TI  - Democratizing Glacier Data - Maturity of Worldwide Datasets and Future Ambitions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The creation and curation of environmental data present numerous challenges and rewards. In this study, we reflect on the increasing amount of freely available glacier data (inventories and changes), as well as on related demands by data providers, data users, and data repositories in-between. The amount of glacier data has increased significantly over the last two decades as remote sensing techniques have improved and free data access is much more common. The portfolio of observed parameters has increased as well, which presents new challenges for international data centers, and fosters new expectations from users. We focus here on the service of the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers (GTN-G) as the central organization for standardized data on glacier distribution and change. Within GTN-G, different glacier datasets are consolidated under one umbrella, and the glaciological community supports this service by actively contributing their datasets and by providing strategic guidance via an Advisory Board. To assess each GTN-G dataset, we present a maturity matrix and summarize achievements, challenges, and ambitions. The challenges and ambitions in the democratization of glacier data are discussed in more detail, as they are key to providing an even better service for glacier data in the future. Most challenges can only be overcome in a financially secure setting for data services and with the help of international standardization as, for example, provided by the CoreTrustSeal. Therefore, dedicated financial support for and organizational long-term commitment to certified data repositories build the basis for the successful democratization of data. In the field of glacier data, this balancing act has so far been successfully achieved through joint collaboration between data repository institutions, data providers, and data users. However, we also note an unequal allotment of funds for data creation and projects using the data, and data curation. Considering the importance of glacier data to answering numerous key societal questions (from local and regional water availability to global sea-level rise), this imbalance needs to be adjusted. In order to guarantee the continuation and success of GTN-G in the future, regular evaluations are required and adaptation measures have to be implemented.

TI  - Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on the financial performance of the hospitality and tourism industries: an ensemble MCDM approach in the Indian context
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The Indian hospitality and tourism industries, major economic growth drivers and employment generators, have been greatly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In FY 2020, the Indian tourism sector created 39 million jobs and contributed nearly US$194.3bn, or 6.8%, to India's gross domestic product. The purpose of this study is to focus on ranking 22 listed hotels and 9 listed travel agencies in India based on their performance across 14 selected financial parameters in both the pre-COVID-19 year ending in March 2019 and the post-COVID-19 year ending in March 2021 to understand how the pandemic affected their businesses. Design/methodology/approach This research proposes to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial performance of 22 listed Indian hotels and 9 listed travel agencies evaluated over 14 financial parameters using a pipeline of two recently developed multicriteria decision-making techniques, method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) and grey-based combined compromised solution (CoCoSo). First, the criteria weights are objectively determined using MEREC, and then the financial performances of the selected companies in both the hospitality and tourism industries are separately assessed using CoCoSo to get their overall performance score, based on which the companies are ranked in order of preference. Findings It was observed that Westlife Development, Lemon Tree Hotels, Indian Tourism Development Corporation, Royal Orchid and Country Club performed significantly poorer than their peers in the aftermath of the pandemic, whereas EIH, Advani Hotels and Resorts and TGB Banquets performed relatively better. Travel agencies Easy Trip and International Travel House performed particularly poorly because of the pandemic, but VMV Holidays performed relatively better in FY 2021. Practical implications The findings of the analysis will aid portfolio construction, corporate investment decisions, competition research, government policymaking and industrial analysis. Originality/value The proposed model is novel because it fills the research gap in the application of the integrated MEREC-CoCoSo method to study the impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality and tourism sectors in India.

TI  - A web-based GIS platform supporting innovative irrigation management techniques at farm-scale for the Mediterranean island of Crete
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is the creation of an integrated and free-access web platform for parcel irrigation water management on a large spatial scale (Water District of Crete, in Greece) in order to: a) accurately determine the irrigation needs of the main crops for Crete such as olives, citrus, avocados and vineyards, b) design strategies, for optimal adaptation of the agricultural sector in the context of climate change, and c) incorporate the dynamic integration of the above information through the creation of a digital platform. In the proposed decision-making system, essential factors are taken into account, such as real-time meteorological data, information about the type and spatial distribution of the agricultural parcels in Crete, algorithms for calculation crop evapotranspiration per development stage and age of the crops, satellite remote sensing techniques in combination with field surveys to depict accurate soil texture map for the whole island of Crete as well as sustainable cultivation practices for saving water per crop and parcel geomorphology. Based on the proposed decision-making system, users will have the opportunity in any specific location/farm in Crete to know the irrigation needs of the crops in real-time and obtain information about proper climate-water adaptation practices. The main novelty points of the proposed platform include the derivation of parcel-level soil texture data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and field samples, the comprehensiveness of the irrigation management information, the relatively low data requirements and the application interface simplicity provided to the end-user.

TI  - An inverse planned oil release validation method for estimating oil slick thickness from thermal contrast remote sensing by in-scene calibration
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates a method to estimate floating oil slick thickness based on remote sensing of thermal infrared contrast. The approach was demonstrated for thick oil slicks from natural seeps in the Coal Oil Point seep field, offshore southern California. Airborne thermal infrared and visible spectrum remote sensing imagery were acquired along with position and orientation data by the SeaSpires(TM) science package. Remote sensing data were acquired in the cross-slick direction of oil slick segments that were targeted for collection, termed "collects." A collect consisted of booming, skimming, and offloading the oil slick segment into buckets for analysis at the laboratory. Each collect provided an in-scene calibration point of oil thickness versus brightness temperature contrast, Delta T-B, where T-B is the sensor-reported temperature based on the emitted thermal radiation and differs from the true temperature due to the oil's emissivity. Delta T-B is the T-B difference between the oil and oil-free sea surface. Thus, this study is a reverse planned oil-release experiment that demonstrates the value of natural seeps for oil spill science. center dot Novel approach to quantify floating oil thickness center dot Custom modified weir skimmer used with added floor and structural strengthening (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Response of dryland vegetation under extreme wet events with satellite measures of greenness and fluorescence
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme wet events in central Australia triggered large vegetation responses that contributed greatly to large global land carbon sink anomalies. There remain significant uncertainties on the extent to which these events over dryland vegetation can be monitored and assessed with satellite data. In this study, we investigated the vegetation responses of the major Australian semiarid biomes to two extreme wet events utilizing multi-satellite observations of (1) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), as a proxy for photosynthetic activity and (2) the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), as a measure of canopy chlorophyll or greenness. We related these satellite observations with gross primary productivity (GPP) estimated from eddy covariance tower sites, as a performance benchmark.The C-3-dominated Mulga woodland was the most responsive biome to both wet pulses and exhibited the highest sensitivity to soil moisture. The C-4-dominated Hummock grassland was more responsive to the 2011 "big wet" event, relative to the later 2016-2017 wet pulse. EVI swiftly responded to the extreme wet events and showed markedly amplified seasonal amplitude, however, there was a time lag as compared with SIF during the post-wet period, presumably due to the relatively slower chlorophyll degradation in contrast with declines in photosynthetic activity. Despite a robust linear SIF-GPP relationship (r(2) ranging from 0.59 to 0.85), the spatially coarse SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) yielded high retrieval noise over the xeric biomes, hindering its capacity to capture thoroughly the dryland vegetation dynamics in central Australia. Our study highlights that synchronous satellite observations of greenness and fluorescence can potentially offer an improved understanding of dryland vegetation dynamics and can advance our ability to detect ecosystem alterations under future changing climates.

TI  - Enhanced extracellular raw starch-degrading α-amylase production in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> by promoter engineering and translation initiation efficiency optimization
T2  - MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A raw starch-degrading alpha-amylase from Pontibacillus sp. ZY (AmyZ1), previously screened by our laboratory, showed a promising application potential for starch-processing industries. However, the AmyZ1 secretory production still under investigation, which seriously restricts its application in the starch-processing industry. On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis is widely used to achieve the extracellular expression of target proteins.Results AmyZ1 secretory production was achieved in B. subtilis and was enhanced by promoter engineering and translation initiation efficiency optimization. First, based on the different phase-dependent promoters, the dual-promoter P-spoVG-P-spoVG142 was constructed by combining dual-promoter engineering and promoter modification. The corresponding strain BZd34 showed an extracellular AmyZ1 activity of 1437.6 U/mL during shake flask cultivation, which was 3.11-fold higher than that of the original strain BZ1 (P-groE). Then, based on translation initiation efficiency optimization, the best strain BZd343 containing optimized 5'-proximal coding sequence (opt3) produced the highest extracellular alpha-amylase activity of 1691.1 U/mL, which was 3.65-fold higher than that of the strain BZ1. Finally, cultivation of BZd343 in 3-L fermenter exhibited an extracellular AmyZ1 activity of 14,012 U/mL at 48 h, with productivity of 291.9 U/mL.h.Conclusions This is the first report of recombinant expression of AmyZ1 in B. subtilis and the expression level of AmyZ1 represents the highest raw starch-degrading alpha-amylase level in B. subtilis to date. The high-level expression of AmyZ1 in this work provides a foundation for its industrial production. The strategies used in this study also provide a strategic reference for improving the secretory expression of other enzymes in B. subtilis.

TI  - Classification and Evolutionary Analysis of Yellow River Delta Wetlands Using Decision Tree Based on Time Series SAR Backscattering Coefficient and Coherence
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Yellow River Delta has been affected by invasive species Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), resulting in a fragile ecological environment. It is of great significance to monitor the ground object types in the Yellow River Delta wetlands. The classification accuracy based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscattering coefficient is limited by the small difference between some ground objects. To solve this problem, a decision tree classification method for extracting the ground object types in wetland combined time series SAR backscattering and coherence characteristics was proposed. The Yellow River Delta was taken as the study area and the 112 Sentinel-1A GRD data with VV/VH dual-polarization and 64 Sentinel-1A SLC data with VH polarization were used. The decision tree method was established, based on the annual mean VH and VV backscattering characteristics, the new constructed radar backscattering indices, and the annual mean VH coherence characteristics were suitable for extracting the wetlands in the Yellow River Delta. Then the classification results in the Yellow River Delta wetlands from 2018 to 2021 were obtained using the new method proposed in this paper. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed method w5ere 89.504% and 0.860, which were 9.992% and 0.127 higher than multi-temporal classification by Support Vector Machine classifier. Compared with the decision tree without coherence, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were improved by 8.854% and 0.108. The spatial distributions of wetland types in the Yellow River Delta from 2018 to 2021 were obtained using the constructed decision tree. The spatio-temporal evolution analysis was conducted. The results showed that the area of S. alterniflora decreased significantly in 2020 but it increased to the area of 2018 in 2021. In addition, S. alterniflora seriously affected the living space of Phragmites australis (P. australis) and in 4 years, 10.485 km(2) living space of P. australis was occupied by S. alterniflora. The proposed method can provide a theoretical basis for higher accuracy SAR wetland classification and the monitoring results can provide an effective reference for local wetland protection.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance of respiratory-tract infections and hand hygiene practice among pilgrims attended Hajj in 2021: a cohort study
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The risk of transmission of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is high in mass gatherings including Hajj. This cohort study estimated the incidence of symptomatic RTIs and hand hygiene compliance with its impact among Hajj pilgrims during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods During the week of Hajj rituals in 2021, domestic pilgrims were recruited by phone and asked to complete a baseline questionnaire. Pilgrims were followed up after seven days using a questionnaire about the development of symptoms, and practices of hand hygiene. Syndromic definitions were used to clinically diagnose 'possible' influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and COVID-19 infection. Results A total of 510 pilgrims aged between 18 and 69 (median of 50) years completed the questionnaire, 280 (54.9%) of whom were female, and all of them (except for one) were vaccinated against COVID-19 with at least one dose. The mean (+/- SD) of pilgrims' hand hygiene knowledge score (on a scale of 0 to 6) was 4.15 (+/- 1.22), and a higher level of knowledge was correlated with a higher frequency of handwashing using soap and water. Among those 445 pilgrims who completed the follow-up form, 21 (4.7%) developed one or more respiratory symptoms, of which sore throat and cough were the commonest (respectively 76.2% and 42.8%); 'possible ILI' and 'possible COVID-19' were present in 1.1% and 0.9% of pilgrims. Obesity was found to be a significant factor associated with the risk of developing RTIs (odds ratio = 4.45, 95% confidence interval 1.15-17.13). Conclusions Hajj pilgrims are still at risk of respiratory infections. Further larger and controlled investigations are needed to assess the efficacy of hand hygiene during Hajj.

TI  - Liver function tests in primary care provide a key opportunity to diagnose and engage patients with hepatitis C
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the advent of direct-acting antiviral therapy, the elimination of hepatitis c virus (HCV) as a public health concern is now possible. However, identification of those who remain undiagnosed, and re-engagement of those who are diagnosed but remain untreated, will be essential to achieve this. We examined the extent of HCV infection among individuals undergoing liver function tests (LFT) in primary care. Residual biochemistry samples for 6007 patients, who had venous blood collected in primary care for LFT between July 2016 and January 2017, were tested for HCV antibody. Through data linkage to national and sentinel HCV surveillance databases, we also examined the extent of diagnosed infection, attendance at specialist service and HCV treatment for those found to be HCV positive. Overall HCV antibody prevalence was 4.0% and highest for males (5.0%), those aged 37-50 years (6.2%), and with an ALT result of 70 or greater (7.1%). Of those testing positive, 68.9% had been diagnosed with HCV in the past, 84.9% before the study period. Most (92.5%) of those diagnosed with chronic infection had attended specialist liver services and while 67.7% had ever been treated only 38% had successfully cleared infection. More than half of HCV-positive people required assessment, and potentially treatment, for their HCV infection but were not engaged with services during the study period. LFT in primary care are a key opportunity to diagnose, re-diagnose and re-engage patients with HCV infection and highlight the importance of GPs in efforts to eliminate HCV as a public health concern.

TI  - Lighting up Self-Quenching Nanoaggregates with Protein Corona for Simultaneous Intraoperative Imaging and Photothermal Theranostics of Metastatic Cancer
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) photothermal transduction agents (PTAs) with large rigid K-extended and planar structures are prone to aggregate in a physiological environment where their emission is often quenched due to the strong intermolecular dipole-dipole or K-K interactions. This aggregation-caused quenching effect greatly impedes their applications in image-guided photothermal theranostics. Herein, we made an interesting finding that engineering a bioinspired protein corona (PC), once thermodynamically stabilized in preferred orientations on PTA nanoaggregates, can produce brilliant NIR fluorescence with a high quantum yield (& SIM;6.2%) without compromising their photothermal properties. Both experimental data and computa-tional modeling suggest that the mechanism of fluorescence enhancement is due to the high-affinity binding of nano-sized PTA to albumin, which regulates the molecular conformation and aggregation state of PTA. High spatial and temporal resolution imaging of albumin PC-coated PTA aggregates enables image-guided photothermal therapy for cancer cells in sentinel lymph nodes to remarkably inhibit pulmonary metastasis. Such a treatment combined with the surgical removal of the primary tumor can prolong animal survival, which is a promising candidate for clinical applications in the treatment of advanced metastatic cancers.

TI  - Recent expansion of artisanal gold mining along the Bandama River (Co circumflex accent te d'Ivoire)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent development of small-scale gold mining activities in Cote d'Ivoire is a serious threat to the environment because of deforestation, soil scrapping, pit mining, over-use of water resources and pollution of surface and ground waters by mercury, cyanides, and acids. The challenge for the governance of this activity is to resolve the tension between the desired development of a small-scale mining activity, which may benefit the local and national economy, and the impacts of this activity on the environment. The regulation of the exploration and exploitation of mining sites and the promotion of best practices was part of the National program for the rationalization of gold-panning in Cote d'Ivoire. The capacity of the government to monitor the expansion of numerous mining sites disseminated all over the country is one of the key aspects for successful implementation of these policies. This study explores the potential value of computer-assisted mapping of artisanal mining sites based on Sentinel-2 imagery. The detection method, using artificial intelligence and training data sets generated during field campaigns, was inspired from a previous experience in Senegal. It was applied to a region of about 600 km(2) in Central Cote d'Ivoire. Annual maps of areas affected by the mining activities were produced for the period 2018 - 2021. The areas affected by artisanal mining activities expanded from 3.39 km(2) to 8.80 km(2) in December 2021, corresponding to an average growth rate of 0.24 km(2)/month. The temporal and spatial resolution of the Sentinel satellite imagery proved to be useful to map and quantify the expansion rate of artisanal mining sites in Cote d'Ivoire. Recommendations are made for the integration of these tools into plans for the development of small-scale mining activities in Cote d'Ivoire that would be more respectful of the environment and societies.

TI  - Effect of DEM resolution on assessing hydrological connectivity in tropical and semi-arid basins of central Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of hydrological connectivity is a valuable tool for water management. It enables various environ-mental factors related to water-mediated transport of matter and energy within or between elements of a system to be identified and incorporated into hydrological models. The index of connectivity (IC) is widely used to quantify hydrological connectivity; however, it may be influenced by the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model (DEM), which is one of the common inputs, as pixel size modifies some basin parameters. Several DEMs available on open-access platforms, with spatial resolutions from 5 to 30 m (LiDAR, ALOS, MEC, ASTER, SRTM), were compared to identify differences between IC in two basins with contrasting environments (Site 1: steep slope terrain with warm-humid climate, and Site 2: gentle hill slopes with semi-arid climate). Differences in perimeters were analyzed using GLM Repeated Measures ANOVA, while for differences in IC, one-way ANOVA was used. Relationships between IC subtracted maps and basin parameters were explored with classification and regression trees (CART). Basin perimeters and IC varied as a function of DEM resolution, but environmental factors such as relief and land use/cover seemed to influence IC maps. Distance to sinks was one of the variables explaining spatial differences in IC between DEMs. The selection of DEM spatial resolution for hydrological connectivity analysis should be based on the characteristics of the study area, economic and technological issues, and whether the objectives can be met with the available DEM resolution.

TI  - Satellite-derived spatiotemporal data on imperviousness for improved hydrological modelling of urbanised catchments
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual rainfall-runoff models have been used extensively to simulate streamflow in urban catchments. However, spatiotemporal changes in the impervious surface area, as an important land use indicator for urban environment, has not been used explicitly as input into conceptual rainfall-runoff models. In this study, spatiotemporal impervious surface fraction (ISF) data were incorporated into two lumped and distributed (1 km) models, namely SIMHYD and AWBM in an urbanized catchment in southeast Queensland, Australia. A sub-pixel classification technique was used to derive ISF from 6 LandSat images between 1988 and 2015. Daily rainfall -runoff models were calibrated with ISF as an input variable. To evaluate model performance for different simulation periods, four model runs including M1 (lumped models with constant ISF), M2 (lumped models with temporally varying ISF), M3 (distributed models with fixed spatial ISF) and M4 (distributed models with spatiotemporal ISF and climate data). Results showed that (1) the sub-pixel classification algorithm can be used to accurately derive ISF data with a mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.07 to 0.12 for 6 images, (2) ISF in the catchment has increased gradually from 12.2% to 34.6% from 1988 to 2015, (3) the performance of SIMHYD and AWBM were not improved noticeably when distributed climate and ISF data were used, (4) simulation capability of lumped and distributed SIMHYD and AWBM were improved (e.g., increase in NSE from 0.68 to 0.73, and decrease in PBIAS from-30.2% to 1.2% for lumped SIMHYD) when temporal (M2) and/or spatio-temporal (M4) ISF data (5-year) were used, (5) difference in model performance is small and insignificantly whether annual or 5-yearly ISF data were used and (6) annual streamflow would increase by 6.9-7.3 mm (equal to 2.9-3%) in response to every 1% increase in ISF for the catchment tested. The methodology developed in this study can be applied for assessment of the effect of urbanisation on regional water balance.

TI  - A mobile observatory powered by sun and wind for near real time measurements of atmospheric, glacial, terrestrial, limnic and coastal oceanic conditions in remote off-grid areas
T2  - HARDWAREX
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is rapidly altering the Arctic environment. Although long-term environmental observations have been made at a few locations in the Arctic, the incomplete coverage from ground stations is a main limitation to observations in these remote areas. Here we present a wind and sun powered multi-purpose mobile observatory (ARC-MO) that enables near real time measurements of air, ice, land, rivers, and marine parameters in remote off-grid areas. Two test units were constructed and placed in Northeast Greenland where they have collected data from cabled and wireless instruments deployed in the environment since late summer 2021. The two units can communicate locally via WiFi (units placed 25 km apart) and transmit near-real time data globally over satellite. Data are streamed live and accessible from (https://gios.org). The cost of one mobile observatory unit is c. 304.000 euro . These test units demonstrate the possibility for integrative and automated environmental data collection in remote coastal areas and could serve as models for a proposed global observatory system.

TI  - Meteorological Influence of Mineral Dust Distribution Over South-Western Africa Deserts Using Reanalysis and Satellite Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the meteorological influence of mineral dust in the south-western African region using satellite and reanalysis datasets by studying 1) the seasonal transport and distribution of mineral dust in the region; 2) the relationship between precipitation, wind and desert dust, and 3) the long-term trends of dust column density, precipitation rate and surface wind speed. The results show that the Namib desert is the main source of dust in the region, with the density and distribution varying by seasons. The study found that the greatest dust distribution occurs in the June-July-August (JJA) season, attributed to the southwesterly winds which transport the dust into the interior of the region. Moreover, small dust aerosols less that 20 mu m are observed at highest altitudes between 7 and 10.28 km. Favourable meteorological such as strong and fast winds and low precipitation, and low vegetation played a vital role in the production and distribution of dust aerosols. Over a long time (i.e., from 1990 to 2020), dust column density trend increased, while precipitation and surface wind speed trends decreased. This study provides significant basis for assessing and monitoring of the desertification processes and their effect on regional climate variability and change in Southwest Africa, where data is ground-based data is scarce and related efforts are rare.

TI  - Quantifying the Role of Atmospheric and Surface Albedo on Polar Amplification Using Satellite Observations and CMIP6 Model Output
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding polar amplification (PA) and its underlying processes is key to accurately predicting the climate system's response to increasing anthropogenic forcings. We examine the amplified warming in the Arctic and Antarctic in 17 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) against satellite data. Large hemispheric differences in PA strength was found in the CMIP6 models. Changes in surface temperature and strength of PA is closely coupled to changes in albedo. The planetary albedo of Earth (alpha(p)) is partitioned into a component associated with surface albedo (defined as surface contribution to planetary albedo, alpha surfp ${\alpha }_{\mathit{surf}}<^>{p}$), and a component associated with atmospheric albedo (atmospheric contribution to planetary albedo, alpha atmp ${\alpha }_{\mathit{atm}}<^>{p}$). To assess the hemispheric differences in PA strengths, the relative importance of alpha surfp ${\alpha }_{\mathit{surf}}<^>{p}$ and alpha atmp ${\alpha }_{\mathit{atm}}<^>{p}$ were investigated. The surface reflection looks different as seen at the surface (defined as surface albedo, alpha(surf)) compared to alpha surfp ${\alpha }_{\mathit{surf}}<^>{p}$ (as seen at the top of the atmosphere). We find a stronger correlation between surface temperature and alpha(surf) in the Arctic than in the Antarctic, with correlation coefficients of -0.94 and -0.88, respectively. Interestingly, the correlation for surface temperature and alpha surfp ${\alpha }_{\mathit{surf}}<^>{p}$ is stronger in the Antarctic than in the Arctic with correlation coefficients of -0.93 and -0.90, respectively. In the southern high latitudes, albedo changes at the surface are more important than changes in the atmosphere, while the opposite applies in the northern high latitudes. Surface temperature changes in the low- and mid-latitudes are strongly associated with changes in alpha atmp ${\alpha }_{\mathit{atm}}<^>{p}$, dominated by changes in cloud properties.

TI  - Comparison of surgical morbidities between LigaSure™ and conventional techniques in inguinal or ilioinguinal lymph node dissection for skin cancer: A single center retrospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Skin cancer patients with clinical nodal disease or whose positive sentinel nodes had great tumor burden remain candidates for regional lymph node dissections. Among these patients, inguinal or ilioinguinal lymph node dissection is frequently required in clinical practice, which is associated with significant postoperative morbidity-including lymphatic leakage. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of LigaSure (TM), an electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system, in reducing lymphatic leakage in inguinal or ilioinguinal lymph node dissection. In total, 58 patients who received inguinal or ilioinguinal lymph node dissection (conventional group, 48; LigaSure (TM) group, 10) and shared similar characteristics were included in this study. Lymphatic leakage after drain removal was significantly lower in the LigaSure (TM) group than that in the conventional group (present ratio, 0% vs. 37%; p = 0.02). The daily lymphatic drainage volume also tended to be lower in the LigaSure (TM) than that in the conventional group, with significant differences on postoperative day 1 (p = 0.02). Other perioperative outcomes including the operating time, intraoperative blood loss, time to drain removal, duration of hospital stay, flap necrosis, and wound infection showed no significant differences between the two groups. The use of the LigaSure (TM) in inguinal or ilioinguinal lymph node dissection for the treatment of skin cancer could reduce the incidence of postoperative lymphatic leakage after drain removal.

TI  - Quantifying the influence of 2D and 3D urban morphology on the thermal environment across climatic zones
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) exert a substantially negative impact on human health and urban sustainability. The role of two-dimensional (2D) landscape patterns in UHIs are well documented; while the effects and contributions of three-dimensional (3D) urban structures remain unclear, especially across different climatic zones. Here we investigated the relationship between 2D/3D urban morphology and the urban thermal environment in summer and winter during the day and at night in 62 representative large cities across four major climate zones in China. First, we extracted the seasonal surface regional heat island intensity (SRHII) using the MODIS 8-Day land surface temperature product. Subsequently, we constructed 25 2D and five 3D urban features and explored their relative importance and respective roles in UHIs in different climatic contexts. Results show that: (1) significant differences (p < 0.05) exist in SRHII between various climate zones; cities with a humid subtropical climate experience temperatures approximately 2 degrees C higher during the day in summer compared to those with the other climate types. (2) 3D urban features can effectively improve the interpretation of urban features for SRHII, with an average optimization level of 21%. (3) Urban trees have a higher cooling effect than other green spaces, whereas tall buildings can also reduce the UHI effect. (4) On summer days, equal proportions of tree to building volume provide the greatest cooling effects. This study provides new insights into the effect of 3D urban characteristics on SRHII and has promising implications for climate resilience planning and heat-related risk management

T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ulan Buh Desert is in an arid and semiarid area in China, which features an exceedingly vulnerable ecological environment and has severe desertification. Based on Marx's explanations for the human-nature relationship, this research applies the remote sensing data and meteorological and socioeconomic data from 2006 to 2018 to conduct a quantitative analysis of the desertification driving factors in the Ulan Buh Desert by adopting the method called multivariate random forest regressor. The findings of the research suggested that the average model employing a random forest algorithm is found to be 84.20%. The desertification in the Ulan Buh Desert showed a declining trend from 2006 to 2018, and the reversed desertification areas mainly are expanded into the hinterlands of the Ulan Buh Desert and along the Yellow River. While the main driving factor of desertification was found to be related to human activities, which were undertaken based on natural factors, the regional desertification was mainly attributed to human economic activities, population density, and altitude. Thus, lessening the excessive impact of human activities on the desert ecosystem would be crucial to protecting the local desert resources and increasing the ecological capacity of the desert ecological capacity. As a consequence, to reduce pressure on land, expand environment capacity, protect vegetation cover in the region, and lower the probability of triggering desertification, the interaction between human beings and nature should be carefully managed and observed.

TI  - Multiyear Automated Mapping and Price Analysis of Garlic in Main Planting Areas of China Using Time-Series Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the major cash crops in China, the accurate area and distribution prediction of garlic is of great significance for the adjustment of the extent under cultivation. In this study, to map garlic in the main planting areas of China, an innovative phenology-based automated classification method was developed. The obtained garlic maps were subsequently used to analyze the relationship between areas under cultivation and garlic prices. The details are summarized as follows. First, we established the normalized difference vegetation index time-series remote sensing images to extract winter crop masks. Second, an improved green chlorophyll vegetation index was designed to distinguish garlic from winter crops using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 time-series images. Specifically, we extract the garlic planting areas from 2014 to 2021 in our study areas, located in the main planting areas of east-central China. The quantitative evaluations showed that the proposed method delivered an average overall accuracy varying from 89.89% to 98.68% across the entire study areas. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the areas in cultivation and the prices of garlic in multiple years. These results indicate that the price of garlic is highly correlated to the planting behavior of farmers, and the size of the planting areas is one of the main factors to the prices of garlic. The results can guide farmers to adjust their planting areas so as to optimize the garlic market and ensure the maximum benefit to farmers.

TI  - A database of modeled gridded dry deposition velocities for 45 gaseous species and three particle size ranges across North America
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dry deposition process refers to the flux loss of an atmospheric pollutant due to uptake of the pollutant by the earth's surfaces. Dry deposition flux of a chemical species is typically calculated as the product of its surface-layer concentration and its dry deposition velocity (V-d). Field measurement based V-d data are very scarce or do not exist for many chemical species considered in chemistry transport models. In the present study, gaseous and particulate dry deposition schemes were applied to generate a database of hourly V-d for 45 gaseous species and three particle size ranges for two years (2016-2017) at a 15 km by 15 km horizontal resolution across North America. Hourly V-d of the 45 gaseous species ranged from < 0.001 to 4.6 cm/sec across the whole domain, with chemical species-dependent median (mean) values being in the range of 0.018-1.37 cm/sec (0.05-1.43 cm/sec). The spatial distributions of the two-year average V-d showed values higher than 1-3 cm/sec for those soluble and reactive species over certain land types. Soluble species have the highest V-d over water surfaces, while insoluble but reactive species have the highest V-d over forests. Hourly V-d of PM2.5 across the whole domain ranged from 0.039 to 0.75 cm/sec with median (mean) value of 0.18 (0.20) cm s(-1), while the mean V-d for PM2.5-10 is twice that of PM2.5. Uncertainties in the modeled V-d are typically on the order of a factor of 2.0 or larger, which needs to be considered when applying the dataset in other studies.

TI  - Characteristics of the Quasi-Periodic Outbreaks of Deep Convection During Tropical Cyclone Genesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nineteen years of high resolution infrared brightness temperature data are adopted to investigate the characteristics of deep convective activities during the genesis and early evolution of tropical cyclones (TC) in the Northwest Pacific. It is found that quasi-periodic outbreaks of deep convection are common during TC genesis regardless of the large-scale flow pattern or the magnitude of wind shear. Spatially, deep convection concentrates within 3 degrees of the disturbance center at peak time (when convection is active), and will shrink in coverage and become scattered at trough time (when convection is inactive). At the decay stage deep convection in the central area tends to weaken first. Among the quasi-periodic cycles of deep convection, quasi-diurnal cycles are the most distinct feature, followed by cycles with periods of 10-18 hr. The quasi-diurnal cycles with an early morning peak only account for less than 50%. Statistically the amplitude of deep convection cycles will decrease a bit under shear greater than 9 m.s(-1), and period length in the range of 12-28 hr decreases slowly with the increase in wind shear and will rise slightly when shear is greater than 9 m.s(-1). Besides, genesis does not necessarily occur at the peak time of coverage in deep convection, and the oscillatory feature is not an effective indicator of genesis acceleration.

TI  - Remote sensing methods for detecting and mapping hailstorm damage: a case study from the 20 July 2020 hailstorm, Baragan Plain, Romania
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hail is one of the dangerous meteorological phenomena facing society. The present study aims to analyse remote sensing methods for detecting and assessing hailstorm damage on agricultural crops. The event used as a case study occurred on 20 July 2020 within Traian commune/Administrative Territorial Units, north of Baragan Plain. The analysis was performed for agricultural areas using: optical satellite imagery from Sentinel-2A, Landsat-8 and Terra MODIS; Soil Water Index (SWI) derived from Sentinel-1 SAR satellite imagery; and weather radar data. The change detection method (difference between pre- and post-event data) was applied. Based on Sentinel-2A images and using a threshold of more than 0.05 in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) difference between 14 and 21 July, it was found that 3,142.98 ha were affected. Results show that the intensity of hail damage was directly proportional to the Land Surface Temperature (LST) difference derived from Landsat - 8 between 15 and 31 July. LST difference values higher than 12 degrees C were observed in areas where NDVI decreased by 0.4-0.5. By comparing a hail mask extracted from NDVI with the SWI difference from 14 and 21 July, it was confirmed that the hail event occurred and caused the most damage in the west of the analysed area. This is supported by large values (greater than 55 dBZ) of weather radar reflectivity, indicating medium-large hail. This research also shows that satellite data is useful for cross-validation of surface-based weather reports and weather radar-derived products.

TI  - Prevalence of Pathologic N2/N3 Disease in Postmenopausal Women with Clinical N0 ER+/HER2-Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The RxPONDER trial demonstrated that the 21-gene recurrence score can be used to guide adjuvant systemic therapy decisions in postmenopausal women with pN1 ER+/HER2- breast cancer. As such, a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may not provide systemic treatment-altering information for many patients, and omission of SLNB in patients with low probability of pN2/N3 disease could be considered. Methods Postmenopausal women (aged >= 50 years) diagnosed with cN0cM0, ER+/HER- breast cancer from 2013 to 2017 were identified in the National Cancer Database. The primary outcome was the prevalence of pN2/N3 disease. Results Of 325,692 postmenopausal women with cN0 ER+/HER2- breast cancer, 7106 (2.2%) were pN2/N3. In total, 81.7% had cT1 tumors, 16.8% T2, 1.3% T3, and 0.2% T4. In patients with T1 tumors, the prevalence of pN2/N3 disease was 1.2% compared with 17.2% in patients with T3/T4 tumors. In multivariable models, cT stage was the strongest predictor of pN2/N3 disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 14.9 [12.1-18.4]). Lobular histology (aOR 2.4 [2.3-2.6]), higher grade (aOR 2.9 [2.6-3.1]), and young age (aOR 1.5 [1.3-1.7]) were also associated with increased prevalence of pN2/N3. We created a model using histology, grade, and T stage that stratifies patients with low prevalence of pN2/3 disease (< 1%) and those at high risk (> 20%). Conclusions In postmenopausal women with cN0 ER+/HER2- breast cancer, the prevalence of pN2/N3 disease is low, indicating a potential opportunity to use the results of RxPONDER to extend criteria to omit SLNB. Prospective study is needed to determine safety, including risk of nodal recurrence, of omission of SLNB in carefully selected patients.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones are associated with extreme winds, waves, and storm surge, being among most destructive natural phenomena. Developing capability for a rapid impact estimate is crucial for coastal applications and risk preparedness. When predicting waves characteristics associated to tropical cyclones, the traditional approach involves a two-step procedure (a) a Holland-type wind vortex model and (b) numerical simulations using a wave generation model, using buoy and satellite measurements for validation. In this work, we take advantage of the increasing amount of remote sensing observational data and propose a new empirical model to estimate the wind wave footprint of tropical cyclones. For this purpose, we construct a dataset with over a million satellite observations of waves triggered by tropical cyclones assuming a circular shape of the TC influence area and defining composites of significant wave height as a function of representative parameters of the track characteristics like the minimum pressure, its forward velocity, and its latitude. The validation against buoy data confirms the usefulness of the model for a first and rapid estimation of the wave footprint, although an underestimation of the most extreme events is observed due to the relatively small number of observations recorded. Due to its efficiency, the model can be applied for rapid estimations of wave footprints in operational systems, reconstruction of historical or synthetic events and risk assessments.

TI  - Study of intertidal molluscan diversity of the Dakshina Kannada coast, India using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The intertidal fauna of the Dakshina Kannada coast, Karnataka, India, are facing a threat due to several factors. In the present study, we delineate various changes in the selected intertidal habitats along the coastline of the Dakshina Kannada district, to correlate these changes with the diversity of molluscs in the intertidal zones. The study also aims at understanding the threat faced by molluscs due to various factors. This study was carried out from November 2016 to September 2017. Mapping of the coastline of Dakshina Kannada was done using topographical maps and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite imageries (IRS-Resourcesat 1-LISS-III). Satellite data were processed using ERDAS IMAGINE 9.1 software and various land-use/ land-cover classes were analysed using ArcGIS 10.1. The resulting coastal maps were used to estimate the geomorphological changes and shifting of the shoreline position due to erosion and accretion. Shoreline changes were correlated to diversity changes within intertidal mollusc communities. The study revealed the abundance of molluscs at the intertidal zone of Sasihithlu and species richness at Someshwar and Panambur during post-monsoon. Significant correlation was observed between water temperature and diversity of molluscs, indicating that water temperature is the important physico-chemical parameter responsible for the change in molluscan diversity of the Dakshina Kannada coast. The variation in land-use/land-cover during the study period was analysed. The coastline has been threatened by different land-use patterns such as urbanization, industrialization, developmental activities, erosion and accretion. The changes occurring along the coastline during this study due to industrialization and anthropogenic factors have been discussed, which help in the implementation of conservation measures and protect the sensitive habitats of the shelled organisms.

TI  - Ockham on the Side of the Angels: Why a Classical Theist Shouldn't be Moved by Oppy's Argument from Simplicity
T2  - NEW BLACKFRIARS
M3  - Article
AB  - A common argument put forth by naturalists (including the prominent philosopher Graham Oppy) in support of naturalism as a worldview over theism, is to claim that naturalism is a simpler hypothesis. Theism posits the existence of everything that naturalism does, plus the existence of a theistic realm. Thus, all things being equal, via Ockham's Razor, naturalism should be preferred to theism. In this essay, we argue that the Classical Theist need not worry about the naturalist's Simplicity argument. Specifically, we argue that, the one holding to a scholastic metaphysics (i.e., potency-act distinction, participatory metaphysics, and existence-in-degree), in the end, will be the one with the simpler worldview.

TI  - Assessment of Changes in Planform Morphology of the Upper Yamuna River Segment, India, Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study explores the planform morphological changes that have occurred in the upper segment of the Yamuna River by using Landsat images from 1979 to 2019. The river segment was divided into 18 sections at equal spacing, viz., S1 to S18, and the centerline and bank line shifting, channel width, alterations in meander geometry and braiding characteristics in terms of sinuosity index (SI) and braiding index (BI) were evaluated. The results indicate a maximum centerline shifting eastward at section S-5 and westward at S17 during 1999, with respect to the base year of 1979. The average eastward and westward centerline shifting remained insignificant. The average west bank shifting ranged from 0.407 km to 0.892 km east and 0.440 km to 0.418 km west, indicating relatively higher west bank shifting towards east. The average east bank shifting ranged from 0.335 km to 0.505 km east and 0.344 km to 0.896 km west, indicating a narrowing of the bank width throughout the segment length. During the assessment period, the river segment exhibited sinuous characteristics and non-braided behavior. The outcomes of this study could be useful in predicting future trends in river shifting and developing sustainable land use planning strategies along floodplains.

TI  - Caring for Service Members Who Have Been Sexually Assaulted: The Military Health System
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction Reports of sexual assault (SA) in the U.S. Military have increased in recent years. Given the deleterious effects of military SA, there remains a need for large-scale studies to assess SA-related health care utilization among active duty service members (ADSMs). The present study, therefore, utilized Military Health System (MHS) data to determine the prevalence of SA-related care, sociodemographic characteristics of ADSMs receiving said care, and the type of provider seen during the initial SA-related health encounter. Materials and Methods Utilizing the MHS Data Repository and Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, all ADSMs from the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps during fiscal years (FY) 2016-2018 were identified. Those with an International Classification of Diseases diagnostic code related to SA during the study period were isolated. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. The study was exempt from human subjects review. Results A total of 1,728,433 ADSMs during FY 2016-2018 were identified, of whom 4,113 (0.24%) had an SA-related health encounter. Rates of SA-related health care encounters decreased each FY. Women (odds ratio [OR] = 12.02, P < .0001), those in the Army (reference group), and enlisted personnel (OR = 2.65, P < .0001) were most likely to receive SA-related health care, whereas ADSMs aged 18-25 years had lower odds (OR = 0.70, P < .0001). In addition, higher odds of SA-related care were observed among those identifying as American Indian/Alaskan Native (OR = 1.37, P = .02) and "Other" race (e.g., multiracial) (OR = 4.60, P < .0001). Initial SA-related health encounters were most likely to occur with behavioral health providers (41.4%). Conclusions The current study is the first large-scale examination of health care usage by ADSMs in the MHS who have experienced SA. Results indicated that rates of SA-related care decreased throughout the study period, despite the increasing rates of SA documented by the DoD. Inconsistent with previous research and DoD reports indicating that younger ADSMs are at the highest risk for SA, our study observed lower rates of SA-related care among those aged 18-25 years; additional research is warranted to determine if there are barriers preventing younger ADSMs from seeking SA-related health care. Behavioral health providers were most frequently seen for the initial SA-related encounter, suggesting that they may be in a unique position to provide care and/or relevant referrals to ADSMs who have experienced SA. The present study provides key insights about the prevalence of SA-related care within the MHS, not yet reported in previous literature, which could help inform MHS screening practices. The strengths of the study are the inclusion of the entire active duty population without the need for research recruitment given the utilization of de-identified TRICARE claims data. The study is limited by its use of health care claims data, general SA International Classification of Diseases codes as a proxy indicator for military SA, and lack of data on ethnicity. Future research utilizing MHS data should examine mental health outcomes following the documentation of SA and disruptions in SA-related care due to SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Quality validation of HJ-1B satellite land surface temperature products based on DTW
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The HJ-1B satellite thermal infrared data is widely used,but the quality validation of its surface temperature retrieval products is not yet perfect.In response to this problem,part of multiple underlying surfaces in the Heihe River Basin was taken as the research area,HJ-1B data was used as the research data,and universal single-channel algorithm was used to invert the surface temperature of the different underlying surface research areas.The inversion results were verified using the ground observation site data of the Heihe River Basin and MODIS surface temperature data.Dynamic time warping was introduced to evaluate timing similarity.The results show that the relative deviation between the HJ- 1B surface temperature inversion product and the ground observation value for desert and desert sites is within 1K,and the root mean square error(RMSE) is about 0.5K.The deviation for vegetation and crop sites is within 2K,and the RMSE is 1-2K.The evaluation result of the time-series mismatched data using DTW is consistent with the performance of existing indicators.The relative deviations between the HJ-1B surface temperature inversion products and the surface stations are lower than those between the HJ-1B surface temperature inversion products and the MODIS surface temperature inversion products.

TI  - Assessment of preoperative axillary nodal disease burden: breast MRI in locally advanced breast cancer before, during and after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis is one of the most important predictors of recurrence and survival in breast cancer, and accurate assessment of LN involvement is crucial. Determining extent of residual disease is key for surgical planning after neoadjuvant therapy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of MRI for nodal disease in locally advanced breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET).Methods: Thirty-three clinically node-positive locally advanced breast cancer patients who underwent NET and surgery were prospectively enrolled. Two radiologists reviewed the axillary nodes at 3 separate time points MRI exami, nations at baseline (before the first treatment regimen), interim (following at least 2 months after the first cycle and prior to crossing-over), and preoperative (after the final administration of therapy and immediately before surgery). According to LN status after surgery, imaging features and diagnostic performance were analyzed.Results: All 33 patients had a target LN reduction, the greatest treatment benefit from week 8 to week 16. There was a positive correlation between the maximal diameter of the most suspicious LN measured by MRI and pathology during and after NET, being highest at therapy completion (r= 0.6, P <= .001). Mean and median differences of maximal diameter of the most suspicious LN were higher with MRI than with pathology. Seven of 33 patients demonstrated normal posttreatment MRI nodal status (yrN0). Of these 7 yrN0, 3 exhibited no metastasis on final pathology (ypN0), 2 ypN1 and 2 ypN2. Reciprocally, MRI diagnosed 3 cases of ypN0 as yrN+. Diffusion -weighted imaging (DWI) was the only axillary node characteristic significant when associated with pathological node status (chi(2)(4)=8.118, P= .072).Conclusion: Performance characteristics of MRI were not completely sufficient to preclude surgical axillary staging. To our knowledge, this is the first study on MRI LN assessment following NET in locally advanced breast cancer, and further studies with larger sample sizes are required to consolidate the results of this preliminary study.

TI  - Evaluating the spatiotemporal variations of daytime surface and canopy urban heat islands: an arid climate case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal variations of surface urban heat island (SUHI) and canopy urban heat island (CUHI) are compared in this study for the arid city of Isfahan, Iran, using two datasets for land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature (AT), and three different indices: urban-rural LST difference, urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) and urban-rural AT difference. The inverted SUHI intensity was shown to vary between -13.9 degrees C in summer and -1.5 degrees C in winter, while the hourly average CUHI intensity ranged between -4.4 degrees C in summer and 6.3 degrees C in autumn. The spatial variation of CUHI showed significant differences in UHI intensity between urban sites (p < 0.05). Based on UTFVI variation, the non-SUHI and strongest SUHI were dominant phenomena in urban sites. In contrast, SUHI intensities were negative, representing only the non-SUHI phenomenon. The correlation between SUHI and CUHI values was not significant, indicating that intensities of CUHI and corresponding SUHI are not comparable in arid climates. These results demonstrate that for arid climates, determining UHI based on UTFVI, and the urban-rural AT difference, can provide detailed information about spatiotemporal variations of UHI.

TI  - Monitoring the trophic state of shallow urban lakes using Landsat 8/OLI data: a case study of lakes in Hanoi (Vietnam)
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Lakes in the Hanoi urban areas are highly vulnerable to serious eutrophication and algae bloom due to anthropogenic pollution and climate change. This study aims at monitoring the trophic state of lakes in Hanoi by developing an empirical model for directly estimating the trophic state index (TSI) from Landsat 8 (L8) level 2 data, which has been atmospheric corrected by the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) algorithm and provided freely by the US Geological Survey (USGS). Regression analysis of a 138-point data set of in situ TSI measured in 13 lakes in Hanoi on seven dates in the 2015-2020 time period with the simultaneously acquired L8 reflectance data set showed a significant correlation between TSI and L8 spectral ratio of the near-infrared band (band 5) versus the green band (band 3) by a logarithmic equation (the coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.65). Validation results demonstrated that the model was appropriate for estimating TSI in highly trophic waters (the root-mean-square error, RMSE = 6.6). The model then was applied to six selected L8 images to observe an increasing trend in TSI of 25 lakes in the Hanoi urban area during the 2015-2020 time period. The L8-LaSRC performed better than the Landsat 8 Provisional Aquatic Reflectance Product in providing data for monitoring shallow urban lakes. Our proposed model can be applied to monitor the TSI of worldwide lakes with similar features as lakes in the Hanoi urban areas.

TI  - Multi-temporal and multi-channel cloud detection algorithm based on GF-4 data
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem that the traditional cloud detection algorithm is difficult to distinguish between clouds and ice pixels due to the lack of bands of the Gaofen-4 (GF-1) satellite imagery, a multi-temporal and multi-channel cloud detection algorithm was proposed. The algorithm first carried out the radiation calibration and registration of the GF-1 satellite image, used the spectral difference between the cloud and the typical ground surface to obtain potential cloud pixels, and then used the difference between the sequence GF-4 satellite image to identify cloud pixels. Finally, the mid-infrared band was used to retrieve the brightness temperature of the surface to remove the ice and snow pixels. The algorithm was verified in three research areas of Hainan, Liaoning and Anhui, and the detection results were compared with the detection results of traditional single-phase cloud detection algorithm, SVM cloud detection algorithm, and RTD cloud detection algorithm. The results show that the algorithm is better than the others. The proposed algorithm has an accurate recognition rate of more than 90%, and the false detection rate is less than 5%, which is conducive to further use of GF-4 satellite imagery.

TI  - Spatial and temporal evolution of carbon stocks in Dongting Lake wetlands based on remote sensing data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the important carbon reservoirs on earth, assessing the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetland carbon stocks and their driving mechanisms is critical for stabilizing and enhancing the carbon sink function of wetlands. In this study, the carbon stocks of Dongting Lake wetland during 1995-2020 were estimated using the Integrate Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Tool (InVEST) model and land use/cover data derived from remote sensing data. Subsequently, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was utilized to explore the driving mechanisms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks based on natural and socio-economic factors. Finally, evolution of land use status and carbon stocks was simulated based on patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model during 2030-2050 under different scenarios. The results showed that: 1) over the past 25 years, carbon stocks have been fluctuating in a 'decrease-increase-decrease' pattern, with an average decrease of 39.70 x 10(6) t per year; 2) compared with socio-economic factors, climate conditions have a greater influence on the change of carbon stocks distribution; 3) under the natural variation scenario, the carbon stocks in 2030 is 1345.36 x 10(6) t, which is increased compared with the year of 2020. However, the carbon stocks in 2040-2050 started to show a decreasing trend. Under the ecological conservation scenario, the increase in forest area leads to a significant increase in carbon stocks from 2030 to 2050, which showed a continuous growth trend and obviously enhanced the carbon sequestration capacity of the Ecological and Economic Circle around Dongting Lake. The results of this study are expected to provide a scientific basis for carbon balance, land use restructuring and wetland resource management planning in the ecological and economic circle around Dongting Lake.

TI  - A novel method for simultaneous analysis of particle size and mineralogy for Chang'E-5 lunar soil with minimum sample consumption
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful return of lunar soil samples from the northern Oceanus Procellarum by the Chang'E 5 (CE-5) mission has provided unprecedented ground-truth information for the previously unexplored region of the Moon. In particular, the particle size and mineral constituents of the CE-5 soil samples are of critical importance to interpret remote sensing data. With a Raman-based particle analysis system, we show that the particle size properties and mineral constituents of the CE-5 soil can be simultaneously determined with a small sample size (ca. 30 mu g). The CE-5 sample scooped from the lunar surface has an overall small size between 0.4 mu m and 73.9 mu m (mean=3.5 mu m), and mainly consists of pyroxene (39.4%), plagioclase (37.5%), olivine (9.8%), Fe-Ti oxides (1.9%), glass (8.3%) and other minor or trace phases. The results are consistent with previous analyses with larger sample sizes. In addition to minimum sample consumption, this method requires very little sample preparation, and can rapidly build a large database with each particle precisely traceable. Therefore, this novel technique is particularly suitable for the analysis of future returned soil samples from extraterrestrial bodies.

TI  - Different Responses of Chlorophyll a to the Passage of the Tropical Storm Wipha (2019) in the Coastal Waters of the Northern Beibu Gulf
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical storms (TS) are important drivers of short-term changes and affects the coastal and marine environment. Based on in situ observational data from four locations in the coastal area of the northern Beibu Gulf and satellite data, we analyzed the changes in temperature, salinity, and turbidity during the transit of TS "Wipha" in 2019 and assessed the environmental factors controlling chlorophyll a concenteation (Chl-a) increases in the coastal area. Our results showed that in the coastal area, the growth of phytoplankton after the TS was mainly controlled by the nutrient and light availability. The increased input of freshwater by TS, including direct inputs from rainfall and increased river discharge, reduced the salinity. The decrease in salinity may indicate an increased input of nutrient-rich freshwater at all four stations (nutrients input: S1>S2>S3>S4). Nutrient concentration at S1, S2, and S3 implied by salinity was high, but that at S4 was limited. The shorter recovery time of turbidity after TS indicated the faster improvement of light conditions in this area [recovery time: S4 (2 days)< S1 (3 days)< S3 (5 days)< S2 (10 days)]. The high turbidity associated with poor light penetration was an important factor limiting phytoplankton growth at station 2, with a slow recovery of the turbidity to pre-TS levels. The rapid recovery of the turbidity to the pre-TS levels at S1, S3, and S4 suggested good light conditions soon after the TS, and probably led to a significant increase in Chl-a after the TS ([Chl-a]: S1>S3>S4). The less of an increase of Chl-a at S4 was not only related to nutrient restriction but also related to weak mixing of the water column, while the least significant decrease in the SST at S4 implied that the enhancing mixing after TS was limited.

TI  - Transport of substantial stratospheric ozone to the surface by a dying typhoon and shallow convection
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stratospheric ozone transported to the troposphere is estimated to account for 5 %-15% of the tropo-spherico zone sources. However, the chances of intruded stratospheric ozone reaching the surface are low. Here,we report an event of a strong surface ozone surge of stratospheric origin in the North China Plain (NCP, 34-40 degrees N, 114-121 degrees E) during the night of 31 July 2021. The hourly measurements reveal surface ozone concentrations of up to 80-90 ppbv at several cities over the NCP from 23:00 LST (Local Standard time, D UTC C8 h) on31 July to 06:00 LST on 1 August 2021. The ozone enhancement was 40-50 ppbv higher than the corresponding monthly mean. A high-frequency surface measurement indicates that this ozone surge occurred abruptly, with an increase reaching 40-50 ppbv within 10 min. A concurrent decline in surface carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations suggests that this surface ozone surge might have resulted from the downward transport of a stratospheric ozone-rich and CO-poor air mass. This is further confirmed by the vertical evolutions of humidity and ozone profiles based on radiosonde and satellite data respectively. Such an event of stratospheric impact on surface ozone is rarely documented in view of its magnitude, coverage, and duration.We find that this surface ozone surge was induced by a combined effect of dying Typhoon In-fa and shallow local mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that facilitated transport of stratospheric ozone to the surface. This finding is based on analysis of meteorological reanalysis and radiosonde data, combined with high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulation and backward trajectory analysis using the FLEXible ARTicle (FLEXPART) particle dispersion model. Although Typhoon In-fa on the synoptic scale was at its dissipation stage when it passed through the NCP, it could still bring down a stratospheric dry and ozone-rich air mass. As a result, the stratospheric air mass descended to the middle-to-low troposphere over the NCP before the MCSs formed. With the pre-existing stratospheric air mass, the convective downdrafts of the MCSs facilitated the final descent of stratospheric air mass to the surface. Significant surface ozone enhancement occurred in the convective downdraft regions during the development and propagation of the MCSs. This study underscores the substantial roles of weak convection in transporting stratospheric ozone to the lower troposphere and even to the surface, which has important implications for air quality and climate change.

TI  - Tracking the binding of multi-functional fluorescent tags for Alzheimer's disease using quantitative multiphoton microscopy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent theranostic approach to address Alzheimer's disease (AD) utilizes multifunctional targets that both tag and negate the toxicity of AD biomarkers. These compounds, which emit fluorescence with both an activation and a spectral shift in the presence of A beta, were previously characterized with traditional fluorescence imaging for binary characterization. However, these multifunctional compounds have broad and dynamic emission spectra that are dependent on factors such as the local environment, presence of A beta deposits, etc. Since quantitative multiphoton microscopy is sensitive to the binding dynamics of molecules, we characterized the performance of two such compounds, LS-4 and ZY-12-OMe, using Simultaneous Label-free Autofluorescence Multi-harmonic (SLAM) microscopy and Fast Optical Coherence, Autofluorescence Lifetime imaging and Second harmonic generation (FOCALS) microscopy. This study shows that the combination of quantitative multiphoton imaging with multifunctional tags for AD offers new insights into the interaction of these tags with AD biomarkers and the theranostic mechanisms.

TI  - Process-Oriented Estimation of Chlorophyll-a Vertical Profile in the Mediterranean Sea Using MODIS and Oceanographic Float Products
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructing chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) vertical profile is a promising approach for investigating the internal structure of marine ecosystem. Given that the process of profile classification in current process-oriented profile inversion methods are either too subjective or too complex, a novel Chl-a profile reconstruction method was proposed incorporating both a novel binary tree profile classification model and a profile inversion model in the Mediterranean Sea. The binary tree profile classification model was established based on a priori knowledge provided by clustering Chl-a profiles measured by BGC-Argo floats performed by the profile classification model (PCM), an advanced unsupervised machine learning clustering method. The profile inversion model contains the relationships between the shape-dependent parameters of the nonuniform Chl-a profile and the corresponding Chl-a surface concentration derived from satellite observations. According to quantitative evaluation, the proposed profile classification model reached an overall accuracy of 89%, and the mean absolute percent deviation (MAPD) of the proposed profile inversion model ranged from 12%-37% under different shape-dependent parameters. By generating monthly three dimensions Chl-a concentration from 2011 to 2018, the proposed process-oriented method exhibits great application potential in investigating the spatial and temporal characteristics of Chl-a profiles and even the water column total biomass throughout the Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Identifying habitat preferences and core areas of Amazon River dolphin activity using spatial ecology analysis
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Identifying the habitat preferences and core areas of Inia geoffrensis activity is essential to designing effective strategies for the management and conservation of Amazon River dolphins and their habitats in the Colombian Amazonas River and Orinoco basin. Objectives Quantify the differential use of habitat that Amazon River dolphins exhibit and identify core areas of activity during seasons of rising waters in the Colombian Amazonas River and five major rivers in the Orinoco basin. Methods Based on processed satellite images from Landsat 8 (2018-2021), we classified habitat types used by I. geoffrensis as reported in the literature as follows: (1) main river, (2) confluences, (3) tributaries, (4) channels, (5) islands, (6) bays, and (7) lagoons. We combined this dataset with GPS location data obtained from 17 tagged Amazon River dolphins to quantify the proportion of habitat types used. We used kernel density estimate (KDE) analysis to identify both areas used (K-95) and core areas (K-50) in the habitat types for the satellite-monitored individuals. Results Satellite tracking of I. geoffrensis individuals reported 16,098 locations classified into seven habitat types. For the analyzed period (rising waters) main habitat types used were as follow: (1) main river (n = 9144, 57%); (2) confluences (n = 932, 6%); (3) tributaries (n = 1423, 9%); (4) channels (n = 1597, 10%); (5) islands (n = 738, 5%); (6) bays (n = 1096, 7%), and (7) lagoons (n = 1168, 7%). Home range size (K-95) for the satellite-monitored I. geoffrensis individuals ranged from 6 to 116 km(2) (mean = 40 +/- 33); and the largest core areas (K-50) or core area of activity were recorded in the main river, confluences, channels, bays, lagoons, and tributaries. Conclusions Our results demonstrated the importance of spatial ecology analysis of Amazon River dolphins for the definition of protected areas, quantifying the use of ecosystems within these areas, and the location of priority areas for the implementation of management plans for the species and habitats.

TI  - Spatial Variability of <i>In Situ</i> Above-Water Reflectance in Coastal Dynamic Waters: Implications for Satellite Match-Up Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The validation of ocean color satellite retrievals generally relies on analyzing match-ups between in situ measurements and satellite retrievals. These analyses focus on the quality of the satellite data, however, of the same importance is the quality of the in situ data. Here, we present the spatial variability of in situ above-water reflectance (R-rs(0+)) within the spatial resolution of different ocean color satellites-300, 900, 1500, and 3000m spatial resolutions, mimicking Sentinel 3 OLCI and MODIS-Aqua satellites, and possible 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 windows. Radiometric data was acquired with autonomous radiometric sensors installed in the British Columbia Ferry Services Inc. vessel "Queen of Alberni" from May to September 2019, crossing the optically dynamic waters of the Strait of Georgia, Canada. The dataset followed optimal geometry of acquisition and processing, including corrections for skylight radiance signals, ship superstructure, the non-isotropic distribution of the waterleaving radiances, and quality control. A total of 33,073 spectra at full resolution, corresponding to 10 days, were considered for the analysis presented here. The results showed that, overall, the subpixel variability increased as the spatial resolution of the sensor or the window size increased, mainly in a linear fashion. Specifically, spatial variability of R-rs(0+) was the largest (similar to 18% and 68% for 900 and 3000m pixel resolution, respectively) in Near Field Plume Interface waters, followed by in the Ocean Water Interface (similar to 28% and 35%, respectively), thus indicating spatial heterogeneity of interface waters. Further, we found that the estuarine waters showed higher subpixel R-rs(0+) variability (similar to 8% and 16% for 900 and 3000 m, respectively) compared with plume and oceanic waters. We showed that the high spatial variability in R-rs(0+) was primarily associated with the spatial dynamics of the optical water constituents, thus limiting the use of these datasets as Fiducial Reference Measurements and for validation of satellite-derived atmospherically corrected reflectance. We suggest that spatial variability of the in situ R-rs(0+) should also be considered in the selection criteria for good match-up data, especially for data acquired in coastal dynamic systems. As a result, it will advocate for the exclusion of interface or transition water pixel grids in order to avoid compromising the statistical result of satellite validation.

TI  - Three different glacier surges at a spot: what satellites observe and what not
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Karakoram, dozens of glacier surges occurred in the past 2 decades, making the region a global hotspot. Detailed analyses of dense time series from optical and radar satellite images revealed a wide range of surge behaviour in this region: from slow advances longer than a decade at low flow velocities to short, pulse-like advances over 1 or 2 years with high velocities. In this study, we present an analysis of three currently surging glaciers in the central Karakoram: North and South Chongtar Glaciers and an unnamed glacier referred to as NN9. All three glaciers flow towards the same small region but differ strongly in surge behaviour. A full suite of satellites (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel-1 and 2, Planet, TerraSAR-X, ICESat-2) and digital elevation models (DEMs) from different sources (e.g. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, SRTM; Satellite Pour 1' Observation de la Terre, SPOT; High Mountain Asia DEM, HMA DEM) are used to (a) obtain comprehensive information about the evolution of the surges from 2000 to 2021 and (b) to compare and evaluate capabilities and limitations of the different satellite sensors for monitoring surges of relatively small glaciers in steep terrain. A strongly contrasting evolution of advance rates and flow velocities is found, though the elevation change pattern is more similar. For example, South Chongtar Glacier had short-lived advance rates above 10 km yr(-1), velocities up to 30 m d(-1), and surface elevations increasing by 170 m. In contrast, the neighbouring and 3-times-smaller North Chongtar Glacier had a slow and near-linear increase in advance rates (up to 500 m yr -1 ), flow velocities below 1 m d(-1) and elevation increases up to 100 m. The even smaller glacier NN9 changed from a slow advance to a full surge within a year, reaching advance rates higher than 1 km yr(-1). It seems that, despite a similar climatic setting, different surge mechanisms are at play, and a transition from one mechanism to another can occur during a single surge. The sensor inter-comparison revealed a high agreement across sensors for deriving flow velocities, but limitations are found on small and narrow glaciers in steep terrain, in particular for Sentinel-1. All investigated DEMs have the required accuracy to clearly show the volume changes during the surges, and elevations from ICESat-2 ATL03 data fit neatly to the other DEMs. We conclude that the available satellite data allow for a comprehensive observation of glacier surges from space when combining different sensors to determine the temporal evolution of length, elevation and velocity changes.

TI  - Carbon tattooing of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients before neoadjuvant chemotherapy: A retrospective analysis
T2  - TUMORI JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of tattooing suspicious axillary lymph nodes with carbon suspension at the time of breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and the intraoperative correspondence between tattooed lymph node (TLN) and sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed consecutive BC patients who underwent NACT, between April 2019 and May 2021, at the Breast Unit of Sant'Anna Hospital in Turin, Italy. Before NACT, all suspicious biopsied lymph nodes were marked with carbon suspension. All SLNs, TLNs, and axillary nodal dissection specimens were sent for histopathological examination. Results: The study group included a total of 49 patients with BC. The overall identification rate of TLNs was 83.7% (41/49; 95%, confidence interval - CI 0.70-0.92). In patients who underwent target axillary dissection (TAD) the carbon tattooing had an intraoperative identification rate of 84.4% (27/32; 95% CI 0.67-0.95) while, in the case of axillary lymph node dissection, TLNs were detected in 82.3% (14/17; 95% CI 0.56-0.96) of patients. The correlation between TLN and SLN was 71.8% (23/32). Conclusions: These results confirmed that tattooing axillary lymph nodes has an acceptable identification rate. We also confirmed that this procedure, in addition to SLN biopsy, improves the accuracy of surgical axillary staging.

TI  - Remote sensing and <i>in-situ</i> approach for investigation of pelagic communities in the reservoirs of the electrical power complex
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Two closely located reservoirs on the Southern Bug River and its tributary in the southern region of Ukraine were compared to study the impact of temperature on hydrobionts and pelagic communities, a major ecologic issue in the climate warming context, using in-situ and satellite remote sensing data. These reservoirs are parts of the South-Ukraine electric power-producing complex. The Tashlyk reservoir is a cooling reservoir for the nuclear power plant, and Oleksandrivske reservoir is used for production of hydroelectricity and irrigation. The cooling reservoir is replenished by pumping water from the upper part of the Oleksandrivske reservoir.Methods: The relationships of temperature, transparency, and distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities were established based on satellite remote sensing data and in-situ during 2013-2021. The main variables of phytoplankton and zooplankton were compared, and for improved understanding features, spatial distribution maps were created.Results: It was found that the distribution of coenotic groups of phytoplankton and zoonplankton in the cooling reservoir (Tashlyk) corresponds to thermal conditions. Three communities of phytoplankton and two communities of zooplankton were identified in the Tashlyk reservoir. However, in the Oleksandrivske reservoir, separate communities of phytoplankton and zooplankton were reported along its length.Conclusions: It was shown that both on land and in the Oleksandrivske reservoir, there is an increase in temperature in summer, an increasing trend in the global warming context, but that was not observed in the cooling reservoir of the nuclear power plant (NPP). It let us assume that the factors such as temperature or nutrients impact can be assessed as external significant factors related to the catchment area for the reservoirs with different types of using.

TI  - The Snowline and 0°C Isotherm Altitudes During Precipitation Events in the Dry Subtropical Chilean Andes as Seen by Citizen Science, Surface Stations, and ERA5 Reanalysis Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the variability of the snowline and the closely related 0 degrees C isotherm during infrequent precipitation events in the dry Andes in Chile is fundamental for precipitation, snow cover, and discharge predictions. For instance, it is known that on the windward side of mountains, the 0 degrees C isotherm can be several hundreds of meters lower than on the free air upwind counterpart, but little is understood about such effects in the Andes due to missing in situ evidence on the precipitation phase. To bridge this gap, 111 photographs of the snowline after precipitation events between 2011 and 2021 were gathered in the frame of a citizen science programme to estimate the snowline altitude. Since photographs of the mountain snowline are in good agreement with Sentinel-2 imagery, they have great potential to validate empirical snowline estimations. Using the snowline altitude from the photos, we evaluated different methods to estimate the snowline and 0 degrees C isotherm altitude during precipitation events based on surface meteorological observations and ERA5 reanalysis data. We found a high correlation between the observed snowline altitude and the extrapolated 0 degrees C isotherm based on constant lapse rates (-5.5 to -6.5 degrees C km(-1)) applied to air temperature from single, near stations. However, uncertainty increases for distances >10 km. The results also indicate that the linear regression method is a good option to estimate Z(SL), but the results strongly depend on the availability of high-elevation station datasets. During half of the precipitation events, the 0 degrees C isotherm lies between similar to 1,800 and similar to 2,400-2,500 m asl. in winter, and the snowline is on average similar to 280 m below this altitude. Our results indicate the presence of a mesoscale lowering of the 0 degrees C isotherm over the windward slopes compared to the free-air upwind value during precipitation events and a possible isothermal layer of near-freezing air temperatures comparable to other mountain ranges. Due to this mesoscale and local behavior, ERA5 data generally overestimate the snow-rain transition in high-elevation areas, especially for relatively intense events. On the other hand, the 0 degrees C isotherm altitude is underestimated if only low-elevation valley stations are considered, highlighting the importance of high-altitude meteorological stations in the network.

TI  - Perioperative management of antithrombotic drugs in skin surgery - A survey of dermatologists in Germany
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We identified substantial heterogeneity in the perioperative management of antithrombotic drugs in skin surgery in Germany in 2012 and 2017 in two cross-sectional surveys. The first national guideline on this subject was published in 2014 and updated in 2021. We sought to identify whether the management of these drugs had changed.Methods: We sent a paper-based survey to 1115 dermatologists throughout Germany asking them about their perioperative management of antithrombotic drugs in skin surgery, as well as their familiarity with the guideline.Results: We received responses from 65 hospital- and 202 office-based dermatologists. Most dermatologists reported continuing antithrombotic drugs in their patients when performing minor surgeries. A notable proportion of dermatologists reported discontinuing phenprocoumon treatment perioperatively and bridging patients with heparin when performing more invasive surgeries. Continuation was less common during combination therapies.Conclusions: The proportion of physicians in Germany who reported managing antithrombotic drugs during skin surgery in ways that are in concordance with the national guideline has increased since 2012. However, continuing antithrombotic drugs during large excisions and sentinel lymph node biopsies, abstaining from bridging patients on phenprocoumon with heparin, and continuing antithrombotic combination therapies perioperatively need to be further encouraged, especially among office-based dermatologists.

TI  - <i>Euclid</i> preparation XVIII. The NISP photometric system
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Euclid will be the first space mission to survey most of the extragalactic sky in the 0.95-2.02 mu m range, to a 5 sigma point-source median depth of 24.4 AB mag. This unique photometric dataset will find wide use beyond Euclid's core science. In this paper, we present accurate computations of the Euclid Y-E, J(E), and H-E passbands used by the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP), and the associated photometric system. We pay particular attention to passband variations in the field of view, accounting for, among other factors, spatially variable filter transmission and variations in the angle of incidence on the filter substrate using optical ray tracing. The response curves' cut-on and cut-off wavelengths - and their variation in the field of view - are determined with similar to 0.8 nm accuracy, essential for the photometric redshift accuracy required by Euclid. After computing the photometric zero points in the AB mag system, we present linear transformations from and to common ground-based near-infrared photometric systems, for normal stars, red and brown dwarfs, and galaxies separately. A Python tool to compute accurate magnitudes for arbitrary passbands and spectral energy distributions is provided. We discuss various factors, from space weathering to material outgassing, that may slowly alter Euclid's spectral response. At the absolute flux scale, the Euclid in-flight calibration program connects the NISP photometric system to Hubble Space Telescope spectrophotometric white dwarf standards; at the relative flux scale, the chromatic evolution of the response is tracked at the milli-mag level. In this way, we establish an accurate photometric system that is fully controlled throughout Euclid's lifetime.

TI  - The Relationship Between Dust Sources and Airborne Bacteria in the Southwest of Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The biological agents are carried from deserts and dried lands to long distances by high dust volumes. Their adverse effects can be reduced by specifying and controlling dust sources and their related biological agents. Thus, the current work examined the relationship between the bacteria in air and soil samples by taking samples from the soil surface of two dust sources, as well as from air samples during spring from Khorramshahr and Abadan cities. The dust event is the most influential factor on airborne bacteria. There is an insignificant negative (-0.06), insignificant positive (0.14), and weak positive (0.24) correlation between airborne bacteria and UV radiation, relative humidity, and temperature, respectively. After preparing a 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone library from the soil and air samples, operational taxonomic unit picking and taxonomic assignment were conducted using QIIME Virtual Box. In the present work, Bacillus was the dominant species. The relationship between dust sources and air samples was determined by principal component analysis. Bacteria in the Hoor-Al-Azim dust source and airborne bacteria on dusty and non-dusty days showed a more significant correlation compared to bacteria in the Shadegan dust source. Source Tracker software was used to estimate the contribution of dust sources. The primary source of dust was associated with the dried areas of Hoor-Al-Azim on the non-dusty and dusty days. Finally, the long transport of airborne bacteria was assessed by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the back trajectory model of Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) data. The research findings can help decision-makers prioritize dust sources to control the adverse effects of dust.

TI  - Internal mammary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients based on anatomical imaging and functional imaging
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) metastasis forms part of the clinical node classification for primary breast cancer, which influences the treatment strategy. However, because of the IMLNs' complicated anatomical structures and relationships with adjacent structures, IMLN biopsy or resection is associated with a limited improvement in prognosis and a high complication rate. The positivity rate also varies broadly according to imaging modality, and there is a low rate of agreement between the imaging and pathological diagnoses, which creates imprecision in the preoperative staging. The IMLN positivity rate also varies remarkably, and there are no clear, accurate, and non-invasive modalities for diagnosing the pre-mastectomy IMLN status. Nevertheless, medical imaging modalities continue to evolve, with functional imaging and image-guided thoracoscopic biopsy of sentinel IMLNs being well established. Thus, personalized decision-making and treatment selection should be based on the modality-specific differences in the diagnosis of IMLN metastasis/recurrence and the patient's specific risk factors.

TI  - Fengyun-4 Geostationary Satellite-Based Solar Energy Nowcasting System and Its Application in North China
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface solar irradiance (SSI) nowcasting (0-3 h) is an effective way to overcome the intermittency of solar energy and to ensure the safe operation of grid-connected solar power plants. In this study, an SSI estimate and nowcasting system was established using the near-infrared channel of Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite. The system is composed of two key components: The first is a hybrid SSI estimation method combining a physical clear-sky model and an empirical cloudy-sky model. The second component is the SSI nowcasting model, the core of which is the derivation of the cloud motion vector (CMV) using the block-matching method. The goal of simultaneous estimation and nowcasting of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) is fulfilled. The system was evaluated under different sky conditions using SSI measurements at Xianghe, a radiation station in the North China Plain. The results show that the accuracy of GHI estimation is higher than that of DNI estimation, with a normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE) of 22.4% relative to 45.4%. The nRMSE of forecasting GHI and DNI at 30-180 min ahead varied within 25.1%-30.8% and 48.1%-53.4%, respectively. The discrepancy of SSI estimation depends on cloud occurrence frequency and shows a seasonal pattern, being lower in spring-summer and higher in autumn-winter. The FY-4A has great potential in supporting SSI nowcasting, which promotes the development of photovoltaic energy and the reduction of carbon emissions in China. The system can be improved further if calibration of the empirical method is improved.

TI  - Modifying the SWAT Model to Simulate Eco-Hydrological Processes in an Arid Grassland Dominated Watershed
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are the main land cover type and one of the most important ecosystems in arid and alpine endorheic basins. The vegetation coverage of grasslands is spatially heterogeneous in arid and alpine areas and it may lead to variations in water allocation. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is one of the most widely used semi-distributed catchment-scale eco-hydrological models. The leaf area index (LAI) is one of the vegetation coverage indexes and is incorporated in the SWAT model. However, in SWAT, the LAI accumulation is controlled by heat, and neglects other relevant factors such as precipitation and terrain. To address the drawbacks of the SWAT in simulating vegetation coverage and plant patterns, several studies have focused on improving LAI estimation. However, they still have been limited to arid and alpine grasslands with different vegetation coverages. In this study, we modified the SWAT model using remotely sensed LAI data with high temporal and spatial resolution. We used this to better simulate eco-hydrological processes in grassland basins with different vegetation coverages in the upper reaches of the Bayin River Basin. Results showed that for the original SWAT model, the simulated LAI was homogeneous within each land use/cover type, whereas the remotely sensed LAI was spatially heterogeneous and better captured the vegetation coverage of the entire basin. The proper estimation of the LAI was reflected in the improved simulation of the monthly streamflow and sediment yield at the basin outlet and the monthly ET. These findings indicate that the modified SWAT could better simulate hydrological processes in arid and alpine grasslands with different vegetation coverages.

TI  - Urban modelling and forecasting of landuse using SLEUTH model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study performs landcover modelling using the SLEUTH model. The urban land use changing factors are calibrated to predict the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) for a densely populated and developing smart city, Prayagraj, India. This research aims to use the SLEUTH model for simulating the future urban growth with the help of historical LULC (1990-2020), road network and elevation data. The influence of road gravity and slope resistant coefficients is very significant in this study's outcome. The built-up area of the region increased from 40.22 km(2) (5.10% of total area) in 1990 to 85.89 km(2) (10.89%) in 2020. According to prediction results, in the next 20 years, the built-up growth rate would be 1.9% and approximated built-up area would be 118.66 km(2) (14.98%) in the year 2040. The quality of the result has been quantified in terms of best fit value of Optimal SLEUTH Metric (OSM) and validated against the existing LULC. The study utilises a spatially explicit urban growth model with 30 m resolution remote sensing data and provides future landuse of Prayagraj city.

TI  - Estimation of surface temperature lapse rate over the Uttarakhand region using 107 station data and MODIS-LST data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An Altitudinal temperature lapse rate (TLR) is essential in understanding the local and regional climate over a mountainous region. This study estimated TLR for the Uttarakhand State in the Northern Indian region using MODIS-LST and the observed air temperature data extracted from the 107 Automatic Weather Stations. The objective of this study is to estimate the TLR: first directly from MODIS-LST and second from the observed station. The result of our analysis shows that MODIS-LST estimated TLR during day-time (-0.54 degrees C/100 m) is noticeably less accurate than the night-time (-0.59 degrees C/100 m) and; steeper at night in summer months and shallower during day in winter months. The spatial and temporal changes of TLR of 107 stations varies significantly with the steepest summer (-1.1 degrees C/100 m) and shallowest winter (-0.12 degrees C/100 m). Further, for the validation of performance, the MODIS-LST estimated TLR were found out to be highly correlated with the observed air temperature.

TI  - A 30 m annual maize phenology dataset from 1985 to 2020 in China
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Crop phenology indicators provide essential information on crop growth phases, which are highly required for agroecosystem management and yield estimation. Previous crop phenology studies were mainly conducted using coarse-resolution (e.g., 500 m) satellite data, such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. However, precision agriculture requires higher resolution phenology information of crops for better agroecosystem management, and this requirement can be met by long-term and fine-resolution Landsat observations. In this study, we generated the first national maize phenology product with a fine spatial resolution (30 m) and a long temporal span (1985-2020) in China, using all available Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. First, we extracted long-term mean phenological indicators using the harmonic model, including the v3 (i.e., the date when the third leaf is fully expanded) and the maturity phases (i.e., when the dry weight of maize grains first reaches the maximum). Second, we identified the annual dynamics of phenological indicators by measuring the difference in dates when the vegetation index in a specific year reaches the same magnitude as its long-term mean. The derived maize phenology datasets are consistent with in situ observations from the agricultural meteorological stations and the PhenoCam network. Besides, the derived fine-resolution phenology dataset agrees well with the MODIS phenology product regarding the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we observed a noticeable difference in maize phenology temporal trends before and after 2000, which is likely attributable to the changes in temperature and precipitation, which further altered the farming activities. The extracted maize phenology dataset can support precise yield estimation and deepen our understanding of the future agroecosystem response to global warming.

AB  - The international radiotherapy (RT) expert panel has revised and updated the RT guidelines that were accepted in 2020 at the 4th Hungarian Breast Cancer Consensus Conference, based on new scientific evidence. Radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is indicated in ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0), as RT decreases the risk of local recurrence (LR) by 50-60%. In early stage (stage I-II) invasive breast cancer RT remains a standard treatment following BCS. However, in elderly (& GE;70 years) patients with stage I, hormone receptor-positive tumour, hormonal therapy without RT can be considered. Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) and for selected cases accelerated partial breast irradiation are validated treatment alternatives to conventional WBI administered for 5 weeks. Following mastectomy, RT significantly decreases the risk of LR and improves overall survival of patients who have 1 to 3 or & GE;4 positive axillary lymph nodes. In selected cases of patients with 1 to 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes axillary dissection can be substituted with axillary RT. After neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) followed by BCS, WBI is mandatory, while after NST followed by mastectomy, locoregional RT should be given in cases of initial stage III-IV and ypN1 axillary status.

TI  - Morphological slum index for slum extraction from high-resolution remote sensing imagery over urban areas
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes the Morphological Slum Index (MSI) approach for extracting slum areas from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images. An MSI is built by using different morphological operators. Since, the non-slum objects (buildings, vegetation, roads and open areas) are brighter than their neighbourhoods and show similar spectral properties as those of slums, MSI classifies the non-slum objects as slum objects. To optimize the misclassification of MSI, a post-processing technique called Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is used. Three different VHR images acquired by the WorldView-2 sensor (1.84 m resolution) of Madurai city, India and one image acquired by the WorldView-3 Sensor (0.31 m resolution) of Kibera, Kenya are used as the test images to investigate the qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed technique. From the classified outputs, the proposed MSI with MSPA approach attains an overall accuracy of 95.78%, 96.42%, 95.12% and 92.64% for test images 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

TI  - Interrelated impacts of seismic ground motion and topography on coseismic landslide occurrence using high-resolution displacement SAR data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, a number of studies have been conducted to examine the relationship between seismic ground motion and coseismic landslides. However, the impacts of seismic ground motion on coseismic landslide occurrence are not fully understood owing to the poor spatial resolution of seismic ground motion data. Recently, seismic observation research has expanded with the use of satellite technology, as crustal deformation can be observed using pairs of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) satellite data. With this technique, obtaining information regarding the ground surface displacement induced by earthquakes is possible at a high spatial resolution, without the need for interpolation or extrapolation. In this study, we focus specifically on the interrelated impacts of seismic ground motion and topography on coseismic landslide occurrence, which has previously been difficult to detect. Using high-resolution ground surface displacement from SAR data, we examine these interrelated impacts in detail and assess coseismic landslide occurrence based on seismic ground motion and topography. Results show that the developed formula accurately reproduces coseismic landslide occurrence and that the impact behaviors of the two factors on landslide occurrence are different. Finally, based on the new formula, we suggest two different trends for the attenuation of seismic ground motion and topography related to coseismic landslide occurrence.

TI  - A Lagrangian analysis of pockets of open cells over the southeastern Pacific
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pockets of open cells (POCs) have been shown to develop within closed-cell stratocumulus (StCu), and a large body of evidence suggests that the development of POCs result from changes in small-scale processes internal to the boundary layer rather than large-scale forcings. Precipitation is widely viewed as a key process important to POC development and maintenance. In this study, GOES-16 satellite observations are used in conjunction with MERRA-2 winds to track and compare the microphysical and environmental evolution of two populations of closed-cell StCu selected by visual inspection over the southeastern Pacific Ocean: one group that transitions to POCs and another comparison group (CLOSED) that does not. The high spatiotemporal resolution of the new GOES-16 data allows for a detailed examination of the temporal evolution of POCs in this region. We find that POCs tend to develop near the coast, last tens of hours, are larger than 10(4) km(2), and often (88% of cases) do not re-close before they exit the StCu deck. Most POCs are observed to form at night and tend to exit the StCu during the day when the StCu is contracting in area. Relative to the CLOSED trajectories, POCs have systematically larger effective radii, lower cloud drop number concentrations, a comparable conditional in-cloud liquid water path, and a higher frequency of more intense precipitation. Meanwhile, no systematic environmental differences other than boundary layer height are observed between POC and CLOSED trajectories. Interestingly, there are no differences in reanalysis aerosol optical depth between both sets of trajectories, which may lead one to the interpretation that differences in aerosol concentrations are not influencing POC development or resulting in a large number that re-close. However, this largely depends on the reanalysis treatment of aerosol-cloud interactions, and the product used in this study has no explicit handling of these important processes. These results support the consensus view regarding the importance of precipitation on the formation and maintenance of POCs and demonstrate the utility of modern geostationary remote sensing data in evaluating the POC life cycle.

TI  - Wet-GC: A Novel Multimodel Graph Convolutional Approach for Wetland Classification Using Sentinel-1 and 2 Imagery With Limited Training Samples
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland is one of the most productive resources on earth, and it provides vital habitats for several unique species of flora and fauna. Over the last decade, mapping and monitoring wetlands by utilizing deep learning (DL) models and remote sensing data gained popularity due to the importance of wetland preservation. In general, DL-based methods have shown astonishing achievement in wetland classification, but some practical issues, such as limited training samples, still need to be addressed. Moreover, the performance of most of the DL approaches is decreased when moderate-resolution images with few features are used as input data. One solution to breaking the performance bottleneck of a single model is to fuse two or more of them. To this end, we strive to investigate and develop a multimodel DL algorithm for wetland classification based on the combination of a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN), which is called the Wet-GC algorithm hereinafter. In doing this, moderate-resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral optical imagery are fed into the GCN and CNN models, respectively. As we know from the literature, the synergistic use of S1 SAR and S2 optical imagery can be used to extract different types of wetland features and increase the class discrimination possibility. Hence, wetland mapping by jointly using GCN and CNN has the ability to boost the wetland classification task. Findings indicate that the efficiency of Wet-GC with an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.68% outperforms the results obtained from random forest (OA = 84.88%), support vector machine (OA = 82.86%), extreme gradient boosting (OA = 86.55%), and ResNet50 (OA = 86.93%). The outcomes reveal that the Wet-GC architecture proposed in this article has an excellent capability to be applied over large areas with minimal need for training samples and can perform acceptably in supporting regional wetland mapping.

TI  - Dynamics of human presence and flood-exposure risk in close proximity to Bangladesh's river network: an evaluation with multitemporal satellite imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing human presence in close proximity to river network is crucial for frequently flood-affected populous countries, like Bangladesh, to reliably estimate flood-exposure risk. Using multitemporal satellite nighttime light (NTL) as a proxy for human presence, we examined the spatial distribution and change in NTL luminosity (+11,225.69 km(2) areas) across Bangladesh during 2000-2018 at national and river network scales. Results showed a rising trend and emerging hotspots of nightlights and increased near-river population (+1.5 million) under flood-exposure risk. These patterns were coincident with the dwindling of forests (-91.89%), grasslands (-6.02%) and barren lands (-27.92%) and increased built-up (11.06%) areas. Positive correlations were found between annual NTL luminosity and LandScan population (r = 0.48) and annual population (%) access to electricity (r = 0.82), revealing the effect of rural electrification. Our analytical approach and results provide a basis for timely monitoring of floodplain occupancy and flood-exposure risk at scale in the rapidly developing regions globally.

AB  - This article examines five direct border conflicts between China and India to study how well the reputational effects of their crisis management conformed to conventional deterrence expectations. This article finds that how these crises are settled suggests that instead of deterrence expectations of resolve-oriented behavior, China and India have engaged in reassurance-oriented behavior. Answering why reassurance has taken precedence over resolve even under crises conditions, it is argued that despite the two countries being at odds on the specific and highly salient border issue, they recognize the value of broader joint gains, which in turn is buttressed by a shared 'post-colonial' identity and common worldview on questions of global order.

TI  - Capturing spatial variability of factors affecting the water allocation plans-a geo-informatics approach for large irrigation schemes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The livelihoods of poor people living in rural areas of Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) of Pakistan depend largely on irrigated agriculture. Water duties in IBIS are mainly calculated based on crop-specific evapotranspiration. Recent studies show that ignoring the spatial variability of factors affecting the crop water requirements can affect the crop production. The objective of the current study is thus to identify the factors which can affect the water duties in IBIS, map these factors by GIS, and then develop the irrigation response units (IRUs), an area representing the unique combinations of factors affecting the gross irrigation requirements (GIR). The Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) irrigation scheme, the largest irrigation scheme of the IBIS, is selected as a case. Groundwater quality, groundwater levels, soil salinity, soil texture, and crop types are identified as the main factors for IRUs. GIS along with gamma design software GS + was used to delineate the IRUs in the large irrigation scheme. This resulted in a total of 84 IRUs in the large irrigation scheme based on similar biophysical factors. This study provided the empathy of suitable tactics to increase water management and productivity in LCC. It will be conceivable to investigate a whole irrigation canal command in parts (considering the field-level variations) and to give definite tactics for management.

T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an analysis of the starspot properties and chromospheric activity on HD 134319 using high-precision photometry by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in sectors 14-16 (T1) and 21-23 (T2) and high-resolution spectroscopy by the ELODIE spectrograph on 1.93-m telescope of Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP/ELODIE) and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on Keck 10-m telescope of W. M. Keck Observatory (Keck/HIRES) during the years 1995-2013. We applied a two-spot model with generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram determined period of P = 4.436391 +/- 0.00137 d to model chunks sliding over TESS light curve. We also measured the relative equivalent widths of Ca ii H and K, H beta and H alpha emissions by subtracting the overall spectrum from individual spectra. It was found that a two-spot configuration, namely a primary, slowly evolving and long-lasting spot (P) plus a secondary, rapidly evolving spot (S), was capable of explaining the data, although the actual starspot distribution cannot be derived from the collected data. Despite the spot radius-latitude degeneracy revealed in the best-fitting solutions, a sudden alternation between P and S radii followed by a gradual decrease of S in T1 and a decrease of both P and S from T1 to T2 were significant, corresponding to the evolution of magnetic activity. In addition, S revealed rotation and an oscillatory longitude migration synchronized to P in T1, but had a much larger migration than P in T2. This might indicate the evolution of the internal magnetic configuration. Chromospheric activity indicators were found to be tightly correlated with each other and revealed rotational modulation as well as a long-term decrease of emissions, implying the existence and evolution of magnetic activity on HD 134319.

TI  - Diverse cloud radiative effects and global surface temperature simulations induced by different ice cloud optical property parameterizations
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The representation of ice cloud optical properties in climate models has long been a difficult problem. Very different ice cloud optical property parameterization schemes developed based on very different assumptions of ice particle shape habits, particle size distributions, and surface roughness conditions, are used in various models. It is not clear as to how simulated climate variables are affected by the ice cloud optical property parameterizations. A total of five ice cloud optical property parameterization schemes, including three based on the ice habit mixtures suitable for general ice clouds, mid-latitude synoptic ice clouds, and tropical deep convective ice clouds, and the other two based on single ice habits (smooth hexagonal column and severely roughened column aggregate), are developed under a same framework and are implemented in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmospheric Model version 5. A series of atmosphere-only climate simulations are carried out for each of the five cases with different ice parameterizations. The differences in the simulated top of the atmosphere shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effects (CREs) are evaluated, and the global averaged net CRE differences among different cases range from - 1.93 to 1.03 Wm(-2). The corresponding changes in simulated surface temperature are found to be most prominent on continental regions which amount to several degrees in Kelvin. Our results indicate the importance of choosing a reasonable ice cloud optical property parameterization in climate simulations.

TI  - Spatio-temporal assessment of land use dynamics and urbanization: linking with environmental aspects and DPSIR framework approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is the main force of the global environmental as well as land use land cover changes (LULC). Urbanization is caused by prompt increase in population growth, migration, and urge for employment. In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS) was applied for the analysis and representation of spatio-temporal changes in LULC in Peshawar district and these results were linked with environmental aspects and Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework approaches. For LULC classification, the Landsat freely available satellite imageries were used. The analysis revealed that the vegetation cover has increased from 37.8% of the total area to 71.3% during 1990-2020 and this change in vegetation is attributed to the government initiatives of Billion Tree Tsunami afforestation project after 2014 which has substantially decreased the barren land (from 66% in 1990 to 19% in 2020) in southeastern part of Peshawar district. Although, there was reduction in the vegetation cover in the past but due to extensive plantation between 2014 and 2020 resulted rapid increase in vegetation cover in the study area. The results of the present study detected a remarkable increase in built-up area which has increased almost 224.6% from 1990 to 2020. The study area population has increased from 2.12 million during 1998 to 4.26 million in 2017. The DPSIR results revealed that drivers and pressure have adverse effects on the carrying capacity of natural resources which have resulted deterioration of ecosystem. The resulted reduced capacity leading towards land degradation, loss of agricultural land, decline the groundwater level and resulted in pluvial flooding in Peshawar district. Government and environmental protection agency should implement the land use bylaws to reduce the rapid and unplanned urban growth and its negative impacts on natural environment.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) information is a fundamental component of environmental research relating to urban planning, agricultural sustainability, and natural hazards assessment. In particular, remote sensing technology has demonstrated a powerful capacity for LULC modeling with a corresponding increase in sensor number and type. Here, an advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model was developed in combination with object-based image analysis (OBIA) to map LULC in Ain Temouchent coastal area, western Algeria, using sentinel-2 and Pleiades imagery data. First, the CNN model was constructed based on convolution, hidden, and max pooling layers. The parameters of CNN architecture were optimized to improve the model for further processing. Then, based on high levels of CNN feature extraction, the OBIA was applied to classify the segmented objects, and detect the LULC features. Furthermore, machine learning methods, including random forest and support vector machines were tested for comparison. The proposed method achieved a high overall accuracy (93.5%) using Pleiades imagery, revealing significant improvements compared to other machine learning techniques. Accordingly, it was concluded that the method proposed here is useful for LULC detection, and can be applied at larger scales in coastal areas. The derived maps can also inform regional and national-level decision making.

TI  - MRSE-Net: Multiscale Residuals and SE-Attention Network for Water Body Segmentation From Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic extraction of water bodies from various satellite images containing complex targets is a very important and challenging task in remote sensing and image interpretation. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become an important choice in the field of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. However, generic CNN models present many problems when performing water body segmentation, such as: 1) blurred water body boundaries; 2) difficulty in accommodating different scales of rivers, often losing information about many small-scale rivers; and 3) a large number of trainable parameters. This article proposes an end-to-end CNN structure based on multiscale residuals and squeeze-and-excitation (SE)-attention for water segmentation, called MRSE-Net. MRSE-Net consists of an encoder-decoder and a skip connection, which captures contextual information at different scales using the encoder, and then passes the encoder feature mapping through the improved skip connection, while localization is achieved by the decoder is implemented. With the multiscale residual module, the number of parameters in our model can be significantly reduced and water pixels can be extracted accurately. The SE-attention module is used to enhance the prediction results, mitigate the blurring effect, and make the segmented water boundaries more continuous. Landsat-8 images are used to train our model and validate our proposed method's performance and effectiveness. In addition, we evaluate our method on Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 images and obtain the best water segmentation results. Preliminary results on Sentinel-2 images show that the cross-sensor generalization capability of our model is beyond the range of the Landsat sensor family.

TI  - The progression of flood risk in southern Alberta since the 2013 flood
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - After a century of semi-restricted floodplain development, Southern Alberta, Canada, was struck by the devastating 2013 Flood. Aging infrastructure and limited property-level floodproofing likely contributed to the $4-6 billion (CAD) losses. Following this catastrophe, Alberta has seen a revival in flood management, largely focused on structural protections. However, concurrent with the recent structural work was a 100,000+ increase in Calgary's population in the 5 years following the flood, leading to further densification of high-hazard areas. This study implements the novel Stochastic Object-based Flood damage Dynamic Assessment (SOFDA) model framework to quantify the progression of the direct-damage flood risk in a mature urban neighborhood after the 2013 Flood. Five years of remote-sensing data, property assessment records, and inundation simulations following the flood are used to construct the model. Results show that in these 5 years, vulnerability trends (like densification) have increased flood risk by 4%; however, recent structural mitigation projects have reduced overall flood risk by 47% for this case study. These results demonstrate that the flood management revival in Southern Alberta has largely been successful at reducing flood risk; however, the gains are under threat from continued development and densification absent additional floodproofing regulations.

TI  - Evapotranspiration and Vegetation Cover Classifications Maps Based on Cloud Computing at the Arab Countries Scale
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the most recent Koppen-Geiger classification, Arab countries are divided into seven climate classes. Ground data availability is limited in developing countries, and ground meteorological data are scarce and concentrated in a few locations, rather than station maintenance capability being adequate for the responsibilities. The current study uses remote sensing and meteorological data to create regional classification maps of reference evapotranspiration (ETo), potential crop evapotranspiration, and vegetation cover in Arab countries from 2005 to 2020. The Stand-alone Remote Sensing Approach to Estimate Reference Evapotranspiration (SARE) was used to estimate ETo using satellite data from 2005 to 2020. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were extracted from MODIS satellite data and used in the SARE model, in addition to elevation (E), Julian day (J), and Latitude (Lat). To validate the SARE model results, the FAO-Penman-Monteith model was applied to 35 ground meteorological stations distributed across Arab countries to cover all climate classes based on the most recent Koppen-Geiger climate classification. Google Earth Engine was used to create the classification. The statistical indices produced acceptable results, with average RMSE values ranging from 6.9 to 17.3 (mm/month), while correlation coefficient (r) and index of agreement (d) values are more significant than 0.9. To be included in the ETc calculation, the crop coefficient (K-c) was calculated using NDVI 250 m spatial resolution. The density of the vegetation cover is used to classify it (low to high). The average vegetation cover was calculated to be greater than 31.5 Mha. The minimum vegetation cover was 14.9 Mha, and the maximum vegetation cover was 49.2 Mha. 15.8 Mha can be cultivated without supplementary irrigation for at least one agricultural season, according to the rainfall classification map.

TI  - Added value of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy in FDG-PET/CT node-negative patients with ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (rSLNB) has been suggested for axillary staging in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Although rSLNB is technically feasible in this group of patients, the clinical value has not been established. We aimed to assess the added value of rSLNB in cN0 patients with IBTR who underwent optimal clinical staging with FDG-PET/CT. Methods This retrospective single-center cohort study included 119 patients with IBTR-staged cT1-4N0M0 with FDG-PET/CT who underwent rSLNB between 2006 and 2020. Overall recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated for subgroups with tumor-positive, tumor negative, and unsuccessful rSLNB. Results rSLNB was successful in 79 (66%) of the 119 included patients, of whom 70 (59%) had a tumor negative and 9 (8%) a tumor-positive rSLNB; rSLNB was unsuccessful in the remaining 40 (34%) patients. Patients with a tumor-positive rSLNB had poorer overall 5-year RFS compared to patients with a tumor negative or unsuccessful rSLNB (44% vs. 86% vs. 90%, p = 0.004). Although patients with a tumor-positive rSLNB had worse RFS, the 10-year OS was comparable to a tumor negative or unsuccessful rSLNB (89% vs. 89% vs. 95%, p = 0.701). Conclusion The incidence of a tumor-positive rSLNB in patients with a negative FDG-PET/CT is low and does not change survival. Therefore, in cN0 patients with IBTR who underwent optimal clinical staging with FDG-PET/CT, we support a patient- and tumor-tailored treatment strategy in which rSLNB may be omitted.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to eliminate Cd(II) ions from aqueous solutions by Corn Silk/Zeolite-Y (CS/ZY) adsorbent. The prepared composite was characterized by FTIR, SEM, XRD, TEM, and BET analysis. The adsorption process was optimized by central composite design (CCD). Four factors including the solution pH (2.0-6.0), Cd(II) concentration (2.5-12.5 mg L-1), contact time (5.5-11.5 min), and adsorbent dose (0.005-0.01 g) were considered, and the optimal condition of parameters for maximum cadmium adsorption was as follows: pH 5.0, adsorbent dosage: 0.009 g, cadmium concentration: 10.0 mg L-1, and contact time: 7.0 min. The kinetic and equilibrium data were well-fitted by pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models (q(m) = 315.27 mg g(-1)). The obtained results related to the reusability of the CS/ZY composite after five sorption desorption cycles offered promising potential in industrial activities.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Bias adjustment and downscaling of snow cover fraction projections from regional climate models using remote sensing for the European Alps
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain seasonal snow cover is undergoing major changes due to global climate change. Assessments of future snow cover usually rely on physically based models, and often include post-processed meteorology. Alternatively, we here propose a direct statistical adjustment of snow cover fraction from regional climate models by using long-term remote-sensing observations. We compared different bias-adjustment routines (delta change, quantile mapping, and quantile delta mapping) and explored a downscaling based on historical observations for the Greater Alpine Region in Europe. All bias-adjustment methods account for systematic biases, for example due to topographic smoothing, and reduce model spread in future projections. The trend-preserving methods delta change and quantile delta mapping were found to be more suitable for snow cover fraction than quantile mapping. Averaged over the study region and whole year, snow cover fraction decreases from 12.5 % in 2001-2020 to 10.4 % (8.9 %, 11.5 %; model spread) in 2071-2100 under RCP2.6 (representative concentration pathway), and to 6.4 % (4.1 %, 7.8 %) under RCP8.5 (bias-adjusted estimates from quantile delta mapping). In addition, changes strongly depended on season and elevation. The comparison of the statistical downscaling to a high-resolution physically based model yields similar results for the elevation range covered by the climate models, but different elevation gradients of change above and below. Downscaling showed overall potential but requires further research. Since climate model and remote-sensing observations are available globally, the proposed methods are potentially widely applicable but are limited to snow cover fraction.

TI  - Long-Time Variation and Mechanism of Surface Energy Budget Over Diverse Geographical Regions in Pakistan
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth's energy budget is a major force that drives global climate. The long-term pattern of land surface energy budget with pronounced biophysical effects on climate was normally ignored at a regional scale, particularly in Pakistan. In this article, the land surface energy budget from 2001 to 2018 was estimated and analyzed from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations over three geographical regions (northern highlands, Indus plains, and Bolochistan plateau) in Pakistan. Biophysical and energy budget parameters, such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), albedo, emissivity, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were obtained from MODIS, whereas the downward shortwave solar and longwave thermal radiation were obtained from CERES satellite data. Spatiotemporal trends of three energy budget parameters, i.e., net radiation, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux, and three biophysical parameters, i.e., albedo, NDVI, and LST, were investigated from 2001 to 2018. The latent heat flux showed a significant increase with a trend of 0.24, whereas a decrease in sensible heat flux with a trend of -0.21 was observed over Pakistan. Net radiation showed an ignorable increase with a trend of 0.054 over the whole of Pakistan. A significant negative relation was found between net radiation and sensible heat flux with albedo, whereas a significant positive relation was found between latent heat flux and NDVI. Biophysical parameters, such as NDVI, albedo, and LST, successively explain the trends of radiative and nonradiative fluxes. This study comprehensively explains the mechanism and patterns of the regional energy budget.

M3  - Article
AB  - The current investigation concern Tiouit region in order to perceive potential mining zones. Remote sensing data were the main component to process. In order to spot geochemical anomalies associated with the target zones, multispectral ASTER data, gamma-ray spectrometry, and stream sediment data were used. Crosta and SAM applications granted to map a spatial distribution of propylitic, phyllic, clay, and ferruginous alteration zones. The normalized ratios let the delineation of potassic alteration zones, including the Tiouit gold mine characterized by an intense alteration in the lkniwn granodiorite. Thus, the potassic alteration zones are consistently co-located with the tectonic structures materialized by strong fracturing densities. The stream sediment geochemical investigation revealed that the cited areas have an important potential of mineralization, with high concentrations of As (136 g/t), Cu (91 g/t), Pb (141 g/t), Zn (392 g/t), Ag (3 g/t), Mo (11 g/t), Mn (0.2 g/t), and Fe (10.63 %).

TI  - Multiscale Adaptive Convolution for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely used in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification owing to their advantages of spatial-spectral features capture capability and learning depth features as well as their structural flexibility. Nevertheless, the shape of the convolution kernel is fixed, a limitation that leads to shape fixation when modeling different features in CNN, especially in the edge regions between classes. A multiscale adaptive convolution (MSAC) model is proposed in this article to overcome this shortcoming. Combining superpixels with the traditional convolutional kernels to form adaptive kernels automatically adjusts the receptive field, suppresses edge noise, and enhances feature learning for different classes. On the basis of adaptive convolution, adaptive convolution units (AConvUs) are constructed. The hierarchical residual structure is constructed by superimposing multiple AConvUs to learn the spatial spectral features of different receptive fields of the HSI, reduce the gradient disappearance and enhance the robustness. The proposed multiscale convolution adjusts the shape of the convolution kernel according to the spatial distribution of different superpixels in HSI. Finally, the MSAC classification framework is constructed by the decision fusion of multiscale adaptive convolution at different superpixel scales, which helps to extract the complementary information of the HSI. The MSAC method's experimental performance on several HSI datasets, including Indian Pines, University of Pavia, Salinas and Gaofen-5, to verify the validity and practically.

TI  - Global Flood Mapper: a novel Google Earth Engine application for rapid flood mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information about the extent of floodwater is critical for emergency planning and disaster management efforts. Despite the advances in computational resources and in the field of remote sensing, there is a clear gap that restricts the disaster community from leveraging the technological resources in real time, which impedes on-ground response efforts. To bridge this gap, this paper makes two contributions. First, the paper presents a new web application, the Global Flood Mapper (GFM) that allows the user to generate flood maps quickly and without getting into technical intricacies. To derive the flood extent from Sentinel-1 satellite data, the pre-flood collection is considered as base and anomaly cells in the during-flood image(s) are identified using Z-Score values. Second, it advances an existing flood mapping method to (a) Map the peak of the floods by combining ascending and descending scenes when necessary, and (b) Check for false positives in hilly terrains by adding slope and elevation mask parameters. By comparing our results with Sentinel-2 MSI derived flood maps and field photographs, we show that the GFM can generate flood maps with precision. The GFM can be used to map and download the extent of multiple flood events of an area as vector data (.kml format), which can be a critical input for flood modeling and risk and impact assessments. The GFM shall enable first responders and practitioners across the globe to overcome technical barriers and lack of computational resources to map the extent of inundation during and after floods.

TI  - Incidental irradiation of the regional lymph nodes during deep inspiration breath-hold radiation therapy in left-sided breast cancer patients: a dosimetric analysis
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Radiotherapy using the deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique compared with free breathing (FB) can achieve substantial reduction of heart and lung doses in left-sided breast cancer cases. The anatomical organ movement in deep inspiration also cause unintended exposure of locoregional lymph nodes to the irradiation field. Methods From 2017-2020, 148 patients with left-sided breast cancer underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy (ME) with axillary lymph node staging, followed by adjuvant irradiation in DIBH technique. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy was administered depending on hormone receptor and HER2-status. CT scans in FB and DIBH position with individual coaching and determination of the breathing amplitude during the radiation planning CT were performed for all patients. Intrafractional 3D position monitoring of the patient surface in deep inspiration and gating was performed using Sentinel and Catalyst HD 3D surface scanning systems (C-RAD, Catalyst, C-RAD AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Three-dimensional treatment planning was performed using standard tangential treatment portals (6 or 18 MV). The delineation of ipsilateral locoregional lymph nodes was done on the FB and the DIBH CT-scan according to the RTOG recommendations. Results The mean doses (D-mean) in axillary lymph node (AL) level I, II and III in DIBH were 32.28 Gy (range 2.87-51.7), 20.1 Gy (range 0.44-53.84) and 3.84 Gy (range 0.25-39.23) vs. 34.93 Gy (range 10.52-50.40), 16.40 Gy (range 0.38-52.40) and 3.06 Gy (range 0.21-40.48) in FB (p < 0.0001). Accordingly, in DIBH the D-mean for AL level I were reduced by 7.59%, whereas for AL level II and III increased by 22.56% and 25.49%, respectively. The D-mean for the supraclavicular lymph nodes (SC) in DIBH was 0.82 Gy (range 0.23-4.11), as compared to 0.84 Gy (range 0.22-10.80) with FB (p = 0.002). This results in a mean dose reduction of 2.38% in DIBH. The D-mean for internal mammary lymph nodes (IM) was 12.77 Gy (range 1.45-39.09) in DIBH vs. 11.17 Gy (range 1.34-44.24) in FB (p = 0.005). This yields a mean dose increase of 14.32% in DIBH. Conclusions The DIBH technique may result in changes in the incidental dose exposure of regional lymph node areas.

TI  - Characterization of Clinical <i>Salmonella entericas</i> Trains in Huzhou, China
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES & MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica causes salmonellosis in humans and animals and is an important antecedent of food infections worldwide. This study collected 105 clinical S. enterica isolates from diarrhoea samples from six sentinel hospitals for active surveillance of foodborne diseases in Huzhou, China, between 2018 and 2020. These represented all the Salmonella isolates collected in Huzhou during that period. Methods. The isolates were characterized by serovar determination, antimicrobial susceptibility tests, and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Results. The 105 Salmonella strains were mainly S. typhimurium (35.24%, 95% CI from 25.95 to 44.53%) and S. enteritidis (18.10%, 95% CI from 10.61 to 25.58%). Testing indicated that the resistance rate of the Salmonella strains ranged from 0.00% to 70.48%, and the highest resistance rate was for ampicillin (70.48%; 74/105), followed by tetracycline (67.62%; 71/105) and doxycycline (65.71%; 69/105). Following XbaI digestion, the 105 strains yielded 93 PFGE patterns, and 15 clones had similarity values >85.00%. Conclusions. Our analyses revealed the serovar distribution of isolates recovered from diarrhoea patients and the characteristics of resistant strains in Huzhou from 2018 to 2020. Our results highlight a serovar shift and a concerning number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Continued surveillance of Salmonella and their MDR profiles and efforts to control the rapid increase in antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella in Huzhou are needed.

TI  - Generalized Composite Mangrove Index for Mapping Mangroves Using Sentinel-2 Time Series Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring mangroves is critical to protect the coastal ecosystems. Some studies resorted to remote sensing for constructing mangrove indices (MIs). However, there are still some drawbacks in existing MIs. On the one hand, difficulty still persists in distinguishing mangroves from nonmangrove vegetation and nonvegetated areas at the same time. On the other hand, the existing MIs have not fully utilized the phenological trajectories, which can greatly help to distinguish mangroves from other land covers. To overcome these issues, we built a novel mangrove index, namely generalized composite mangrove index (GCMI) by compositing vegetation indices (VIs) and water indices (WIs) based on Sentinel-2 time series data. Firstly, to determine the optimal indices, a similarity trend distance (ST distance) measure was proposed based on Pearson correlation coefficient and dynamic time warping (DTW). Secondly, in order to optimize the weights of selected indices, a population reconstruction genetic algorithm (PRGA) was designed. Finally, mangroves were mapped by feeding the time series of GCMI into random forest classifier. Experiments conducted over three areas along the southern coast of China demonstrate that: 1) GCMI enhances the separability between mangroves and other land covers compared to the existing VIs, WIs, and MIs, with an averaged overall accuracy of 91.45%; 2) ST distance outperforms Euclidean distance, Cosine distance, Pearson correlation coefficient, and DTW in optimizing the weights of GCMI; 3) PRGA greatly improves the probability of attaining global optimal result. The innovation lies in the presented GCMI considering both the vegetation trajectory information and water inundation using time series.

TI  - A Global Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Variability of Usable Landsat Observations at the Pixel Scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat program has the longest collection of moderate-resolution satellite imagery, and the data are free to everyone. With the improvements of standardized image products, the flexibility of cloud computing platforms, and the development of time series approaches, it is now possible to conduct global-scale analyses of time series using Landsat data over multiple decades. Efforts in this regard are limited by the density of usable observations. The availability of usable Landsat Tier 1 observations at the scale of individual pixels from the perspective of time series analysis for land change monitoring is remarkably variable both in space (globally) and time (1985-2020), depending most immediately on which sensors were in operation, the technical capabilities of the mission, and the acquisition strategies and objectives of the satellite operators (e.g., USGS, commercial company) and the international ground receiving stations. Additionally, analysis of data density at the pixel scale allows for the integration of quality control data on clouds, cloud shadows, and snow as well as other properties returned from the atmospheric correction process. Maps for different time periods show the effect of excluding observations based on the presence of clouds, cloud shadows, snow, sensor saturation, hazy observations (based on atmospheric opacity), and lack of aerosol optical depth information. Two major discoveries are: 1) that filtering saturated and hazy pixels is helpful to reduce noise in the time series, although the impact may vary across different continents; 2) the atmospheric opacity band needs to be used with caution because many images are removed when no value is given in this band, when many of those observations are usable. The results provide guidance on when and where time series analysis is feasible, which will benefit many users of Landsat data.

TI  - Urban Vitality and its Influencing Factors: Comparative Analysis Based on Taxi Trajectory Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Taxis have always been an important part of the urban transportation system in metropolises since they can meet many demands and greatly improve travel efficiency. This article explores the distributions of hot spot destinations of taxi, land surface temperature data, and visible infrared imaging radiometer (VIIRS) nighttime light data in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan. This article further selects point of interests (POIs) that are very close to taxi ridership patterns. This article finally uses a geographically weighted regression model to examine the relationship between population flow by taxi and urban vitality, which is represented by land surface temperature, nighttime light data, and influential POIs. The results suggest that urban structure has an impact on the distribution of drop-off points and nighttime light. The implementation of the relevant policies is revealed to have a certain influence on the alleviation of the urban thermal environment. Traffic stations and financial facilities contribute to an increase in travel, and their influences vary spatially. Similarly, the relationships between the drop-off points and LST and NTL vary spatially. This article aids in understanding population flow and urban vitality development. In addition, this article provides valuable results for policy-makers to promote urban vitality development.

Monitoring was conducted to evaluate water quality indicators: chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and turbidity. Ground truthing was performed to select the most suitable atmospheric correction technique (ACT). Several ACT have been tested: dark spectrum fitting (DSF), dark object subtraction (DOS), atmospheric and topographic correction (ATCOR), and exponential extrapolation (EXP). Classical sampling was conducted first; then, the resulting concentrations were compared to those obtained using remote sensing analysis by the above-mentioned ACT. This research revealed that DOS and DSF achieved the best performance (an advantage ranging between 29% and 47%). Further, we demonstrated the appropriateness of the use of Sentinel-2 red and vegetation red edge reciprocal bands 1/B4xB6 for estimating Chl-a (R-2=0.82, RMSE=14.52 mg/m(3)). As for Landsat-8, red to near-infrared ratio (B4/B5) produced the best performing model (R-2=0.71, RMSE=39.88 mg/m3), but it did not perform as well as Sentinel-2. Regarding turbidity, the best model (R-2=0.85, RMSE=0.87 NTU) obtained by Sentinel-2 utilized a single band (B4), while the best model (with R-2=0.64, RMSE=0.90 NTU) using Landsat-8 was performed by applying two bands (B1/B3). Mapping the water quality parameters using the best performance biooptical model showed the significant effect of the adjacent land on the boundary pixels compared to pixels of deeper water.

TI  - Feasibility of a drop-in γ-probe for radioguided sentinel lymph detection in early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Minimally invasive radioguided sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedures, increasingly performed with robot-assisted laparoscopy, can benefit from using a drop-in gamma-probe instead of the conventional rigid laparoscopic gamma-probe. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of a tethered drop-in gamma-probe system for SLN detection in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.Methods: Ten patients with FIGO stage IA - IB2 or IIA1 cervical cancer scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic SLN procedure were included. All patients underwent preoperative 240 MBq technetium-99m nanocolloid (Tc-99m) injection and SPECT/CT imaging. Intraoperatively the tethered drop-in gamma-probe SENSEI (R) (Lightpoint Medical Ltd, Chesham, UK) was used for probe guided SLN detection, subsequently confirmed by the standard rigid laparoscopic gamma-probe. Sentinel lymph node detection rates and anatomical SLN location were assessed. Surgeon questionnaires were used to assess usability.Results: In all patients at least one SLN was successfully resected under guidance of the drop-in gamma-probe (overall detection rate: 100%). Bilateral SLN detection rate with the drop-in gamma-probe was 80%. Of the two patients with unilateral SLN detection only, one presented with an atypical SLN location at the aortic bifurcation that was detected only on SPECT/CT. The other patient had failed unilateral Tc-99m uptake. Combined use of preoperative SPECT/CT and drop-in gamma-probe resulted in a bilateral detection rate of 90%. Similar to the drop-in gamma-probe, overall and bilateral SLN detection rate of the rigid gamma-probe was 100% and 80%, respectively. No significant discrepancy existed between the count rate of the drop-in and rigid laparoscopic gamma-probe (p = 0.69). In total 21 SLN's were detected with the drop-in gamma-probes including all three tumor positive nodes. Because of wristed articulation of the robotic tissue grasper and possibility of autonomous probe control by the surgeon, maneuverability and control with the drop-in gamma-probe were highly rated in surgeon questionnaires. No adverse events related to the intervention occurred.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node detection with a drop-in gamma-probe is safe and feasible in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Use of the drop-in gamma-probe enhances maneuverability and surgical autonomy during robot-assisted SLN detection.

TI  - Good news for a rare plant: Fine-resolution distributional predictions and field testing for the critically endangered plant <i>Dianthus pseudocrinitus</i>
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many endangered species are distributed in narrow geographic ranges, often at severe risk of extinction. Ecological niche modeling can be used to identify suitable areas, which can be surveyed to detect additional populations. We combined remotely sensed data (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and field sampling to increase distributional knowledge of the species and improve understanding of its conservation status. We identified numerous new sites for a rare plant (Dianthus pseudocrinitus) and tested model-based predictions of its full geographic distribution. Using only eight occurrences, we developed initial models, which guided detailed field sampling: 11 new sites were identified, but models were unable to predict better than random expectations. A second round of models did show significant predictive ability and pointed to a broader geographic and environmental distribution of the species. As a consequence, the conservation status of the species should be upgraded from Critically Endangered to Endangered. We identified six protected areas (Golestan, Ghorkhoud, Miandasht, Salouk, Sarani, Sarigol) that likely hold populations of this species; one area adjacent to Ghorkhoud Protected Area, if protected, would protect the best-known populations of the species. Our results highlight the importance of combining modeling with field sampling in characterizing distributions of rare and endangered species.

TI  - Towards a new approach to job-related distress: A three-sample study of the Occupational Depression Inventory
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Occupational Depression Inventory (ODI) was recently developed to assess depressive symptoms that individuals specifically attribute to their work. One purpose of the ODI is to respond to limitations of current assessments of job-related distress, most notably, assessments relying on the burnout construct. In this study, we conducted a thorough examination of the psychometric and structural properties of the ODI using exploratory structural equation modelling bifactor analysis and Mokken scale analysis. The study involved three samples of employed individuals, recruited in France (N = 3454), Switzerland (N = 1971), and Australia (N = 1485). Results were consistent across the three samples. The ODI exhibited essential unidimensionality and excellent total-score reliability?as indexed by McDonald's omega, Cronbach's alpha, Guttman's lambda-2, and the Molenaar-Sijtsma statistic. We found evidence for measurement invariance across sexes, age groups, and samples. Mokken scale analysis revealed that the ODI's scalability was strong. No monotonicity violation was detected. Invariant item ordering showed sufficient accuracy. In all three samples, suicidal ideation was the least commonly endorsed item?thus acting as a sentinel item?and fatigue/loss of energy was the most commonly endorsed item. The ODI exhibits excellent psychometric and structural properties, suggesting that occupational health specialists can effectively employ the instrument.

AB  - What is faith? And what makes faith reasonable, when it is so? I first defend approaching the question of faith and its reasonableness by starting from faith in the religious context. Next, I develop a 'venture' theory of a specific kind of faith of which religious - and specifically Christian - practical commitment to a whole worldview may be taken methodologically as a paradigm case. Then I consider the conditions under which faith-commitment of this general type may be reasonable. I suggest that faith-ventures of this kind are morally permissible only when they are made reasonably, with epistemic integrity. I consider the role an appeal to epistemic externalism may have in defending the epistemic integrity of venturing beyond (though not against) the available evidence. I advance a moderate fideist thesis (inspired by William James's 'justification of faith'), and consider the debate between Jamesian fideists and evidentialists for whom epistemic integrity requires commitment to be made to truth-claims only to the extent supported by evidence for their truth.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasites are important components of the immense n-dimensional trophic network that connects all living beings because they, among others, forge biodiversity and deeply influence ecological evolution and host behavior. In this sense, the influence of Trypanosomatidae remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine trypanosomatid infection and richness in rats, opossums, and dogs in the semiarid Caatinga biome. We submitted DNA samples from trypanosomatids obtained through axenic cultures of the blood of these mammals to mini exon multiplex-PCR, Sanger, and next-generation sequencing targeting the 18S rDNA gene. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify genetic diversity in the Trypanosomatidae family. Shannon, Simpson, equability, and beta-diversity indices were calculated per location and per mammalian host. Dogs were surveyed for trypanosomatid infection through hemocultures and serological assays. The examined mammal species of this area of the Caatinga biome exhibited an enormous trypanosomatid species/genotypes richness. Ten denoised Operational Taxonomic Units (ZOTUs), including three species (Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rangeli and Crithidia mellificae) and one Trypanosoma sp. five genotypes/lineages (T. cruzi DTU TcI, TcII, and TcIV; T. rangeli A and B) and four DTU TcI haplotypes (ZOTU1, ZOTU2, ZOTU5, and ZOTU10 merged), as well as 13 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), including five species (T. cruzi, T. rangeli, C. mellificae, Trypanosoma dionisii, and Trypanosoma lainsoni), five genotypes/lineages (same as the ZOTUs) and six DTU TcI haplotypes (ASV, ASV1, ASV2, ASV3, ASV5 and ASV13), were identified in single and mixed infections. We observed that trypanosomatids present a broad host spectrum given that species related to a single host are found in other mammals from different taxa. Concomitant infections between trypanosomatids and new host-parasite relationships have been reported, and this immense diversity in mammals raised questions, such as how this can influence the course of the infection in these animals and its transmissibility. Dogs demonstrated a high infection rate by T. cruzi as observed by positive serological results (92% in 2005 and 76% in 2007). The absence of positive parasitological tests confirmed their poor infectivity potential but their importance as sentinel hosts of T. cruzi transmission.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE Tubo-ovarian cancer (TOC) is a sentinel cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants (PVs). Identification of a PV in the first member of a family at increased genetic risk (the proband) provides opportunities for cancer prevention in other at-risk family members. Although Australian testing rates are now high, PVs in patients with TOC whose diagnosis predated revised testing guidelines might have been missed. We assessed the feasibility of detecting PVs in this population to enable genetic risk reduction in relatives.PATIENTS AND METHODS In this pilot study, deceased probands were ascertained from research cohort studies, identification by a relative, and gynecologic oncology clinics. DNA was extracted from archival tissue or stored blood for panel sequencing of 10 risk-associated genes. Testing of deceased probands ascertained through clinic records was performed with a consent waiver.RESULTS We identified 85 PVs in 84 of 787 (11%) probands. Familial contacts of 39 of 60 (65%) deceased probands with an identified recipient (60 of 84; 71%) have received a written notification of results, with follow-up verbal contact made in 85% (33 of 39). A minority of families (n = 4) were already aware of the PV. For many (29 of 33; 88%), the genetic result provided new information and referral to a genetic service was accepted in most cases (66%; 19 of 29). Those who declined referral (4 of 29) were all male next of kin whose family member had died more than 10 years before.CONCLUSION We overcame ethical and logistic challenges to demonstrate that retrospective genetic testing to identify PVs in previously untested deceased probands with TOC is feasible. Understanding reasons for a family member's decision to accept or decline a referral will be important for guiding future TRACEBACK projects. (C) 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Correlation Analysis of Soil Nutrients and Prediction Model Through ISO Cluster Unsupervised Classification with Multispectral Data
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural sector is the backbone of the Indian economy, where precision agriculture is playing a vital role in boosting productivity. The soil chemical parameters play an important role in precision agriculture. Analysis and prediction of micronutrient of the soil chemical parameters are highly insisted upon by farmers and agriculture researchers. The soil nutrients parameters can be analyzed from multispectral data through ISO cluster unsupervised classification. Understanding the nutrient level of soil is highly recommended for farming; early understanding may help to improve soil fertility and fully meet productivity requirements. This paper addresses the soil nutrients analysis by the regression method and its spectral indexed based on the prediction model by Iterative Self-Organizing (ISO) cluster unsupervised classification algorithm. Therefore, for this study, the Baggi, Ibrahimpur, Wai, Mogra, and Bori (for validation) villages were selected. These villages are located in the Amravati district and fall under Maharashtra provenance of India. From the study area, three soil nutrients parameters such as P, Fe, pH indices-based data were acquired from the spectral calculation of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 bands. The P, Fe and pH indices were calculated from the yellowness index (YI), ferrous oxide index, and carbonate level. The ISO cluster unsupervised mechanism has been used for prediction of soil chemical parameter indices out of 100 samples. The study regions recognition rate is 97% for P, 94.05% for Fe, and 69% for pH. During the validation process, four villages' results were used for the identification of soil nutrient parameters for Bori village. The results of the study area can be helpful for the development of the planning of soil fertility in the agriculture fields and effectively increase the crop yield production in the semi-arid region.

T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations pollution is one of serious environmental issues. It is necessary for PM2.5 concentrations estimation because the existing PM2.5 ground monitoring stations are relatively sparse and cannot obtain continuous PM2.5 concentrations over a large area. Several studies have been applied aerosol optical depth (AOD) to PM2.5 concentrations estimation. However, the missing of the AOD data does not improve the accuracy of PM2.5 estimations. Therefore, we need a filling technique to fill the AOD data. The purpose of this study is to deal with the missing AOD data using machine learning interpolation techniques and to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km resolution by adding auxiliary factors to fit the relationship between AOD data and PM2.5 data. We used a long short-term memory network (LSTM), model to fit the filled AOD data. We estimated PM2.5 values based on the meteorological conditions and the AOD data at the station, and we also established the temporal and spatial relationships of PM2.5. Overall, the method is suitable for PM2.5 estimations with R-2 = 0.75. We conducted experiments at existing stations in Beijing. The results of the study demonstrate the validity of gap-filling AOD data for PM2.5 estimations, with PM2.5 distributions being higher in the south and lower in the north.

T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and environmental changes have caused changes in alpine tundra worldwide in recent decades. However, the roles of snow cover on tundra vegetation change remain less studied. There were obvious changes of alpine tundra vegetation, such as herbaceous encroachment and shrub expansion reported in Changbai Mountains in recent decades. This study investigates the relationship between snow cover and vegetation change (1988-2017) in alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains by analysing the hydrological distribution of spring snowmelt in the tundra. We mapped the wet snow extent using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) spaceborne data and estimated the snow water equivalent (SWE). We proposed a measure of relative water accumulation (RWA), which was determined by both rainfall and SWE, to represent water flowing through each pixel. We found strong correlations between RWA and vegetation change in different mountain aspects. Spring snowmelt leads to inter-mountain aspect differences in hydrological distribution, with the western aspect showing a significant higher RWA than the eastern and northern aspects, which could attribute to the greater vegetation change in the western mountain aspect. Our results suggest that the distribution of snow in alpine tundra and the different mountain aspects hydrological conditions have important implications for the study of vegetation change in alpine tundra.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become widespread in all the fields of remote sensing and earth observation. This has allowed the rapid development of new procedures to solve problems affecting these sectors. In this context, this work aims at presenting a novel method for filtering speckle noise from Sentinel-1 ground range detected data by applying deep learning (DL) algorithms, based on convolutional neural networks. This article provides an easy yet very effective approach to extract the large amount of training data needed for DL approaches in this challenging case. The experimental results on simulated speckled images and an actual synthetic aperture radar dataset show a clear improvement with respect to the state of the art in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, equivalent number of looks, proving the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

TI  - A Theoretical Model for the Microwave Emissivity of Rough Sea Surfaces
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - When sea surface wavelengths are not larger than microwave wavelengths, the microwave emissivity of Gaussian rough sea surfaces can be investigated by applying effective media theory (EMT) of rough surfaces. For one-dimensional Gaussian sea surface, the microwave emissivity model is proposed by EMT, which regards the air-sea rough interface as a new effective medium of isotropic permittivity between the top layer of air and the bottom layer of seawater. The emissivity model is controlled by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the rough surface height and the correlation length of the rough surface. Results clearly show that the emissivity increases along with the RMSD increase if the latter is smaller than a critical value. Furthermore, excess emissivities and the brightness temperature increments for a wind-roughened sea surface can be estimated from those of flat surfaces by fitting the RMSD as a function of wind speed. Good agreements are obtained by comparing the results of our model with the satellite data at microwave frequencies of 1.4, 6.8, 18, 21, and 37 GHz, respectively. Moreover, these findings imply that our method can be extended to retrieve the sea surface parameters, such as RMSD and the correlation length of the rough surface, from the satellite data.

TI  - Working with curiosity: Knowledge transfer practitioners' ambivalence at CERN
T2  - SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current science-policy trends emphasise efficiency, application orientation, and accountability. This article is inspired by the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012; the author studies how the knowledge transfer practitioners at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the birthplace of the Higgs boson, account for their experiences at CERN. In the body of the Science Policy Studies literature, the knowledge transfer practitioners' perspective on the wider impacts of particle and high-energy physics research is relatively understudied. The data are generated from qualitative interviews. Constructivist discourse analysis, which is introduced from Science and Technology Studies, is applied to the data; namely, this research focuses on the practitioners' worldview and their perceived situation at CERN. As a result, there is a repetitive sense of ambivalence towards knowledge transfer in the discourse. Practical suggestions are provided in response to this ambivalence.

TI  - Decline of suspended particulate matter concentrations in Lake Taihu from 1984 to 2020: observations from Landsat TM and OLI
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) affects the optical properties of water, which can be used as a marker of water quality. The water quality of Lake Taihu has changed immensely since the 1980's. However, despite the link between water quality and SPM, long-term systematic studies on SPM have not been conducted in this lake. Here, we used Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI data to model changes in the SPM concentration of Lake Taihu from 1984 to 2020. Various models were generated, calibrated, and finally validated using in situ SPM, remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data, and synchronous satellite data. After comparing various commonly used models, it was found that the exponential model based on band combination [R-rs(red) + R-rs(NIR)/R-rs(green)] had the highest accuracy, with an average unbiased relative error greater than 35%. Subsequently, the SPM products of Lake Taihu during 1984-2020 were generated. Overall, the SPM concentration showed a downward trend over the study period, which might be primarily attributable to a decline in wind speed. These findings may assist in the conservation of Lake Taihu and its associated water resources. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Effect of urbanization on the dynamics of ecosystem services: An analysis for decision making in Kolkata urban agglomeration
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has profound influence on the changes of land use and land cover, which on the other hand exert significant impact on ecosystem services and their values, especially in the urban agglomerations. Kolkata urban agglomeration of India has been selected to determine the causes in changes of ecosystem services under present and projected land use land cover scenario. Land use land cover maps of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were prepared by support vector machine method, using LANDSAT satellite imageries and projected up-to 2040 using CA-Markov model. Built-up land was increased by 65.39% during 1990-2020 and will further increase to 76.88% by 2040. Built-up lands are mainly encroaching crop lands and wetlands. During the period of fifty years (1990-2040), the ecosystem service value will decrease from $38,486.49 to $28,060.79, with annual rate of decrement of 0.54%. During the same period, the spatial extent of very low ecosystem service value will be increased from 16.60 to 58.88%; whereas, the area coverage of very high ecosystem service value will be decreased from 2.69 to 2.35%. Water supply contributed highest ecosystem service value followed by disturbance regulation and nutrient cycling; whereas, lacking in soil formation, pollination and biological control services contributed lowest. The study will help in decision making process for sustainable management of natural resources and also provide useful guideline for the quality improvement in urban ecosystems.

TI  - A stable block adjustment method without ground control points using bound constrained optimization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Block adjustment is a key technology for achieving large-scale accurate mapping of space via remote sensing. When block adjustment without ground control points (GCPs) is conducted, the adjustment model has large condition number of design matrix, and an ill-conditioned normal equation, which eventually leads to abnormal convergence of direct least squares solution. In this study, we investigated block adjustment without GCPs based on Rational Function Model (RFM), and applied image space affine model of RFM as the systematic error compensation model of single scene imagery. The value range of each parameter of the affine model was determined by calculating the inverse projection errors of tie points and the adjustment model parameters were solved by the optimization method with attached inequalities constraint. Finally, the abnormal convergence problem was solved by reducing the degree of freedom of convergence. Comparative tests of block adjustment without GCPs using various methods were conducted using multiple regional imagery from Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3), Tianhui-1 (TH-1), Luojia-1 (LJ-1) and Gaofen-3 (GF-3). The results show that the proposed method can achieve rapid and correct convergence, and has strong practicability.

TI  - Beyond the SDG 15.3.1 Good Practice Guidance 1.0 using the Google Earth Engine platform: developing a self-adjusting algorithm to detect significant changes in water use efficiency and net primary production
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in Annual Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) is required for reporting on UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 15.3.1: the proportion of land that is degraded over the total land area. Calibrating time-series observations of ANPP to derive Water Use Efficiency (WUE; a measure of ANPP per unit of evapotranspiration) can minimize the influence of climate factors on ANPP observations and highlight the influence of non-climatic drivers of degradation such as land use changes. Comparing the ANPP and WUE time series may be useful for identifying the primary drivers of land degradation, which could be used to support the Land Degradation Neutrality objectives of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). This paper presents an algorithm for the Google Earth Engine (freely and openly available upon request - http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4429773) to calculate and compare ANPP and WUE time series for Santa Cruz, Bolivia, which has recently experienced an intensification in its land use. This code builds on the Good Practice Guidance document (version 1) for monitoring SDG Indicator 15.3.1. We use the MODIS 16-day average, 250 m resolution to demonstrate that the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) responds faster to changes in water availability than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also consider the relationships between ANPP and WUE. Significant and concordant trends may highlight good agricultural practices or increased resilience in ecosystem structure and productivity when they are positive or reducing resilience and functional integrity if negative. The sign and significance of the correlation between ANPP and WUE may also diverge over time. With further analysis, it may be possible to interpret this relationship in terms of the drivers of change in plant productivity and ecosystem resilience.

TI  - Feature based remote sensing image registration techniques: a comprehensive and comparative review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Earth observation using remote sensing data is a trending research field across the globe. In this perspective, image registration is a mandatory data processing step for any kind of time series data analytics. Feature-based image registration is one of the prominent categories for superimposing multi-temporal and multi-modal images over each other. The paper provides a comprehensive and comparative survey of feature detection/description techniques for remote sensing images. In addition, outlier removal algorithms are explored in detail to generate putative keypoint correspondences for accurate transformation parameter estimation. The experiments are conducted on multiple remote sensing image pairs comprising visible, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and infrared images that provide diverse characteristics of the feature target. The co-registration accuracy is quantified for all possible combinations of feature detection/description with outlier removal, and best amalgamation is visually verified to check sub-pixel spatial alignment by swiping multi-temporal or multi-modal images over each other. It has been found that SIFT performs better in optical image registration, whereas A-KAZE feature detection has an upper edge at SAR image registration task. Marginalizing Sample Consensus (MAGSAC) and Mode Guided (MG) based outlier removal techniques achieves better pruning performance for multi-temporal optical and SAR images respectively. The comparative evaluation indicates that Motion Smoothness Constraint (MSC) optimization shows optimal performance for multi-modal remote sensing images. The best possible Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) achieved for multi-temporal optical images is 0.44 pixel whereas for multi-temporal SAR images, it is 0.46 pixels. The RMSE achieved for multi-modal images is 0.48 pixel using combination of SIFT with MSC.

TI  - Cross-Comparison of channel parameters between FY-3E/MERSI-LL and Himawari-8/AHI in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) is the world's first operational meteorological satellite on dawn-dusk orbit. In order to realize the generality of algorithms for different satellites and provide a basis for subsequent inversion studies on remote sensing parameters, such as land surface temperature, fire, and atmospheric water vapour, we perform a cross-comparison of the brightness temperature (TB) of the six infrared (IR) channels between the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager Level L onboard the FY-3E satellite (FY-3E/MERSI-LL) and the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard the Himawari-8 satellite (Himawari-8/AHI). The statistical indicators, correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias, are used to analyse the consistency and differences of the channel parameters between the MERSI-LL and AHI in terms of overall data, different regions and different TB. The results show that the TB data observed by the FY-3E/MERSI-LL and Himawari-8/AHI are generally consistent, with correlation coefficients of more than 0.99, mean biases of less than 1.60 K and RMSEs of less than 1.90 K. In terms of different channels, the TB in channel IR 038 has the best consistency between the two sensors, while the results from the MERSI-LL are higher than those of the AHI for channels IR038, IR086, IR108 and IR120, and lower than those of the AHI for channel IR041. Analysing the situation in different regions, we find that the MERSI-LL and AHI data are highly consistent and relatively stable in the Huang-Huai Region, with low RMSEs, low mean biases and high correlation coefficients (more than 0.95) at all channels. For the different TB ranges, the RMSEs and mean biases for the TB ranges of 270-280 K and 280-290 K between the MERSI-LL and AHI are small, and the data in the 290-300 K TB range has great differences and fluctuations between the two sensors.

TI  - A new approach towards temporal densification of river discharge estimates by filling cloud- and stripe-gaps using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge plays a vital role in the Earth's water cycle. Recent studies have sought to estimate river discharge using optical sensors onboard satellites, typically deriving discharge from multispectral data after e(x)cluding many images that are contaminated by cloud or affected by the scan-line-corrector (SLC) failure on Landsat 7. As such, time series of estimated discharge generally include a high proportion of missing values. To overcome these issues, we propose an easy and feasible methodology to temporally densify the time series of discharge estimates by repairing cloud-contaminated and SLC-affected images on the Google Earth Engine platform. The middle Yangtze River (MYR) was chosen as the study area to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of the methodology. First, different water indices were compared to select the most appropriate indicator for water surface retrieval along the MYR. The Pekel method shows the best performance for extracting the water surface when turbid or under thin, semi-transparent clouds. Second, the performances of the Tourian method and the Manning equation for estimating the discharge were compared when using only good-quality images, yielding Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Nash) coefficients of 0.69 and 0.79, respectively. Images affected by the SLC and over 50% cloud cover accounted for 41% of 532 records used from 1986 to 2019. The repaired, temporally complete time series of discharge estimates by the Manning equation corresponds to a correlation coefficient of 0.86, a Nash coefficient of 0.73, and a root mean square error of 5697 m(3)/s from 2000 to 2019. These results show the strong potential of this method for estimating the discharge of rivers with known cross-sectional and the morphological conditions worldwide.

TI  - A cross-channel multi-scale gated fusion network for recognizing construction and demolition waste from high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate survey of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) distribution is of significance for managing C&DW and enhancing the quality of the urban environment, especially in rapidly urbanizing country of China. Automatic C&DW recognition using high-resolution remote sensing images is an extremely important surveying method. Existing C&DW recognition methods can only obtain a rough spatial distribution of C&DW. Mapping precise C&DW distribution on large-scale remote sensing images is still challenging. In this paper, to solve the problem of precise C&DW recognition, a novel deep learning algorithm based on high-resolution remote sensing images is proposed, which we refer to as the cross-channel multi-scale gated fusion network (CCMGNet). CCMGNet extracts depth features of C&DW from RGB and NIR bands by using two independent encoding streams. A gated fusion layer and a multi-scale attention module are designed to effectively fuse the features from two encoding streams. We manually labelled the sample set used for training and testing on 26 remote sensing images captured by the Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite. These images were taken in nine typical cities in China over the time period from 2019 to 2021. The results showed that the proposed method is effective in recognizing C&DW, realizing 89.42% and 84.52% in precision and IoU, and is superior to other state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and existing C&DW recognition methods. The effectiveness of all significant components in CCMGNet was confirmed by ablation experiments. The proposed method was applied to extract C&DW regions in large-scale remote sensing images, with an example of a GF-2 image of Beijing. The high extraction efficiency and satisfactory visual effect demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for surveying the spatial distribution of C&DW. The novel method will play a crucial role in automatically surveying the spatial distribution and size of C&DW across the country.

TI  - An improved coastline inflection method for geolocation correction of Microwave Radiation Imager data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geolocation accuracy is an important factor affecting the application of microwave remote sensing data. For effective application of microwave radiation data in quantitative remote sensing, geolocation errors should be corrected. The coastline inflection method (CIM) is widely used for geolocation correction of microwave radiometer data, which consists of the inflection point identification process and the error estimation process. The detected coastline that is composed of the brightness temperature inflection points can be identified in the first process, and the error between the detected coastline and the true coastline can be estimated in the second process. However, both processes will be affected when the coastline is complex or disturbed by some clouds, rain, etc. Therefore, we improve the CIM in its two processes. Firstly, a method based on the dynamic threshold is used to identify inflection points. Secondly, a new geolocation error estimation method combining the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and the Kernel Correlation (KC) algorithm is proposed to estimate geolocation errors. By applying the proposed method, the FengYun-3C (FY-3C) Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) dataset selected in the specified regions from 1 April 2019 to 1 October 2019 is processed. For the data with complex coastline structure or some interference factors, compared with the CIM based on a surface fitting interpolation model and ICP algorithm, the number of inflection points is increased by about 70%, and the mean geolocation errors in cross- and along-track directions are reduced by about 24.12% and 21.61%, respectively. For the data with simple coastline structure and less interference, the two methods have similar effects. For all selected data, the mean geolocation errors in cross- and along-track directions is reduced from [0.5376, 0.5528] pixels to [0.1581, 0.1110] pixels. Mean geolocation accuracy is improved by approximately 75%.

TI  - Satellite-based assessment of hailstorm-affected potato crop for insurance purpose
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the extent of hailstorm-affected crop is one of the thrust areas for quantifying mid-season adversities under crop insurance values chain. This study evaluated the pre- and post-hailstorm responses of potato crop, over different spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 data, towards assessment of damage severity classes. The potato crop was mapped using pre-event satellite data with overall accuracy of 88% (k = 0.82). Pair-wise Games-Howell t-test showed significant differences among the post-hailstorm potato severity classes in red, near infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands and normalized vegetation indices. Percentage change (from pre- to post-event) in band reflectance and vegetation indices showed a better sensitivity in differentiating damage severities. Differential behaviour of SWIR-1 (Band-11) and SWIR-2 (Band-12) was observed within severely affected potato crop under dry and wet soil conditions. Decision matrix based on percentage change in normalized difference vegetation index (Delta NDVI) and normalized difference tillage index (Delta NDVI) could able to capture the damage severity classes with an overall accuracy of 86.7%. Higher proportion of affected area was found to be associated with larger percentage of potato yield reduction based on measured yield data at insurance unit level. The proposed methodological approach could be adopted for operational assessment of the impact of hailstorm events on other crops with required modifications.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of our study was to better define the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (cSCCHN). A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement. Seven-hundred and five patients were included from 20 studies. The pooled SLN identification rate was 98.8% (95%CI: 97.0-99.8). The median number of SLN excised was 3.6 (n = 371, 95%CI: 2.0-4.4). The pooled SLNB positive rate and cumulative regional recurrence rate (RRR) in negative SLNB were 5.6% (95%CI: 2.6-9.6) and 2.9% (95%CI: 0.5-7.2), respectively. The high SLN identification rate demonstrates SLNB feasibility in cSCCHN. The low SLNB positive rate and the relatively high RRR raise some doubts concerning its clinical utility. Further studies are mandatory to define predictors of lymph node metastases able to better select patients that may benefit from a SLNB.

AB  - Ocean oil slicks can be attributed to natural seepages or to anthropogenic discharges. To date, the global picture of their distribution and relative natural and anthropogenic contributions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing 563,705 Sentinel-1 images from 2014-2019, we provide the first global map of oil slicks and a detailed inventory of static-and-persistent sources (natural seeps, platforms, and pipelines). About 90% of oil slicks were within 160 kilometers of shorelines, with 21 high-density slick belts coinciding well with shipping routes. Quantified by slick area, the proportion of anthropogenic discharges was an order of magnitude greater than natural seepages (94 versus 6%), in contrast to the previous estimate quantified by volume during 1990-1999 (54 versus 46%). Our findings reveal that the present-day anthropogenic contribution to marine oil pollution may have been substantially underestimated.

TI  - Assessing and mapping distribution, area, and density of riparian forests in southern Iran using Sentinel-2A, Google earth, and field data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian forests in Iran are valuable ecosystems which have many ecological values. Because of destruction of these forests in recent years, providing spatio-temporal information from area and distribution of these ecosystems has been receiving much attention. This study was performed for mapping distribution, area and density of riparian forests in southern Iran using Sentinel-2A, Google Earth, and field data. First Sentinel-2A satellite image of the study area was provided. The field work was performed to take the training areas and to assess the forest density of riparian forests in Khuzestan province. In the first part of this study, after selecting training areas as pixel-based samples on the Sentinel-2A satellite image, supervised classification of image was performed using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify the distribution of riparian forests. After classification of Sentinel-2A satellite image, the boundary of riparian forests map was checked and corrected on Google Earth images. In the second part of this study, field data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and regression model were used to assess the density of riparian forests. Finally, the accuracy of the final riparian forest map (showing both distribution and density of riparian forests) was assessed using Google Earth images. Results showed that the final riparian forest map (showing both distribution and density of riparian forests) with overall accuracy 89% and kappa index 0.81 had a good accuracy for classifying the distribution and density of riparian forests in Khuzestan province. These results demonstrate the accuracy of SVM algorithm for classifying the distribution of riparian forests and also capability of NDVI for classifying the density of riparian forests in this study. Results also showed that regression model (R-2 = 0.97) is reliable for estimating riparian forest density. The results demonstrated that there are 68447.18 ha of riparian forest around the main rivers in Khuzestan province, mainly distributed in the northwest and southeast of the province. From this area, 54694.15 ha have been covered by dense forests and 13753.03 ha by sparse forests. Results of this research have created the useful data of area, distribution and density of riparian forests in 10-m spatial resolution which is necessary for conservation and management of these forests in southern Iran. It is suggested that mapping area, distribution and density of these forests would be performed using SVM algorithm and NDVI in the certain temporal periods for protective management of these ecosystems in time series.

TI  - Record-breaking dust loading during two mega dust storm events over northern China in March 2021: aerosol optical and radiative properties and meteorological drivers
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although a remarkable reduction in the frequency of sand and dust storms (SDSs) in the past several decades has been reported over northern China (NC), two unexpected mega SDSs occurred on 15-20 and 27-29 March 2021 (abbreviated as the "3.15" and "3.27" SDS events), which has reawakened widespread concern. This study characterizes the optical, microphysical, and radiative properties of aerosols and their meteorological drivers during these two SDS events using the Sun photometer observations in Beijing and a comprehensive set of multiple satellite (including MODIS, VIIRS, CALIOP, and Himawari-8) and ground-based observations (including the CMA visibility network and AD-Net) combined with atmospheric reanalysis data. Moreover, a long-term (2000-2021) dust optical depth (DOD) dataset retrieved from MODIS measurements was also utilized to evaluate the historical ranking of the dust loading in NC during dust events. During the 3.15 and 3.27 events, the invasion of dust plumes greatly degraded the visibility over large areas of NC, with extreme low visibility of 50 and 500 m recorded at most sites on 15 and 28 March, respectively. Despite the shorter duration of the 3.27 event relative to the 3.15 event, sun photometer and satellite observations in Beijing recorded a larger peak AOD (similar to 2.5) in the former than in the latter (similar to 2.0), which was mainly attributed to the short-term intrusion of coarse-mode dust particles with larger effective radii (similar to 1.9 mu m) and volume concentrations (similar to 2.0 mu m(3) mu m(-2)) during the 3.27 event. The shortwave direct aerosol radiative forcing induced by dust was estimated to be -92.1 and -111.4 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere, -184.7 and -296.2 Wm(-2) at the surface, and +92.6 and +184.8 Wm(-2) in the atmosphere in Beijing during the 3.15 and 3.27 events, respectively. CALIOP observations show that during the 3.15 event the dust plume was lifted to an altitude of 4-8 km, and its range of impact extended from the dust source to the eastern coast of China. In contrast, the lifting height of the dust plume during the 3.27 event was lower than that during the 3.15 event, which was also confirmed by ground-based lidar observations. The MODIS-retrieved DOD data registered these two massive SDS events as the most intense episode in the same period in history over the past 2 decades. These two extreme SDS events were associated with both atmospheric circulation extremes and local meteorological anomalies that favored enhanced dust emissions in the Gobi Desert (GD) across southern Mongolia and NC. Meteorological analysis revealed that both SDS events were triggered by an exceptionally strong Mongolian cyclone generated at nearly the same location (along the central and eastern plateau of Inner Mongolia) in conjunction with a surface-level cold high-pressure system at the rear, albeit with differences in magnitude and spatial extent of impact. In the GD, the early melting of spring snow caused by near-surface temperature anomalies over dust source regions, together with negative soil moisture anomalies induced by decreased precipitation, formed drier and barer soil surfaces, which allowed for increased emissions of dust into the atmosphere by strongly enhanced surface winds generated by the Mongolian cyclone.

TI  - Development and parameter estimation of snowmelt models using spatial snow-cover observations from MODIS
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the importance of snow on different land and atmospheric processes, accurate representation of seasonal snow evolution, including distribution and melt volume, is highly imperative to any water resources development trajectories. The limitation of reliable snowmelt estimation in mountainous regions is, however, further exacerbated by data scarcity. This study attempts to develop relatively simple extended degree-day snow models driven by freely available snow-cover images. This approach offers relative simplicity and a plausible alternative to data-intensive models, as well as in situ measurements, and has a wide range of applicability, allowing for immediate verification with point measurements. The methodology employs readily available MODIS composite images to calibrate the snowmelt models on spatial snow distribution in contrast to the traditional snow-water-equivalent-based calibration. The spatial distribution of snow-cover is simulated using different extended degree-day models with parameters calibrated against individual MODIS snow-cover images for cloud-free days or a set of images representing a period within the snow season. The study was carried out in Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany) and in Switzerland. The simulated snow-cover data show very good agreement with MODIS snow-cover distribution, and the calibrated parameters exhibit relative stability across the time domain. Furthermore, different thresholds that demarcate snow and no-snow pixels for both observed and simulated snow cover were analyzed to evaluate these thresholds' influence on the model performance and identified for the study regions. The melt data from these calibrated snow models were used as standalone inputs to a modified Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) without the snow component in all the study catchments to assess the performance of the melt outputs in comparison to a calibrated standard HBV model. The results show an overall increase in Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) performance and a reduction in uncertainty in terms of model performance. This can be attributed to the reduction in the number of parameters available for calibration in the modified HBV and an added reliability of the snow accumulation and melt processes inherent in the MODIS calibrated snow model output. This paper highlights that the calibration using readily available images used in this method allows for a flexible regional calibration of snow-cover distribution in mountainous areas with reasonably accurate precipitation and temperature data and globally available inputs. Likewise, the study concludes that simpler specific alterations to processes contributing to snowmelt can contribute to reliably identify the snow distribution and bring about improvements in hydrological simulations, owing to better representation of the snow processes in snow-dominated regimes.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node metastasis diagnosis using ultrasound plus magnetic resonance lymphangiography in breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ultrasound diagnosis is a highly specific tool and widely applied, but is associated with low sensitivity in detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The diagnostic value of routine ultrasound combining magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) for the detection of SLNs in breast cancer metastasis is still unclear. This study used ultrasound combined with MRL to explore the diagnostic value of detecting SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Methods: This study included female breast cancer patients who received modified radical mastectomy at the Department of Breast Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between January 2016 and January 2019. The gold standard of SLNs is pathological results. The patients were divided into three groups: (I) Group A: an ultrasound plus MRL (contrast agent injected outside the areola) group; (II) Group B: an ultrasound plus MRL (contrast agent injection around the areola) group; and (III) Group C: an ultrasound plus MRL group (this group comprised patients from the two aforementioned groups). Results: A total of 432 patients were included. The overall detection rate and overall diagnostic accuracy of SLNs in breast cancer differed significantly among the three groups (all P<0.05). Ultrasound plus MRL showed a best overall detection rate 56.02%, and a best diagnostic accuracy 95.83%. The detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of axillary SLNs varied markedly among the three groups (P<0.05). The detection rate and diagnostic accuracy when the internal mammary node was the SLN differed notably between the ultrasound plus MRL (contrast agent injected outside the areola) and ultrasound plus MRL (contrast agent injection around the areola) groups and between the ultrasound plus MRL (contrast agent injection around the areola) and ultrasound plus MRL groups (all P<0.05). Conclusions: Ultrasound plus MRL may be advantageous for the detection of SLN metastasis in breast cancer and predicting breast cancer prognosis.

TI  - Systematic Pelvic and Para-Aortic Lymphadenectomy During Fertility-Sparing Surgery in Patients With Early-Stage Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: A Retrospective Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe implication of pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in surgical staging of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (eEOC) is still debated. Limited data are available about systematic lymphadenectomy during fertility-sparing surgery (FSS) in patients with eEOC. MethodsThe medical records of 38 patients with FIGO stage I EOC and below 40 years who underwent FSS at our hospital between January 2003 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsAmong them, 18 patients (47.4%) underwent comprehensive lymphadenectomy, 11 patients (28.9%) underwent lymph node sampling, and 9 patients (23.7%) did not undergo lymphadenectomy. There was no statically significant difference in age, histology, grade, surgical approach, chemotherapy, and gestation among the three groups. With a median follow-up of 52.5 months (range: 24-153), three patients (7.9%) with FIGO stage IC EOC developed tumor recurrence. In these patients, progress-free survival (PFS) was 92.1%, and overall survival (OS) was 94.7%. No significant difference in the OS. Three patients had among all the patients, 15 patients (39.5%) had gestation after treatment, and 23 patients (60.5%) did not have gestation after treatment. ConclusionThe number of lymph nodes removed did not significantly affect survival eEOC with FSS. Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy could not be performed for mucious eEOC patients with FSS if intraoperative freezing in confirmed and no suspicious lymph nodes are found. A better understanding of sentinel lymph node biopsy may help to identify whether the patient requires FSS.

TI  - Determination of the Hydrodynamic Characteristics of a Typical Inland Saline-Alkali Wetland in Northeast China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological connectivity in wetland ecosystems comprises a combination of hydrodynamic, hydrochemical, and biological characteristics. Hydrodynamic characteristics are important for the transmission of energy, matter, and information between surface water bodies and are critical for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems. The hydrodynamic characteristics of wetlands are the temporal and spatial changes in the water level, flow direction, quantity, recharge, and discharge conditions of surface water and groundwater. Identifying wetland hydrodynamic characteristics is of great significance in revealing the hydrological patterns and biogeochemical phenomena of wetland ecosystems. The Momoge National Nature Reserve (MNNR) is a wetland located in the semi-arid region of northeast China, where the hydrodynamic characteristics are still unclear. In this study, water level monitoring of surface water and groundwater in MNNR was carried out, and wetland recharge and discharge were calculated according to a water balance analysis. The submerged wetland area was simulated based on an improved distributed hydrological model, SWAT-DSF, and compared with remote sensing data. The results showed that the dynamic characteristics of wetland surface water and groundwater are mostly affected by topography and recharge water sources. The water resources in the reserve are in a positive state of equilibrium in the wet season (September), with an equilibrium difference of 276.41 x 10(4) m(3)/day. However, it displays a negative equilibrium state in dry (November) and other (June) seasons, with an equilibrium difference of -12.84 x 10(4) m(3)/day and -9.11 x 10(4) m(3)/d, respectively. The difference between the submerged areas of the MNNR wetland during the wet and dry seasons was 250 km(2).

TI  - Extracting Coastal Water Depths from Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) can be calculated using analytical or empirical approaches. Analytical approaches require several water properties and assumptions, which might not be known. Empirical approaches rely on the linear relationship between reflectances and in-situ depths, but the relationship may not be entirely linear due to bottom type variation, water column effect, and noise. Machine learning approaches have been used to address nonlinearity, but those treat pixels independently, while adjacent pixels are spatially correlated in depth. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can detect this characteristic of the local connectivity. Therefore, this paper conducts a study of SDB using CNN and compares the accuracies between different areas and different amounts of training data, i.e., single and multi-temporal images. Furthermore, this paper discusses the accuracies of SDB when a pre-trained CNN model from one or a combination of multiple locations is applied to a new location. The results show that the accuracy of SDB using the CNN method outperforms existing works with other methods. Multi-temporal images enhance the variety in the training data and improve the CNN accuracy. SDB computation using the pre-trained model shows several limitations at particular depths or when water conditions differ.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass of Wetland Vegetation Under Climate Change in the Western Songnen Plain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for investigating the wetland ecosystem carbon cycle. In this paper, we explored the spatiotemporal change of aboveground biomass and its response to climate change in a marsh wetland of western Songen Plain by using field measured AGB data and vegetation index derived from MODIS datasets. The results showed that the AGB could be established by the power function between measured AGB density and the annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax) of marsh: Y = 302.06 x NDVImax1.9817. The averaged AGB of marshes showed a significant increase of 2.04 g.C/m(2)/a, with an average AGB value of about 111.01 g.C/m(2) over the entire western Songnen Plain. For the influence of precipitation and temperature, we found that the annual mean temperature had a smaller effect on the distribution of marsh AGB than that of the total precipitation in the western Songnen Plain. Increased precipitation in summer and autumn would increase AGB by promoting marshes' vegetation growth. In addition, we found that the minimum temperature (T-min) and maximum temperatures (T-max) have an asymmetric effect on marsh AGB on the western Songnen Plain: warming T-max has a significant impact on AGB of marsh vegetation, while warming at night can non-significantly increase the AGB of marsh wetland. This research is expected to provide theoretical guidance for the restoration, protection, and adaptive management of wetland vegetation in the western Songnen Plain.

TI  - Uncertainty, reconstruction and resistance: young adults' responses to religious diversity in Spain and the UK
T2  - RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Young people in diverse societies routinely encounter worldviews different from their own, but we know relatively little about how these encounters affect them. This study investigated how young adults in Britain and Spain respond to encounters with other worldviews, focusing on whether and how their existing worldviews were affected. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants. Thematic and narrative analyses revealed three main responses: uncertainty, reconstruction and resistance. Encounters with alternative worldviews often led young people to feel uncertain about their own beliefs, particularly those which they understood to be contradicted by the alternative worldview. Reconstruction occurred when participants adopted elements of newly encountered worldviews to create an idiosyncratic religiosity or spirituality. Resistance captured those instances where participants dismissed alternative worldviews as epistemologically or morally problematic. The findings indicate that young people in the UK and Spain are responding in several distinct ways to religious diversity.

TI  - Carnosol, a diterpene present in rosemary, increases ELP1 levels in familial dysautonomia patient-derived cells and healthy adults: a possible therapy for FD
T2  - HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research on familial dysautonomia (FD) has focused on the development of therapeutics that facilitate the production of the correctly spliced, exon 20-containing, transcript in cells and individuals bearing the splice-altering, FD-causing mutation in the elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit I (ELP1) gene. We report here the ability of carnosol, a diterpene present in plant species of the Lamiaceae family, including rosemary, to enhance the cellular presence of the correctly spliced ELP1 transcript in FD patient-derived fibroblasts by upregulating transcription of the ELP1 gene and correcting the aberrant splicing of the ELP1 transcript. Carnosol treatment also elevates the level of the RNA binding motif protein 24 (RBM24) and RNA binding motif protein 38 (RBM38) proteins, two multifunctional RNA-binding proteins. Transfection-mediated expression of either of these RNA binding motif (RBMs) facilitates the inclusion of exon 20 sequence into the transcript generated from a minigene-bearing ELP1 genomic sequence containing the FD-causing mutation. Suppression of the carnosol-mediated induction of either of these RBMs, using targeting siRNAs, limited the carnosol-mediated inclusion of the ELP1 exon 20 sequence. Carnosol treatment of FD patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells facilitates the inclusion of exon 20 into the ELP1 transcript. The increased levels of the ELP1 and RBM38 transcripts and the alternative splicing of the sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) transcript, a sentinel for exon 20 inclusion in the FD-derived ELP1 transcript, are observed in RNA isolated from whole blood of healthy adults following the ingestion of carnosol-containing rosemary extract. These findings and the excellent safety profile of rosemary together justify an expedited clinical study of the impact of carnosol on the FD patient population.

TI  - Modelling inter-pixel spatial variation of surface urban heat island intensity
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) is a classical measure depicting urban heat island phenomenon via remotely sensed thermal infrared data. The most common approach is to compare urban and rural land surface temperatures (LST), which is not only sensitive to the selection of pixels/measurements representative of urban and rural areas, but also overlook the pixel-level intra-city SUHII variation and thermodynamics associated with heterogeneous urban landscape.Objectives This study develops a new S (UHIIe) over capn, via pixel-based sharpening enhancement method to integrate a pixel's LST magnitude that reflects a city's overall thermal context with its local SUHII that takes the landscape variations and cognate thermal interactions with neighboring pixels into account.Methods Using Guangzhou (south China) as a case study, S (UHIIe) over capn is constructed applying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST product for the summer season of 2015 through cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. The effectiveness of S (UHIIe) over capn is tested by comparing S (UHIIe) over capn results (based on 3 x 3, 5 x 5 and 7 x 7 kernels) with the original LST, a two-dimensional Gaussian surface, and Gaussian density curve with stepwise increments of the thermal influence from neighboring pixels on the center pixels.Results We found that (1) local SUHII variations are sensitive to the spatial composition of a center pixel's land use type and that of its eight neighbors; (2) S (UHIIe) over capn makes more pronounced those spots that are not only heat per se (with higher original LST), but also receive additional heat load emitted from directly adjacent pixels due to land use homogeneity; (3) the effectiveness of S (UHIIe) over capn could be successfully verified.Conclusions This new SUHI indicator accounts for inter-pixel spatial variation of UHI and highlights how neighboring pixels' homogeneous/heterogeneous land use and associated thermal properties could affect center pixels' thermal characteristics via either reinforcement or mitigation of heat load. It contributes to rigorous assessment of potential heat risks at micro-pixel scale and tailored design of mitigation strategies.

TI  - What is the relationship between land use and surface water quality? A review and prospects from remote sensing perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Good surface water quality is critical to human health and ecology. Land use determines the surface water heat and material balance, which cause climate change and affect water quality. There are many factors affecting water quality degradation, and the process of influence is complex. As rivers, lakes, and other water bodies are used as environmental receiving carriers, evaluating and quantifying how impacts occur between land use types and surface water quality is extremely important. Based on the summary of published studies, we can see that (1) land use for agricultural and construction has a negative impact on surface water quality, while woodland use has a certain degree of improvement on surface water quality; (2) statistical methods used in relevant research mainly include correlation analysis, regression analysis, redundancy analysis, etc. Different methods have their own advantages and limitations; (3) in recent years, remote sensing monitoring technology has developed rapidly, and has developed into an effective tool for comprehensive water quality assessment and management. However, the increase in spatial resolution of remote sensing data has been accompanied by a surge in data volume, which has caused difficulties in information interpretation and other aspects.

TI  - Estimating Lake Water Volume With Regression and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The volume of a lake is a crucial component in understanding environmental and hydrologic processes. The State of Minnesota (USA) has tens of thousands of lakes, but only a small fraction has readily available bathymetric information. In this paper we develop and test methods for predicting water volume in the lake-rich region of Central Minnesota. We used three different published regression models for predicting lake volume using available data. The first model utilized lake surface area as the sole independent variable. The second model utilized lake surface area but also included an additional independent variable, the average change in land surface area in a designated buffer area surrounding a lake. The third model also utilized lake surface area but assumed the land surface to be a self-affine surface, thus allowing the surface area-lake volume relationship to be governed by a scale defined by the Hurst coefficient. These models all utilized bathymetric data available for 816 lakes across the region of study. The models explained over 80% of the variation in lake volumes. The sum difference between the total predicted lake volume and known volumes were <2%. We applied these models to predicting lake volumes using available independent variables for over 40,000 lakes within the study region. The total lake volumes for the methods ranged from 1,180,000- and 1,200,000-hectare meters. We also investigated machine learning models for estimating the individual lake volumes and found they achieved comparable and slightly better predictive performance than from the three regression analysis methods. A 15-year time series of satellite data for the study region was used to develop a time series of lake surface areas and those were used, with the first regression model, to calculate individual lake volumes and temporal variation in the total lake volume of the study region. The time series of lake volumes quantified the effect on water volume of a dry period that occurred from 2011 to 2012. These models are important both for estimating lake volume, but also provide critical information for scaling up different ecosystem processes that are sensitive to lake bathymetry.

TI  - Detecting the Spatial Mismatch of Water Resources and Grain Planting Pattern Changes in China Based on Satellite Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - China has achieved sustained growth in grain production and significant changes in grain patterns since the early 21st century. Meanwhile, the contradiction between the shortage of water resources and the development of agriculture is becoming more and more severe. This study introduced Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity satellite Total Water Storage (TWS) Product to indicate total water storage and calculated the Cumulated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (CNDVI) of cropland as an indicator for grain growth. Based on the continuous satellite data, this paper revealed the spatial mismatch between water resources supply and grain growth pattern in China. The center of gravity of the CNDVI tends to move northwest, while the GRACE TWS data's center of gravity is in the opposite direction. There were different relationships between GRACE-TWS and CNDVI changes in different zones. We calculated the pixel-wise spatial Pearson Correlation coefficients of TWS and CNDVI. The TWS data and CNDVI data show negative correlation trends in the water-limited areas such as the northern arid-semiarid region and northern China plain, while they show a positive correlation in relatively sufficient water resources in southeast China. According to the results, the changing pattern of grain production in China is likely to cause the depletion of grain production potential in the water-limited regions, while the southeastern regions with higher potential still have more capacity for agricultural production.

TI  - Assessing the impact of land use land cover change on regulatory ecosystem services of subtropical scrub forest, Soan Valley Pakistan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the effect of land use land cover (LULC) changes on carbon sequestration in the Hayat-ul-Mir subtropical scrub reserve forest, Pakistan. Supervised maximum likelihood classification of Landsat satellite imagery was done to assess spatio-temporal changes in LULC during 2007, 2013 and 2019. The CA-Markov model was used to simulate LULC of 2030. Spatial LULC data and carbon pools data was processed in Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) carbon model to investigate the effect of LULC on future carbon dynamics. The analysis revealed increase in cover of A. modesta and O. ferruginea and decrease in agriculture, built up and barren area of forest during 2007-2019 and 2030. The analysis also showed that the forest would additionally sequester 111 Mg C with an overall Net Present Value of $4112.05 in year 2030. The analysis revealed LULC changes on 25% area with increase and decrease in the value of ecosystem service (at some location) from carbon storage and loss as CO2 emissions respectively depending on the type of LULC converted. The study is helpful in identifying areas of potential carbon sequestration to maximize net benefits from management interventions.

TI  - Combined Adjustment Pipeline for Improved Global Geopositioning Accuracy of Optical Satellite Imagery With the Aid of SAR and GLAS
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the widespread availability of multiple remote sensing methods, regions are often covered by satellite observation from multiple sources. However, the geometric positioning accuracy of optical satellites, which is the most common data source, is generally insufficient. An intuitive idea to improve accuracy is to integrate the dominant accuracy of multisource information. Previous articles have used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and geoscience laser altimetry system (GLAS) data with improved geopositioning accuracy. However, the accuracy and applicability of existing combination methods are unsatisfactory because of various restrictions. In this article, a pipeline with automatic extraction of tie points and combined adjustment was designed based on nonstereo SAR images and GLAS data, considering both the high precision and wide distribution of multisource data. Experiments using real satellite data (ZY-3, GF-7, GF-3, and ICESat-2) and test areas covering complex landforms demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. The geopositioning accuracy in three experimental areas reached 3.16, 3.36, and 3.17 m in the horizontal direction and 1.45, 1.25, and 1.28 m in the vertical direction. Our pipeline not only permits high accuracy close to the nominal accuracy of heterogeneous reference data but can also be extended to global high-precision geopositioning without ground control.

TI  - The Influence of Sub-Footprint Cloudiness on Three-Dimensional Horizontal Wind From Geostationary Hyperspectral Infrared Sounder Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiance measurements from a geostationary hyperspectral infrared sounder (GeoHIS) with high temporal resolution not only provide a continuous weather cube of atmospheric temperature and moisture information at different pressure levels, but also enable derivation of three-dimensional (3D) horizontal winds by tracking atmospheric water vapor features. However, GeoHIS radiances are influenced by sub-footprint cloudiness, which needs to be considered in tracking the moisture features for deriving the atmospheric wind fields. By combining the collocated high spatial resolution cloud information from an imager onboard the same platform, the 3D horizontal wind retrievals can be improved, and the influence of sub-footprint cloudiness on winds can be quantified for better applications. Using data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) and Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder onboard the same experimental geostationary satellite Fengyun-4A, it is found that 3D horizontal wind retrievals can be derived under both clear and partially clear skies with reasonable accuracy. Sub-footprint cloud information provides noticeable improvement in wind retrievals; higher/lower clouds have more/less influence while thicker/thinner clouds have more/less influence, respectively, on the wind product. The sub-footprint cloudiness (cloud-top pressure and cloud coverage) provides a good indication of the quality flag for quantitative applications of the 3D horizontal wind product.

TI  - Application of UAV Remote Sensing in Monitoring Water Use Efficiency and Biomass of Cotton Plants Adjacent to Shelterbelt
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree shelterbelts are crucial for maintaining the ecological environment of oasis, but they may also compete for soil water with adjacent crops, affecting crop yields. To evaluate the impacts of the shelterbelt on water use efficiency (WUE) and normalized water productivity (WP) of adjacent cotton plants, the biomass (B) and WUE of cotton with different distances from the shelterbelt (0.1H, 0.5H, 1H, 2H, and 3H; average tree height = 15 m [H]) were estimated based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data combined with the FAO crop water response model AquaCrop. Besides, the accuracy and universality of the estimation method were also evaluated. The results showed that the method based on UAV remote sensing data and AquaCrop can accurately estimate the impact range and intensity of shelterbelt on WUE, water consumption, and B of adjacent cotton plants. Fierce water competition between shelterbelt and cotton was detected within 0.1H-1H, and the competitiveness of the shelterbelt was weaker in the plots >1H than in the 0.1H-1H. The B, actual evapotranspiration (T-c), and WUE of cotton at 0.1H decreased by 59.3, 48.8, and 23.6%, respectively, compared with those at 3H, but the cotton plants at 2H and 3H were completely unaffected by the shelterbelt. Besides, the B estimated based on WP (root mean square error [RMSE] = 108 g/m(2), d = 0.89) was more accurate than that estimated based on WUE (RMSE = 118 g/m(2), d = 0.85). This study clarifies the inter-species competition for soil water between crops and shelterbelts under drip irrigation in oases in China.

TI  - Rainbow of the Night: First Direct Observation of a SAR Arc Evolving Into STEVE
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 17 March 2015 geomagnetic storm, citizen scientist observations from Dunedin (45.95 degrees S, 170.32 degrees E), New Zealand, revealed a bright wide red arc known as stable auroral red (SAR) arc evolving into a thin white-mauve arc, known as Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE). An all-sky imager at the Mount John Observatory (43.99 degrees S, 170.46 degrees E), 200 km north of Dunedin, detected an extremely bright arc in 630.0 nm, with a peak of similar to 6 kR, colocated with the arc measured at Dunedin at an assumed height of 425 km. Swarm satellite data measured plasma parameters that showed strong subauroral ion drift signatures when the SAR arc was observed. These conditions intensified to extremely high values in a thinner channel when STEVE was present. Our results highlight the fast evolution of plasma properties and their effects on optical emissions. Current theories and models are unable to reproduce or explain these observations.

TI  - The Influence of Dust-Smoke Mixtures on Boundary Layer Processes and Nocturnal Warming in the Sahel
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a single column model with ground-based, aircraft, and satellite data sets we assess the combined role of smoke and dust aerosols, land degradation/aridization (LDA), and their impact on the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in influencing near-surface air temperature over the Sahel. Our study is unique because it assesses the combined role of smoke and dust aerosols on PBL evolution and near-surface air temperatures during both day and nighttime. More importantly, using a theoretical framework, we provide a careful explanation of the geophysical processes responsible for the changes in PBL and near-surface air temperature. Our results indicate that during northern hemisphere winter months, dust, and smoke over Sahel radiatively combine to impact the PBL. We show that aerosol mixtures dominated by dust modify PBL height in a manner that minimizes/maximizes surface layer cooling/warming at times when daytime maximum/nocturnal minimum temperatures occur. Furthermore, we find that increasing smoke contribution to total column aerosol optical extinction counteracts nighttime warming through daytime cooling. When smoke constitutes half or more of to the total column aerosol optical extinction, the ratio of longwave to shortwave radiative forcing is less than 10%, and nighttime cooling ensues. Minimum temperature is most sensitive to changes in mid-visible aerosol optical depth (AOD) values <1 and doubling of dust AOD within this range during the 1950-1980 Sahelian LDA event is estimated to have a nocturnal warming potential of 0.6 degrees C.

TI  - Predicting Microscale Land Use/Land Cover Changes Using Cellular Automata Algorithm on the Northwest Coast of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing intervention from high-rise infrastructural development in the urban fabric threatens the land use/land cover (LULC) of the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Predicting future scenarios of LULC on a microscale level can help to curb rapid urbanization in Malaysia and promote sustainability. This study aims to appraise the ability of the Support Vector Machine and Cellular Automata (CA) algorithms to monitor (2005-2020) and predict (2025 and 2035) the future LULC change in Penang, Malaysia. Landsat images were used to estimate LULC classes, and Pearson chi-square values were calculated to validate the CA model. The results revealed that Penang had experienced a significant increase in built-up areas by 15.56%, resulting from the declination of the forest by 5.57%, agricultural land by 8.41% and waterbody by 1.58% between 2005 and 2020. The predicted LULC result suggests that approximately 4.68% of agricultural land, 2.77% of the forest, and 1.03% of the water bodies will transform into built-up lands by 2035. The study signifies the urgent control of urban growth patterns and assists urban planners and policymakers of Malaysian cities in ensuring sustainable urban development.

TI  - Girls, gold, and gods: perverted individualism and heightened secularism in O'Neill's <i>Desire Under the Elms</i>
T2  - COMPARATIVE LITERATURE-EAST & WEST
M3  - Article
AB  - Beyond the archetypalian themes and motifs such as chauvinism, family dysfunctions and conflicts, Nietzschean and Freudian elements, Desire Under the Elms was a critique of America's brands of individualist and secularist ideologies. Spreading in the US at the time was a faulty form of individualism which continues to affect and permeate other parts of the world through cultural imperialism. Concomitant with perverted self-reliance was a growing secularist worldview that was challenging established religion, as if demanding freedom from hundreds of years of clout from Calvinist Christianity. In this article, I will emphasize that the drama captured an increased preference for an extreme form of individualism that was going wayward, juxtaposed with the movement toward secularization before and during the early 1900s. Further, I will highlight that these twin ideologies underpin the three major themes in the award-winning drama: the peripheralization, objectification, and often negative portrayal of women, the obsession over possessions and of persons, and the rejection of religion.

TI  - Statistical considerations of nonrandom treatment applications reveal region-wide benefits of widespread post-fire restoration action
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Postfire sagebrush seeding treatments are widely applied across the western USA but evidence for the success of this restoration approach has been variable. Examining >1500 wildfires, this study shows that positive treatment effects were only detected after considering systematic differences between treated and untreated sites due to effects of selection biases in restoration.Accurate predictions of ecological restoration outcomes are needed across the increasingly large landscapes requiring treatment following disturbances. However, observational studies often fail to account for nonrandom treatment application, which can result in invalid inference. Examining a spatiotemporally extensive management treatment involving post-fire seeding of declining sagebrush shrubs across semiarid areas of the western USA over two decades, we quantify drivers and consequences of selection biases in restoration using remotely sensed data. From following more than 1,500 wildfires, we find treatments were disproportionately applied in more stressful, degraded ecological conditions. Failure to incorporate unmeasured drivers of treatment allocation led to the conclusion that costly, widespread seedings were unsuccessful; however, after considering sources of bias, restoration positively affected sagebrush recovery. Treatment effects varied with climate, indicating prioritization criteria for interventions. Our findings revise the perspective that post-fire sagebrush seedings have been broadly unsuccessful and demonstrate how selection biases can pose substantive inferential hazards in observational studies of restoration efficacy and the development of restoration theory.

TI  - Robotic Staging of Cervical Cancer With Simultaneous Detection of Primary Pelvic and Secondary Para-Aortic Sentinel Lymph Nodes: Reproducibility in a First Case Series
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Discrepancies exist among international guidelines on the surgical staging of para-aortic lymph nodes in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), varying from considering a para-aortic lymph node dissection, at least up to the inferior mesenteric artery, to a complete para-aortic lymph node dissection. In this study, we aim to assess the reproducibility of our recently reported robotic technique using indocyanine green for identifying besides primary pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), secondary para-aortic SLNs in a first case-cohort of cervical cancer patients.Methods: A retrospective case series of LACC patients with/without suspicious pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) on imaging (including two patients with an additional suspicious para-aortic LN) is reported. All patients underwent a robotic pelvic SLN and paraaortic sentinel/nonsentinel LN dissection using the da Vinci Xi platform. Indocyanine green was used as a fluorescent tracer, at a concentration of 1.9 mg/mL, and injected as 0.5 mL in each quadrant of the cervix.Results: In a total of 10 cases, primary pelvic SLNs (90% bilateral) with subsequent secondary para-aortic SLNs were identified in all cases. Lower para-aortic SLNs were present in all cases, and upper para-aortic SLNs were found in 9 out of 10 cases. The mean age of the cervical cancer patients was 49.8 years (SD +/- 6.89), and the mean body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) was 23.96 (SD +/- 4.60). The median total operative time was 105.5 min (range: 89-141 min). The mean numbers of primary pelvic SLNs and secondary lower and upper para-aortic SLNs were 3.10 (SD +/- 1.10), 2.90 (SD +/- 0.74), and 2.30 (SD +/- 1.57), respectively. The median number of total para-aortic LNs (PALNs) dissected per patient was 11.5. Six patients had positive primary pelvic SLNs, and two had secondary positive para-aortic SLNs. The nonsentinel para-aortic LNs were negative in all cases. There were no intra- or postoperative complications.Conclusion: Our preliminary experience demonstrates the reproducibility of identifying, besides primary pelvic SLNs, secondary lower and upper para-aortic SLNs during robotic staging in LACC. A surgical approach limiting a complete para-aortic LN dissection could reduce the potential risks and morbidity associated with this procedure. To determine the sensitivity and negative predictive value of this new surgical approach, and whether the lower para-aortic SLNs under the inferior mesenteric artery are representative of the whole para-aortic region, large prospective observational studies are needed in LACC and/or those with suspicious pelvic LNs but apparent normal para-aortic LNs on imaging.

TI  - Goals of chaplaincy care: a scoping review of Dutch literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE CHAPLAINCY
M3  - Review
AB  - A substantial number of (mostly health care) chaplaincy articles have emphasized the need for chaplaincy outcome research. In this study, we contribute to formulating intrinsic chaplaincy outcomes by first identifying chaplaincy goals. To this end, we have performed a scoping review of Dutch chaplaincy literature. We have focused on articles, books, and dissertations published between 2014 and 2019. Six distinct goals of chaplaincy were identified, using 86 fragments found in 33 sources: worldview vitality and plausibility, processing life events, deepening spirituality, relational affirmation, well-being, and exercising freedom of religion. Several of these main goals could be subdivided into more specific goals. Future research is needed to examine whether the found goals apply equally within the different types of chaplaincy and to examine their interrelations. In addition, future research should examine how these goals are pursued in practice and how they relate to client needs.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach to Extract Internal Tides Scattered by Geostrophic Turbulence
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A proper extraction of internal tidal signals is central to the interpretation of Sea Surface Height (SSH) data. The increased spatial resolution of future wide-swath satellite missions poses a challenge for traditional harmonic analysis, due to prominent and unsteady wave-mean interactions at finer scales. However, the wide swaths will also produce SSH snapshots that are spatially two-dimensional, which allows us to treat tidal extraction as an image translation problem. We design and train a conditional Generative Adversarial Network, which, given a snapshot of raw SSH from an idealized numerical eddying simulation, generates a snapshot of the embedded tidal component. We test it on data whose dynamical regimes are different from the data provided during training. Despite the diversity and complexity of data, it accurately extracts tidal components in most individual snapshots considered and reproduces physically meaningful statistical properties. Predictably, Toronto Internal Tide Emulator's performance decreases with the intensity of the turbulent flow.

TI  - Role of Cloud Subgrid-Scale Structure in Modulating Clouds Viewed by ISCCP, MODIS, and MISR Simulators
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of cloud subgrid-scale structure in modulating satellite views of clouds was investigated. This was realized by implementing a stochastic cloud generator into the CFMIP (Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project) Observation Simulator Package together with surrogate clouds produced by a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The subgrid-scale structural parameters are decorrelation length for overlapping cloud fraction (L-cf), decorrelation length for overlapping cloud condensate (L-cw), and the shape parameter v for measuring cloud inhomogeneity. With the use of median values of L-cf, L-cw, and v derived from CRM, the simulated satellite views bear close resemblance to those using CRM-inherent clouds. Varying these parameters in the range of lower and upper quartiles leads to differences that are about one-fifth of those caused by changing cloud microphysics in CRM. While L-cf influences clouds throughout the whole troposphere, L-cw and v result in changes mostly within the upper layers. Increasing (decreasing) cloud inhomogeneity or overlapping degree leads to decreased (increased) occurrence of clouds, except for high-topped clouds viewed by Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer. Care must then be exercised when interpreting model biases in comparison with different instruments. Sensitivity tests show changing condensate distribution from gamma to lognormal makes little impact on final results. Although the differences induced by any of the parameters alone are much limited, they are getting comparable to those seen between models and observations when all parameters are synergistically altered. This brings encouraging results to the modeling community that simulator-diagnosed clouds can be potentially improved by tuning cloud subgrid-scale parameters.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Breast Cancer: Initial Experience of a Multidisciplinary Team
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women; it is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the United States with a lifetime risk of dying of about 3.4%. Regional lymph node involvement is quite early in breast carcinoma and axillary lymph node metastasis is an important predictor of recurrence and survival, particularly in invasive ductal histology of breast carcinoma. localization of sentinel lymph node/nodes followed by frozen section and histopathological evaluation helps to prevent unnecessary axillary nodal dissection and, hence, reduces associated post-surgical morbidity. Sentinel nodes are the first ones to receive lymph-borne metastatic cells and, hence, lymphoscintigraphy followed by biopsy is quite reliable to detect nodal metastasis, particularly at an early stage (I, II) of breast cancer.Methods: Here we will share our experience of introducing procedure, personnel training, and workflow of sentinel lymph node lymphoscintigraphy in breast cancer patients at our cancer institute to help other centers establish programs for this study.Results: Initially, 10 procedures were performed, all of which were successful in the localization of sentinel nodes and played a substantial part in the surgical planning of breast cancer. Planar lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)-CT images of our first patient revealed radiotracer avidity in the lymph node in the ipsilateral axilla, which was later on diagnosed as metastatic resulting in axillary nodal clearance.Conclusions: In multidisciplinary/closely-placed surgical, pathological, and hybrid imaging facility settings, lymphoscintigraphy provides a quick, accurate, and better way of nodal localization leading to correct surgical decision-making. In addition to planar imaging, SPECT-CT acquisition significantly improves the specificity of the lymphoscintigraphy procedure, which is beneficial for patients to avoid false-positive results, thus saving breast cancer patients from potential adverse effects of surgery.

TI  - Short-time-series grassland mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery and deep learning-based architecture
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, a deep learning-based network called LeNet is applied for accurate grassland map production from Sentinel-2 data for the Greater Sydney region, Australia. First, we apply the technique to the base date Sentinel-2 data (non-seasonal) to make the vegetation maps. Then, we combine short time-series (seasonal) data and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) information to the base date imagery to improve the classification results and generate high-resolution grassland maps. The proposed model obtained an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.36% for the mono-temporal data, and 92.74% for the multi-temporal data. The experimental products proved that, by combining the short time-series images and EVI information to the base date, the classification maps' accuracy is increased by 4.38%. Moreover, the Sentinel-2 produced grassland maps are compared with the pre-existing maps such as Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) 50 m resolution and Dynamic Land Cover Dataset (DLCD) with 250 m resolution as well as some traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The results show the effect of the LeNet network's performance and efficiency for grassland map production from short time-series data. As a result, decision-makers and urban planners can benefit from this work in terms of grassland change identification, monitoring, and planning assessment.

TI  - Correlation dispersion as a measure to better estimate uncertainty in remotely sensed glacier displacements
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years a vast amount of glacier surface velocity data from satellite imagery has emerged based on correlation between repeat images. Thereby, much emphasis has been put on the fast processing of large data volumes and products with complete spatial coverage. The metadata of such measurements are often highly simplified when the measurement precision is lumped into a single number for the whole dataset, although the error budget of image matching is in reality neither isotropic nor constant over the whole velocity field. The spread of the correlation peak of individual image offset measurements is dependent on the image structure and the non-uniform flow of the ice and is used here to extract a proxy for measurement uncertainty. A quantification of estimation error or dispersion for each individual velocity measurement can be important for the inversion of, for instance, rheology, ice thickness and/or bedrock friction. Errors in the velocity data can propagate into derived results in a complex and exaggerating way, making the outcomes very sensitive to velocity noise and outliers. Here, we present a computationally fast method to estimate the matching precision of individual displacement measurements from repeat imaging data, focusing on satellite data. The approach is based upon Gaussian fitting directly on the correlation peak and is formulated as a linear least-squares estimation, making its implementation into current pipelines straightforward. The methodology is demonstrated for Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbr AE), Greenland, a glacier with regions of strong shear flow and with clearly oriented crevasses, and Malaspina Glacier, Alaska. Directionality within an image seems to be the dominant factor influencing the correlation dispersion. In our cases these are crevasses and moraine bands, while a relation to differential flow, such as shear, is less pronounced on the correlation spread.

TI  - Indocyanine green-guided sentinel lymph node mapping during laparoscopic surgery with vaginal cuff closure but no uterine manipulator for cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymph node metastasis is a critical prognostic factor in cervical cancer. Considering the potential complications of lymphadenectomy and desirability of avoiding systemic lymphadenectomy, accurate intraoperative prediction of the existence of lymph node metastasis is important in patients undergoing surgery for cervical cancer. We evaluated the feasibility and value of indocyanine green (ICG) use for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping during laparoscopic surgery performed for cervical cancer. Methods This single-center cohort study included 77 patients undergoing a new laparoscopic radical surgery method with pelvic lymphadenectomy for early-stage cervical cancer. The surgery, performed without using a uterine manipulator, included creation of a vaginal cuff. Bilateral ICG-guided SLN mapping and rapid histopathological examination were performed, and results were analyzed in relation to final histopathologic diagnoses. Results The SLN pelvic side-specific detection rate was 93.5%, sensitivity (SLN-positive cases/SLN-detected pelvic lymph node-positive cases) was 100%, intraoperative negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.8%, and final pathological NPV was 100%. The detection rate was significantly lower for tumors >= 2 cm in diameter than for tumors < 2 cm in diameter. Micrometastases were missed by intraoperative examination in 3 cases. Conclusion The high NPV suggests the feasibility and usefulness of ICG-based SLN mapping plus rapid intraoperative examination for identification of metastatic SLNs. Use of ICG-based mapping for intraoperative identification of SLNs in patients undergoing this new laparoscopic surgery method for early-stage cervical cancer was particularly effective for tumors < 2 cm in diameter. However, incorporating a search for micrometastases into rapid intraoperative histopathologic examination may be necessary.

TI  - Landsat time series reveal forest loss and woody encroachment in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) of Tanzania, is globally significant for biodiversity conservation due to the presence of iconic fauna, and, since 1959 has been managed as a unique multiple land-use areas to mutually benefit wildlife and indigenous residents. Understating vegetation dynamics and ongoing land cover change processes in protected areas is important to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable development. However, land cover changes in savannahs are especially difficult, as changes are often long-term and subtle. Here, we demonstrate a Landsat-based monitoring strategy incorporating (i) regression-based unmixing for the accurate mapping of the fraction of the different land cover types, and (ii) a combination of linear regression and the BFAST trend break analysis technique for mapping and quantifying land cover changes. Using Google Earth Pro and the EnMap-Box software, the fractional cover of the main land cover types of the NCA were accurately mapped for the first time, namely bareland, bushland, cropland, forest, grassland, montane heath, shrubland, water and woodland. Our results show that the main changes occurring in the NCA are the degradation of upland forests into bushland: we exemplify this with a case study in the Lerai Forest; and found declines in grassland and co-incident increases in shrubland in the Serengeti Plains, suggesting woody encroachment. These changes threaten the wellbeing of livestock, the livelihoods of resident pastoralists and of the wildlife dependent on these grazing areas. Some of the land cover changes may be occurring naturally and caused by herbivory, rainfall patterns and vegetation succession, but many are linked to human activity, specifically, management policies, tourism development and the increase in human population and livestock. Our study provides for the first time much needed and highly accurate information on long-term land cover changes in the NCA that can support the sustainable management and conservation of this unique UNESCO World Heritage Site.

TI  - Sentinel Cards Provide Practical SARS-CoV-2 Monitoring in School Settings
T2  - MSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A promising approach to help students safely return to in person learning is through the application of sentinel cards for accurate high resolution environmental monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 traces indoors. Because SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist for up to a week on several indoor surface materials, there is a need for increased temporal resolution to determine whether consecutive surface positives arise from new infection events or continue to report past events. Cleaning sentinel cards after sampling would provide the needed resolution but might interfere with assay performance. We tested the effect of three cleaning solutions (BZK wipes, Wet Wipes, RNase Away) at three different viral loads: "high" (4 x 10(4) GE/mL), "medium" (1 x 10(4) GE/mL), and "low" (2.5 x 10(3) GE/mL). RNase Away, chosen as a positive control, was the most effective cleaning solution on all three viral loads. Wet Wipes were found to be more effective than BZK wipes in the medium viral load condition. The low viral load condition was easily reset with all three cleaning solutions. These findings will enable temporal SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in indoor environments where transmission risk of the virus is high and the need to avoid individual-level sampling for privacy or compliance reasons exists.IMPORTANCE Because SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, persists on surfaces, testing swabs taken from surfaces is useful as a monitoring tool. This approach is especially valuable in school settings, where there are cost and privacy concerns that are eliminated by taking a single sample from a classroom. However, the virus persists for days to weeks on surface samples, so it is impossible to tell whether positive detection events on consecutive days are a persistent signal or new infectious cases and therefore whether the positive individuals have been successfully removed from the classroom. We compare several methods for cleaning "sentinel cards" to show that this approach can be used to identify new SARS-CoV-2 signals day to day. The results are important for determining how to monitor classrooms and other indoor environments for SARS-CoV-2 virus.

TI  - Canopy defoliation by leaf-cutting ants in eucalyptus plantations inferred by unsupervised machine learning applied to remote sensing
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Defoliation by leaf-cutting ants alters the physiological processes of plants, and this defoliation can be inferred from satellite imagery used to identify plant injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the spectral pattern of defoliation by leaf-cutting ants in eucalyptus plants on a pixel level using unsupervised machine learning techniques applied to remote sensing by satellites. The study was carried out in a eucalyptus plantation in the municipality of Telemaco Borba, Parana state, Brazil. The nests of leaf-cutting ants were located and georeferenced. Multispectral images were obtained from the Sentinel-2 (S-2) and planet scope (PS) satellites. The response variables were the RGB-NIR bands and four vegetation indices (VIs). The data obtained from these bands and vegetation indices was separated in an unsupervised method by the k-medoids clustering algorithm and input into a Random Forest (RF) model. The significance of the models was tested with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). The k-medoids algorithm classified the spectral response of the RGB-NIR and VIs bands into two main factors of variation in the tree canopy. The models selected were 1200 trees and 6 variables for the S2 satellite (accuracy = 97.74 +/- 0.040%) and 900 trees and 5 variables for the PS (accuracy = 97.42 +/- 0.026%). The unsupervised machine learning technique, applied to remote sensing, was effective to map defoliation caused by leaf-cutting ants, and this approach can be used in precision agriculture for pest management purposes.

TI  - Remote sensing of field-scale irrigation withdrawals in the central Ogallala aquifer region
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For agricultural areas facing water scarcity, sustainable water use policy relies on irrigation information that is timely and at a high resolution, but existing publicly available water use data are often insufficient for monitoring compliance or understanding the influence of policy on individual farmer decisions. This study attempts to fill this data gap by using remote sensing to map annual irrigation quantity at the field-scale within the central Ogallala aquifer region of the United States. We compiled in situ annual irrigation volume data at the field scale in the Republican River Basin of Colorado for 2015-2018 and at the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section scale in western Kansas for 2000-2016, which served as reference data in random forest models that relied on Landsat-based actual evapotranspiration from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance model (SSEBop) along with maps of irrigated area, Landsat spectral indices, climate, soils, and derived hydrologic variables. The models explained 87% of the variability in irrigation volume in Colorado and 75% in Kansas, but accuracy declined when transferring the models in spatial cross-validation (Colorado R2 =0.81; Kansas R2 =0.51) and temporal cross-validation (Colorado R2 =0.82; Kansas R2 =0.68). Predicted annual totals of irrigation volume in western Kansas had a mean absolute error of 11.9%, which was slightly higher than the average annual change of 11%. Use of predicted irrigation maps also lead to an underestimated effect size for a water use restriction policy in Kansas. These results indicate that field- and section-scale irrigation can be mapped with reasonable accuracy within a region and time period that has adequate sample data, but that methods may need to be improved for applying the models more broadly in areas that lack extensive in situ irrigation data to support further research on water use and aid in structuring policy.

TI  - Moving wildlife tracking forward under forested conditions with the SWIFT GPS algorithm
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote collection of animal location data has proliferated in recent decades, and higher-frequency data are increasingly available with battery-saving optimisations such as 'snapshot' algorithms that acquire GPS satellite data and post-process locations off-board. This is the first study to assess the effects of vegetation and topography on the fix success rate and location error of global positioning system (GPS) devices that use the SWIFT fix algorithm, developed by Lotek. To assess fix success rate (FSR-the proportion of successful fixes compared to the total number of attempts) and location error (LE), we conducted a stationary test at a predominately forested site on the South Island of New Zealand. The overall FSR was 83% (+/- 15.3% SD), which was affected strongly by canopy closure above 90%. Half of the locations were within 8.65 m of the true location, 79.7% were within 30 m, and 95% of locations were within 271 m. When 6 or more satellites were used, this reduced to 4.92 m and 18.6 m for 50% and 95%, respectively. Horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP), the number of satellites, and canopy closure all influenced location error. To field test the fix success rate of SWIFT GPS devices, we deployed them on forest-dwelling parrots with 2 and 3-h fix intervals, which showed similar FSR results to the stationary test when cavity-nesting individuals were removed (FSR mean +/- SD = 81.6 +/- 5.0%). The devices lasted an average of 147 days before depleting the battery, resulting in an average of 1087 successful fixes per individual at an average time of 9.38 s to acquire the GPS ephemeris, resulting in an average of 3.73 attempted locations per mAh of battery for PinPoint 350 devices. Our study provides a baseline for fix success rates and location errors under forested conditions that can be used for future SWIFT GPS tracking studies.

TI  - The converging paradigms of holism and complexity: An exploration of naturopathic clinical case management using complexity science principles
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale Traditional whole systems of medicine, such as naturopathy, are founded upon holism; a philosophical paradigm consistent with contemporary complexity science. Naturopathic case management is predicated upon the understanding of an intimately interconnected internal physiological and external context of the human organism-potentially indicating a worldview aligned with a complexity perspective. In this study we investigate naturopathic clinical reasoning using a complexity lens with the aim of ascertaining the extent of correspondence between the two. Method Mind maps depicting case presentations were sought from Australian degree qualified naturopaths. A network mapping was undertaken, which was then analysed in accordance with a complexity science framework using exploratory data analysis and network analysis processes and tools. Results Naturopathic case schematics, in the form of mind maps (n = 70), were collected, network mapped, and analysed. A total of 739 unique elements and 2724 links were identified across the network. Integral elements across the network were: stress, fatigue, general anxiety, systemic inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and diet. A modularity algorithm detected 11 communities, the primary ones of these representing the nervous system and mood; the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and nutrition; immune function and the immune system; and diet and nutrients. Conclusions Naturopathic case management is holistic and based on a perspective of an integrated physiology and external context of the human organism. The traditional concept of holism, when subjected to a complexity lens, leads to the emergence of a contemporary holistic paradigm cognisant of the human organism being a complex system. The application of complexity science to investigate naturopathic case management as employed in this study, demonstrates that it is possible to investigate traditional philosophies and principles in a scientific and critical manner. A complexity science research approach may offer a suitable scientific paradigm to develop our understanding of traditional whole systems of medicine.

TI  - Sequence-Selected C<sub>13</sub>-Dipeptide Self-Assembled Hydrogels for Encapsulation of Lemon Essential Oil with Antibacterial Activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Supramolecular self-assembling peptide hydrogels are attracting attention. The switching of even one amino acid may lead to differences in structure and functions of peptide hydrogels. Herein, we investigate the effect of substitution of a single amino acid residue on the gelation properties of C-13-dipeptide hydrogels. We show that four C-13-R1Y (C-13-VY, C-13-FY, C-13-WY, and C-13-YY) can form hydrogels with drastically tunable rigidity (the G' values were 5.74, 0.16, 27.74, and 67.90 KPa, respectively). Moreover, C-13-WY and C-13-YY hydrogels with high stability and excellent mechanical properties formed beta-sheet nanofiber crosslinked networks. Furthermore, we applied four hydrogels into encapsulation of lemon essential oil (LEO). The peptide hydrogels had a high encapsulation rate and slowly released the LEO. Importantly, the LEO-loaded hydrogels showed enhanced antibacterial activity than free LEO. Our results clearly demonstrate the significance of side-chain interactions in determining hydrogel properties and their potential application in encapsulation for nutrition agents and hydrophobic drugs.

TI  - Exceptional warming over the Barents area
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, surface air temperature (SAT) data from Global reanalyses points to maximum warming over the northern Barents area. However, a scarcity of observations hampers the confidence of reanalyses in this Arctic hotspot region. Here, we study the warming over the past 20-40 years based on new available SAT observations and a quality controlled comprehensive SAT dataset from the northern archipelagos in the Barents Sea. We identify a statistically significant record-high annual warming of up to 2.7 degrees C per decade, with a maximum in autumn of up to 4.0 degrees C per decade. Our results are compared with the most recent global and Arctic regional reanalysis data sets, as well as remote sensing data records of sea ice concentration (SIC), sea surface temperature (SST) and high-resolution ice charts. The warming pattern is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover and confirms the general spatial and temporal patterns represented by reanalyses. However, our findings suggest even a stronger rate of warming and SIC-SAT relation than was known in this region until now.

TI  - Monitoring effect of nickel, copper, and zinc on growth and photosynthetic pigments of <i>Spirulina platensis</i> with suitability investigation in Idku Lake
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the increase of pollutant sources in oceans, seas, and lakes, there is an expected effect on growth and metabolism of planktonic algae which are considered primary producers in the ecosystem. Therefore, it becomes urgent to carry out laboratory studies to test to what extent these pollutants can affect the growth of algae which is necessary as a food for marine fishes. Spirulina is considered the most important algal species due to its high nutritional value for humans and animals. Therefore, this work investigated the effect of different concentrations of Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ metal ion pollutants on growth of the blue-green alga Spirulina platensis. EC50 was identified to be around 2 mg/l for the three heavy metals. The suitability of Idku Lake for Spirulina platensis growth was investigated using multi-criteria spatial modeling integrated with remotely sensed data processing. Spatial distribution maps of turbidity, water nutrients, and phytoplankton were the input criteria used to assess Idku Lake's suitability. The results obtained proved that low concentrations of the tested heavy metals stimulated growth and pigment fractions (chlorophyll a, carotenoids, and total phycobilins content) but to different degrees. The inhibitory effect was more prominent in the case of copper ions than zinc and nickel ions with all concentrations used. The overall suitability map of Spirulina platensis in Idku Lake showed that the whole lake is suitable for growth and proliferation except for the northwestern corner due to the high salinity levels. The present paper helps to understand the behavior of algae responding to environmental pollution, which supports environmental planners with the necessary baseline for investigating the fate of pollutants and the potential risk.

TI  - Vegetation stress as chief indicator for detection of hydrocarbon microseepage in regions of north-eastern India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrocarbons are of significance for economic and environmental standpoints. Hydrocarbon microseepage alters the surface properties of land. Here, the detection of potential hydrocarbon microoseepage zone based on vegetation stress is carried out in the north-eastern Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya. A weighted overlay model, fed by 11 spectral wide and narrow band vegetation indices (VIs), is used to determine the effective VIs for detecting vegetation stress. Mineral alteration indices are also employed as proxies to detect potential hydrocarbon microseepage sites. Mineral alteration zones exhibiting vegetation stress are speculated to be potential hydrocarbon microseepage sites. VIs such as Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Lichtenthaler Index 1 (LIC1) and Simple Ratio Index (SRI) are more effective in detecting vegetation stress as they are sensitive to minor variations in chlorophyll content. The predominant vegetation stress is detected in south-east region of the study area in Jowai around Jaintia hills. The mineral alteration indices confirms that it is a potential hydrocarbon microseepage zone. Thus, remote sensing data can serve the dual purpose of fuel resource exploration and pollution source detection at once being cost effective, hazard free and convenient.

TI  - Mapping algal bloom dynamics in small reservoirs using Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater algal blooms have caused ecological damage and public health concerns throughout the world. Monitoring such blooms via in situ sampling is both costly and time-consuming, and satellite imagery provides a rapid and relatively inexpensive way to supplement these techniques. Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager data have effectively detected chlorophyll-a, a proxy for algal biomass, in large bodies of water, but few studies have shown the applicability in small (< 10 km2) reservoirs, which are critically important for aquatic species, drinking water, irrigation, cultural activities, and recreation. This study provides a test of the use of Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine for algal bloom detection in two small freshwater reservoirs in northern California, USA, from October 2015 to December 2020. Google Earth Engine's cloud computing allows for the analysis of extensive datasets and time series, expanding the capacity to analyze the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of floating algal blooms. Here we analyzed four spectral indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI), B8AB4, and B3B2 to retrieve chlorophyll-a data for algal bloom identification in two highly dynamic freshwater systems. We assessed the relationship between spectral indices and monthly in situ water samples that were collected at three sites within the reservoirs using cubic polynomial regression equations. NDCI, which leverages the red-edge wavelength, most accurately identified chlorophyll-a across all study sites (highest adjusted R-2 = 0.84, lowest RMSE = 0.02 mu g/l), followed by NDVI. We demonstrate that Sentinel-2 imagery can capture greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity of algal blooms than typical in situ sampling. This suggests that remote sensing may be an increasingly important tool in monitoring algal bloom dynamics in small reservoirs and other aquatic environments.

TI  - Thermal Environment Evolution and Response Mechanism of Urban Sprawl Based on Multi-source Data
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the urban thermal environment and improving the quality of human settlements are important prerequisites for creating ecologically livable cities. The current research on the relationship between urban expansion and the thermal environment is mostly based on remote sensing data, and the application of multi-source data is weak. Here, we selected the Xi'an metropolitan core area, measured the urban expansion and temporal and spatial evolution of the thermal environment based on Landsat remote sensing images in 2010 and 2020, and used multi-source data, such as interest points and the Baidu thermal index, to study the response mechanism of the urban thermal environment through geoscience statistical analysis methods. The results showed that: (1) the construction land in the study area had expanded by 200.84 km(2), and the area and intensity showed that "the center and the periphery are weaker, and the difference between the two" characteristics, and the expansion mode was mainly edge type and infill type. (2) Between 2010 and 2020, the overall thermal environment in the study area deteriorated, and the area of the heat island area increased by 282.65 km(2). The spread of the heat island area was in the same direction as the urban expansion, and the distribution pattern evolved from "southeast-northwest" to "northeast-southwest;" however, the average temperature in the central area of the city decreased 1.09 degrees C. (3) Urban expansion was strongly positively correlated with the deterioration of the urban thermal environment. The expansion of urban space had a contribution rate of 60.40% to the deterioration of the thermal environment, and various socio-economic factors had a weaker effect, with an overall contribution rate of 39.60%. The vegetation water body had an obvious cooling effect; under the influence of multiple factors, the surface temperature increased by 0.241 units. In the process of urban expansion, changes in surface parameters and two-dimensional urban morphology were still the main factors for thermal environment changes, whereas three-dimensional morphology had a small effect on the warming of social and economic activities, and the contribution of water bodies and vegetation to cooling was prominent.

TI  - Field hyperspectral data and OLI8 multispectral imagery for heavy metal content prediction and mapping around an abandoned Pb-Zn mining site in northern Tunisia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining and smelting releases toxic contaminants such as zinc (Zn), lead (Pb) or cadmium (Cd) into the soil thereby poisoning it and rendering it unproductive. Remotely alternatives have been widely employed in the attempt of estimating heavy metal content within soils. The present study provides a methodological approach based on VNIR-SWIR field hyperspectral data and multispectral Landsat OLI 8 imageries for the prediction and mapping of Pb, Zn and Cd heavy metal contents around the abandoned Jebel Ressas mine site in Northern Tunisia. Thus, eighty-seven soil and tailing samples were collected from the study site and VNIR-SWIR field reflectances were measured on the same collection points, as well. All samples were analysed by atomic absorption for the estimation of heavy metal concentrations. The partial least squares regression PLSR was conducted considering the measured heavy metal concentrations and using multi-scale data: VNIR-SWIR field hyperspectral data and multispectral Landsat OLI 8 imagery. Standard normal variable (SNV) and multiple scatter correction (MSC) preprocessing methods were applied for further mapping improvement. Thus, this work aims to automate the estimation of the heavy metal contents in contaminated soils, by carrying out: a modeling approach based on the PLSR using VNIR-SWIR field hyperspectral data, ii) the mapping of Pb and Zn contents thanks to the exploitation of Landsat OLI8 multispectral imagery and iii) the application of both MSC and SNV preprocessing methods to optimize the performance of the developed models, when using such spectrally and spatially degraded data.

TI  - Mechanisms of Interannual Variability of Ocean Bottom Pressure in the Southern Indian Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of ocean bottom pressure (OBP) helps to understand the changes in the sea level budget and ocean deep circulation. In this study, the characteristics and mechanisms of interannual OBP variability in the Southern Indian Ocean are examined using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data from 2003 to 2016. Results show that there are two energetic OBP centers in the Southern Indian Ocean (50 degrees-60 degrees S, 40 degrees-60 degrees E and 45 degrees-60 degrees S, 80 degrees-120 degrees E). The OBP magnitudes at two centers have strong variability on interannual time scales, and their values are larger during austral summer (NDJF) and winter (JJAS). Atmospheric forcing plays an important role in local OBP variability. The high (low) sea level pressure (SLP) over the Southern Indian Ocean benefits positive (negative) OBP anomalies via the convergence (divergence) of Ekman transport driven by local wind. Such SLP anomalies are related to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Southern Oscillation (SO) and Indian Ocean dipole (IOD). SAM can influence the OBP changes in both austral summer and winter, while SO and IOD have positive correlations with OBP variability during austral summer and austral winter, respectively. These results are validated by a mass-conservation ocean model, which further confirms the importance of atmospheric forcing on the interannual OBP variations.

TI  - The Field Immersion Framework: A Transformative Pedagogy for Experiential Civic Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging from faculty collaboration across disciplines, the four-stage Field Immersion Framework (FIF) marries place-based experiential learning with civic engagement to promote important transformative learning outcomes such as shifts in Worldview, Self, Epistemology, Ontology, Behavior, and Capacity. To support those outcomes, we developed this adaptable pedagogical framework for immersive courses that cultivate shared inquiry by faculty and students while fostering civic agency. The FIF positions students as explorers in communities grappling with important, unresolved issues and facilitates deep learning in the affective domain. Immersing students in the field as they experience civic issues is an emancipatory opportunity for many students, particularly those bound by geography or digital screens. We detail the FIF's grounding in learning theory and provide examples of its implementation in varied courses and geographic settings.

TI  - Multispectral images for monitoring the physiological parameters of coffee plants under different treatments against nematodes
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The coffee crops are exposed to different pathogens that directly affect yield. These include nematodes, which attack the roots of plants and compromise their physiological development. Given the losses caused by this pathogen and the lack of information on spatial distribution in infested areas, it is important to adopt technologies that enable crops under different management systems to be monitored during their growth cycle. The remote sensing associated with machine learning algorithms is presented as a potential tool for monitoring agricultural crops. The present study assesses different machine learning algorithms, using radiometric values of multispectral images as input datasets, and identifies the best algorithms, to estimate the physiological agronomic parameters in coffee crops submitted to 11 treatments for nematode management. Based on the association between the images taken by a low-cost camera (bands: (R) red, (G) green and (B) blue) mounted on a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), machine learning algorithms (Random Forest (RF) and support-vector machines (SVM)), the results made it possible to estimate with satisfactory accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) less than 26.5% the main physical parameters of coffee plants: chlorophyll, plant height, branch length, number of branches and number of nodes per branch. With Planet satellite-derived multispectral bands, the SVM algorithm estimated plant canopy diameters with an RMSE of 7.74%. Based on the spatial distribution maps of the physical parameters, the application machine learning methods offered an opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring coffee crop growth conditions and accurately guiding several management techniques.

TI  - Contribution of vertical electrical soundings, Landsat 8 and SRTM images to the comparative study of the hydrogeological characteristics of the Foto, Keleng and Foreke areas, West Cameroon
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area is located in the town of Dschang, West-Cameroon, on the southern flank of the Bambouto Mountains. The acute shortage of drinking water supply points due to lack of structural knowledge on existing aquifers. The present work allows the establishment of a hydrogeological map of the study area. The data from the vertical electrical soundings carried out on 64 points, show 12 electrical anomalies: A, H, K, Q, AK, HA, HK, HQ, KQ, KA, KH and Q; divided into two domains: a resistive domain with resistivities between 2892.63 and 27 323.56 Omega m and a conductive domain with resistivities between 0.43 and 2892.63 Omega m. The conductive domain is more represented in the basaltic zone while the most resistant domain is represented by the gneissic and the granitic zones. Hydraulic conductivity in the study area ranges from 0.004 to 44.852 m/day, porosity from 0.192% to 42.615%, longitudinal conductance from 0.001 to 1.101 Omega(-1) and transmissivity values from 0.019 to 504.023 m(2)/day. The area includes two types of aquifers; saprolite aquifer from 1.6 to 16.26 m with a roof varying between 1.5 and 16 m and aquifers on thick fractures from 16.26 to 38.34 m with a thickness varying between 16 and 36 m. The major and minor fracturing directions are respectively N 60 degrees to N 70 degrees E and N 0 degrees to N 30 degrees E. According to the hydrogeological potentials, Foto which is made up of basaltic formation is very favourable, Foreke on granitic formation is moderately favourable and Keleng on gneissic formation is not very favourable.

TI  - The absence of alternative stable states in vegetation cover of northeastern India
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, forests and savannah are shown to be alternative stable states for intermediate rainfall regimes. This has implications for how these ecosystems respond to changing rainfall conditions. However, we know little about the occurrence of alternative stable states in forest ecosystems in India. In this study, we investigate the possibility of alternative stable states in the vegetation cover of northeastern India, which is a part of the Eastern Himalaya and the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspots. To do so, we construct the so-called state diagram, by plotting frequency distributions of vegetation cover as a function of mean annual precipitation (MAP). We use remotely sensed satellite data of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as a proxy for vegetation cover (at 1 km resolution). We find that EVI exhibits unimodal distribution across a wide range of MAP. Specifically, EVI increases monotonically in the range 1000-2000 mm of MAP, after which it plateaus. This range of MAP corresponds to the vegetation transitional zone (1200-3700 m), whereas MAP greater than 2000 mm covers the larger extent of the tropical forest (less than or equal to 1200 m) of northeast India. In other words, we find no evidence for alternative stable states in vegetation cover or forest states at coarser scales in northeast India.

TI  - Promoter Identification and Optimization for the Response of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> WCFS1 to the Gram-Negative Pathogen-Associated Molecule <i>N</i>-3-Oxododecanoyl Homoserine Lactone
T2  - ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quorum sensing (QS) in bacteria has been well studied as a cellular communication phenomenon for decades. In recent years, such systems have been repurposed for the use of biosensors in both cellular and cell-free contexts as well as for inducible protein expression in nontraditional chassis organisms. Such biosensors are particularly intriguing when considering the association between the pathogenesis of some bacteria and their signaling intermediates. Considering this relationship and considering the recent demonstration of the species Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 as both a synthetic biology chassis and an organism capable of detecting a pathogen-associated QS molecule, we wanted to develop this organism as a QS sentinel. We used an approach combining techniques from both systems and synthetic biology to identify a number of native QS-response genes and to alter associated promoter activity to tune the output of L. plantarum cultures exposed to N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone. The resulting engineered QS sentinel reinforces the potential of modified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for use in human-health-promoting applications and also demonstrates a simple rational workflow to engineer sentinel organisms to respond to any environmental or chemical stimuli.

TI  - Retrieval of total and fine mode aerosol optical depth by an improved MODIS Dark Target algorithm
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Total and fine mode aerosol optical depth (AODT and AODF), as well as the fine mode fraction (FMF = AODF/AODT), are critical variables for climate change and atmospheric environment studies. The retrievals with high accuracy from satellite observations, particularly FMF and AODF over land, remain challenging. This study aims to improve the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) land dark target (DT) algorithm for retrieving AODT, AODF, and FMF on a global scale. Based on the fact that the underestimated surface reflectance (SR) could overestimate the AODT and underestimate the aerosol size parameter in the DT algorithm, two robust schemes were developed to improve SR determination: the first (NEW1 DT) used the top of the atmosphere reflectance instead of SR at 2.12 um; the second (NEW2 DT) used eleven-year MODIS data to establish a monthly spectral SR relationship model (2.12-0.47 and 2.12-0.65 um) database at pixel-by-pixel scale. Then a novel lookup table approach based on the physical process was proposed to retrieve the AODF and FMF. The new MODIS AODT, FMF, and AODF were compared to AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) retrievals. Results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.096-0.103, 0.098-0.099, and 0.167-0.180 for the new AODTs, AODFs, and FMFs, respectively, which were better than that of the Collection 6.1 (C6.1) DT (0.117, 0.235, and 0.426) in the validation by global AERONET sites. From the validation results, NEW2 DT provided better AODT and coarse mode AOD retrievals, while NEW1 DT had better AODF and FMF performances. The spatial patterns of AODF, FMF, and AODC of the new DT algorithms were comparable to those of the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances aerosol product. Hence, the new algorithms have the potential to provide global AODT, FMF, and AODF products over land to the scientific community with high accuracy using long-term MODIS data.

TI  - A validated geospatial model approach for monitoring progress of the Sendai Framework: The example of people affected in agriculture due to flooding in Ecuador
T2  - PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of data on disaster-related loss and damage, especially in developing countries, obstructs the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). This weakens the accuracy, timeliness, and quality of the SFDRR monitoring process at the national level. This is the case for the country of Ecuador, who has not reported on the progress of SFDRR Target B, indicator B-5a, the number of workers in agriculture with crops damaged or destroyed. Consequently, this research developed a geospatial model approach to model indicator B-5a in the context of flooding. The model uses Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and other spatial data to quantify indicator B-5a at a cantonal spatial level across three ecological regions in Ecuador. The results of the model were validated against country provided in-situ measured loss and damage reference data by combining elements of flood exposure and vulnerability. A statistical analysis was used to assess the agreement of the models with reference data and the models' ability to reproduce the reference data. The validation procedure produced models that had high agreement with the reference data, but the models were sensitive to the different ecological regions. This validated geospatial model approach is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first attempt to validate geospatially measured Sendai indicators against reference data, and provides an opportunity to support countries without information on disaster-related loss and damage in monitoring indicator B-5a of the SFDRR.

TI  - Responding Mechanism of Vegetation Cover to Climate Change and Human Activities in Southwest China from 2000 to 2020
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying vegetation cover variation and its responding mechanism to climate change and human activities is of great significance for regional ecological protection and vegetation restoration. In this study, on the basis of MODIS NDVI, in situ climate data, and land use type data using Theil-Sen Median analysis, the Mann-Kendall significance test, residual analysis, partial correlation analysis, and multi-correlation analysis, the spatial and temporal variation in vegetation cover and its response to climate change and the land use/land cover change in each geomorphological unit in southwest China were analyzed. The vegetation cover showed a fluctuant increasing trend, and the changing trend exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity, with the increasing rate being higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest of southwest China from 2000 to 2020. The vegetation variation was dominated by positive effects of the climate change and human activities in southwest China, and the positive effects were stronger in Guangxi Hill than those in other geomorphological units. Furthermore, from 2000 to 2020 the vegetation cover was positively associated with precipitation and temperature and negatively correlated with relative humidity and sunshine duration in southwest China. Temperature was considered to be the dominate climate factor controlling the vegetation variation in the study area. Urban expansion had decreased the region vegetation cover, but the overall vegetation cover had increased in southwest China due to the suitable regional climate conditions and the implementation of ecological reforestation projection. These results can provide scientific references for ecological protection and economic sustainable development in southwest China.

TI  - MRI characteristics of breast edema for assessing axillary lymph node burden in early-stage breast cancer: a retrospective bicentric study
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To investigate whether breast edema characteristics at preoperative T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) could help evaluate axillary lymph node (ALN) burden in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods This retrospective study included women with clinical T1 and T2 stage breast cancer and preoperative MRI examination in two independent cohorts from May 2014 to December 2020. Low (< 3 LNs+) and high (>= 3 LNs+) pathological ALN (pALN) burden were recorded as endpoint. Breast edema score (BES) was evaluated at T2WI. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed by the logistic regression model. The added predictive value of BES was examined utilizing the area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results A total of 1092 patients were included in this study. BES was identified as the independent predictor of pALN burden in primary (n = 677) and validation (n = 415) cohorts. The analysis using MRI-ALN status showed that BES significantly improved the predictive performance of pALN burden (AUC: 0.65 vs 0.71, p < 0.001; IDI = 0.045, p < 0.001; continuous NRI = 0.159, p = 0.050). These results were confirmed in the validation cohort (AUC: 0.64 vs 0.69, p = 0.009; IDI = 0.050, p < 0.001; continuous NRI = 0.213, p = 0.047). Furthermore, BES was positively correlated with biologically invasive clinicopathological factors (p < 0.05). Conclusions In individuals with early-stage breast cancer, preoperative MRI characteristics of breast edema could be a promising predictor for pALN burden, which may aid in treatment planning.

TI  - Trend Changes in Ozone Pollution and Sensitivity Analysis of Ozone in Henan Province
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on air quality station data and satellite remote sensing data, the interannual variation characteristics and seasonal variation trends of near-surface ozone (O-3) in Henan province were studied, and the variation in O-3 sensitivity was analyzed. The results showed that the O-3 concentration near the surface of Henan province increased first and then decreased from 2015 to 2020. The highest O-3 concentration was found in 2018, and the annual mean of the maximum daily 8 h moving mean (MDA8) of O-3 was 110.70 mu g.m(-3). The difference in MDA8 values among different stations gradually decreased. From 2015 to 2020, the average monthly MDA8 in Henan province showed an upward trend, with a growth rate of 2.46 mu g.(m3.a)(-1). According to the MK trend test, except for in Luohe, Nanyang, and Pingdingshan, the rising trend in other cities was significant (P<0.05). The concentration of MDA8 in the four seasons also showed an increasing trend during the 6 years as follows:autumn (19.31%)>winter (17.09%)>spring (16.82%)>summer (7.24%). From 2015 to 2019, the high value of tropospheric NO2 was concentrated in the northwest of Henan province, and the concentration showed a decreasing trend with a decreasing rate of 0.34x1015 molecules.(cm(2).a)(-1), whereas the tropospheric HCHO showed a slow rising trend with an annual growth rate of 0.19x10(15) molecules.(cm(2).a)(-1), with a higher concentration in the northern urban area. The O-3 sensitivity control area from 2015 to 2019 showed that most of the eastern part of Henan province belonged to the VOCs limited category

TI  - Influence of cyanobacterial bloom accumulation and dissipation on underwater light attenuation in a large and shallow lake
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial bloom accumulation and dissipation frequently occur in Lake Taihu, a typically shallow, eutrophic lake due to wind wave disturbance. However, knowledge of the driving mechanisms of cyanobacterial blooms on underwater light attenuation is still limited. In this study, we collected a high-frequency in situ monitoring of the wind field, underwater light environment, and surface water quality to elucidate how cyanobacterial bloom accumulation and dissipation affect the variations in underwater light attenuation in the littoral zone of Lake Taihu. Results showed that cyanobacterial blooms significantly increased the diffuse attenuation coefficient of ultraviolet-B (K-d(313)), ultraviolet-A (K-d(340)), and photosynthetically active radiation (K-d(PAR)); the scattering of total suspended matter (b(bp)(lambda)); and the absorption of phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM, a(g)(lambda)) (p < 0.01). The K-d(PAR) decreased quickly during the processes of bloom dissipation, but the decrease of K-d(313) and K-d(340) lagged 0.5 day. Our results suggested that cyanobacterial blooms could increase particle matters and elevated the production of autochthonous CDOM, resulting in underwater light attenuation increase. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and PAR attenuation both have significant responses to cyanobacterial blooms, but the response processes were distinct due to the different changes of particle and dissolved organic matters. Our study unravels the driving mechanisms of cyanobacterial blooms on underwater light attenuation, improving lake ecosystem management and protection.

TI  - Patterns and driving factors of built-up land expansion in small provincial city in the Belt and Road Initiative: case study of Nong Khai City, Thailand
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - China's Belt and Road Initiative is the twenty-first century megaproject that will boost urbanisation and elicit expansion of new built-up land. However, little understanding exists concerning the expansion of new built-up land in small cities that will encounter urbanisation unavoidably. Thus, this study aims to clarify the patterns and driving forces behind built-up land expansion during the 1997-2017 period using Nong Khai City, Thailand-which has become an international hub in the Pan-Asia Railway Network-as a case study. Land-use maps were generated based on Landsat Satellite images and used to examine built-up land expansion, and driving forces were clarified through logistic regression using 16 independent variables based on four groups of driving factors. The findings indicate that built-up land expansion was the predominant pattern of land-use changes, with agricultural land transformed the most. Most independent variables affected the expansion with the same relationship, but magnitude varied during different periods. Socioeconomic and neighbourhood and spatial interaction factors were the most powerful driving forces during the 1997-2007 and 2007-2017 periods, respectively. While the designation of built-up areas under the spatial policy factor exerted a moderate influence on built-up land expansion over time, the influence of almost all the variables of biophysical factors was weak, except distance from the Mekong River. In the future, city planners should consider controlling the expansion of built-up land into agricultural land and conserve agricultural land around cities.

TI  - Fire probability mapping and prediction from environmental data: What a comprehensive savanna-forest transition can tell us
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado-Amazon transition (CAT) is located between the two largest biogeographic domains of the Neotropical region, coinciding with the "Arc of Deforestation", an agricultural frontier that expands towards the Amazon. Fire plays an important role in the landscape changes that have been occurring in this transition. Thus, the objectives of this study were (i) evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms/techniques in predicting fires in the CAT; (ii) investigate the season of highest fire probabilities in the CAT; and (iii) identify, among anthropic, climatic, topographic and soil variables, the main drivers of fires spatial distribution in the CAT. Fire occurrence data (active fire pixels) from the MODIS sensor were used as input data in species distribution models. The SDM allowed the construction of monthly fire probability models for the study area. The model's quality was assessed by R-squared, RMSE, AUC and TSS metrics. In addition, we assessed the weight of variables in building the models. To obtain the fire seasonality, we used the bootstrap technique to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) about the mean. As result, we found that all algorithms obtained satisfactory performance, as well as the ensemble model technique used, which obtained an average AUC of 0.812 +/- 0.001. The algorithm with the best individual performance was Random Forest, with a mean AUC 0.851 +/- 0.002. Similar patterns were found when considering TSS metrics. The predicted and observed fire occurrences showed strong association (R-2 = 0.81). The high fire probability area was higher during the dry season (15304.37 +/- 41.65), showing a significant difference (p-value <= 0.05) from the rainy season. The variables that most explained the fire occurrences along the CAT were 'Silt Fraction', 'Distance from Agriculture' and 'Maximum Temperature'. In addition, 'Distance from Roads', 'Distance from Protected Areas' and Elevation' were relevant for the monthly models. Anthropogenic variables were more important during the dry season. The results demonstrate that SDMs can be adequately used in fire prediction. Protected areas have shown an important role in acting as a fire barrier. However, many of these areas are vulnerable, surrounded by high fire probabilities during the dry season, predominantly anthropic, putting the natural dynamics of fire in the region and the local biodiversity at risk. Our approach can be useful in environmental protection and monitoring, in addition to facilitating the understanding about the CAT ecological complexity and the high anthropogenic pressure happening there.

TI  - Exploration of Alternative Approaches to Phenotyping of Late Leaf Spot and Groundnut Rosette Virus Disease for Groundnut Breeding
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Late leaf spot (LLS), caused by Nothopassalora personata (Berk. & M.A Curt.), and groundnut rosette disease (GRD), [caused by groundnut rosette virus (GRV)], represent the most important biotic constraints to groundnut production in Uganda. Application of visual scores in selection for disease resistance presents a challenge especially when breeding experiments are large because it is resource-intensive, subjective, and error-prone. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) can alleviate these constraints. The objective of this study is to determine if HTP derived indices can replace visual scores in a groundnut breeding program in Uganda. Fifty genotypes were planted under rain-fed conditions at two locations, Nakabango (GRD hotspot) and NaSARRI (LLS hotspot). Three handheld sensors (RGB camera, GreenSeeker, and Thermal camera) were used to collect HTP data on the dates visual scores were taken. Pearson correlation was made between the indices and visual scores, and logistic models for predicting visual scores were developed. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r = -0.89) and red-green-blue (RGB) color space indices CSI (r = 0.76), v* (r = -0.80), and b* (r = -0.75) were highly correlated with LLS visual scores. NDVI (r = -0.72), v* (r = -0.71), b* (r = -0.64), and GA (r = -0.67) were best related to the GRD visual symptoms. Heritability estimates indicated NDVI, green area (GA), greener area (GGA), a*, and hue angle having the highest heritability (H-2 > 0.75). Logistic models developed using these indices were 68% accurate for LLS and 45% accurate for GRD. The accuracy of the models improved to 91 and 84% when the nearest score method was used for LLS and GRD, respectively. Results presented in this study indicated that use of handheld remote sensing tools can improve screening for GRD and LLS resistance, and the best associated indices can be used for indirect selection for resistance and improve genetic gain in groundnut breeding.

TI  - Lead Detection in the Arctic Ocean from Sentinel-3 Satellite Data: A Comprehensive Assessment of Thresholding and Machine Learning Classification Methods
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Arctic Ocean, obtaining water levels from satellite altimetry is hampered by the presence of sea ice. Hence, water level retrieval requires accurate detection of fractures in the sea ice (leads). This paper describes a thorough assessment of various surface type classification methods, including a thresholding method, nine supervised-, and two unsupervised machine learning methods, applied to Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter data. For the first time, the simultaneously sensed images from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument, onboard Sentinel-3, were used for training and validation of the classifiers. This product allows to identify leads that are at least 300 meters wide. Applied to data from winter months, the supervised Adaptive Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, Naive-Bayes, and Linear Discriminant classifiers showed robust results with overall accuracies of up to 92%. The unsupervised Kmedoids classifier produced excellent results with accuracies up to 92.74% and is an attractive classifier when ground truth data is limited. All classifiers perform poorly on summer data, rendering surface classifications that are solely based on altimetry data from summer months unsuitable. Finally, the Adaptive Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and Bootstrap Aggregation classifiers obtain the highest accuracies when the altimetry observations include measurements from the open ocean.

TI  - Spaceborne SAR image formation enhancement using MOCO techniques
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is considered a prevailing tool for remote sensing. It benefits working with high efficiency in all weather and all-day circumstances, making SAR is very confident compared to other types of remote sensing. The SAR platform moves with constant velocity and height, with a linear path for ideal situations. However, this assumption is not realized in satellite movement, which is an elliptical orbiting that worsens the quality of the focused image. This paper introduces a methodology of motion compensation for motion errors due to satellite elliptical orbiting and perturbations in an orbital path. It represents two major contributions applied on a low earth orbit (LEO) spaceborne SAR. First, motion errors analysis in the range and azimuth directions. Second, an algorithm for motion error compensation (MOCO) combined with a chirp scaling algorithm (CSA) is performed. Moreover, a validation for the for-mulated algorithm is executed using sentinel-1 level-0 real raw data input, and the result is compared with the sentinel-1 level-1 single look complex (SLC) SAR image. The validation is performed using two different metrics. First, image quality measurement by sharpness, contrast, and entropy. Second, measuring the peak-sidelobe-ratio (PSLR), impulse-response-width (IRW), and integrated-sidelobe-ratio (ISLR) for five high power reflecting points in the scene area.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - A multi-source spatio-temporal data cube for large-scale geospatial analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data management and analysis are challenging with big Earth observation (EO) data. Expanding upon the rising promises of data cubes for analysis-ready big EO data, we propose a new geospatial infrastructure layered over a data cube to facilitate big EO data management and analysis. Compared to previous work on data cubes, the proposed infrastructure, GeoCube, extends the capacity of data cubes to multi-source big vector and raster data. GeoCube is developed in terms of three major efforts: formalize cube dimensions for multi-source geospatial data, process geospatial data query along these dimensions, and organize cube data for high-performance geoprocessing. This strategy improves EO data cube management and keeps connections with the business intelligence cube, which provides supplementary information for EO data cube processing. The paper highlights the major efforts and key research contributions to online analytical processing for dimension formalization, distributed cube objects for tiles, and artificial intelligence enabled prediction of computational intensity for data cube processing. Case studies with data from Landsat, Gaofen, and OpenStreetMap demonstrate the capabilities and applicability of the proposed infrastructure.

TI  - Adaptive smoothing to identify spatial structure in global lake ecological processes using satellite remote sensing data
T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data are important to the study of environment problems at a global scale. The GloboLakes project aimed to use satellite remote sensing data to investigate the response of the major lakes on Earth to environmental conditions and change. The main challenge to statistical modelling is the identification of the spatial structure in global lake ecological processes from a large number of time series subject to incomplete data and varying uncertainty. This paper introduces a comprehensive modelling procedure, combining adaptive smoothing and functional data analysis, to estimate the smooth curves representing the trend and seasonal patterns in the time series and to cluster the curves over space. Two approaches, based on an irregular basis and an adaptive penalty matrix, are developed to account for the varying uncertainty induced by missing observations and specific constraints (e.g. substantive periods of measurement values of zero in winter). In particular, the adaptive penalty matrix applies a heavier penalty to smooth curve estimates where there is higher uncertainty to prevent over-fitting the noisy/biased data. The modelling procedure was applied to the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) time series from 732 largest lakes globally and the lake chlorophyll -a time series from 535 largest lakes globally. The procedure enabled the identification of nine global lake thermal regions based on the temporal dynamics of LSWT, and the extraction of eight global lake clusters based on the interannual variation in chlorophyll -a and ten clusters to differentiate the seasonal signals.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of snow cover and its relationship with temperature and precipitation in the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and its surrounding areas is very sensitive to climate changes. Due to the complexity of geographical environment in this large region, the response of snow cover to climate change should exhibit spatiotemporal differences. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover from 2002-2015 in the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River Basin (YBRB) were analyzed using an optimized fractional snow cover (FSC) product derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Additionally, the effects of temperature and precipitation on the variability of snow cover were also investigated. The results showed that: (1) The snow cover exhibited large spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the YBRB. High FSC was observed in the northeast of the basin and the south slope of Himalaya, while the lowest was concentrated in the broad valley of the upstream of YBRB. The FSC value reached its highest in winter and dropped to its lowest in summer, but the monthly change processes were different between upstream and downstream regions. (2) A slightly increasing tendency (3.76%/10 a) of snow cover was observed on basin-wide, but the changes varied through time and space. The FSC increased significantly in the source and midstream regions during winter to spring (10.5%-18.0%/10 a), while it changed slightly in summer over all parts of the basin (-0.4%-4.3%/10 a). (3) The study area generally became warm and wet, and the change trend of temperature was more significant than that of precipitation. Snow cover changes were weakly correlated with temperature in winter and precipitation in summer. But in spring and autumn, both precipitation and temperature were significantly related to snow cover change in most regions of the basin. (4) The dominant factor driving the changes of snow cover varied in seasons. The area dominated by temperature was slightly larger than that dominated by precipitation in spring, except that precipitation significantly dominated the snow cover changes in the source region; In summer and autumn, temperature contributed more to the snow cover change in most areas of the basin; However, in winter, precipitation played a leading role in the variations of snow cover. These findings help to understand the different performance of the snow cover in the QTP and its surrounding areas under future climate change.

TI  - Satellites Detect a Methane Ultra-emission Event from an Offshore Platform in the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigation of methane emissions from fossil fuel extraction, processing, and transport is one of the most effective ways to slow global warming. Satellite-based methods are instrumental for the detection, characterization, and quantification of this type of emissions. However, despite the rapid development of satellite-based methane plume detection methods for terrestrial surfaces, there is still an important observational gap with respect to offshore oil and gas infrastructure, which accounts for roughly 30% of global production. In this work, we have used observations from the WorldView-3 and Landsat 8 satellite missions in a particular observation-illumination geometry to image offshore methane plumes from space. The study site is an offshore oil and gas production platform in the Gulf of Mexico, near the coast of Campeche, in one of Mexico's major oil producing fields. Our data suggest that the platform vented high volumes of methane during a 17-day ultra-emission event, amounting to 0.04 +/- 0.01 Tg of methane (equivalent to 3.36 million tons of carbon dioxide) released to the atmosphere if integrated over time. Our results illustrate how satellites can detect methane plumes from offshore infrastructure, which represents a significant breakthrough in the monitoring of industrial methane emissions from space.

TI  - Carcinoma arising within phyllodes tumors of the breast: clinicopathologic observation and a literature review of five cases
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Cases of phyllodes tumors (PTs) of the breast with a malignant epithelial component are rare. The pathogenesis and optimal treatment of patients with carcinoma within PT are still not clear. Methods: We collected five cases of carcinoma arising within PT of the breast between 2007 and 2018, and performed morphological observations and immunohistochemistry using the EnVision method. Results: Four cases arose from benign PT, including two cases of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and two cases from classical lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). One case with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arose from malignant PT. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the LCIS and DCIS cases were diffusely positive for ER and PR, while the single case of SCC was negative. After 15-64 months of follow-up, all patients were alive. Conclusion:To date, there has been no standard treatment for this disease. Thorough sampling is needed to avoid a missed diagnosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed if invasive cancer is present.

TI  - A case of matrix-producing carcinoma of the breast treated with preoperative chemotherapy
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Matrix-producing carcinoma (MPC) is a rare tumor accounting for 0.1% of all breast cancers. Although MPC is usually triple-negative breast cancer, there have been few reports of preoperative chemotherapy for MPC that is considered chemotherapy-resistant. Herein, we report a case of MPC that was successfully treated with preoperative chemotherapy. Case Description: The patient was a 47-year-old woman diagnosed with right multiple breast cancer, clinical stage IIA. One of the tumors was identified as MPC and the other was invasive ductal carcinoma. The maximum tumor diameter of MPC was 3.8-cm. On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells of MPC tested negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The Ki67 index was 90%. Preoperative chemotherapy was performed. EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)) was administered every 3 weeks for a total of 4 courses, followed by 12 courses of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)). Then, she underwent right skin-sparing mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and deep inferior epigastric perforator flap reconstruction. There was no metastasis to the sentinel lymph nodes. Postoperative pathological results showed that the residual tumor of the MPC measured only 0.1 cm. On the other hand, the residual tumor of the invasive ductal carcinoma was 0.7 cm. Endocrine therapy with oral tamoxifen was initiated for the invasive ductal carcinoma. Three years after surgery, no recurrence was observed. It has been reported that prognosis was correlated with residual cancer after preoperative chemotherapy. In addition, preoperative chemotherapy is of high clinical significance for the selection of postoperative treatment. In conclusion, Conclusions: Although our case of MPC was successfully treated with preoperative chemotherapy, the standard of care for MPC remains uncertain. Development of a new targeted therapy for MPC is warranted.

TI  - Estimation of the Surface Net Radiation Under Clear-Sky Conditions in Areas With Complex Terrain: A Case Study in Haihe River Basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface net radiation as an important component of the surface radiation budget has attracted wide attention; however, it is still an enormous challenge to carry out an accurate estimation of the surface net radiation in areas with complex terrain due to the scarcity of radiation observation sites and high-spatial heterogeneity of the influencing factors of the surface net radiation. Taking the Haihe River Basin as the study area, this study estimated the surface net radiation under clear-sky conditions from 2001 similar to 2019 based on an improved algorithm of the net long-wave radiation, and the solar short-wave radiation in terms of direct radiation, diffuse sky radiation, and reflected radiation from the surrounding terrain. In this study, the regional meteorological factors were inverted based on remote sensing data to make up for the deficiency of meteorological factor interpolation. The solar short-wave radiation was corrected by considering the comprehensive influence of the atmosphere, underlying surface, and terrain, and the net long-wave radiation was optimized by localizing the algorithm coefficients. The results showed the correlation coefficient between the estimated and observed surface net radiation reached approximately 0.9, indicating the accuracy of this improved method is acceptable. Besides, the results suggested the surface net radiation was significantly influenced by the terrain, the highest value of which occurred on the south slope, followed by that on the southwest slope, west or southeast slopes, and the lowest value occurred on the north slope. In addition, there was the highest surface net radiation in summer, and there was the lowest and most frequently negative surface net radiation in winter. This study makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional spatial interpolation of meteorological factors and previous empirical formulas, and can therefore provide an important methodological foundation for the research on the surface radiation, climate, and hydrology in the areas with complex terrain.

TI  - Population-based assessment of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of cutaneous melanoma
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma plays a central role in determining prognosis and guiding treatment and surveillance strategies. Despite widely published guidelines for SLNB, variation exists in its use. We aimed to determine the frequency of and predictive factors for SLNB in patients with clinically node-negative melanoma in British Columbia.Methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients with clinically node-negative melanoma diagnosed between January 2015 and December 2017. Patients included had a Breslow depth greater than 0.75 mm or a Breslow depth less than or equal to 0.75 mm with ulceration, or a mitotic rate greater than or equal to 1/mm(2). SLNB was considered to be indicated for clinical stages IB to IIC (American Joint Committee on Cancer's AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, seventh edition).Results: A total of 759 patients were included. SLNB was performed in 54.8% (363/662) of patients when indicated. SLNB was more likely to be performed for tumours with a Breslow depth greater than 1.0 mm or a mitotic rate greater than or equal to 1/mm(2). SLNB was less likely to be performed in patients older than 75 years and with a nonextremity tumour location. Compliance with SLNB guidelines decreased distant recurrence but did not significantly affect regional recurrence, nor did it have a significant impact on overall survival among patients aged 75 years and younger.Conclusion: SLNB is being underutilized in British Columbia. These results are concerning and highly relevant given the rapidly evolving field of adjuvant systemic therapy for high-risk patients and the increased proportion of patients who should be considered for SLNB on the basis of the eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual and current guidelines. Efforts should be made to increase the use of SLNB in appropriate patients.

TI  - Dynamic surface water maps of Canada from 1984 to 2019 Landsat satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the location of surface water in time and space is critical to inform policy on the environment, wildlife, and human welfare. Dynamic surface water maps have been created at continental to global scales from medium and coarse resolution satellite image archives, most notably by Pekel et al. (2016), who mapped global water dynamics from 1984 to 2015 Landsat data. Their occurrence layer, depicting the percentage of time that water was observed in each 30 m resolution cell, has been relied upon heavily by Natural Resources Canada's (NRCan) Emergency Geomatics Service (EGS) to map surface water during flood events. To generate dynamic surface water maps that are optimized for Canada's unique geography, the fully automated EGS surface water mapping methodology was applied in a cloud environment to the 1984-2019 Landsat archive over Canada. National-scale surface water maps and derived inundation frequency akin to Pekel's occurrence, as well as inter -annual wetting and drying trends calculated using per-pixel logistic regression, were produced to form the complete dataset. Separate comparisons of our frequency layer with Pekel's occurrence layer and Canada's water base layer from the National Hydrographic Network (NHN) were conducted. The comparison with Pekel's occurrence showed that our product contains a large number of unique water objects, the majority of which are correct when assessed against Google Earth (GE) imagery. Comparison with the NHN indicated that the NHN contained a large number of permanent water objects that were mapped as ephemeral water objects in our product, with the majority of these being verified in GE as true ephemeral water objects such as floodplains and wetlands. Wetting trends were found to be more than five times greater than drying trends across Canada, with notable wetting in the Prairie Pothole region and Low Arctic verified with examples of statistically significant wetting and drying features. The dataset will enhance EGS flood and river ice mapping operations, provide information on floodplain location and extent, and give insight into the effects of climate change on surface water availability.

TI  - Sentinel node approach to monitoring online COVID-19 misinformation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how different online communities engage with COVID-19 misinformation is critical for public health response. For example, misinformation confined to a small, isolated community of users poses a different public health risk than misinformation being consumed by a large population spanning many diverse communities. Here we take a longitudinal approach that leverages tools from network science to study COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter. Our approach provides a means to examine the breadth of misinformation engagement using modest data needs and computational resources. We identify a subset of accounts from different Twitter communities discussing COVID-19, and follow these 'sentinel nodes' longitudinally from July 2020 to January 2021. We characterize sentinel nodes in terms of a linked domain preference score, and use a standardized similarity score to examine alignment of tweets within and between communities. We find that media preference is strongly correlated with the amount of misinformation propagated by sentinel nodes. Engagement with sensationalist misinformation topics is largely confined to a cluster of sentinel nodes that includes influential conspiracy theorist accounts. By contrast, misinformation relating to COVID-19 severity generated widespread engagement across multiple communities. Our findings indicate that misinformation downplaying COVID-19 severity is of particular concern for public health response. We conclude that the sentinel node approach can be an effective way to assess breadth and depth of online misinformation penetration.

TI  - Individual Tree Crown Segmentation and Crown Width Extraction From a Heightmap Derived From Aerial Laser Scanning Data Using a Deep Learning Framework
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving individual tree crown (ITC) information from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data is of great significance to forest resource assessment and smart management. After proof-of-concept studies, advanced deep learning methods have been shown to have high efficiency and accuracy in remote sensing data analysis and geoscience problem solving. This study proposes a novel concept for synergetic use of the YOLO-v4 deep learning network based on heightmaps directly generated from airborne LiDAR data for ITC segmentation and a computer graphics algorithm for refinement of the segmentation results involving overlapping tree crowns. This concept overcomes the limitations experienced by existing ITC segmentation methods that use aerial photographs to obtain texture and crown appearance information and commonly encounter interference due to heterogeneous solar illumination intensities or interlacing branches and leaves. Three generative adversarial networks (WGAN, CycleGAN, and SinGAN) were employed to generate synthetic images. These images were coupled with manually labeled training samples to train the network. Three forest plots, namely, a tree nursery, forest landscape and mixed tree plantation, were used to verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results showed that the overall recall of our method for detecting ITCs in the three forest plot types reached 83.6%, with an overall precision of 81.4%. Compared with reference field measurement data, the coefficient of determination R-2 was >= 79.93% for tree crown width estimation, and the accuracy of our deep learning method was not influenced by the values of key parameters, yielding 3.9% greater accuracy than the traditional watershed method. The results demonstrate an enhancement of tree crown segmentation in the form of a heightmap for different forest plot types using the concept of deep learning, and our method bypasses the visual complications arising from aerial images featuring diverse textures and unordered scanned points with irregular geometrical properties.

TI  - Worldview Analysis as a Tool for Conflict Resolution
T2  - NEGOTIATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - When we survey the current theoretical landscape, we find two distinct approaches to the analysis of worldviews. The systemic approach centers on responses to fundamental worldview questions (aka "big questions"); the cognitive-behavioral approach focuses on the processes that give rise to behaviors that express worldviews. If we think of worldviews as subjective representations of the environment, that is, subjective "worlds," we can think of the first approach as a means of eliciting, documenting, and comparing "worlds-made" and the second as a framework for understanding the nonconscious processes of "world-making." It is not clear, however, how the two approaches are related. If human answers to the fundamental worldview questions are simply reflective additions to underlying cognitive processes, we would anticipate that worldview conflicts could be resolved relatively easily. If the implicit answers are embedded in nonconscious processes that are presupposed by various ways of life, we would expect that the process of resolving conflicts would be much more complex. An evolutionary approach, which views world-making as an evolved capacity, not only suggests that the latter is the case, but also offers a way to integrate the two approaches. If, as an evolutionary approach would suggest, all mobile organisms must implicitly answer basic, species-appropriate versions of the big questions in order to survive, then we can integrate the two approaches by defining worldviews in terms of simplified big questions that allow for both proximate and ultimate answers. This allows us to embed the systemic framework in an agent-based cognitive-behavioral process grounded in the everyday life and behavior of humans and other animals. The article is divided into three parts. The first demonstrates how we can use simplified versions of the big questions to integrate the systemic and cognitive-behavioral approaches, ground the big questions in ways of life, and shift between systemic and agent-based perspectives. The second offers more refined analytic concepts-modes, scale, and scope-for characterizing this dynamic, multilevel approach to worldviews. The third offers several comparisons to illustrate the benefits of this more-nuanced approach in the context of conflict resolution.

TI  - Assessment of vegetation change on the Mongolian Plateau over three decades using different remote sensing products
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a major component of temperate steppes in the Eurasian continent, the Mongolian Plateau (MP) plays a pivotal role in the East Asian and global carbon cycles. This paper describes the use of five remote sensing indices derived from satellite data to characterize vegetation cover on MP, namely: gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). It is found that GPP, NPP, and NDVI exhibit increasing trends, whereas LAI and FVC present decreasing trends on the MP since 1982. The different indices highlight discrepancies in the spatial pattern of vegetation growth, with the greatest increase in the southeast of MP. Only 3.4% of the total land area of MP exhibited consistent trends in the indices (0.1% degradation and 3.3% growth, P < 0.01), with the synchronous change of both LAI and NPP exhibiting higher consistency than that of raw NDVI and NPP. Understanding of the characteristics and status of vegetation change on the MP has far-reaching implications for its ecological protection management, and climate change mitigation.

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Since the publication of the Z0011 trial, practice-changing clinical guidelines for breast surgery have been developed. Although recent studies confirmed the feasibility of the Z0011 strategy in Asian populations, there has been no study on the trends of axillary surgery in Asian cohort. This study aimed to investigate the time trend of axillary surgery for breast cancer from a Korean Breast Cancer Registry to understand the impact of the Z0011 trial in Asian patients. Methods We collected prospectively constructed data from the nationwide Korean Breast Cancer Registry (KBCR). We identified patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy followed by breast-conserving surgery from 2011 to 2018 and were found to have pathological stage T1-2N1-3M0 disease. Regression analyses were performed to compare the downward trend of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in Korean cohort with that previously reported in a Dutch cohort. Results From KBCR data, 7478 patients met the inclusion criteria. The proportion of ALND significantly decreased from 2011 (76.6%) to 2018 (47.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed that earlier years at diagnosis, larger tumor size, and lymphatic invasion were associated with a higher odds ratio of performing ALND. Compared to the Dutch cohort, the downward trend of ALND in Korea was significantly more gradual (annual percent change: 37.2 vs. 5.8%, p < 0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrated a downward trend of ALND in Korean patients with breast cancer. However, the rate of decrease was significantly slower than that in the Dutch cohort.

TI  - Accelerated Shrinkage of Glaciers in the Altai Mountains From 2000 to 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain glaciers are an important component of the global hydrological cycle. Existing research about glacier changes in the Altai focused on limited regions. Study about recent glacier changes in the entire Altai Mountains is still lacking. We presented a consistent method for identifying glacier margins. The two new glacier inventories in 2000 and 2020 were derived from Landsat satellite imagery. Glacier surface elevation change and mass balance were obtained by comparing the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and 2020 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images. The spatial pattern of glacier changes was discussed in conjunction with climate trends. We mapped a total area of 1,096.06 +/- 53.32 km(2) around 2020, which amounts to 1,927 glaciers in the Altai Mountains. That was 12.02 +/- 3.01% (or 0.60 +/- 0.15%center dot a(-1)) less than the 1,245.75 +/- 58.52 km(2) around 2000. The geodetic mass balance of the monitoring glaciers in the Aktru basin for the period 2000-2011 was used to validate the geodetic survey. The average geodetic mass balance of -0.32 +/- 0.09 m w. e.center dot a(-1) on monitoring glaciers was slightly exaggerated than the observed mass balance of -0.26 m w. e.center dot a(-1), but it was proved that the geodetic mass balance could reflect glacier changes in the Altai Mountains. An average mass loss of 14.55 +/- 1.32 m w. e. (or 0.74 +/- 0.07 m w. e.center dot a(-1)) was found during 2000-2020 in the Altai Mountains. Although the glacier area changes and mass balance were characterized by spatial heterogeneity, the glaciers in the Altai had experienced an accelerated shrinkage from 2000 to 2020 compared to the 20th century. The rising temperature is the foremost reason for glacier area shrinkage and mass loss according to the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) reanalysis data.

TI  - Validation of a corner reflector installation at Cote d'Azur multi-technique geodetic observatory
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the procedure we followed to design an artificial corner reflector (CR) at the Calern site of Cote d'Azur Observatory (France). Although still few in number, such reflectors are an integral part of the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) infrastructure. They can be used as a stable radar target in SAR images to connect local InSAR deformation maps to the global Terrestrial Reference Frame and for SAR absolute determination. During a test phase, the orientation of the CR was changed in order to be aligned toward all possible orbits of Sentinel-1A/1B satellites. On the different SAR images, the CR exhibits a high backscattering signal, and provides a Signal-to-Clutter Ratio larger than 26 dB. Since December 2018, the CR is specifically oriented toward the relative orbit 88. It is clearly detected as a PS in our InSAR analyses and as expected, the standard deviation of displacement measured on the CR is lower than on surrounding PS. A first local survey was performed to locate precisely this CR with respect to the existing geodetic instruments and annual campaigns have been carried out since then to insure its stability over time.

TI  - Copernicus Sentinel-1 POD reprocessing campaign
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Copernicus Sentinel-1 is a C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite mission within the European Copernicus Programme. The two satellites Sentinel-1A and -1B were launched in April 2014 and 2016, respectively. The Copernicus POD (Precise Orbit Determination) Service is responsible for the determination of orbital and auxiliary products required by the Payload Data Ground Segment (PDGS). Precise orbits are determined based on the dual-frequency GPS (Global Positioning System) data delivered by dedicated geodetic-grade GPS receivers on-board the satellites. Several updates in the operational orbit determination were done during the years including an update of the GPS antenna reference point coordinates. The switch to GPS carrier phase ambiguity-fixing was a major improvement. A reprocessing of the entire mission span of both satellites became necessary to provide a consistent orbit time series for the mission based on state-of-the-art models and processing settings. Due to the lack of independent observation techniques, the Sentinel-1 orbit quality has been assessed by analysing processing metrics, orbit overlaps and orbit comparisons. For this purpose, members of the Copernicus POD Quality Working Group (QWG) provided reprocessed Sentinel-1 orbit time series based on their software packages and their orbit determination settings. A weighted average of all five delivered solutions - a combined orbit - serves as reference for the comparisons. The quality and reliability of this reference orbit depends among others on the number of available orbit solutions and whether a manoeuvre has been performed during the processed day or not. The mean orbit consistency between all orbit solutions is below 1 cm in 3D RMS for the entire mission time interval for both satellites. Only few days show inferior quality due to data gaps or orbit manoeuvres. Following this sophisticated validation process, the reprocessed Sentinel-1 orbits from the Copernicus POD Service have been made available to the user community. (C) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Conceptual model visual simulation and the inductive learning of missing domain constraints
T2  - DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual modeling plays a fundamental role in information systems engineering, and in data and systems interoperability. To play their role as instruments for domain modeling, conceptual models must contain the exact set of constraints that represent the worldview of the relevant domain stakeholders. However, as empirical results show, conceptual modelers are subject to cognitive limitations and biases and, hence, in practice, they systematically produce models that fall short in that respect. Moreover, automating the process of formally assessing conceptual models in this sense (i.e., model validation) is notoriously hard, mainly because the intended worldview at hand lies in the mind of these stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to model validation and automated constraint learning that combines, on one hand, Model Finding via the visual simulation of that model's valid instances and, on the other hand, Inductive Logic Programming techniques. In our approach, we properly channel the results produced by the application of a visual model finding technique as input to a learning process. We then show how the approach is able to support the modeler in identifying missing constraints from the original model. The approach is validated against a catalog of empirically elicited conceptual modeling anti-patterns. As we show here, the approach is able to support the automated learning of constraints that are needed to rectify a number of relevant anti-patterns in this catalog.

AB  - Forest succession analysis can predict forest change trends in the study area, which provides an important basis for other studies. Remote sensing is a recognized and effective tool in forestry succession analysis. Many forest modeling studies use statistic values, but only a few uses remote sensing images. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based digital twin approach for forestry. A data processing algorithm was designed to process Landsat 7 remote sensing data as model's input. An LSTM-based model was constructed to fit historical image data of the study area. The experimental results show that this study's digital twin method can effectively forecast the study area's future image.

TI  - How long is the memory of forest growth to rainfall in asynchronous climates?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The out-of-phase rainfall and temperature and deep root system make the sequential connection between past rainfall events, soil water storage, and forest growth response complicated and temporally extended in asynchronous climates with Mediterranean-type settings. Unfortunately, these location-specific deep-soil water stores are rarely measured due to logistic and financial constraints, especially in the forest. Therefore, at a large spatiotemporal scale, forest growth relationship to growth drivers is still unknown in these ecosystems, limiting our knowledge to understand the functioning of these forests and their links with hydrological processes. Although process-based water balance models can analyze vegetation growth response to the input climate forcing, they rely upon some significant assumptions regarding plants access to deep soil water storage. Thus, this study aims to understand how the out-of-phase rainfall events affect the current ecosystem growth response, represented by the observed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), across the landscape. We have used an empirical approach on long term observed data without any assumption on access to deep-soil water stores. We estimated time lags between forest growth and rainfall events using a lagged correlation analysis applied to monthly anomalies of NDVI and rainfall against their climatological averages over 2002-2018. The study found that the forests in asynchronous climates exhibit unexpectedly long (10-25 months) memory to rain, and this memory has a systematic pattern across the landscape, which we contend has highlighted three things: 1) the forest in the middle aridity (~3-4.5) range are relatively more sensitive to changes in the short-term rainfall than the forest in lower (<3) and higher (>5) aridity regions, could be due to rapid depletion of relatively small soil water storage in between the storms, 2) the variable memory of forest to rain across the landscape can be an indicator of soil depth/rooting depth, and 3) the variable sized location specific antecedent rainfall windows can explain significant variability in forest growth status in asynchronous climates, thus these rainfall windows can be employed to forecast forest growth with a lead time (>4 months).

TI  - Assessing the long-term planform dynamics of Ganges-Jamuna confluence with the aid of remote sensing and GIS
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The confluence of the Ganges, Jamuna, and Padma rivers is one of the most dynamic in the world, an internationally important research area because of the confluence of two of the world's major rivers, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Morphological changes in this area have resulted in severe erosion along the banks. Riverbank erosion is one of Bangladesh's most critical issues, requiring a substantial solution. Riverbank erosion affects millions of people in Bangladesh each year because of erosion in this confluence zone. Consequently, understanding the morphological shifting pattern of the confluence is crucial. The research aims to quantify actual bank shifting near the confluence of the Ganges, Jamuna, and Padma rivers in terms of shifting rate and area during a 25-year period (1990-2015). The acquired satellite images were geo-referenced, and bank lines were digitized to carry out this research. The bank line is the linear construction that separates the outside boundary of the river channel from the floodplains. To assess channel width fluctuation, the distance between the extreme borders of the left and right banks, including mid-channel sandbars, was measured. This period is split into five stages, each lasting 5 years, to measure the maturity of change. Furthermore, the long-term trend from 1972 to 2015 is qualitatively discernible. Landsat satellite pictures were used to investigate this morphological change. The study provides current and reliable information on the planform dynamics of the Ganga-Jamuna confluence. This study will help design and implement drainage development plans and erosion control techniques in this crucial confluence zone.

TI  - Multitemporal Change Detection and Irregular Land Shape Area Measurement from Multispectral Sensor Images through BSO Algorithm
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pixel-based classification and area measurement play a vital role in satellite image processing. The accuracy in classification and area measurement is required for remote monitoring various regions such as water area, cultivation regions, reservoir water spread, and disease spread in cultivation area. Traditionally, Google Earth Pro-based area measurement has error in area measurement due to curvature nature and irregular land surface. Moreover, exact point identification on land surface on Earth pro is difficult due to frequent changes on the land surface. The problem in the land area measurement is mostly affected due to the man-made changes in that particular land area. In this paper, we solve land area measurement error problem through the automated single and multithresholding pixels of different iterations on the land surface by the BSO algorithm. The land cover region pixel intensity changes on the curvature region of land surface with respect to spatial and temporal variations which are identified through BSO optimization-based image segmentation for exact area measurement. For the experimentation of accurate measurement, land area images such as urban, semiurban, hill, and coastal region from LANDSAT and SENTINEL images for period 2016 to 2019 are taken for the land area measurement study. BSO enhances and segments the land regions such as road, building, water body, vegetation, bare land, hill, and coastal region of about 32% more than particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Furthermore, the urban land area measurement accuracy increases to about 97% than the irregular land surface area.

TI  - Deep learning detects invasive plant species across complex landscapes using Worldview-2 and Planetscope satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective management of invasive species requires rapid detection and dynamic monitoring. Remote sensing offers an efficient alternative to field surveys for invasive plants; however, distinguishing individual plant species can be challenging especially over geographic scales. Satellite imagery is the most practical source of data for developing predictive models over landscapes, but spatial resolution and spectral information can be limiting. We used two types of satellite imagery to detect the invasive plant, leafy spurge (Euphorbia virgata), across a heterogeneous landscape in Minnesota, USA. We developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with imagery from Worldview-2 and Planetscope satellites. Worldview-2 imagery has high spatial and spectral resolution, but images are not routinely taken in space or time. By contrast, Planetscope imagery has lower spatial and spectral resolution, but images are taken daily across Earth. The former had 96.1% accuracy in detecting leafy spurge, whereas the latter had 89.9% accuracy. Second, we modified the CNN for Planetscope with a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer that leverages information on phenology from a time series of images. The detection accuracy of the Planetscope LSTM model was 96.3%, on par with the high resolution, Worldview-2 model. Across models, most false-positive errors occurred near true populations, indicating that these errors are not consequential for management. We identified that early and mid-season phenological periods in the Planetscope time series were key to predicting leafy spurge. Additionally, green, red-edge and near-infrared spectral bands were important for differentiating leafy spurge from other vegetation. These findings suggest that deep learning models can accurately identify individual species over complex landscapes even with satellite imagery of modest spatial and spectral resolution if a temporal series of images is incorporated. Our results will help inform future management efforts using remote sensing to identify invasive plants, especially across large-scale, remote and data-sparse areas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal land use/land cover dynamics and its driving forces in the Mekong Basin using Landsat imageries from 1988 to 2017
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, Mekong Basin has experienced a dramatic change in land-use and land-cover (LULC) over the past three decades, which could have a profound effect on regional biodiversity patterns. However, LULC dynamic and their driving forces in the Mekong Basin are still not well understood due to the complex geographical environment and the lack of efficient approaches to consistently produce accurate and timely LULC maps. In this study, we divided the Mekong Basin into three geographical units based on topographic and landscape heterogeneity. Then a rule-based method was employed to map LULC for each geographical unit from Landsat images. Finally, LULC dynamics and associated driving forces in the Mekong Basin from 1988 to 2017 were analysed. The results showed that: (1) the rule-based classification framework could accurately produce time series of LULC maps with overall accuracies over 86% for all single-year classifications. (2) Forest (49.92%) and cultivated land (34.89%) were the dominant LULC types in the Mekong Basin during the study period. Between 1988 and 2017, about 20.98% of the study area experienced LULC changes, in which the artificial surface increased by 3980.31 km(2), mainly at the expense of forest and cultivated land. (3) Human disturbances were identified as the major driving forces of LULC changes. This study present essential source of information for policymakers to formulate sustainable natural resources management policies in the study site. In addition, this rule-based classification provides an insight into improving the accuracy of LULC mapping in complex geographical environment.

TI  - Particulate air pollution in Durban: Characteristics and its relationship with 1 km resolution satellite aerosol optical depth
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigations on the characteristics of air pollution in African regions are fewer compared to other parts of the world. This study presents the temporal characteristics of PM2.5 and PM10 (mass concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic size less than or equal to 2.5 and 10 mu m, respectively) and their ratio (PM2.5/PM10) over Durban, South Africa for the period 2019-2020. The study further explores the satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particulate matter (PM) relationship using an advanced statistical model. The PM data used in this study is obtained from ground-based monitoring stations being maintained by the South African Air Quality Informative System (SAAQIS) network. Within Durban, PM2.5 and PM10 showed an increasing trend toward the south. The annual mean PM2.5 (PM10) ranged between 15 and 24 mu g m(-3) (37 and 54 mu g m(-3)) across the four study sites in Durban. Winter is observed to be the most polluted season among all, with daily mean PM levels exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) standards. PM2.5, PM10, and the PM2.5/PM10 ratios exhibited pronounced diurnal variations. Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis identified the potential non-local source regions and long-range transportation pathways of PM. Investigation into the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on PM revealed a maximum of 15% reduction compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) year. The observed reduction in PM during lockdown is compared and contrasted with that observed in other cities worldwide. The statistical model's tenfold cross-validation (CV) coefficient of determination (R-2) ranged between 0.6 and 0.8. The model predictions can be highly useful in the spatial mapping of PM over the measurements-deficit African regions. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the most important environmental issues, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, due to the influence of various parameters such as climate variables. Nowadays, the use of computational intelligence systems has expanded as a new strategy for soil studies based on satellite imagery. The purpose of this study is comparison of performance and efficiency of two multivariate regression methods as linear methods, and artificial neural network as a nonlinear method, to model and estimate salinity on topsoil in Jarghouyeh_e_Sofla plain. For this purpose, 61 soil samples were collected from 0 to 10 cm depth in study area and electrical conductivity values were extracted in laboratory. Two types of data were used: electrical conductivity of sampling points as independent variables and satellite data including salinity indices and Landsat Operational Land Imager sensor bands of Landsat8 as associated variables. The combination of input parameters was carried out in regression and neural network by using backward regression and principal component analysis, respectively. Therefore, data were divided into two series: train series (60 to 70%) and test series (20 to 30%). The results of assessment based on correlation coefficient and root mean square error in the neural network and regression was equal to 0.65, 27.74 and 29.9 and 31.85, respectively. It showed that the neural network has the highest precision in forecasting soil salinity.

TI  - Global Tonga tsunami explained by a fast-moving atmospheric source
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanoes can produce tsunamis by means of earthquakes, caldera and flank collapses, pyroclastic flows or underwater explosions(1-4). These mechanisms rarely displace enough water to trigger transoceanic tsunamis. Violent volcanic explosions, however, can cause global tsunamis(1,5) by triggering acoustic-gravity waves(6-8) that excite the atmosphere-ocean interface. The colossal eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano and ensuing tsunami is the first global volcano-triggered tsunami recorded by modern, worldwide dense instrumentation, thus providing a unique opportunity to investigate the role of air-water-coupling processes in tsunami generation and propagation. Here we use sea-level, atmospheric and satellite data from across the globe, along with numerical and analytical models, to demonstrate that this tsunami was driven by a constantly moving source in which the acoustic-gravity waves radiating from the eruption excite the ocean and transfer energy into it by means of resonance. A direct correlation between the tsunami and the acoustic-gravity waves' arrival times confirms that these phenomena are closely linked. Our models also show that the unusually fast travel times and long duration of the tsunami, as well as its global reach, are consistent with an air-water-coupled source. This coupling mechanism has clear hazard implications, as it leads to higher waves along land masses that rise abruptly from long stretches of deep ocean waters.

TI  - Estimation of particulate matter pollution using WRF-Chem during dust storm event over India
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates the ground-level PM10 concentration by effectively combining the Aerosols Optical Depth (AOD) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite retrievals and Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The model simulates typical dust storm events 17th-22nd April 2010 and 05th-10th May 2010 which has severely affected air quality in North and Northwestern India. The satellite retrievals shows high AOD (>1.0) over Indo Gangetic Plains and nearby Thar Desert. The model captures the spatial pattern of AOD very well however, it underestimates high aerosol loading in comparision to MODISAOD. The modeled AOD (MODELAOD) shows an underestimation by 37% with MODISAOD over the study region. Therefore, the WRF-Chem model Particulate Matter (PM10) and MODELAOD are scaled using satellite MODISAOD to provide a better estimation of the particulate pollution. The results shows better estimation, trend and correlation (R = 0.83) of the PM10 with hourly observations at Delhi monitoring station and a Mean Bias (MB) of 61 mu g/m3 during the satellite overpass time. The comparison of estimated PM with daily averaged observations of PM10 from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at stations of Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, and Delhi showed a strong agreement with an correlation of (R) of 0.81, 0.70, 0.77 and 0.78, respectively.

TI  - Distribution and habitat use of the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon: first estimates for area of habitat and population size
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately demarcating distributions of biological taxa has long been at the core of ecology. Yet our understanding of the factors defining species range limits is incomplete, especially for tropical species in the Global South. Human-driven threats to the survival of many taxa are increasing, particularly habitat loss and climate change. Identifying distributional range limits of at-risk and data-limited species using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can thus inform spatial conservation planning to mitigate these threats. The Madagascar Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus radama is the resident sub-species of the Peregrine Falcon complex distributed across Madagascar, Mayotte, and the Comoros Islands. There are currently significant knowledge gaps regarding its distribution, habitat preferences, and population size. Here, we use penalized logistic regression and environmental ordination to identify Madagascar Peregrine Falcon habitat in both geographic and environmental space and propose a population size estimate based on inferred habitat. From the penalized logistic regression model, the core habitat area of the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon extends across the central and northern upland plateau of Madagascar with patchier habitat across coastal and low-elevation areas. Range-wide habitat use in both geographic and environmental space indicated positive associations with high elevation and aridity, coupled with high vegetation heterogeneity and >95% herbaceous landcover, but general avoidance of areas >30% cultivated land and >10% mosaic forest. Based on inferred high-class habitat from the penalized logistic regression model, we estimate this habitat area could potentially support a population size ranging between 150 and 300 pairs. Following IUCN Red List guidelines, this subspecies would be classed as 'Vulnerable' due to its small population size. Despite its potentially large range, the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon has specialised habitat requirements and would benefit from targeted conservation measures based on spatial models to maintain viable populations.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4 is a second-generation Chinese geostationary quantitative remote sensing meteorological satellite. To operate continuously and steadily as well as achieve the high accuracy attitude determination requirement throughout the whole remote sensing operation period, the attitude control system is capable of autonomously locating and isolating its gyroscope faults. This paper introduces its practical strategy of gyroscope bias fault diagnosis, which is based on the correlated measurement equations among those redundancy gyroscopes. The correlated measurement equation, null space vector calculation, gyroscope bias fault detection algorithms as well as its practical bias fault diagnosis strategy are presented in detail. Numerical simulation suggests that the bias fault diagnosis in Fengyun4 spacecraft could accurately detect and locate the bias fault among five redundancy gyroscopes. (C) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - The Designated Shipping Avoidance Area Around St. Lawrence Island, Northern Bering Sea, Is not Sufficient to Protect Foraging Habitat of the Island's Breeding Seabird Community
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One direct consequence of Arctic warming is the expansion of navigable portions of the Arctic Ocean. As a result, vessel traffic and the accompanying threats of spills, strikes and disturbance is intensifying throughout the Arctic. In the Bering Sea, these threats to the environment, wildlife and to the people who rely on marine resources for food and cultural continuity, are acute. We examined the spatial relevance of an Area To Be Avoided (ATBA), a shipping-risk mitigation measure, established around St. Lawrence Island with respect to seabirds, as sentinel species, habitat use. We studied four seabird species (common murre Uria aalge, thick-billed murre U. lomvia, crested auklet Aethia cristatella, black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla) breeding at St. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea. GPS tracking data from 47 at-sea foraging trips showed that both murre species and crested auklets distributed outside the ATBA, during at least one stage of the breeding season. A larger dataset based on the birds' red blood cell isotopic signatures confirmed that for murres, the tracked individuals covered the broad niche exploited by these species. Habitat modelling further showed that the birds' most suitable marine habitats were associated with seasonal surface chlorophyll blooms, and largely extended beyond the ATBA on the shelf north of the island. Data on the murres' diet and diving behavior emphasized the importance of the shelf as a foraging habitat for these birds. We suggest that extending the ATBA to the north by only 35 km, would include areas of maximal habitat suitability. This extension would better protect seabirds, their foraging habitats and the cultural continuity of St. Lawrence Islanders, against growing threats stemming from Arctic warming.

AB  - As a new type of lymphatic tracer, nano carbon has been widely used. This study mainly explores the application of nanomaterial preparation based on natural polyphenol compounds in the surgical treatment of breast cancer. The operation methods included total / near total breast ectomy, lobectomy and isthmectomy. All the patients met the above criteria after screening. The patients in the two groups were interviewed before operation and informed consent was given. The preoperative examination was actively improved and the contraindications were excluded. According to the intraoperative lymph node black staining, the lymph nodes in each area were divided into three groups: black staining in area II, non-black staining in area II, black staining in area II, non-black staining in area I, black staining in area IV and non-black staining in area IV. The patients and their families were informed before the operation, and the preventive lateral lymph node dissection was performed according to the freezing condition during the operation. Each patient expressed his understanding and signed the informed consent for the operation. During the operation, the breast gland was fully exposed after the breast pseudocapsule was free. All patients used nano-carbon injection during the operation. 0.2 ml nano carbon was injected into the gland at multiple points. After the injection, the injection point was pressed with gauze, and the black staining of the gland was observed after waiting for 3-5 min. The "refined dorsal membrane dissection" and "1 + X" method were used to preserve parabreast glands in situ. The black stained lymph nodes in the central area (confirmed by postoperative pathology) were set as sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), and the remaining lymph nodes in the dissected tissues were set as non-SLNs. There were 101 sides of cN0 microcarcinoma, 97 sides were detected with black stained lymph nodes, the median number was 7 (1-27), 63 sides had central region metastasis, the false negative rate was 14.29%, the sensitivity was 85.71%, the specificity was 100%, and the accuracy was 91.89%. This study is helpful to promote the application of nano carbon in the operation of CNO differentiated breast cancer.

TI  - Multi-scale evaluation of global evapotranspiration products derived from remote sensing images: Accuracy and uncertainty
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in satellite remote sensing (RS) techniques have greatly prompted the development of large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) models, yielding several freely available global ET products. A comprehensive evaluation on these products is necessary for selecting the most suitable ET products and developing large-scale ET models step forward. In this study, the accuracy and uncertainty of five RS-based global ET products (MOD16, SSEBop, GLEAM, AVHRR, and BESS) were evaluated at multi scales. At point scale their accuracy was evaluated through a direct comparison with in-situ observations from 94 worldwide flux towers. Results indicate that accuracy differences of these five products vary with statistical metrics and land cover types. The combination of all statistics illustrates that GLEAM and AVHRR outperform three other products, which is consistent with the findings of most previous continental-scale studies. The accuracy at basin scale was assessed through water balance analysis across 19 big river basins. BESS is found to be the product that is superior to four other ET products at both monthly and multi-annual scale, which may be related with its low random error at point scale. The uncertainty of these five products at pixel scale was assessed by the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and comparison analysis. The TCH outputs reveal that BESS and SSEBop are the two products with the lowest and largest relative uncertainty, respectively. That explains the good performance of BESS at basin scale from another perspective. As for the two MODIS-based ET products (MOD16 and SSEBop), their accuracy at FLUXNET site scale is comparable in monthly ET estimation. However, SSEBop has special advantage in the capture of multiyear ET patterns. The comparison analysis indicates that SSEBop is the product that agrees best with the ensemble mean not only on a global scale but also in four of the six continents. Our results imply that it is difficult or even impossible to figure out the best ET product in all respects. The selection of ET products for scientific research should consider their performance difference in spatial scale as well as the influence of land cover and climate conditions.

TI  - Monitoring of grassland productivity using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are a source of goods and ecosystem services. It would therefore be helpful to monitor grass growth and estimate grass productivity indicators in order to optimize grassland management over time. Until today, farmers have had to cope with a lack of regular assessments of grass availability over time across the whole farm. In order to simplify and automate grass measurements, we propose to develop methods for estimating grassland biomass using remote sensing. The aim of this study is to assess the ability of Sentinel-2 remotely sensed data to estimate grassland height as measurements in order to provide farmers with information on the quantity of grass available per agricultural plot. We propose a generic data-driven methodology to identify 1) the set of features derived from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images and 2) a regression technique, in order to yield the best performances in estimating grassland height. Before selecting a subset of features, we generated 1, 935 partly new but potentially meaningful features derived from the spectral indices available. The study was conducted between 2017 and 2020 on 18 farms located in France. The model has been tested and evaluated using the data from 2017 to 2019. The average RMSE (resp. R-2) is 1.78 +/- 0.30cm (resp. 0.70 +/- 0.12) on the test set. The RMSE is lower than 10 percent of the range width of the predicted values, indicating a very good assessment of grassland height and this is consistent with the precision required for the grassland management support service. The model has also been evaluated on the data from 2020. The correlation between measurements and estimations is encouraging with R-2 = 0.56 and RMSE = 2.1cm. The majority of the differences are between -1cm and 2cm which are relevant according to grassland management.

TI  - Spectral mixture analysis for surveillance of harmful algal blooms (SMASH): A field-, laboratory-, and satellite-based approach to identifying cyanobacteria genera from remotely sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms around the world are increasing in frequency and severity, often with the possibility of adverse effects on human and ecosystem health. The health and economic impacts associated with harmful algal blooms, or HABs, provide compelling rationale for developing new methods for monitoring these events via remote sensing. Although concentrations of chlorophyll -a and key pigments like phycocyanin are routinely estimated from satellite images and used to infer algal or cyanobacterial cell counts, current methods are unable to provide information on the taxonomic composition of a bloom. This study introduced a new approach capable of differentiating among genera based on their reflectance characteristics: Spectral Mixture Analysis for Surveil-lance of HABs, or SMASH. The foundation of SMASH is a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) algorithm that takes a library of cyanobacteria endmembers and a hyperspectral image as input and estimates the fractional abundance of each genus, plus water, on a per-pixel basis. Importantly, we assume that the water column consists of only pure water and cyanobacteria, implying that our linear spectral unmixing models do not account for other optically active constituents such as suspended sediment and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). We used reflectance spectra for 12 genera measured under a microscope to populate an algal spectral library and applied the SMASH workflow to satellite images from four waterbodies across the United States. Normalized spectral separability scores indicated that the 12 genera were distinct from one another and the MESMA algorithm reproduced known input fractions for simulated mixtures that included all pairwise combinations of genera and water. We used Upper Klamath Lake as an example to illustrate data products generated via SMASH: maps of the normalized difference chlorophyll index and cyanobacterial index, a MESMA-based classification of algal genera, fraction images for each endmember, and a root mean square error (RMSE) image that summarizes uncertainty. For Upper Klamath Lake, these outputs highlighted a complex algal bloom featuring several genera, primarily Aphanizomenon, and intricate spatial patterns associated with gyres. The maximum RMSE constraint imposed on the MESMA algorithm provided a means of avoiding false positive detection of genera not present in a waterbody but must not be set so low as to leave much of an image un-classified in cases where genera included in the library are present. Comparison of endmember fractions with relative biovolumes calculated from field samples indicated that taxonomic information from SMASH was consistent with field observations. For example, the algorithm successfully identified Microcystis in Owasco Lake but avoided misclassifying Asterionella, a genus not yet included in our library, in Detroit Lake. This proof -of-concept investigation demonstrates the potential of SMASH to enhance our understanding of algal blooms, particularly with respect to their spatial and temporal dynamics.

TI  - Assessment of relationship between young mangrove and phytoplankton abundance according to different river zoning
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton plays an important role in the food web of estuarine ecosystems and their communities assume very great ecological significance in mangrove ecosystems. Nevertheless, the disturbance levels in mangrove habitats and seasonal changes have affected phytoplankton abundance, structure, and distribution. Accordingly, the correlation between mangrove age with phytoplankton abundance has been determined in order to find the relationship between these two parameters. More interestingly, the relationship between phytoplankton abundance and river zoning is also assessed considering that high tide would have an effect on the abundance of phytoplankton due to mixing between seawater and freshwater which is considered as contributor to the growth of plankton. The results indicate that the population and compactness of phytoplankton appear higher at the younger mangrove area compared to mature area. This condition is due to the shading produced by the canopy at older mangrove sites, which reduces light availability in the creeks and suppresses phytoplankton growth. The results also discovered that the lowest abundance of phytoplankton is located at upstream of young mangrove areas, while the highest abundance of phytoplankton is located at downstream due to having been carried away by the current heading towards the ocean. This verifies that mangrove age affects the abundance of phytoplankton based on different river zonings. Significantly, the findings will assist the Department of Fisheries Malaysia and agritourism by providing scientific data which will facilitate the maintenance of the mangrove ecosystem and enhance the fishing industry within the area.

TI  - A model-backfeed deformation estimation method for revealing 20-year surface dynamics of the Groningen gas field using multi-platform SAR imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Groningen gas field, the largest natural gas field in Europe, was discovered in 1959 and started its production in 1963. The Earth surface above it experienced subsidence over the past six decades because of gas extraction activities. To accurately reveal this surface movement with satellite SAR data, our study first proposes and demonstrates a model-backfeed (MBF) InSAR deformation estimation method to improve InSAR deformation time series modeling. This method allowed us to include a priori knowledge and to iteratively optimize functional and stochastic models. Using this method and employing a spatio-temporal SAR data integration method based upon Monte Carlo and Multiple Hypothesis Testing methods, we retrieved the 20-year subsidence history of the Groningen gas field by integrating 32 ERS-1/2, 68 Envisat and 82 Radarsat-2 SAR images. The results show that the maximum cumulative surface subsidence in this gas field has been as much as 15.5 cm between 1995 and 2015. In terms of precision and accuracy, our MBF method offered a better result than the standard Multi Temporal InSAR analysis method: the Ensemble Coherence increased by 10%-19% and Spatio-Temporal Consistency decreased by 2%-20%. In terms of accuracy, our results better concur with the external GNSS reference observations. We further show that the spatio-temporal SAR data integration method has better links with multi platform SAR data if the uncertainties of the InSAR geolocation and temporal deformation are included. The study demonstrates that the MBF method optimized the estimation of deformation parameters and mitigated unwrapping errors.

TI  - Urban sprawl analysis and shoreline extraction in Douala-Cameroon city using optical and radar sensors
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal city of Douala is seriously undergoing unplanned urban sprawl due to industrialisation and urbanisation. At the same time, the seal level is fluctuating, modifying the shoreline. This paper extracts the up-to-date shoreline adjacent to the city boundary, quantifies and maps the dynamics of urban sprawl from 1986 to 2020 using both optical and radar sensors. The patterns and trends of urban sprawl are assessed using the post-classification technique. The main land cover units (built-up area, water body and non-built-up area) are calculated for 1986, 2007, 2015 and 2020. Results show that over the study period (34 years), the built-up areas have been dramatically increased by 140% from 78 to 109 km(2). In additional, the shoreline position has significantly changed during the same period. The current position is detected and mapped as accurate as possible from the Landsat OLI 2022 image using a joint GIS-remote sensing approach. These findings are of paramount importance for the integrated management of such a coastal city.

TI  - Does the traffic volume of a port determine connectivity? Revisiting port connectivity measures with high-frequency satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seaports play an important role in the global shipping network. Shipping participants often attach great importance to the measurement of container port connectivity, as it reflects countries' access to world markets. As a result, various port connectivity index systems have been proposed by members of the shipping industry and scholars. In recent years, technological developments especially the advancement of high coverage and real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, have provided a chance to improve the scope and frequency of the existing index systems. An improved system is expected to reflect the dynamic changes in a port's connectivity which may be induced by either local disruptions or shocks in the wider economy. This study builds a monthly container port connectivity index system by applying big data mining techniques, graph theory, and principal component analysis (PCA) to AIS data, taking both port factors and shipping network factors into consideration. AIS records from 2020 are used to calculate the connectivity score of 25 major container ports. We also compare our system with the connectivity index commonly used in the shipping industry, the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI). Our results show that the measurement of connectivity can be improved over indices that depend primarily on indicators of traffic volume. Ports like Antwerp and Tanjung Pelepas rank high in the proposed system due to their sound performance on their accessibility and strategic position in the local region instead of their traffic volume. The monthly index system is also proven to reflect timely changes in the shipping industry through its accurate portrayal of changes in port connectivity during the COVID-19 outbreak.

TI  - Utilization of the Long Short-Term Memory network for predicting streamflow in ungauged basins in Korea
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological prediction is essential for managing and preserving headwater, wetland, and rural basins, yet it is difficult due to a lack of data. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is a promising deep learning approach and has demonstrated excellent performance in streamflow prediction. However, due to the characteristics that require abundant and high-quality observations, most LSTM applications focus on investigating performance for data-rich basins. To investigate the applicability of LSTM in ungauged basins without hydrological observations, we introduce and test an approach to predict streamflow in ungauged basins using the LSTM network that has learned the integration of data from multiple gauged basins. Four learning strategies are constructed using various datasets such as ground-observed meteorological data, satellite data, and hydrogeomorphological characteristics. As a result, the LSTM network that learned the meteorological data in multiple gauged basins satisfactorily predicted streamflow in ungauged basins. The LSTM network that learned the satellite data further showed affirmative results. On the other hand, the LSTM, which additionally learned the hydro-geomorphological characteristics of the basins, exposed the need for improvement, such as securing additional various types of training data. In addition, it was recognized that additional efforts were needed to solve overfitting and out-of-distribution prediction problems. However, this approach achieved model performance deriving metrics above threshold values. These results show the potential of LSTM for streamflow prediction in ungauged basins including wetlands.

T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The recent studies of the variations in the atmospheric column-averaged CO2 concentration (X-CO2) above croplands and forests show a negative correlation between X(CO2)and Sun Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and confirmed that photosynthesis is the main regulator of the terrestrial uptake for atmospheric CO2. The remote sensing techniques in this context are very important to observe this relation, however, there is still a time gap in orbital data, since the observation is not daily. Here we analyzed the effects of several variables related to the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation on X-CO2 above Sao Paulo state during the period from 2015 to 2019 and propose a daily model to estimate the natural changes in atmospheric CO2.Results: The data retrieved from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), NASA-POWER and Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS) show that Global Radiation (Qg), Sun Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and, Relative Humidity (RH) are the most significant factors for predicting the annual X-CO2 cycle. The daily model of X-CO2 estimated from Qg and RH predicts daily X-CO2 with root mean squared error of 0.47 ppm (the coefficient of determination is equal to 0.44, p <0.01).Conclusion: The obtained results imply that a significant part of daily X-CO2 variations could be explained by meteorological factors and that further research should be done to quantify the effects of the atmospheric transport and anthropogenic emissions.

T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, machine learning algorithms are considered a powerful tool for analyzing big and complex data due to their ability to deliver accurate and fast results. The main objective of the present study is to prove the effectiveness of the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) method as well as employed data types in the Saharan region mapping. To reveal the potential of the XGBoost, we conducted two experiments. The first was to use different combinations of: airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data, airborne magnetic data, Landsat 8 data and digital elevation model. The objective is to train 9 XGBoost models in order to determine each data type sensitivity in capturing the lithological rock classes. The second experiment was to compare the XGBoost to deep neural networks (DNN) to display its potential against other machine learning algorithms. Compared to the existing geological map, the application of XGBoost reveals a great potential for geological mapping as it was able to achieve a correlation score of (78%) where igneous and metamorphic rocks are easily identified compared to sedimentary rocks. In addition, using different data combinations reveals airborne magnetic data utility to discriminate some lithological units. It also reveals the potential of the apparent density, derived from airborne magnetic data, to improve the algorithm's accuracy up to 20%. Furthermore, the second experiment in this study indicates that the XGBoost is a better choice for the geological mapping task compared to the DNN. The obtained predicted map shows that the XGBoost method provides an efficient tool to update existing geological maps and to edit new geological maps in the region with well outcropped rocks.

TI  - Surface biophysical features fusion in remote sensing for improving land crop/cover classification accuracy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Preparing up-to-date land cap/cover maps is important to study in order to achieve food security. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of surface biophysical features in the land cap/cover classification accuracy and introduce a new fusion-based method with more accurate results for land crop/cover classification. For this purpose, multi-temporal images from Sentinel 1 and 2, and an actual land crop map prepared by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) in 2019 were used for 3 test sites in Ontario, Canada. Firstly, surface biophysical features maps were prepared based on spectral indices from Sentinel 2 including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), Wetness, Albedo, and Brightness and co-polarization (VV) and cross-polarization (VH) from Sentinel 1 for different dates. Then, different scenarios were generated; these included single surface biophysical features as well as a combination of several surface biophysical features. Secondly, land crop/cover maps were prepared for each scenario based on the Random Forest (RF). In the third step, based on the voting strategy, classification maps from different scenarios were combined. Finally, the accuracy of the land crop/cover maps obtained from each of the scenario was evaluated. The results showed that the average overall accuracy of land crop/cover maps obtained from individual scenario (one feature) including NDVI, IBI, Wetness, Albedo, Brightness, VV and VH were 66%, 68%, 63%,60%, 57%, 62%and 58%, respectively, which by the surface biophysical features fusion, the overall accuracy of land crop/cover maps increased to 83%. Also, by combining the classification results obtained from different scenarios based on voting strategy, the overall accuracy increased to 89%. The results of this study indicate that the feature level-based fusion of surface biophysical features and decision level based fusion of land crop/cover maps obtained from various scenarios increases the accuracy of land crop/cover classification.

AB  - Human activities impact hydrology through changes in land use and land cover. This study examins the effects of changing land use on hydrological processes using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model. The data is acquired from Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) in 1989, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) in 2005, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Inventory (OLI) in 2019. Image preprocessing, which includes geo-referencing, radiometric and atmospheric correction, image enhancement, band composite, mosaicking, and sub-setting, are performed. After that, supervised classification, accuracy assessment, and change detection are carried out. The hydrological changes in 1989, 2005, and 2019 are analyzed using land-use maps. The SWAT model's calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis are performed using the Integrated Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Tool in the four main rivers of the basin. Farmlands and built-up lands are found to have steadily increased in the basin, while shrublands, grasslands, and bare lands declined. Due to an expansion of agricultural and built-up lands and a decrease in shrublands and grasslands, the basin's mean annual water yield and surface runoff increased in 2019, while evapotranspiration and lateral flow decreased compared to 1989 and 2005. Therefore, future watershed and basin management shall consider changing land use.

TI  - Small Area Estimation in Diverse Timber Types Using Multiple Sources of Auxiliary Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Informed forest management requires reliable information. As the demand for finer scale estimates has increased, so has the cost for obtaining them from design-based ground sampling. Small area estimation (SAE) is an estimation technique that leverages ancillary information to augment design-based samples with the goal of increasing estimate precision without increasing ground-based sample intensities. This work presents three case studies spanning an industrial timberland ownership in the United States making use of SAE techniques in operational forest inventories. Case studies include an inventory of pre-thin plantation loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands that had achieved crown closure in Alabama and Mississippi, a mixed pine-hardwood inventory in Alabama, and pre-thinning plantation Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in Washington State. Using area-level SAE techniques, vegetation indices derived from 10 m Sentinel imagery were shown to reduce estimate uncertainty for common stand parameters. Additionally, when available, lidar and age were shown to offer additional improvements in estimate precision. The results of this study indicate the operational potential for using commonly available auxiliary data for producing forest parameter estimates with enhanced precision. The implications of these findings span multiple inventory objectives including, for example, commercial forest management, carbon accounting, and wildfire fuel assessments. Study Implications: Forest management requires reliable quantitative information for informed decisions. Data from ground-based forest inventories are commonly used to construct design-unbiased direct estimates. Due to logistical and cost constraints, samples often do not provide estimates with sufficient precision for making confident decisions. The statistical estimation procedure, small area estimation, is able to leverage linearly related ancillary data across areas of interest to form composite estimates that have less uncertainty than direct estimates alone. This study shows how combining ground-based data with auxiliary data from remote sensing and stand records produced more precise estimates of forest stand parameters in three distinct timber types spanning a large ownership in the United States. Results indicate that significant inventory efficiency and confidence can be realized by incorporating commonly available auxiliary data into the estimation of forest characteristics.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is located in Vietnam Study focus: The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) region has one of the leading productions of rice in the world and it stands at the intersection of extreme anthropogenic activity and climate change. To this end, the major focus of this study is to explore the changes in land use, climate, water resources, and their inter-relationship, which are intended to showcase the ability of publicly available earth observations and models in improving understanding of the past changes and future scenarios and contribute to improved decision making. We analyzed the change of agricultural crops (single, double, and triple) and climatic parameters (precipitation, and land surface temperature, and evapotranspiration). Consequently, we used Soil and Water Assessment Tool Model (SWAT) and selected six GCMs for extreme climate to investigate the change of streamflow.New hydrological insights: Our results indicated that double rice crop and aquaculture are the top two land use categories in the VMD, the areas of triple rice crop have increased significantly, especially for the An Giang and Dong Thap provinces. However, by examining the climate, water, and land data analytics, we see challenges in the expansion of triple rice crop over VMD. The spatio-temporal changes in climate variables and future streamflow projections provide strong evidence to water resources managers and decision-makers in the VMD.

TI  - Large-scale dynamic flood monitoring in an arid-zone floodplain using SAR data and hybrid machine-learning models
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the growing number of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites has increased their application in flood-extent mapping, predictive models for the analysis of flood dynamics that are independent of sensor characteristics must be developed to fully extract information from SAR images for flood mitigation. This study aimed to develop hybrid machine-learning models for flood mapping in the Ahvaz region, Iran, based on SAR data. Each hybrid model consists of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm coupled with one of the following metaheuristic optimization procedures: grey wolf optimization (GWO), differential evolution, and the imperialist competitive algorithm. Sentinel-1 acquired SAR images before and during flooding between 20 March and 26 May of 2019. The goodness-of-fit level and predictive capability of each model were scrutinized using overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. The SVM-GWO approach yielded the highest accuracy with overall accuracies of 96.07% and 93.39% in the training and validation steps, respectively. Furthermore, this hybrid model provided the most accurate classification of water-inundation class based on producer accuracy (96.67%) and user accuracy (95.05%). The results highlight that wetland is the last land-use/land-cover type to return to normal conditions due to the many previously dry oxbow lakes that could trap water for a long time. Furthermore, the nine most suitable sites for flood-protection structures (e.g., embankments and levees) were identified based on floodwater distribution analysis. This work describes a robust, data-parsimonious approach that will benefit flood mitigation studies seeking to identify the most suitable locations for embankments based on spatio-temporal flood dynamics.

TI  - Monitoring the abundance of saproxylic red-listed species in a managed beech forest by landsat temporal metrics
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rapid climate changes lead to an increase in forest disturbance, which in turn lead to growing concerns for biodiversity. While saproxylic beetles are relevant indicators for studying different aspects of biodiversity, most are smaller than 2 mm and difficult to sample. This, together with a high number of species and trophic roles, make their study remarkably challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. The Landsat mission provides data since 1984 and represents a powerful tool in this scenario. While we believe that remote sensing data cannot replace on-site sampling and analysis, in this study we aim to prove that the Landsat Time Series (TS) may support the identification of insects??? hotspots and consequently guide the selection of areas where to concentrate field analysis. Methods: With this aim, we constructed a Landsat-derived NDVI TS (1984???2020) and we summarised the NDVI trend over time by calculating eight Temporal Metrics (TMs) among which four resulted particularly successful in predicting the amount of saproxylic insects: (i) the slope of the regression line obtained by linear interpolating the NDVI values over time; (ii) the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the regression line and the NDVI TS; (iii) the median, and the (iv) minimum values of the NDVI TS. The study area consists of four monitoring sectors in a Mediterranean-managed beech forest located in the Apennines (Molise, Italy), where 60 window flight traps for flying beetles were installed. First, the saproxylic beetle's biodiversities of monitoring sectors were quantified in terms of species richness and alpha-diversity. Second, the capability of TMs in predicting the richness of saproxylic beetles family and trophic categories was assessed in terms of Pearson's product-moment correlation. Results: The alpha diversity and species richness analysis indicate dissimilarities across the four monitored sectors (Shannon and Simpson's index ranging between 0.67 to 2.31 and 0.69 to 0.88, respectively), with Landsat TS resulting in effective predictors for estimating saproxylic beetle richness. The strongest correlation was reached between the Monotomidae family and the RMSE temporal metric (R 1/4 0.66). The mean absolute correlation (r) between the NDVI TMs and the saproxylic community was 0.46 for Monotomidae, 0.31 for Cerambycidae, and 0.25 for Curculionidae. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Landsat TS has important implications for studying saproxylic beetle distribution and, by helping the selection of monitoring areas, increasing the amount of information acquired while decreasing the effort required for field analysis.

TI  - Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle DEM in flood modeling and comparison with global DEMs: Case study of Atrak River Basin, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) play a significant role in hydraulic modeling and flood risk management. This study initially investigated the effect of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) DEM resolutions, ranging from 1 m to 30 m, on flood characteristics, including the inundation area, mean flow depth, and mean flow velocity. Then, the errors of flood characteristics for global DEMs, comprising ALOS (30 m), ASTER (30 m), SRTM (30 m), and TDX (12 m) were quantified using UAV DEM measurements. For these purposes, the HEC-RAS 2D model in steady-state conditions was used to simulate the flood with return periods of 5- to 200 years along 20 km reach of Atrak River located in northeastern Iran. Results indicated when UAV DEM resolution decreased from 1 m to 30 m, inundation area and mean flow depth increased 17.0% (R-2 = 0.94) and 10.2% (R-2 = 0.96) respectively, while mean flow velocity decreased 16.8% (R-2 = -0.94). Validation of the hydraulic modeling using the modified normalized difference water index demonstrated that the HEC-RAS 2D model in conjunction with UAV DEM simulates the flood with similar to 92% accuracy. Comparing the global DEMs with UAV DEM showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) values of the flow depth for ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, and TDX DEMs were 1.77, 1.12, 1.02, and 0.93 m, and the RMSE values of the flow velocity for the same DEMs were 0.81, 0.66, 0.55, and 0.47 m/s, respectively. Furthermore, TDX DEM with a 6.15% error in the inundation area was the nearest to UAV measurements. Overall, TDX DEM revealed a better performance in hydraulic modeling of the fluvial flood characteristics. Hence, it is recommended for environments where high-resolution topography data is scarce. The results of this study could potentially serve as a guideline for selecting global DEMs for hydraulic simulations.

TI  - Monitoring drought impacts on crop productivity of the US Midwest with solar-induced fluorescence: GOSIF outperforms GOME-2 SIF and MODIS NDVI, EVI, and NIRv
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and severity of drought are increasing in the context of global warming. Elucidating the responses of crop productivity to drought is essential for informing agricultural management and ensuring food security. Here we used satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data and vegetation indices to evaluate the impacts of the 2012 drought on crop productivity in the U.S. Midwest. We used SIF from the global, OCO-2 based SIF product (GOSIF; 0.05 degrees, 8-day), GOME-2 SIF product (0.5 degrees, monthly), and three MODIS-derived vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, and NIRv). We compared the seasonal cycles and anomalies of SIF and VIs from 2008 to 2018. We also examined to what extent these proxies could capture the variations of gross primary production (GPP) for eddy covariance flux sites. SIF and VIs were able to capture the seasonal cycle in drought and normal years. SIF better captured the photosynthesis changes due to water and heat stresses than vegetation indices. In particular, GOSIF data with the finer spatio-temporal resolution was a good monitor of crop response to drought. Crop yield decreased by 25% in the 2012 drought relative to the multi-year mean, while GOSIF, NDVI, EVI, and NIRv reduced by 22%, 4%, 10%, and 8%, respectively. GOSIF had the strongest relationship with crop yield (R2 = 0.91), followed by NIRv (R2 = 0.89), EVI (R2 = 0.68) and NDVI (R2 = 0.48). Compared to the crop yield data, the mean difference of the yield estimates based on GOSIF, EVI, and NIRv were 379.32, 328.43, and 503.67 kg/ha, respectively. For both corn and soybeans, yield anomalies were better correlated with GOSIF anomalies than with NIRv and EVI anomalies. Our study demonstrated that SIF with finer spatio-temporal resolution has great potential for monitoring the responses of crop productivity to drought.

TI  - Plasmatic B-esterases as potential biomarkers of exposure to marine plastics in loggerhead turtles
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea turtles are particularly vulnerable to plastic exposures, and the associated chemical additives, due to their feeding strategies. The species Caretta caretta is a proposed sentinel of plastic pollution worldwide. Thus, there is a need to find adequate biomarkers of plastic exposure through non-invasive protocols for this IUCN protected species. Plasmatic acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and carboxylesterase (CE) which participate in xenobiotic and endogenous metabolic reactions could all serve as biomarkers, as they are responsive to plasticizers and have already proved adequate for identifying organophosphorus esters exposures. Here we measured plasmatic B-esterases in wild specimens captured as accidental by-catch. Measurements were taken in each individual either at entry into the rehabilitation program or immediately before release after a recovery period. For CE measurements, 4 commercial substrates were used as potentially indicative of distinct enzyme isoforms. Increased activity was seen with the butyrate-derived substrates. Plasmatic CE activities were over one order of magnitude higher than AChE and BuChE substrates. Moreover, an in vitro protocol with the inclusion of plastic additives such as tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), bisphenol A and some of its analogues was considered a proxy of enzymatic interactions. A clear inhibition by TBBPA was found when using commercially purified AChE and recombinant CE proteins. Overall, from in vitro and in vivo evidences, CEs in plasma are sensitive and easily measurable and have been shown to significantly increase after turtles have been rehabilitated in rescue centres. Nevertheless, the inclusion of plastic (or plasticizers) characterisation would help to confirm its association with plasmatic enzyme modifications before they can be adopted as biomarkers of plastic contamination.

AB  - This study compares the capability of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and ASTER multispectral data in mapping lithological units in the Bukadaban Peak, China, by evaluating the performance of the Random Forest (RF) classifier. Moreover, the study assesses the importance of remote sensing original bands and the bands derived from enhancement techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) to the classification process. Results revealed that RF selected PC8, PC9, PC12, and MNF1 as the most important features in the Sentinel-2 dataset. Several MNF bands of ASTER were more important than the original and PC bands. The original bands were the strongest predictors in Landsat-8 dataset, while PC2, PC5, and MNF5 were relatively significant. Sentinal-2 and ASTER datasets achieved very similar classification accuracy but outperformed Landsat-8 dataset. ASTER dataset yielded the highest overall accuracy 81.8%, which is 0.18% higher than Sentinel-2 and 3.86% higher than Landsat-8.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the distribution and quantity of soil properties is important for black soil protection, management, and restoration in northeastern China. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the spatial resolution on soil pH mapping using satellite images of the black soil region in northeastern China. A high spatial resolution Gaofen (GF)-2 high-definition image and multispectral images acquired by the Landsat 8 operational land imager and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument were used to compare their performance in soil pH prediction. The spectral variables, including the original bands of the three satellite images and a variety of spectral indices derived from the original bands, were employed. Then, a machine learning model (quantile regression forest) was used to determine the relationships between the spectral variables and the measured soil pH, and prediction models were established to estimate the soil pH and to characterize the spatial pattern of the soil pH. The results revealed that the soil pH prediction model based on the GF-2 image had a slightly higher prediction accuracy than the models constructed using the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. The prediction models for Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and GF-2 had root mean square errors of 0.34, 0.39, and 0.31, respectively. The use of remote sensing images with a high spatial resolution may not substantially increase the prediction accuracy of soil pH mapping compared with the results derived from medium-resolution images.

TI  - A twenty-years remote sensing study reveals changes to alpine pastures under asymmetric climate warming
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological records over the past five decades have shown that climate warming has been faster during the nighttime than during the daytime. However, the responses of vegetation development to asymmetric warming are not well understood due to the misinterpretation of phenology that have resulted from the snowmelt effect. We applied normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) sources from Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS:1982-2015) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS: 2000-2020) to reveal maximum greenness in high-mountain Asia (HMA). The snow-free normalized difference phenology index (NDPI), which is a 3-band vegetation index that designed to best contrast vegetation from soil and snow, was applied for estimating the start of the growing season (SOS). We found that alpine pastures in HMA generally became greener and the SOS was delayed. Preseason daytime temperatures (Tday) and nighttime temperatures (Tnight) had opposite effects on maximum greenness, with Tday being negative and Tnight being positive. The responses of SOS to Tday and Tnight were highly related with the frequency of meteorological drought events during 2000-2020. In regions with lower frequency of drought events, both daytime and nighttime warming could advance SOS. In regions with higher frequency of drought events, daytime warming could delay SOS, but nighttime warming could advance SOS. The results of our study are of great significance to understand the responses of alpine ecosystems to asymmetric climate warming. Such an understanding is quite valuable for pasture management and future vegetation climate projections.

TI  - Ethnic diversity and forest commons
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of forest commons requires coordination within a community and between communities. This coordination is usually challenging given the incentives for free riding. The literature suggests that communities with heterogeneous members, particularly from different ethnic groups, are less effective in commons management and public goods provision. In this paper, we empirically test if forest degradation differs within and between ethnically diverse communities. Using data for the majority of villages in rural Gambia, our first set of results suggest that ethno-linguistic fractionalization within villages correlates with a reduction in forest cover and an increase in forest loss over a period of 15 years. Then, we propose a new approach to assess forest management between heterogeneous communities. Forest units within exclusively shared territory between pairs of neighboring villages are defined by dyadic polygons, which are used to apply dyadic regression methods. In our second set of results, we find evidence suggesting that spaces shared between ethnically distant communities exhibit higher forest cover and lower forest loss. Further analyses suggest that the effect of ethnic distance on reduced forest degradation is present mainly when villages are heterogeneous in other characteristics as well. Our study motivates the identification of relevant spaces for the analysis of competition over local commons, providing a novel approach of potential interest to applications beyond our area of study.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impacts of climate changes are particularly severe in polar regions where warmer temperatures and reductions in sea-ice covers threaten the ecological integrity of marine coastal ecosystems. Because of their wide distribution and their ecological importance, mussels are currently used as sentinel organisms in monitoring programs of coastal ecosystems around the world. In the present study, we exploited the concept of liquid biopsy combined to a logistically friendly sampling method to study the hemolymphatic bacterial microbiome in two mussel species (Aulacomya atra and Mytilus platensis) in Kerguelen Islands, a remote Subantarctic volcanic archipelago. We found that the circulating microbiome signatures of both species differ significantly even though their share the same mussel beds. We also found that the microbiome differs significantly between sampling sites, often correlating with the particularity of the ecosystem. Predictive models also revealed that both species have distinct functional microbiota, and that the circulating microbiome of Aulacomya atra was more sensitive to changes induced by acute thermal stress when compared to Mytilus platensis. Taken together, our study suggests that defining circulating microbiome is a useful tool to assess the health status of marine ecosystems and to better understand the interactions between the sentinel species and their habitat.

TI  - Fruit bat migration matches green wave in seasonal landscapes
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Migrating grazers and carnivores respond to seasonal changes in the environment and often match peaks in resource abundance. However, it is unclear whether and how frugivorous animals use phenological events to time migration, especially in the tropics. The straw-coloured fruit bat Eidolon helvum, Africa's most gregarious fruit bat, forms large seasonal colonies throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that aggregations of E. helvum match the timing of their migration with phenologies of plant growth or precipitation. Using monthly colony counts from across much of the species' range, we matched peak colony size to landscape phenologies and explored the variation among colonies matching the overall closest phenological event. Peak colony size was closest to the peak instantaneous rate of green-up, and sites with closer temporal matching were associated with higher maximum greenness, short growing season and larger peak colony size. Eidolon helvum seem to time their migrations to move into highly seasonal landscapes to exploit short-lived explosions of food and may benefit from collective sensing to time migrations. The link between rapid changes in colony size and phenological match may also imply potential collective sensing of the environment. Overall decreasing bat numbers along with various threats might cause this property of large colonies to be lost. Remote sensing data, although, indirectly linked to fruiting events, can potentially be used to globally describe and predict the migration of frugivorous species in a changing world.

TI  - Analysis of support vector machine and maximum likelihood classifiers in land cover classification using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data has been widely applied to classify the land cover more frequently and on a near real-time basis for updating as it is more economic, less time consuming compared to ground based survey. Accurate classification of the land use/cover classes such as water body, cropland, built-up area, scrub land, fallow land, forest etc., is one of the biggest challenges in natural resource inventory, management and monitoring. As accuracy of remote sensing data classification is affected by many parameters which include type of data, presence of heterogeneous landscapes in study area, classification approaches etc., as satellite imagery is complex in nature. Many classifiers have been developed and tested on remotely sensed data for better classification. Classification of remote sensing data is mainly divided into two categories such as supervised and unsupervised. In supervised classification, the decision boundaries in feature space are determined by training the samples. Two supervised classifiers namely maximum likelihood (ML) classifier, which is a parametric classifier that assumes data to be normally distributed, and support vector machine classifier (SVM) which is a non-parametric classifier are used in classification. In the present study, the accuracy of these two classifiers is studied on five different data sets of Sentinel-2 satellite image of different years and sessions to accommodate intra and inter annual variations of the datasets. Sentinel-2 satellite images covering part of Nagpur, located in Maharashtra, India were used for the classification. Classifier accuracy has been calculated using overall accuracy and kappa statistics based on ground truth information. The result obtained were carefully examined by comparing classification accuracies and then by visual analysis. The result shows that SVM classifiers gives better overall accuracy and kappa coefficients and its average value for intra and inter annual classification outputs were 91.78% and 0.89 in that order which is far better than ML classifier which gave 87.07% and 0.83 respectively. The experimental results obtained from the present study, it is clear that SVM classifier produced better accuracy than ML classifier in classifying Sentinel-2 optical image and have significant potential in classifying various land cover classes in the heterogeneous land use/land cover conditions of the tropical regime.

TI  - When family interrupted work: The implications of gendered role perception in the face of COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals are confronted with the work-from-home challenge, which often results in work-family interference. Although prior to COVID-19, the influence of traditional gender role expectations was shown to be reduced over time, it is unclear whether and how such traditional worldview might influence judgments towards men and women when family interrupted work under the threat of COVID-19. This study presented and tested competing predictions derived from the gender role theory. An experimental study with 971 adults showed that during (vs. before) COVID-19 pandemic, men were evaluated more negatively when they experienced family interruption to work compared with women. The negative evaluation further led to more punitive reactions and less support at work. The results suggested that gender role expectations reinforced the traditional status quo by punishing status-quo-breakers under the threat of COVID-19.

TI  - Coseismic DInSAR Analysis of the 2020 Petrinja Earthquake Sequence
T2  - PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA-CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric SAR analysis provides an excellent opportunity to perform large-scale and rapid coseismic deformation mapping. Between December 28-30, 2020, three earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4.3 occurred during the 2020 Petrinja Earthquake Sequence near Petrinja in Croatia, resulting in significant coseismic deformation. Considering both the available ascending and descending Sentinel-1A/B images preceding and following the Petrinja Earthquake Sequence, 2.5D differential interferometric analysis was performed to determine the resulting deformation field, which have significant importance in civil engineering related countermeasures and hazard assessment. With the applied methodology, the derived horizontal and vertical deformation fields can be characterized by a maximum of ??0.43 m local East-West, a maximum of 0.15 m local subsidence and a maximum of 0.19 m local vertical uplift near Petrinja.

TI  - Angiotensin II in Patients With Shock on Mechanical Circulatory Support: A Single-Center Retrospective Case Senes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To describe angiotensin II (ANGII) use in patients on mechanical circulatory support (MCS). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANGII in patients with shock on MCS.Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: A single-center, quaternary care academic medical center.Participants: The study comprised critically ill patients on MCS.Interventions: None.Measurements and Main Results: Fourteen patients were included in this retrospective analysis. The median age was 54 years (44.8, 68.3) and 78.6% were men. Six patients were receiving venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, 4 patients were receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and 4 patients were on left ventricular assist devices. Five patients (36%) achieved hemodynamic response to ANGII at 3 hours, defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >= 65 mmHg or a 10-mmHg increase in MAP with a decrease or no change in total vasopressor dose. Overall, the median MAP increased from 61 mmHg (51, 73) at baseline to 66 mmHg (58, 71) at 3 hours, and the median norepinephrine dose decreased from 0.45 mu g/kg/min (0.28, 0.6) at baseline to 0.2 mu g/kg/min (0.18, 0.32) at 3 hours. The in-hospital mortality rate was 78.6%. Two patients experienced severe adverse drug events and 1 patient had a sentinel thrombotic event.Conclusions: This study suggested that ANGII may provide a salvage treatment option in patients on MCS with refractory vasodilatory shock. There are several safety considerations with the use of ANGII in these patients. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANGII in patients on MCS.

TI  - Models for predicting bulinids species habitats in southwestern Nigeria
T2  - PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Schistosomiasis prevalence is high in southwestern Nigeria and planorbids of the genus Bulinus had been implicated in the transmission of the disease in the area. The knowledge of species distribution in relation to environmental variables will be auspicious in planning control strategies.Methods: Satellite imagery and geographic information system (GIS) were used to develop models for predicting the habitats suitable for bulinid species. Monthly snail sample collection was done in twenty-three randomly selected water contact sites using the standard method for a period of two years. Remotely sensed variables such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were extracted from Landsat TM, ETM+; Slope and Elevation were obtained from digital elevation model (DEM) while Rainfall was retrieved from European Meteorology Research Program. These environmental factors and snail species were integrated into QGIS to predict the potential habitats of different bulinid species using an exploratory regression model.Results: The following environmental variables: flat-moderate slope (0.01-15.83), LST (21.1 degrees C-23.4 degrees C), NDVI (0.19-0.52), rainfall (> 1569.34 mm) and elevation (1-278 m) contributed to the model used in predicting habitat suitable for bulinids snail intermediate hosts. Exploratory regression models showed that LST, NDVI and slope were predictors of Bulinus globosus and Bulinus jousseaumei; elevation, LST, rainfall and slope were predictors of Bulinus camerunensis; rainfall, NDVI and slope were predictors of B. senegalensis while NDVI and slope were predictors of Bulinus forskalii in the area. Bulinids in the forskalii group showed clustering in middle belt and south. The predictive risk map of B. jousseaumei was similar to the pattern described for B. globosus, but with a high R-square value of 81%.Conclusion: The predictive risk models of bulinid species in this study provided a robust output for the study area which could be used as base-line for other areas in that ecological zone. It will be useful in appropriate allocation of scarces resources in the control of schistosomiasis in that environment.

TI  - Use of Sentinel 2 imagery to estimate vegetation height in fragments of Atlantic Forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on vegetation height can be used in a variety of applications, but the high cost to obtain it in large areas using field sampling and the latest remote sensing technologies is still a barrier for low-income countries and organizations. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we explored the possibility to estimate vegetation height in fragments of Atlantic Forest (Sao Paulo -Brazil) based on Sentinel 2 imagery, using LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and field data as reference. The initial results showed that only wet season images appear to be related to the vegetation height, especially band 5 (red-edge) and related vegetation indices (VIs). Predictions made with Sentinel 2 and LiDAR data showed that vegetation height can be estimated with a root mean square error (RMSE) close to 3 m, with simple linear models outperforming random forest algorithms. It's also shown in a variety of validation tests, that although better results are obtained if the models are applied to the same images they were trained in, they are still able to reasonably predict vegetation height when applied to other images and locations if the right predictive variables are used. The results agree with recent studies made in other biomes and show that Sentinel 2 imagery can be used to estimate vegetation height in the Atlantic Forest as well. We conclude that vegetation height estimates with linear models can be used as a simple low cost alter-native for future applications in this environment.

TI  - Monitoring snow cover in the Himalayan-Karakoram basins using AWiFS data: significant outcomes
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover, the second largest component of the Earth's cryosphere, controls the hydrology of basins, mass balance of glaciers and climate at the local, regional and global scale. Therefore, it is regularly observed through the Earth Observation (EO) dataset at fine, medium and coarse resolution to understand the impact of its variability in land-atmospheric interactions. The present study analyses of the variability of snow cover area within the Himalayan-Karakoram (H-K) region based on snow products generated by the NDSI approach using data from AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat satellites at an interval of five and ten days. The study covers 33 sub-basins of the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra basins in the H-K region. For analysis and presentation, results of the Indus basin have been further divided as Indus-North, Indus-South, Chenab and Satluj basins due to the large basin area. A high spatial and temporal variability in the seasonal snow area was observed in the entire H- K region based on the sub-basin-wise 35,910 snow cover products generated between 2004 and 2019. A higher percentage of snow area in the Karakoram region than in the other sub-basins was observed throughout the years. Though interannual trends of snow cover area remained more or less stable in all the basins, a decreasing trend was observed in October in a few basins and an increase in snow area in the Indus-North region during December and January.

TI  - Integrating climate and satellite remote sensing data for predicting county-level wheat yield in China using machine learning methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Early and reliable crop yield prediction on a large scale is imperative for making in-season crop management decisions as well as for ensuring global food security. The integrated use of climate and remote sensing data for predicting yield at regional and national scales has been previously investigated in various parts of the world. However, such attempts for national scale yield prediction, particularly in different planting zones in China have been rarely reported. For this purpose, this study explored the potential of nine climate variables, three remote sensing-derived metrics, and three machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for predicting wheat yield based on data acquired during 2002-2010 from 1582 counties across China's three wheat planting zones. Our results illustrated large spatial divergences for yield prediction. The best performance (R-2 = 0.79 and R-2 = 0.66) was achieved for the northern winter wheat and northern spring wheat planting zones, respectively. Water-related climatic variables outperformed temperature-related variables, with the best individual predictive performance (R-2 = 0.67). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence had better performance (R-2 = 0.60) for predicting the crop yield than NDVI and EVI. Climate data across the whole growing season has provided additional information for yield prediction as compared to remote sensing data. The additional contribution for yield prediction in winter wheat planting zones benefiting from climate data decreased from sowing to maturity, which was the opposite in remote sensing data. Typically, the support vector machine outperformed other models and the prediction in winter wheat planting zones performed better than the spring wheat planting zone. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating climate and remote sensing data for accurate county-level yield prediction in China. These kinds of simple and scalable machine learning methods could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisors.

TI  - Performance characterization of low-cost air quality sensors for off-grid deployment in rural Malawi
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-cost gas and particulate matter sensor packages offer a compact, lightweight, and easily transportable solution to address global gaps in air quality (AQ) observations. However, regions that would benefit most from widespread deployment of low-cost AQ monitors often lack the reference-grade equipment required to reliably calibrate and validate them. In this study, we explore approaches to calibrating and validating three integrated sensor packages before a 1-year deployment to rural Malawi using colocation data collected at a regulatory site in North Carolina, USA. We compare the performance of five computational modeling approaches to calibrate the electrochemical gas sensors: k-nearest neighbors (kNN) hybrid, random forest (RF) hybrid, high-dimensional model representation (HDMR), multilinear regression (MLR), and quadratic regression (QR). For the CO, O-x, NO, and NO2 sensors, we found that kNN hybrid models returned the highest coefficients of determination and lowest error metrics when validated. Hybrid models were also the most transferable approach when applied to deployment data collected in Malawi. We compared kNN hybrid calibrated CO observations from two regions in Malawi to remote sensing data and found qualitative agreement in spatial and annual trends. However, ARISense monthly mean surface observations were 2 to 4 times higher than the remote sensing data, partly due to proximity to residential biomass combustion activity not resolved by satellite imaging. We also compared the performance of the integrated Alphasense OPC-N2 optical particle counter to a filter-corrected nephelometer using colocation data collected at one of our de- ployment sites in Malawi. We found the performance of the OPC-N2 varied widely with environmental conditions, with the worst performance associated with high relative humidity (RH >70 %) conditions and influence from emissions from nearby residential biomass combustion. We did not find obvious evidence of systematic sensor performance decay after the 1-year deployment to Malawi. Data recovery (30 %-80 %) varied by sensor and season and was limited by insufficient power and access to resources at the remote deployment sites. Future low-cost sensor deployments to rural, low-income settings would benefit from adaptable power systems, standardized sensor calibration methodologies, and increased regional regulatory-grade monitoring infrastructure.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Unlike satellite images, which are typically acquired and processed in near-real-time, global land cover products have historically been produced on an annual basis, often with substantial lag times between image processing and dataset release. We developed a new automated approach for globally consistent, high resolution, near real-time (NRT) land use land cover (LULC) classification leveraging deep learning on 10 m Sentinel-2 imagery. We utilize a highly scalable cloud-based system to apply this approach and provide an open, continuous feed of LULC predictions in parallel with Sentinel-2 acquisitions. This first-of-its-kind NRT product, which we collectively refer to as Dynamic World, accommodates a variety of user needs ranging from extremely up-to-date LULC data to custom global composites representing user-specified date ranges. Furthermore, the continuous nature of the product's outputs enables refinement, extension, and even redefinition of the LULC classification. In combination, these unique attributes enable unprecedented flexibility for a diverse community of users across a variety of disciplines.

TI  - Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the coastline of Jiaozhou Bay and its driving factors
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatiotemporal changes in coastlines and the underlying mechanisms is important for the rational development and utilization of coastal resources and sustainable economic development. For the first time, this study analyzes twenty years of spatiotemporal changes in the coastline of Jiaozhou Bay (JB), Qingdao, by integrating high-resolution remote sensing images from Google Maps and Landsat time series data at five-year intervals from 2000 to 2020. Five coastlines were extracted using the normalized difference water index and Otsu threshold segmentation method. The index of coastline type diversity (ICTD), index of coastline utilization degree (ICUD), and end point rate were applied to the systematic study of the evolution of the coastline of JB for the first time. The results show that the total length of coastline decreased, with the natural coastline accounting for only approximately 10% of the sharp decrease in the first five years and slow increase in the last 15 years. The ICTD was > 0.7, and the ICUD increased from 231.7 to 261.5, indicating an increase in the influence of humans. The coastline also moved seaward with an average accretion rate of 47.5 km/year, resulting in a 24.5 km(2) reduction in the area of the bay over the 20 years. This was caused by human activities such as port construction. In addition, the degree of correlation between coastline changes and socioeconomic factors was analyzed using grey correlation analysis. Based on this, the forces driving the changes to the coastline were explored, and suggestions for coastal zone management were proposed.

TI  - Observation scheduling for a state-of-the-art SAREOS: Two adaptive multi-objective evolutionary algorithms
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - An observation scheduling for Gaofen-12 (OSFGF-12), a state-of-the-art earth observation satellite installed a novel synthetic aperture radar, is investigated in this paper. Considering a novel observation capability, uninterrupted imaging mode, we build a three-objective optimization model OSFGF-12 to minimize the loss rate of ground targets, the invalid observation and the times of opening sensor. We design two adaptive multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, ALNS + NSGA-II and ALNS + NSGA-III, where an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is adopted as the breeding algorithm, and NSGA-II and NSGA-III are respectively adopted as selection mechanisms. A supplemental selection mechanism is proposed to remedy NSGA-III, by which the iteration values of hypervolume obtained by ALNS + NSGA-III increase stably, and ALNS + NSGA-III achieves the Pareto frontier much faster. Extensive simulation instances are designed to test these two algorithms.

TI  - Photosynthesis phenology, as defined by solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, is overestimated by vegetation indices in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is highly sensitive to climate change, although the data and methods used to estimate key phenological states can influence this sensitivity. Because of its direct relation to leaf photosynthetic carbon uptake, remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can provide new insight assessing changes in vegetation phenology. Here, we investigated the potential of using a SIF time series product named contiguous SIF (CSIF) to estimate spring, summer, and autumn phenology in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere (>30 degrees N) and compared the results with those based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the period 2001-2018. Overall, we found similar spatial patterns in phenological states. However, specific dates of key phenological events differed when using CSIF vs. MODIS NDVI data. NDVI data indicated that the growing season started earlier (by 10.1 days on average) and ended later (11.5 days on average) relative to CSIF data. This implies that actual periods for photosynthetic activity are shorter (by 21.6 days on average) than those estimated from vegetation indices more directly related to changes in canopy structure. These large differences between results from NDVI and that from CSIF suggest that vegetation indices such as NDVI seem to overestimate the period for active photosynthesis over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, while phenology of the early growing season is dominated by temperature for both NDVI and CSIF data, phenology of the late growing season is mainly controlled by temperature for NDVI but by precipitation for CSIF. Our findings were further confirmed by other SIF (GOME-2 SIF) and vegetation index (MODIS EVI) datasets. Phenology modes in Earth system modelling are often parameterized using leaf unfolding and senescence from either station or satellite observations. Our results imply that canopy structure-based parameterization schemes may have overestimated photosynthesis active period, and thus productivity responses. We conclude that SIF data offers a novel and unique approach for assessing phenological change - one that is more directly tied to the carbon cycle and how it is being influenced by climate change.

TI  - The 5-year overall survival and its associated prognostic factors among patients with head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - SURGICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in Asians remains low but shows a steady rising trend. There is a lack of reporting of the long-term outcome in this population. This study aims to evaluate the 5-year overall survival and its associated prognostic factors among patients with head and neck cSCC.Patients and Methods: Patients with head and neck cSCC were identified in a regional hospital over 20 years. The 5-year overall survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier curve and its prognostic risk factors were analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression.Results: A total of 73 patients were identified. The median age was 84. The 5-year overall survival rate was 40.3%. A higher grade of differentiation (hazard ratio 3.732, 95% confidence interval 1.161-11.991, P = .027) was a significant prognostic factor on both univariate and multivariate analyses.Conclusion: In this Asian cSCC survival series specific to the head and neck region, which mostly included octogenarians, the 5-year overall-survival was low and a poor grade of differentiation was associated with a worse survival. Further studies on the Asian population is warranted.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Expansion Patterns Through Landscape Metrics in an Emerging Metropolis of Mangaluru Community Development Block, India, During 1972-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth in the twenty-first century, unlike the conventional mega-city centred development, is occurring in small- and medium-sized cities of the developing world. However, in India possibilities of medium-sized cities are often unnoticed. The current study uses landscape metrics to extract spatial dynamics of built-up patches for applications in spatial planning in the urban landscape of Mangaluru Community Development Block (CDB). The Landsat series of satellite images (MSS, TM, ETM + , OLI TIRS) of Mangaluru was used to extract built-up patches through maximum likelihood classification algorithms and then to calculate 12 selected landscape metrics describing 5 diverse aspects of the spatial configuration relating to the area-edge, shape, aggregation, subdivision and isolation characteristics of the built-up patches during the year from 1972 to 2018. The landscape metrics were calculated for 8 directions in the study area using zonal analysis. The study finds that the city had experienced a growth rate of more than 400% during the study period and establishes the high propensity of the city to grow beyond the administrative boundary. Aggregation of built-up at CBD and formation of subsidiary urban cores in the north and southern part of the city is identified. The study recognises that the building regulations and other planning activities in the centre of the city have brought symmetry and order to built-up patches over the years. The study suggests implementing similar urban planning activities in the periphery of the city where newly emerging and highly heterogeneous settlement patterns were identified. The landscape metrics along with the techniques of remote sensing and GIS thus can recognize the spatial dynamism of urban growth and can be used to manage the future urban growth in an emergent city.

TI  - Research on monitoring overground carbon stock of forest vegetation communities based on remote sensing technology
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of forest carbon stocks provides a better understanding of the carbon sequestration capacity of forests. This paper took forest vegetation communities in Henan as an example and extracted waveband information, texture features and vegetation features from Landsat8 remote sensing image data as modeling factors to establish a multiple regression model and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model for overground carbon stock. It was found that the BPNN model had a R-2 value value 0.678, a relative error of - 1.89%, and a root-mean-square error value of 13.21 t/hm(2), indicating higher accuracy and more accurate estimation of overground carbon stock. The results verify the reliability of the remote sensing technology and the BPNN model in monitoring overground carbon stock, providing some theoretical bases for research on the carbon fixation capability of forest vegetation communities.

TI  - A calibration free radiation driven model for estimating actual evapotranspiration of mountain grasslands (CLIME-MG)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems in the Alps are considered hotspots of climate and land use change. In addition, alpine regions are usually characterized by complex morphologies, which make measurement (especially in the long term) of states and fluxes of water, energy and matter particularly challenging. Therefore, there is a limited availability of information and modelling tools to characterize actual ecosystem conditions, and to simulate future scenarios. Despite the fact that in high altitude areas meteorological forcing is extremely variable in space and time, much of the variability of actual evapotranspiration (AET) in the above-mentioned regions is largely related to land surface properties such as aspect, shadowing and slope. Therefore, a simple, radiation driven, calibration free, bucket hydrological model for predicting AET and estimating the soil-water balance is proposed here (i.e. CLIME-MG). Conventional meteorological data from a network of automatic weather stations together with a 10 m digital terrain model (aggregated at 30 m), and a land cover map are used to inform the model. All the parameters and values required are obtained or calculated from data provided in literature. CLIME-MG has proved to perform well for AET modelling of mountain grassland. The model is validated both temporally and spatially. Temporal validation of AET is performed using eddy-covariance datasets from two different high mountain sites: a sunny and steep abandoned pasture facing S-E at an altitude of 1730 m, and a meadow with a S-SE aspect located at an altitude of 2555 m. Spatial validation is performed by comparing CLIME-MG simulations with the Landsat-based METRIC model evapotranspiration output. Results show good daily temporal performance, especially in wetter periods with recurring rainfall events. Sensitivity of the correlation coefficient between measured and modeled AET values to some key parameters such as effective porosity, and the vegetation and stress coefficients was found to be quite low. Spatial validation of hourly results shows SPAEF values in the range 0.21-0.34 between the outputs of the two models (with a similar spatial structure ruled by the DTM). Boxplots of deviations between CLIME and METRIC with respect to morphological characteristics has highlighted some dependency on elevation and slope (but not on aspect and soil depth); this suggests an opportunity to refine the modelisation of the grassland AET processes. Finally, spatial results demonstrated the non-sensitivity of the proposed model to local elevation and to the distance from the meteorological stations.

TI  - Multivariate assimilation of satellite-based leaf area index and ground-based river streamflow for hydrological modelling of irrigated watersheds using SWAT
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics have different effects on the terrestrial water cycle and therefore play an important role in catchment-scale biophysical and hydrological modeling. Meanwhile, validation of hydrological models of irrigated watersheds concerning vegetation dynamics has rarely been studied. In this study, we propose a combinatorial approach for modelling irrigated watersheds; at first, based on Sentinel-2 (S2), we provide crop/land-use mapping; then we retrieve S2-based leaf area index (LAI) through the neural network algorithm and the PROSAIL model; finally, we employ sequential particle filter (PF) technique to explore the benefits of jointly assimilating high-resolution S2-LAI as well as in-situ river discharge observations for improving the predictive accuracy of SWAT + model. Moreover, we explain how SWAT + source code must be modified to implement the assimilation procedure. The developed methodology is applied to an irrigated watershed in Iran; we provide 66 raster LAI maps with a spatial resolution of 20 m for the study area related to January to December of 2019 as well as crop/ land-use mapping of 2019 with a spatial resolution of 10 m. Results show that improvements in the hydrological simulation of LAI, evapotranspiration, and river discharge are achieved when we apply multivariate assimilation of S2-LAI and streamflow observations, compared to univariate assimilation scenarios. Results also reveal that LAI assimilation has a significant influence on the estimation of irrigation volume and timing.

TI  - Sentinel Node Methods in Penile Cancer - a Historical Perspective on Development of Modern Concepts
T2  - SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Malignant penile tumors are of squamous cell origin in more than 95% of cases and the occurrence of a distant metastasis without prior inguinal lymph node metastatic deposits is very rare. This makes inguinal lymph node staging very reliable and of great prognostic significance since undiscovered and untreated inguinal metastases may lead to a fatal clinical course. In lack of a sufficiently accurate noninvasive lymph node staging modality, penile cancer relies on surgical lymph node removal for regional staging. In this respect sentinel node biopsy offers a favourable minimally invasive alternative to prophylactic inguinal lymph node dissection which is associated with significant surgery-related morbidity.Today sentinel node biopsy is widely used in surgical oncology within high volume cancers such as breast cancer and melanoma. In rare cancers sentinel node biopsy is also emerging as a minimal invasive staging tool in patients with no obvious lymph node involvement. At several specialized units across Europe sentinel node biopsy has been practiced by dedicated specialist within vulva and penile cancer for more than two decades. In fact, the rare disease penile cancer was a model entity for development of the original sentinel node concept as early as the 1970'es due to work by the Paraguayan penile cancer pioneer, Cabanas, the sentinel node concept was subsequently successfully adapted in breast cancer and melanoma. This turned out mutually beneficial since the sequential development of sentinel node biopsy in penile cancer in the 1990s eventually adopted new insights and added conceptual details from the experiences harvested in the broader clinical application possible in these high-volume diseases.The prerequisite to conceptualising the sentinel node approach was the gradual anatomical and functional understanding of the lymphatic system which in western medicine rooted in ancient Greece and gradually increased in details and comprehension with significant contributions from many great notabilities during the last centuries including Hippocrates, Galen, Fallopio, Malpighi, Virchow, Starling, Cabanas, Hodgkin and Horenblas.Sentinel node biopsy in penile cancer is a complex multimodality procedure involving inguinal ultrasonography by radiologists, precise tracer-injection and interpretation of nuclear images by nuclear medicine physicians, radio-tracer- and dye guided open surgical biopsies by urologists and thorough step-sectioning, immunostaining and accurate lymph node specimen analysis by pathologists. This team effort requires well-tested protocols, experience and good collaboration and in rare diseases this calls for centralization of service. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite Leaf Area Index in California vineyards for improving water use estimation
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) directly quantifies plant water consumption and provides essential information for irrigation scheduling, which is a pressing need for California vineyards as extreme droughts become more frequent. Many ET models take satellite-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) as a major input, but how uncertainties of LAI estimations propagate to ET and the partitioning between evaporation and transpiration is poorly understood. Here we assessed six satellite-based LAI estimation approaches using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images against ground measurements from four vineyards in California and evaluated ET sensitivity to LAI in the thermal-based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model. We found that radiative transfer modeling-based approaches predicted low to medium LAI well, but they significantly underestimated high LAI in highly clumped vine canopies (RMSE similar to 0.97 to 1.27). Cubist regression models trained with ground LAI measurements from all vineyards achieved high accuracy (RMSE similar to 0.3 to 0.48), but these empirical models did not generalize well between sites. Red edge bands and the related vegetation index (VI) from the Sentinel-2 satellite contain complementary information of LAI to VIs based on near-infrared and red bands. TSEB ET was more sensitive to positive LAI biases than negative ones. Positive LAI errors of 50% resulted in up to 50% changes in ET, while negative biases of 50% in LAI caused less than 10% deviations in ET. However, even when ET changes were minimal, negative LAI errors of 50% led to up to a 40% reduction in modeled transpiration, as soil evaporation and plant transpiration responded to LAI change divergently. These findings call for careful consideration of satellite LAI uncertainties for ET modeling, especially for the partitioning of water loss between vine and soil or cover crop for effective vineyard irrigation management.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of the hot-spot theoretical model was carried out with extensive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements in the Jarvselja RAMI pine stand. A 120 m x 120 m x 12 m point cloud of laser hits of 1 cm resolution was built to describe the spatial structure of the crown layer. From this point cloud, foliage density was found at 1 dm resolution, and a Fourier analysis of the spatial structure of the crown layer was performed. The autocorrelation function of the transmittance of 1 dm slices of the crown layer, which controls the hot-spot profile of directional reflectance, was estimated directly from the point cloud. The determined value of the hotspot parameter was found to agree well with the value estimated indirectly from the measurements of reflectance profile in the principal plane.

TI  - Monitoring Chlorophyll-a concentration in karst plateau lakes using Sentinel 2 imagery from a case study of pingzhai reservoir in Guizhou, China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) is an important index for water eutrophication. In this study, retrieval models of Chla were established based on the measured water spectra, spectral response function, measured Chla and the corresponding Sentinel-2 imagery of the Pingzhai Reservoir, the first large-scale trans-regional, trans-basin, and long-distance source reservoir in Guizhou. The retrieved results from 11 Sentinel-2 from 2018 to 2021 were used to analyze the spatiotemporal variations in Chla and the influence of different environmental factors on their spatial differentiation, providing a powerful approach for monitoring Chla in the Pingzhai Reservoir. Our binomial function model based on B8*(B7-B5) of Sentinel-2 yielded acceptable to high fitting accuracies, accounting for 89% of the variation in Chla. Overall, the Chla was relatively low, with a mean value of 10.24 mu g/L. Higher Chla were distributed in the catchment area, such as the Nayong River and the dam. Moreover, significant seasonal fluctuations and intra-year changes were observed . Spatio-temporal variations in Chla were influenced by human activities and environmental factors such as Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Ammoniacal Nitrogen (NH4+-N). Our work provided compelling evidence that Sentinel-2 could be used for quantitative inversion of Chla in Pingzhai Reservoir.

TI  - Quality Assessment of Ecological Environment Based on Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of the Zhoushan Islands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of society, the impact of human activities on the ecological environment is becoming increasingly intense, so the dynamic monitoring of the status of the ecological environment is of great significance to the management and protection of urban ecology. As an objective and rapid ecological quality monitoring and evaluation technique, the remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) has been widely used in the field of ecological research. Free available Landsat series data has the character of a long time series and high spatial resolution provides the possibility to conduct large-scale and long-term monitoring of ecological environment quality. Compared with traditional methods, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform can save a lot of time and energy in the data acquisition and preprocessing steps. To monitor the quality of the ecological environment in Zhoushan from 2000 to 2020, the GEE platform was used for cloud computing to obtain the RSEI, which can reflect the quality of the ecological environment. The results show that (1) from 2000 to 2020, the average RSEI value in Zhoushan Islands decreased from 0.748 to 0.681, indicating that the overall ecological environment exhibited a degradation trend. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the change in the area of each ecological environment level indicates that the quality of the ecological environment in Zhoushan Islands exhibited a degradation trend. The proportion of the area with an excellent eco-environment grade decreased by 13.54%, and the proportion of the area with poor and fair eco-environment grades increased by 3.43%.

TI  - Surgical and oncological outcomes of sentinel lymph node sampling in elderly patients with intermediate to high-risk endometrial carcinoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We aimed to evaluate the surgical and oncological outcomes of elderly patients with intermediate to high-risk endometrial cancer undergoing staging with sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of elderly (>65-year-old) patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer between December 2007 and August 2017. These patients had been treated at a single center in Montreal, Canada. We compared the surgical and oncological outcomes of three cohorts undergoing surgical staging in non-overlapping eras: 1) lymphadenectomy, 2) lymphadenectomy and SLN sampling, 3) SLN sampling alone. Using life tables, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests, we analyzed 2-year progression-free survival, overall survival, and disease-specific survival. Results Our study included 278 patients with a median age of 73 years (range; 65-91): 84 (30.2%) underwent lymphadenectomy, 120 (43.2%) underwent SLN sampling with lymphadenectomy, and 74 (26.6%) had SLN sampling alone. The SLN sampling alone group had shorter operative times with a median duration of 199 minutes (range, 75-393) compared with 231 (range, 125-403) and 229 (range, 151-440) minutes in the SLN sampling with lymphadenectomy and lymphadenectomy cohorts; respectively (p<0.001). The SLN sampling alone group also had lower estimated blood loss with a median loss of 20 mL (range, 5-150) vs 25 mL (range, 5-800) and 40 mL (range, 5-400) in the SLN sampling with lymphadenectomy and lymphadenectomy cohorts, respectively (p=0.002). The 2 year overall survival and progression-free survival were not significantly different between the three groups (p=0.45, p=0.51, respectively). On multivariable analysis after adjusting for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, stage, grade, and lymphovascular space invasion, adding SLN sampling was associated with better overall survival, (HR 0.2, CI [0.1 to 0.6], p=0.006) and progression-free survival (HR 0.5, CI [0.1 to 1.0], p=0.05). Conclusion Sentinel lymph node-based surgical staging is feasible and associated with better surgical outcomes and comparable oncological outcomes in elderly patients with intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Risk factors for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) are poorly understood.OBJECTIVE To evaluate rates of and risk factors associated with BCRL in a prospective cohort of women treated with ALND.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective BCRL screening study performed at a tertiary cancer center enrolled women with breast cancer 18 years and older undergoing breast surgery and unilateral AIM in the primary setting or after sentinel lymph node biopsy.EXPOSURES Risk of BCRL during the first 2 years after ALND and radiotherapy.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients were prospectively evaluated with arm volume (perometer) measurements, and BCRL was defined as a relative volume change of 10% or greater from baseline. Cumulative incidence of BCRL was assessed using competing risk analysis. Risk factors for BCRL were assessed on univariate and multivariable analyses.RESULTS From November 2016 to March 2020, 304 patients were enrolled; 276 had at least 1 longitudinal measurement. Median (IQR) age was 48 (40-57) years; median (IQR) body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 26.4 (22.5-31.2). Of the 276 patients included in the analysis, 29 (11%) self-identified as Asian, 55 (20%) as Black, 16 (6%) as Hispanic, 166 (60%) as White, and 10 (3%) as unknown race and ethnicity; 70% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC); 93% received nodal irradiation. The 24-month BCRL rate was 23.8% (95% CI, 17.9%-29.8%), with significant variation by race and ethnicity (24-month rate: 37.2% [Black], 27.7% [Hispanic], 22.5% [Asian], and 19.8% [White]; P = .004). The BCRL rates were also higher among patients receiving NAC vs up-front surgery (24-month rate: 29.3% vs 11.1%; P = .01). On multivariable analysis, Black race and Hispanic ethnicity (compared with White race) (odds ratio [OR], 3.88; 95% CI, 2.14-7.08 and OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.10-7.62, respectively; P < .001 for each), receipt of NAC (compared with up-front surgery) (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.16-3.95; P = .01), older age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07 per 1-year increase; P = .001), and a longer follow-up interval (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.30-1.90 per 6-month increase; P < .001) were independently associated with an increased risk of BCRL, while ERBB2-positive subtype was associated with a decreased risk of BCRL (compared with hormone receptor positive/ERBB2 negative): OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99; P = .04).CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, NAC receipt, older age, and longer follow-up were independently associated with risk of BCRL. Studies are warranted to evaluate the biologic mechanisms behind racial and ethnic disparities in BCRL development and alternatives to NAC to avoid ALND in tumor subtypes unlikely to achieve nodal pathologic complete response.

TI  - Long-term variations and comparison of aerosol optical properties based on MODIS and ground-based data in Thailand
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparison and analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), and SKYNET aerosol optical depth (AOD) products were investigated at four AERONET and two SKYNET stations in Thailand from 2006 to 2020. AERONET Level 2.0 and MODIS Deep Blue (DB) Collection 6.1 data were applied. Aqua and Terra MODIS AODs (satellite AODs) were compared to AERONET and SKYNET AODs (ground based AODs). Ground-based and satellite AODs were in good agreement, giving a high correlation (R2 = 0.75) in Ubon Ratchathani, associated with biomass burning. The long-term trend in AOD was analyzed. Both satellite and ground based AODs demonstrate increasing trends in AOD over Thailand associated with the urbanized area and traffic congestion. Aerosol particles are categorized into dust, sea salt, and biomass burning, containing fine and coarse modes. A variation between satellite data measurements depended on surface reflectances, such as the large water body surrounding (Songkhla) and the impact of surface albedo (Chiang Mai). Higher AOD values were observed between February to April. In addition, meteorological parameters are directly related to aerosol concentrations, while no significant connection could be developed in the observed values between Angstrom exponent (AE) and Meteorological parameters. Meteorological parameters and temperature inversion more influenced AOD concentrations in February. Nevertheless, the hypothesis showed 95% confidence interval of AODs retrieved from satellite data fell within the confidence range. Therefore, satellite aerosol products are sufficiently accurate for estimating aerosol climatology.

TI  - Indigenous Maori perspectives of smokefree parks
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aims to understand the context of place associated with smoking in urban Hamilton parks from a Te Ao Maori perspective (the worldview of Maori, the Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand). Methods: Our study approached smokefree environments in Hamilton through a Maori lens, undertaking interviews with family groups and people from organisations involved in the local Smokefree environments policy. Results: The majority of the 26 adult participants identified as Maori, with 30% being current smokers. Parks had a place in the sporting memories of participants. Smoking was merged with these memories. Important features of places that influenced smoking behaviours were raised, with signage a key talking point. Conclusions: The colonial construct of parks do not make visible Maori values and historical associations with the land, nor do they set a framework that would promote Maori ways of being and doing, including enacting smokefree spaces and places. Implications for public health: This study provides the incentive to address change in parks and reserve management that would support Maori aspirations for their health and wellbeing associated with ancestral land, and give meaning to smokefree environments.

TI  - The SPARC Water Vapor Assessment II: assessment of satellite measurements of upper tropospheric humidity
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nineteen limb-viewing data sets (occultation, passive thermal, and UV scattering) and two nadir upper tropospheric humidity (UTH) data sets are intercompared and also compared to frost-point hygrometer balloon sondes. The upper troposphere considered here covers the pressure range from 300-100 hPa. UTH is a challenging measurement, because concentrations vary between 2-1000 ppmv (parts per million by volume), with sharp changes in vertical gradients near the tropopause. Cloudiness in this region also makes the measurement challenging. The atmospheric temperature is also highly variable ranging from 180-250 K. The assessment of satellite-measured UTH is based on coincident comparisons with balloon frost-point hygrometer sondes, multi-month mapped comparisons, zonal mean time series comparisons, and coincident satellite-to-satellite comparisons. While the satellite fields show similar features in maps and time series, quantitatively they can differ by a factor of 2 in concentration, with strong dependencies on the amount of UTH. Additionally, time-lag response-corrected Vaisala RS92 radiosondes are compared to satellites and the frost-point hygrometer measurements. In summary, most satellite data sets reviewed here show on average similar to 30 % agreement amongst themselves and frost-point data but with an additional similar to 30 % variability about the mean bias. The Vaisala RS92 sonde, even with a time-lag correction, shows poor behavior for pressures less than 200 hPa.

TI  - Evaluation of seasonal ecological vulnerability using LULC and thermal state dynamics using Landsat and MODIS data: a case study of Prayagraj City, India (1987-2018)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Prayagraj city (India) has been selected as a smart city by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India in 2015. However, long-term spatiotemporal seasonal Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) dynamics and Land Surface Temperature (LST) interactions with ecological vulnerability for different seasons are lacking. Accordingly, this research has been carried out to study the seasonal (summer and winter) LULC and its change pattern, thermal dynamics, and their role in exploring the ecological state over Prayagraj city and its surroundings using multi-temporal Landsat (1987-2018) and MODIS Terra data (2007-2018) at both diurnal and nocturnal scenarios. The LULC classification was carried out using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) by adopting the Anderson classification scheme with more than 85% of overall accuracy. The Landsat data-based LST has been estimated using Mono-Window Algorithm (MWA) for diurnal scenario whereas MODIS-based LST was calculated for nocturnal scenario. Ecological vulnerability state has been evaluated both in day-time and night-time using Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) in summer and winter during 1987-2018 and 2007-2018, respectively. Overall, built-up land increased the most by 18.25% which was responsible for massive urbanization during 1987-2018. In contrast, forest land decreased by 2.22% during 1987-2018. The most vulnerable class was agriculture land followed by forest land irrespective of seasons. Thermal state was intensified by mean LST by 1.25 celcius in summer and 0.58 celcius in winter in day-time. However, in night-time, the mean LST intensified by 6.64 celcius in summer and 1.86 celcius in winter. The excellent ecological class having no SUHI effects declined in summer during 1988-2018 by 1.59% but surged in winter by 12.33% during 1987-2018 in north-west regions at day-time, whereas in night-time the excellent ecological class having no SUHI effects severely declined in summer as well as in winter during 2007-2018 by 11.1% and 1.32%, respectively. However, the worst ecological class having strongest SUHI effects severely spread in night-times compared to day-time which mainly concentrated in central core part of the city during 2007-2018 by 5.33%. The present study has generated a comprehensive long-term geospatial database which can be used for urban planning to achieve sustainable development to make Prayagraj city a truly smart city in future.

TI  - Deep learning reveals one of Earth?s largest landslide terrain in Patagonia
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hundreds of basaltic plateau margins east of the Patagonian Cordillera are undermined by numerous giant slope failures. However, the overall extent of this widespread type of plateau collapse remains unknown and incompletely captured in local maps. To detect giant slope failures consistently throughout the region, we train two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), AlexNet and U-Net, with Sentinel-2 optical data and TanDEM-X topographic data on elevation, surface roughness, and curvature. We validated the performance of these CNNs with independent testing data and found that AlexNet performed better when learned on topographic data, and UNet when learned on optical data. AlexNet predicts a total landslide area of 12,000 km2 in a study area of 450,000 km2, and thus one of Earth's largest clusters of giant landslides. These are mostly lateral spreads and rotational failures in effusive rocks, particularly eroding the margins of basaltic plateaus; some giant landslides occurred along shores of former glacial lakes, but are least prevalent in Quaternary sedimentary rocks. Given the roughly comparable topographic, climatic, and seismic conditions in our study area, we infer that basalts topping weak sedimentary rocks may have elevated potential for large-scale slope failure. Judging from the many newly detected and previously unknown landslides, we conclude that CNNs can be a valuable tool to detect large-scale slope instability at the regional scale. However, visual inspection is still necessary to validate results and correctly outline individual landslide source and deposit areas.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detecting land use changes using hybrid machine learning methods in the Australian tropical regions
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present study evaluates the application of the hybrid machine learning methods to detect changes of land use with a focus on agricultural lands through remote sensing data processing. Two spectral images by Landsat 8 were applied to train and test the machine learning model. Feed forward neural network classifier was utilized as the machine learning model in which two evolutionary algorithms including particle swarm optimization and invasive weed optimization were applied for the training process. Moreover, three conventional training methods including Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation (LM), Scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation (SCG) and BFGS quasi-Newton backpropagation (BFG) were used for comparing the robustness and reliability of the evolutionary algorithms. Based on the results in the case study, evolutionary algorithms are not a reliable method for detecting changes through the remote sensing analysis in terms of accuracy and computational complexities. Either BFG or LM is the best method to detect the agricultural lands in the present study. BFG is slightly more robust than the LM method. However, LM might be preferred for applying in the projects due to low computational complexities.

TI  - Sentinels of Seabed (SoS) indicator: Assessing benthic habitats condition using typical and sensitive species
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indicators are key tools used to assess the ecological status of the environment for ecosystem based management. Anthropogenic disturbances produce changes to habitat condition, which include modifications in species composition and their functions. Monitoring a group of sentinel species (from a taxonomic and functional point of view) provides useful insights into benthic habitat condition. Here, a new indicator, Sentinels of the Seabed (SoS) is proposed to assess state of benthic habitats using "sentinel" species (species which are characteristic of a habitat and sensitive to a given pressure). The selection of these sentinel species has two stages. First, a 'typical species set' is computed using intra-habitat similarity and frequency under reference conditions. Second, the 'sentinel species set' is generated by selecting the most sensitive species from the typical species set. This selection is made using specific indexes able to assess species sensitivity to a particular pressure. The SoS indicator method was tested on six case studies and two different pressure types (trawling disturbance and pollution), using data from otter trawl, box-corer and Remote Operate Vehicle images. In each scenario, the SoS indicator was compared to the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef index and total biomass, being the only metric, which showed the expected significant negative response to pressure in all cases. Our results shows that SoS was highly effective in assessing benthic habitats status under both physical and chemical pressures, regardless of the sampling gear, the habitat, or the case study, showing a great potential to be a useful tool in the management of marine ecosystems.

TI  - Potential of X-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar co-polar phase difference for arctic snow depth estimation
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in snowpack associated with climatic warming has drastic impacts on surface energy balance in the cryosphere. Yet, traditional monitoring techniques, such as punctual measurements in the field, do not cover the full snowpack spatial and temporal variability, which hampers efforts to upscale measurements to the global scale. This variability is one of the primary constraints in model development. In terms of spatial resolution, active microwaves (synthetic aperture radar - SAR) can address the issue and outperform methods based on passive microwaves. Thus, high-spatial-resolution monitoring of snow depth (SD) would allow for better parameterization of local processes that drive the spatial variability of snow. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of the TerraSAR-X (TSX) SAR sensor and the wave co-polar phase difference (CPD) method for characterizing snow cover at high spatial resolution. Consequently, we first (1) investigate SD and depth hoar fraction (DHF) variability between different vegetation classes in the Ice Creek catchment (Qikiqtaruk/Herschel Island, Yukon, Canada) using in situ measurements collected over the course of a field campaign in 2019; (2) evaluate linkages between snow characteristics and CPD distribution over the 2019 dataset; and (3) determine CPD seasonality considering meteorological data over the 2015-2019 period. SD could be extracted using the CPD when certain conditions are met. A high incidence angle (>30 circle) with a high topographic wetness index (TWI) (>7.0) showed correlation between SD and CPD (R2 up to 0.72). Further, future work should address a threshold of sensitivity to TWI and incidence angle to map snow depth in such environments and assess the potential of using interpolation tools to fill in gaps in SD information on drier vegetation types.

TI  - Exploring the spatio-temporal characteristics and driving factors of urban expansion in Xi'an during 1930-2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing and understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics and the driving factors of urban expansion over time is crucial for providing solutions to address social, economic and ecological problems caused by urbanisation. Previous studies generally relied on remote sensing data and examined the process of urban expansion in relatively shorter time periods. Taking Xi'an as the case study, this paper uses the proposed urban boundary extraction method by integrating multi-source data to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of long-term urban expansion. The research focuses on indicators including expansion intensity, expansion direction, city centre of gravity, compactness, and elasticity, and identify and discusses the driving factors of urban expansion. The results show that the urban expansion of Xi'an has undergone two cyclical changes during 1930-2014. The urban form presents a 'horizontal rectangle-inverted triangle-concave' evolution feature. The city centre of gravity shifts to the northwest. The compactness continues to decline, and the elasticity coefficient rise. It has been identified that economic and demographic factors together with the industrial structure have driven urban expansion, and urban planning policies has influenced the directions of the expansion. The conservation of great ruins in Xi'an has affected the evolution of its urban morphology. Based on the results, we further discuss the future expansion directions of the city, and provide specific suggestions for future urban planning in order to better coordinate urban expansion, and at the same time provide adequate protection to large heritage sites and support urban sustainability. These findings provide not only valuable insights about urban planning of Xi'an, the methodological approach developed in this research is also applicable to other historic cities with similar characteristics in China and beyond.

TI  - Deficient precipitation sensitivity to Sahel land surface forcings among CMIP5 models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall performance of the simulated seasonal precipitation response to local terrestrial forcings, namely vegetation abundance and soil moisture, in the Sahel among the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Five (CMIP5) Earth System Models (ESMs) is systematically investigated and compared with its observational counterpart using a multivariate statistical method. The observed seasonal precipitation response is evaluated against a large ensemble of observational, reanalysis, and satellite data sets to provide quantification of uncertainties. The behaviour of models with and without a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) component is also explored, along with the mechanisms responsible for terrestrial feedback on rainfall. In general, the CMIP5 models can reasonably capture the seasonal evolution of Sahel precipitation and soil moisture, albeit with wet biases during the pre-monsoon period and dry biases during the peak monsoon period. The non-DGVM ESMs simulate comparable leaf area indices (LAIs) with observations, while DGVM-enabled ESMs simulate too much year-round LAI. The variance of precipitation that is attributed to oceanic forcings in CMIP5 is comparable with observations; however, the variance of precipitation that is attributed to terrestrial forcings is smaller in CMIP5 models than observed, especially for non-DGVM ESMs. CMIP5 models, especially those without DGVMs, undervalue precipitation's observed response strength to soil moisture anomalies. In both observations and CMIP5 models, none of the atmospheric variables show significant responses to direct vegetation forcing, except for the response in transpiration. Although vegetation has minimal direct effect on the atmospheric state, it can affect the atmosphere by modifying soil moisture and transpiration rate indirectly, which helps explain the more realistic simulation of rainfall in DGVM-enabled ESMs than non-DGVM ESMs. Coupling of an ESM to a DGVM is critical in generating reasonable land-atmosphere feedback and examining future ecological and climatic changes over the Sahel.

TI  - Wider economic benefits of transport corridors: Evidence from international development organizations
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper collects data on transport corridor projects financed by the Asian Development Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and World Bank and links them to a wider economic benefit-local economic activity. The paper uses the difference-in-differences methodology to link the variation in country and local initial conditions, and project characteristics to local economic activity. Construction of a new (greenfield) corridor is associated with higher growth in economic activity around the corridor than the rehabilitation or expansion of an existing corridor. Private sector involvement in the operation and management of infrastructure is associated with lower growth in economic activity along the corridors. In the short to medium term, corridor investments with a larger geographic scope are associated with increased growth in economic activity along them, while in the long term, there is no significant difference relative to smaller-scope corridor investments. The initial conditions do not seem to influence how corridor investments affect the growth in economic activity.

TI  - Agricultural burned area detection using an integrated approach utilizing multi spectral instrument based fire and vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 satellite
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a methodology that focuses on detecting agricultural burned areas using Sentinel-2 multispectral data at 10 m. We developed a simple, locally adapted, straightforward approach of multi-index threshold to extract post-winter agricultural burned areas at high resolution for 2019-21. Further, we design a new method for virtual sample collection using already validated fire location data and visual interpretation conditioned using strict selection criteria to improve sample accuracy. Sampling accuracy showed near-perfect agreement with an average Cohen's Kappa value of 0.98. We retrieved monthly ABAs at a resolution of 10 m, and these products were validated against reference burned sample plots identified using visual interpretation of Planet (3m) satellite data. Overall, we found that our method performed well, with an F1 score of 83.63% and low commission (20%) and omission (7%) errors. When compared to global burnt area products, validation accuracy demonstrated an exceptional subpixel scale detecting capability. The study also addresses the complexity of residue burnings and burn signatures' volatile nature by performing multilevel masking and temporal corrections.center dot A novel remotely sensed data aided virtual sampling approach to acquire burned and unburned samples.center dot An integrated method to extract smallholder agricultural burned area using Sentinel-2 multispectral data at a high resolution of 10 m (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Integrating 250 m MODIS data in spectral unmixing for 500 m fractional vegetation cover estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important indicator to measure the potential for carbon neutrality in the terrestrial ecosystem. Spectral unmixing is a common choice for FVC estimation. To deal with the lack of endmembers and intra-class spectral variation, machine learning-based spectral unmixing methods have been developed, but the training samples were constructed based on the data acquired at a time different from the prediction time, which leads to great uncertainty in FVC estimation. Moreover, the used sample features may not cope with areas with strong heterogeneity, where vegetation cannot be reliably identified from the complex background. In this paper, for 500 m FVC estimation, the recently developed the spatio-temporal spectral unmixing model is applied to deal with the inconsistency between training and predicting data by extracting training samples at prediction time directly. Furthermore, more features from 250 m MODIS data are proposed to be integrated with the original 500 m MODIS data. Specifically, for sample construction, new features from 250 m bands (Red and NIR) are stacked with the original 500 m features. For model training, the random forest (RF) model is applied, which can handle high-dimensional data composed of features from different sources. The trained model is employed to predict the FVC of all 500 m MODIS pixels. The proposed method of incorporating 250 m data in 500 m FVC mapping was validated through experiments in five different areas. The results show that the accuracy of FVC mapping can be increased obviously by integrating 250 m features, and the training samples extracted at the prediction time are more reliable for modeling training. This paper has great potential for enhancing current 500 m FVC products at the global scale.

TI  - Coseismic deformation and slip distribution of the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.3 Jinghe, Xinjiang, western China earthquake based on InSAR observations: a buried reverse event on previously unknown fault
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017 M-w 6.3 Jinghe earthquake occurred in the orogenic zone of the North Tianshan mountain range, Xinjiang, western China. No evident surface rupture was identified by field investigation conducted immediately after the earthquake. We investigate the coseismic and post-seismic deformation fields due to the Jinghe event using the C-band Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, and further analyse its causative fault. The Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) model is employed to remove the atmospheric phase delay of multiple InSAR deformation maps. Coseismic deformation fields are resolved by averaging the high quality deformation maps. A nonlinear inversion scheme is used to find the optimized fault geometry in a layered elastic crust. The results imply that the Jinghe earthquake is characterized by thrust faulting, with striking and dipping angles of similar to 62 degrees and similar to 28 degrees, respectively. Subsequently coseismic slip distribution is estimated using the steepest descent method program, constrained by the derived coseismic deformation fields. The inversion results show that the average slip is similar to 0.08 m and the average rake angle is similar to 98 degrees. The maximum slip is similar to 0.24 m, located at the depth of 12.9 km. The moment magnitude is estimated to be M-w 6.38. The fault geometry is generally consistent with the relocated aftershocks distribution. Both the InSAR-derived deformation field and the aftershock distribution indicate that the Jinghe earthquake is attributed to a previously unknown buried fault beneath the Yongji fold with a strike of 62 degrees. No significant post-seismic deformation is identified in the zone of coseismic deformation. This study shows that the Jinghe earthquake is a typical inland thrust event in the North Tianshan area, which is affected by south to north compression due to the Indian-Eurasian collision.

TI  - Performance of primary production algorithm using absorption coefficient of phytoplankton in the Pacific Arctic
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Light condition, day length, and amount of incident sunlight vary widely with season in the Arctic. Absorption-based primary production (PP) models incorporate light absorption coefficients and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); however, algorithm sensitivity to such parameters has not been investigated in the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, we assessed the performance and sensitivity of the vertical generalized production model (VGPM) modified with three absorption-based approaches in relation to in situ and satellite-derived optical and PP data acquired in summer and autumn in the Pacific Arctic region. Based on the VGPM, the absorption-based algorithms, which were developed originally to estimate daily phytoplankton PP in the euphotic layer (PPeu) from the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton and the absorbed radiation (photons) by phytoplankton (ARP) in the Pacific Arctic, were investigated to assess their performance and sensitivity. All approaches exhibited little bias for in situ input parameters and in situ remote sensing reflectance. The PPeu estimation using ARP showed small biases when using satellite data as input. The unbiased root mean square difference was not small, even when using in situ data as input, which suggests inherent problems regarding estimation of quantum yield from only optical parameters. Sensitivity analysis revealed that error not only in the absorption coefficient but also in PAR influences PPeu estimation, particularly when using ARP. The model using the absorption coefficients applied to Second-generation Global Imager data provided a satisfactory estimation of PPeu in the Pacific Arctic where sky conditions can be variable.

TI  - In-flight performance of the Multi-band Uncooled Radiometer Instrument (MURI) thermal sensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's Earth Science and Technology Office (ESTO) encourages and promotes new and innovative science technologies to improve how the Earth is observed from space. Through their Instrument Incubator Program (IIP), an uncooled multispectral thermal instrument was fabricated and flight-tested to demonstrate its potential utility to support future spaceborne missions. While uncooled systems offer the attractive advantage of elimi-nating the need for large and expensive cryocoolers, they naturally introduce challenges that must be overcome to achieve the fidelity observed in image data acquired by existing cooled spaceborne instruments. In this work, the Multi-band Uncooled Radiometer Instrument (MURI) system, designed and built by Leonardo DRS, is fabricated using custom microbolometer detector arrays also developed by Leonardo DRS. Potential is-sues associated with thermal imaging using microbolometers from a spaceborne platform are discussed and innovative engineering solutions to overcome these issues are highlighted. Details of three airborne campaigns designed to assess the fidelity of MURI image data, using Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor's (TIRS) radio-metric & geometric requirements as a baseline, are presented. Results of these campaigns show that the as-built MURI system significantly outperforms these requirements, as compared to ground-based reference measure-ments. Sustainable Land Imaging (SLI) requirements indicate that a five-band instrument is desirable to improve future Landsat science while maintaining continuity with previous thermal instruments. Considering its multi-band design, temperature/emissivity separation (TES) is applied to MURI flight data and compared to ground-based spectrometer measurements for several materials. Results of this study indicate that MURI's TES perfor-mance is in-line with existing spaceborne systems. When considered in conjunction with its radiometric fidelity, the MURI uncooled system represents an intriguing option for future space-based missions.

TI  - Campus Conditions and College Experiences that Facilitate Friendship across Worldview Differences
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Supporting students' friendships across social boundaries is one powerful way in which colleges and universities can contribute to the civic mission of higher education. Using data from the Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey (IDEALS), a national, multi-institutional study, we examined how institutional conditions and various forms of student engagement predicted the number of interworldview friendships among college students at the end of their first year on campus. Multilevel regression results identified factors at three levels of context (personal/individual, community/institution, and network/group) associated with the number of interworldview friendships at Time 2 (dependent variable). Notably, at the community/institution level, we found the availability of co-curricular opportunities for interworldview engagement to be positively associated with interworldview friendship at the end of the first year, while several other institutional features were negatively associated. At the network/group level, we found positive associations between both formal and informal social engagement and interworldview friendship at the end of the first year, while associations between academic majors and interworldview friendship varied. Although some college students may gravitate toward interworldview friendships regardless of institutional conditions, our results affirm that these relationships thrive when structures are in place to encourage social interactions and cooperation across worldview differences.

TI  - Impact of illumination gradients on the raw, atmospherically and topographically corrected snow and vegetation areas of Jhelum basin, Western Himalayas
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous terrains severely affect the sun-target-sensor geometry due to surface dispersion of solar radiation, resulting to variation in the observed radiance. The effect of topographic shadow on raw, atmospherically and topographically processed Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values was investigated for Jhelum basin, Kashmir Himalaya. The results indicate that NDSI and NDVI derived from raw images show less area of snow and vegetation, due to underestimation of corresponding pixels in the shadow regions, in comparison to atmospherically and topographically processed datasets. Among the three datasets, raw images exhibited low values of minimum and maximum NDSI and NDVI for both shadow and sunlit slopes. All the three datasets show significantly higher values of minimum and maximum NDSI, NDVI and surface temperature in the sunlit slopes, relative to shadow slopes. This research demonstrates that topographic shadow has significant impact on the raw, DOS atmospheric corrected and C topographic processed Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) datasets as well as on Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) sensor.

TI  - ArcUHI: A GIS add-in for automated modelling of the Urban Heat Island effect through machine learning
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased urbanisation is boosting the intensity and frequency of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in highly developed cities. The advances in satellite measurement are facilitating the analysis of this phenomenon using Land Surface Temperature (LST) as an indicator of the Surface UHI (SUHI). Due to the spatial implications of using remote sensing data, this research developed ArcUHI, a Geographic Information System (GIS) add-in for modelling SUHI. The tool was designed in ArcGIS, which was bound with R to run machine learning algorithms in the background. ArcUHI was tested using the metropolitan area of Madrid (Spain) in 2006, 2012 and 2018 as a case study. The add-in was found to predict observed LST with high accuracy, especially when using Random Forest Regression (RFR). Building height and albedo were identified as the main drivers of SUHI, whose magnitude and extension increased with time. In view of these results, strategic roof and wall greening was suggested as a measure to mitigate the street canyon effect entailed by buildings and offset the heat retention capacity of built-up surfaces.

TI  - Addressing the difficulties in quantifying droplet number response to aerosol from satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interaction is the most uncertain component of the overall anthropogenic forcing of the climate, in which cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) sensitivity to aerosol (S) is a key term for the overall estimation. However, satellite-based estimates of S are especially challenging, mainly due to the difficulty in disentangling aerosol effects on N-d from possible confounders. By combining multiple satellite observations and reanalysis, this study investigates the impacts of (a) updraft, (b) precipitation, (c) retrieval errors, and (d) vertical co-location between aerosol and cloud on the assessment of S in the context of marine warm (liquid) clouds. Our analysis suggests that S increases remarkably with both cloud-base height and cloud geometric thickness (proxies for vertical velocity at cloud base), consistent with stronger aerosol-cloud interactions at larger updraft velocity for midlatitude and low-latitude clouds. In turn, introducing the confounding effect of aerosol-precipitation interaction can artificially amplify S by an estimated 21 %, highlighting the necessity of removing precipitating clouds from analyses of S. It is noted that the retrieval biases in aerosol and cloud appear to underestimate S, in which cloud fraction acts as a key modulator, making it practically difficult to balance the accuracies of aerosol-cloud retrievals at aggregate scales (e.g., 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid). Moreover, we show that using column-integrated sulfate mass concentration (SO4C) to approximate sulfate concentration at cloud base (SO4B) can result in a degradation of correlation with N-d, along with a nearly twofold enhancement of S, mostly attributed to the inability of SO4C to capture the full spatiotemporal variability of SO4B. These findings point to several potential ways forward to practically account for the major influential factors by means of satellite observations and reanalysis, aiming at optimal observational estimates of global radiative forcings due to the Twomey effect and also cloud adjustments.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Injection for Tracing Axillary Sentinel Nodes in Breast Cancer: A Self-Controlled Clinical Trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMitoxantrone hydrochloride injection for tracing (MHI), a new strategy to identify lymph nodes, has not been tested for axillary node staging in breast cancer. This multicenter, self-controlled, non-inferiority trial aimed to evaluate MHI's efficacy and safety in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). MethodsThe trial was conducted across seven hospitals from December 2019 to December 2020. Patients with early-stage breast cancer received MHI and technetium-99m (99mTc) during the surgery. Sentinel node detection rates were compared between MHI and 99mTc to evaluate non-inferiority and concordance. Non-inferiority was valid if the lower limit of the 95% CI of sentinel node relative detection rate difference was >=-5%. ResultsSLN relative detection rate of MHI was 97.31% (362/372). Of the SLNs, 79.69% (871/1093) were co-detected by both tracers. Of the patients, 4.13% (16/387) had adverse events and recovered during the follow-up. ConclusionsMHI is a lymphatic tracer with comparable efficacy to radionuclides and can be used alone or in combination with radioactive substances for SLNB.

TI  - MSCDUNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Built-Up Area Change Detection Integrating Multispectral, SAR, and VHR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up area change detection (CD) plays an important role in city management, which always uses very high spatial resolution (VHR) remote sensing data to extract refined spatial information. Recently, many CD models based on deep learning with VHR data have been proposed. However, due to the complex background information and natural landscape changes, VHR with optical RGB features is hard to extract changes exactly. To this end, we tend to explore the abundant channel information of multispectral and SAR data as a supplement to the refined spatial features of VHR images. We propose a new deep learning framework called multisource CD UNet++ (MSCDUNet), integrating multispectral, SAR, and VHR data for built-up area CD. First, we label and reform two new built-up area CD datasets containing multispectral, SAR, and VHR data: multisource built-up change (MSBC) and multisource OSCD (MSOSCD) datasets. Second, a feature selection method based on random forest is introduced to choose effective features from multispectral and SAR images. Finally, a multilevel heterogeneous feature fusion module is embedded in MSCDUNet to combine multifeatures for CD. Experiments are conducted on both the MSOSCD and the MSBC datasets. Compared to other CD methods based on VHR images, our proposal achieves the highest accuracy on both datasets and proves the effectiveness of multispectral, SAR, and VHR data fusion for CD. The dataset in the article will be available for download from the following link.(1)

TI  - Quantification and Assessment of Global Terrestrial Water Storage Deficit Caused by Drought Using GRACE Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A drought-induced water storage deficit index (D-WSDI) is proposed to quantify the response of GRACE-based terrestrial water storage change to meteorological drought and the impact of drought on water storage deficit. D-WSDI is defined as the normalized residual component of GRACE time-series data after removing the long-term trend and seasonal components. The evaluation based on the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) showed that more than 90% of global drought events from 2002 to 2019 led to a water storage deficit, which can be detected by the proposed D-WSDI. The severity of the water storage deficit caused by drought increases with the extending drought duration. An average of 73% of water storage deficit months at the global scale is related to precipitation shortages. The cumulative precipitation deficit in relatively short periods of less than 9 months can lead to the water storage deficit in low-latitude regions, whereas a longer time scale is required to lead to a water storage deficit in high-latitude regions. The negative monthly precipitation anomaly of about -20% can lead to a water storage deficit in high rainfall regions, whereas the negative precipitation anomaly can reach -80% in arid and semiarid areas. D-WSDI holds the capability to quantify the water storage deficit caused by drought, especially in the regions with terrestrial water storage change influenced by the long-term trends in climate and anthropogenic activities, and can be used as an index of drought monitoring with similar or superior performance compared to some traditional drought indices.

TI  - Phenology-based classification of Sentinel-2 data to detect coastal mangroves
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise categorization of mangrove forests with medium spatial resolution satellite data is challenging and occasionally yields mixed outcomes. The available methods to estimate mangrove vegetation cover using moderately high-resolution images lack differentiation between mangrove and homestead vegetation. Mangrove vegetation displays a range of responses across the phenological cycle at different wavelengths of an optical sensor. By taking advantage of this principle, the study applied some mangrove and non-mangrove VIs as predictor variables sourced from monthly Sentinel-2 data. These variables were grouped by individual VIs and fed into the random forest algorithm to derive phenology-based classification. A suitable month for thresholding mangroves across different VIs was also ascertained. Results indicated that phenology-based classification with three classes was more accurate (95% overall accuracy) than threshold-based or WorldCover v100 classifications. MI and MVI layers from December image performed better in discerning mangroves. Findings have important implications in separating mangroves from other coastal vegetations.

M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and natural vegetation dynamics are key drivers of global vegetation fire, but anthropogenic burning now prevails over vast areas of the planet. Fire regime classification and mapping may contribute towards improved understanding of relationships between those fire drivers. We used 15 years of daily active fire data from the MODIS fire product (MCD14ML, collection 6) to create global maps of six fire descriptors (incidence, size inequality, season length, interannual variability, intensity, and fire season modality). Using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, we identified three fire macroregimes: Wild, Tamed, and Domesticated, each of which splitting into prototypical and transitional regimes. Interpretation of the six fire regimes in terms of their main drivers relied on the global maps of anthromes and Koppen climate types. The analysis yielded a two-dimensional space where the principal dimension of variability is primarily defined by interannual variability in fire activity and fire season length, and the secondary axis is based mainly on fire incidence. The Wild fire macroregime occurs mostly in cold wildlands, where burning is sporadic and fire seasons are short. Tamed fires predominate in seasonally dry tropical rangelands and croplands with high fire incidence. Domesticated fires are characteristic of humid, warm temperate and tropical croplands and villages with low fire incidence. The Tamed and Domesticated fire macroregimes, representing managed burning, account for 86% of all active fires in our dataset and for 70% of the global burnable area. Fourteen percent of active fires were found in the cold wildlands, and in the rangelands and forests of steppe and desert climates of the Wild macroregime. These results highlight the extent of human control over global pyrogeography in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Quantification of lightning-produced NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> over the Pyrenees and the Ebro Valley by using different TROPOMI-NO<sub>2</sub> and cloud research products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lightning, one of the major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere, contributes to the tropospheric concentration of ozone and to the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. Lightning produces between 2 and 8 Tg N yr(-1) globally and on average about 250 +/- 150 mol NOx per flash. In this work, we estimate the moles of NOx produced per flash (LNOx production efficiency) in the Pyrenees (Spain, France and Andorra) and in the Ebro Valley (Spain) by using nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and cloud properties from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) as well as lightning data from the Earth Networks Global Lightning Network (ENGLN) and from the EUropean Co-operation for Lightning Detection (EUCLID). The Pyrenees are one of the areas in Europe with the highest lightning frequencies, which, along with their remoteness as well as their very low NOx background, enables us to better distinguish the LNOx signal produced by recent lightning in TROPOMI NO2 measurements. We compare the LNOx production efficiency estimates for eight convective systems in 2018 using two different sets of TROPOMI research products provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and the Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR). According to our results, the mean LNOx production efficiency in the Pyrenees and in the Ebro Valley, using a 3 h chemical lifetime, ranges between 14 and 103 mol NOx per flash from the eight systems. The mean LNO x production efficiency estimates obtained using both TROPOMI products and ENGLN lightning data differ by similar to 23 %, while they differ by similar to 35 % when using EUCLID lightning data. The main sources of uncertainty when using ENGLN lightning data are the estimation of background NOx that is not produced by lightning and the time window before the TROPOMI overpass that is used to count the total number of lightning flashes contributing to freshly produced LNOx. The main source of uncertainty when using EUCLID lightning data is the uncertainty in the detection efficiency of EUCLID.

TI  - A simple, fast, and accurate method for land cover mapping in Mongolia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Low accuracy of global land cover (LC) products at local and regional scales is concerning, because of its huge impact on downstream applications. Therefore, developing a method for high accuracy LC maps at local and regional scale is of utmost importance. Taking Mongolia as a case study, we proposed a simple, fast, and accurate method to produce annual LC maps with 250 m spatial resolution from 2001 to 2020 using MODIS data. Our products have higher spatial resolution and higher accuracy (Overall Accuracy similar to 90%) compared to MCD12Q1. These new maps are critical e.g., for land degradation research, and desertification/forest cover monitoring. Especially, information on grassland ecosystems is of utmost importance for Mongolia since more than half of the country economically depends on grassland resources. Therefore, Mongolia will benefit from the new dataset. Furthermore, due to the simplicity of the method, it can be easily applied and transferred to other regions.

TI  - The Progressive Values Scale: Assessing the Ideological Schism on the Left
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Progressivism has increasingly challenged traditional liberalism as the dominant influence within left-wing ideology. Across four studies, we developed a measure-the Progressive Values Scale (PVS)-that characterizes distinctly progressive values within the left-wing. In Study 1, left-wing participants evaluated divisive issues, with four scale factors emerging. In Study 2, we confirmed this factor structure and included a battery of personality and values measures to explore individual differences among those who maintain a progressive worldview. In Study 3, we achieved final confirmation of the factor structure and validated the ability of the PVS to assess a distinctly progressive perspective, insofar as progressives generated prototypical faces for Liberals and Conservatives that were markedly distinct from those generated by traditional liberals. In Study 4, we distinguished the PVS from measures of left-wing authoritarianism and demonstrated that it is a better predictor of progressive political preferences and social judgments.

TI  - Enhancing SWAT model predictivity using multi-objective calibration: effects of integrating remotely sensed evapotranspiration and leaf area index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological process in a catchment consists of multiple internal processes with complex interactions. The conventional practice of using a single variable to calibrate a hydrological model can lead to equifinality, which can result in substantial uncertainty in capturing the internal processes. Since multi-objective calibration process can be a way to solve this problem, a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments are employed by integrating (i) spatiotemporal remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (AET) data in multi objective calibration process, (ii) Leaf area index (LAI) data, and (iii) AET and LAI data together in multi-objective calibration with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). This calibration process aims for reducing the equifinality by improving the connected hydrologic internal processes rather than improvement in the assessment metrics at the catchment outlet. The results suggest that the integration of remotely sensed AET and LAI data in multi-objective calibration tend to increase model accuracy and reduce the prediction uncertainty, including significant improvement in simulated evapotranspiration and streamflow. In comparison with the traditional SWAT model, which is based on user input and semiempirical equations to simulate hydrologic processes, AET and LAI integration in multi-objective calibration notably captured the improved evapotranspiration and actual vegetation dynamics estimations, which resulted improvement in streamflow calibration. The findings showed the necessity of integrating remotely sensed AET and LAI data to improve the calibration and reduce the equifinality of hydrologic model simulations. The presented methodology can be replicated through other hydrological models and remote sensing data sources in diverse hydrological systems in the world.

TI  - Assessing Protected Area Zoning Effectiveness With Remote Sensing Data: The Case of Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) remain the most important tool to prevent biodiversity loss and habitat degradation worldwide, but the formal creation of a PA constitutes only the first step. In recent decades, concerns about PA effectiveness have arisen, and several PAs have been evaluated using different methods. Results show that while some PAs are achieving their conservation goals, others have been less effective. Particularly, assessing broadscale outcomes is a method that allows us to monitor change over time at a large scale, using remote sensing data. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of Nahuel Huapi National Park, with particular attention to its three protection categories: Strict Natural Reserve (SNR), National Park (NP), and National Reserve (NR) (IUCN categories Ia, II, and VI respectively). We compared changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) among sites in these categories and between them and neighboring unprotected areas, over the period 2000-2020. Overall, habitat degradation was low, and we found no difference among the four categories evaluated. Nevertheless, a greening process has been conspicuous in the entire area, with higher values both in the SNR and in the unprotected area. We propose possible explanations as we consider variables such as dominant tree species, precipitation, temperature, elevation, and wildfires. This study supports the importance of NHNP at the regional and national levels, particularly its SNR areas.

TI  - A 1 km daily surface soil moisture dataset of enhanced coverage under all-weather conditions over China in 2003-2019
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is crucial for understanding the hydrological process of our earth surface. The passive microwave (PM) technique has long been the primary tool for estimating global SSM from the view of satellites, while the coarse resolution (usually >similar to 10 km) of PM observations hampers its applications at finer scales. Although quantitative studies have been proposed for downscaling satellite PM-based SSM, very few products have been available to the public that meet the qualification of 1 km resolution and daily revisit cycles under all-weather conditions. In this study, we developed one such SSM product in China with all these characteristics. The product was generated through downscaling the AMSR-E/AMSR-2-based (Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer of the Earth Observing System and its successor) SSM at 36 km, covering all on-orbit times of the two radiometers during 2003-2019. MODIS optical reflectance data and daily thermalinfrared land surface temperature (LST) that had been gap-filled for cloudy conditions were the primary data inputs of the downscaling model so that the "all-weather" quality was achieved for the 1 km SSM. Daily images from this developed SSM product have quasi-complete coverage over the country during April-September. For other months, the national coverage percentage of the developed product is also greatly improved against the original daily PM observations through a specifically developed sub-model for filling the gap between seams of neighboring PM swaths during the downscaling procedure. The product compares well against in situ soil moisture measurements from 2000+ meteorological stations, indicated by station averages of the unbiased root mean square difference (RMSD) ranging from 0.052 to 0.059 vol vol(-1). Moreover, the evaluation results also show that the developed product outperforms the SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and Sentinel (active-passive microwave) combined SSM product at 1 km, with a correlation coefficient of 0.55 achieved against that of 0.40 for the latter product. This indicates the new product has great potential to be used by the hydrological community, by the agricultural industry, and for water resource and environment management. The new product is available for download at https://doi.org/10.11888/Hydro.tpdc.271762 (Song and Zhang, 2021b).

TI  - Environmental degradation in the transnational area of Changbai Mountain based on multiple remote sensing data
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and effective assessment of environmental degradation is essential for promoting regional sustainable development in the transnational area of Changbai Mountain (TACM). However, a comprehensive understanding of environmental degradation in the TACM remains inadequate. In this study, we developed an environmental degradation index (EDI) using multiple remote sensing data, including the enhanced vegetation index, gross primary productivity, land surface temperature, and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance products. We then evaluated the performance of the developed index in comparison with that of the remote sensing ecological index and assessed environmental degradation across the entire TACM, in the subregions of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and Russia from 2000 to 2019. The results indicate that the EDI has various advantages, such as speed, flexibility, and simplicity, and can be used to effectively identify and evaluate the environmental degradation dynamics caused by urban expansion and cropland loss. The TACM experienced a downward trend in environmental change from 2000 to 2019. Degraded environment areas (49,329.50 km(2)) accounted for 30.09% of the entire TACM. The largest area of the degraded environment was in the DPRK subregion (i.e., 25,395.00 km(2)), which was 5.6-times and 1.3-times larger than that in the Russian and Chinese subregions, respectively. Hotspot areas that experienced significant environmental degradation covered only 17.69% of the land area of the TACM, within which the area of environmental degradation accounted for 33.89% of the total degraded environment across the entire TACM. We suggest that international cooperation policies and measures be enacted to promote sustainable regional development.

TI  - Validation of LAI, chlorophyll and FVC biophysical estimates from sentinel-2 level 2 prototype processor over a heterogeneous savanna and grassland environment in South Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) allows the generation of biophysical estimates at high spatiotemporal resolution from Sentinel-2 imagery and could be a solution for generating products in natural environments. This study validated the SL2P estimates of leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) over the savanna and grassland environments using field measurements. The performance of the SL2P estimates in Marakele and Golden Gate Highlands National Parks were comparatively poor and linearly biased coupled with moderate-to-high errors. The SL2P estimates in the two study sites had low accuracy with relative root mean squared error's in the range 61.63% to 85.26% and possible systematic underestimations with pBias's ranging from 32.17% to 63.16%. These findings gave insight about the performance of the SL2P estimates over the considered heterogenous environments, and suggest the need for extensive validation and re-calibration of the system using long-term field measurements.

TI  - Predictors of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Thin Melanoma: An International Multi-institutional Collaboration
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Consideration of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is recommended for patients with T1b melanomas and T1a melanomas with high-risk features; however, the proportion of patients with actionable results is low. We aimed to identify factors predicting SLNB positivity in T1 melanomas by examining a multi-institutional international population. Methods Data were extracted on patients with T1 cutaneous melanoma who underwent SLNB between 2005 and 2018 at five tertiary centers in Europe and Canada. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of SLNB positivity. Results Overall, 676 patients were analyzed. Most patients had one or more high-risk features: Breslow thickness 0.8-1 mm in 78.1% of patients, ulceration in 8.3%, mitotic rate > 1/mm(2) in 42.5%, Clark's level >= 4 in 34.3%, lymphovascular invasion in 1.4%, nodular histology in 2.9%, and absence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 14.4%. Fifty-three patients (7.8%) had a positive SLNB. Breslow thickness and mitotic rate independently predicted SLNB positivity. The odds of positive SLNB increased by 50% for each 0.1 mm increase in thickness past 0.7 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.13) and by 22% for each mitosis per mm(2) (95% CI 1.06-1.41). Patients who had one excised node (vs. two or more) were three times less likely to have a positive SLNB (3.6% vs. 9.6%; odds ratio 2.9 [1.3-7.7]). Conclusions Our international multi-institutional data confirm that Breslow thickness and mitotic rate independently predict SLNB positivity in patients with T1 melanoma. Even within this highly selected population, the number needed to diagnose is 13:1 (7.8%), indicating that more work is required to identify additional predictors of sentinel node positivity.

TI  - Technical note: A view from space on global flux towers by MODIS and Landsat: the FluxnetEO data set
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The eddy-covariance technique measures carbon, water, and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere at hundreds of sites globally. Collections of standardised and homogenised flux estimates such as the LaThuile, Fluxnet2015, National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), AsiaFlux, AmeriFlux, and Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN)/OzFlux data sets are invaluable to study land surface processes and vegetation functioning at the ecosystem scale. Space-borne measurements give complementary information on the state of the land surface in the surroundings of the towers. They aid the interpretation of the fluxes and support the benchmarking of terrestrial biosphere models. However, insufficient quality and frequent and/or long gaps are recurrent problems in applying the remotely sensed data and may considerably affect the scientific conclusions. Here, we describe a standardised procedure to extract, quality filter, and gap-fill Earth observation data from the MODIS instruments and the Landsat satel- lites. The methods consistently process surface reflectance in individual spectral bands, derived vegetation indices, and land surface temperature. A geometrical correction estimates the magnitude of land surface temperature as if seen from nadir or 40 degrees off-nadir. Finally, we offer the community living data sets of pre-processed Earth observation data, where version 1.0 features the MCD43A4/A2 and MxD11A1 MODIS products and Landsat Collection 1 Tier 1 and Tier 2 products in a radius of 2 km around 338 flux sites. The data sets we provide can widely facilitate the integration of activities in the eddy-covariance, remote sensing, and modelling fields.

TI  - Identifying and Mapping Alteration Minerals Using HySpex Airborne Hyperspectral Data and Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data provide rapid, non-destructive, and near laboratory quality reflectance spectra for mineral mapping and lithological discrimination, thereby ushering an innovative era of remote sensing. In this study, NEO HySpex cameras, which comprise 504 spectral channels in the spectral ranges of 0.4-1.0 mu m and 1.0-2.5 mu m, were mounted on a delta wing XT-912 aircraft. The designed flexibility and modular nature of the HySpex aircraft hyperspectral imaging system made it relatively easy to test, transport, install, and remove the system multiple times before the acquisition flights. According to the design fight plan, including the route distance, length, height, and flight speed, we acquired high spectral and spatial resolutions airborne hyperspectral images of Yudai porphyry Cu (Au, Mo) mineralization in Kalatag District, Eastern Tianshan terrane, Northwest China. By comparing the features of the HySpex hyperspectral data and standard spectra data from the United States Geological Survey database, endmember pixels of spectral signatures for most alteration mineral assemblages (goethite, hematite, jarosite, kaolinite, calcite, epidote, and chlorite) were extracted. After a HySpex data processing workflow, the distribution of alteration mineral assemblages (iron oxide/hydroxide, clay, and propylitic alterations) was mapped using the random forest (RF) algorithm. The experiments demonstrated that the workflow for processing data and RF algorithm is feasible and active, and show a good performance in classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy and Kappa classification of alteration mineral identification were 73.08 and 65.73%, respectively. The main alteration mineral assemblages were primarily distributed around pits and grooves, consistent with field-measured data. Our results confirm that HySpex airborne hyperspectral data have potential application in basic geology survey and mineral exploration, which provide a viable alternative for mineral mapping and identifying lithological units at a high spatial resolution for large areas and inaccessible terrains.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an important fundamental data for solar energy utilization, climate change, human health, photochemical reaction studies, etc. However, it is still a problem to get UV radiation estimations with high spatial resolution rapidly. This study attempted to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to estimate clear-sky UV radiation with high accuracy and high spatial resolution (1 km) in China. Based on Moderateresolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) data and ERA5 reanalysis data obtained from Google Earth Engine (GEE), we established input dataset composed of different variables and developed 29 ML models to estimate clear-sky UV radiation using 37 Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) stations measurements for model training and validation. The results showed that compared with other ML models the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model had a high and stable performance with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.904, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.100 Wm-2, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.274 Wm-2 for 10-fold crossvalidation. To realize fast estimation of online clear-sky UV radiation, the DNN model was deployed to Google Cloud Platform. The online estimation results showed that northern China had more UV radiation than southern China, and eastern China had less radiation than western China. This study would provide a useful reference for the study of solar energy resources, human health, and ecological system studies.

TI  - The impact of natural resources on green growth: The role of green trade
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the primary facets of the research being conducted in the domain of sustainability is the green growth of economies. Green growth relates to the sustainable growth of economic systems with consideration and focus on the environmental sustenance. This area of research is imperative due to the deteriorating condition of climate and environment, which is one of the main challenges presented to the worldview of sustainability at present. Thus, extending this line of research, the present study investigated the association between the resource usage of natural resources of energy (coal, gas, oil) and the green growth of China along with the moderation of green trade for the period 1980-2020. The techniques of Zivot-Andrew unit root test was applied for studying the stationary properties of the series. The cointegration was examined through the ARDL bounds test and was found to be strong. Also, the long run associations between the factors with green growth were studied through the applications of the dynamic OLS (DOLS), fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and Canonical Cointegrating Regression (CCR). The empirical results reveal that gas and coal are significant for the green growth of Chinese economy, however, negative associations between gas and green growth were found. The study also found the significant moderating role of "green trade" in the association between "natural resources" and "green growth," however, the moderation of green trade resulted in negative moderation for the relationships between oil, gas and green growth and were positive for coal and green growth. The study suggests policies for the green environment and economy of China and suggests techniques be undertaken to reduce the usage of natural energy resources with the view of improving the green growth of China.

TI  - Molecular detection of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in chicken hearts from markets and retail stores in Northern Iran
T2  - FOOD AND WATERBORNE PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of Toxoplasma gondii in chicken products indicates risk of transmission to consumers. The objective of the current study was to investigate the molecular prevalence of T. gondii in freeranging and industrial chickens in Guilan province, Northern Iran. A total of 150 chicken heart samples including 75 free-range and 75 industrial chickens were collected from farmers' markets and chicken retailers in Guilan, Northern Iran, between October 2017 and August 2018. Genomic DNA were extracted from samples and examined for evidence of T. gondii using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the B1 gene. The B1-positive samples were further analyzed by nestedPCR for SAG1 gene. Of the 150 samples, T. gondii DNA fragments were detected in 59 (39.3%), including 30 (40%) free-range and 29 (38.7%) industrial chicken. No significant differences of T. gondii DNA detection was observed between the free-range and industrial chicken samples (p = 0.73). Four selected positive samples were used for amplifying and sequencing of the SAG1 gene. The results revealed that all four sequences of SAG1 had 100% similarity with T. gondii sequences previously isolated from an AIDS/HIV patient in Mazandaran province, Northern Iran. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all four sequences were closely related to Type I of T. gondii. However, our Type I identification is preliminary and needs to be confirmed by further multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. The findings of the present study provide new data about the presence of T. gondii DNA in chicken hearts in the study area. These results confirm that chicken can be used as sentinels for environment contamination; however, further studies are needed to determine the viability of T. gondii in chicken hearts from Iran for risk assessment.

TI  - Mapping the long-term influence of river discharge on coastal ocean chlorophyll-<i>a</i>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the potential of river discharge to support ocean productivity and marine ecosystems is known, the specifics of this relationship are poorly understood in many regions of the world. Global estimates of river flow indicate that river discharge is decreasing due to the increasing fragmentation, extraction and regulation of rivers. This likely means that the contribution of river flow to coastal productivity and water quality is changing, potentially leading to fewer and smaller magnitude ocean fertilisation events. We developed a simple analysis method, based on Earth observation data, to investigate where coastal ocean chlorophyll-ais most strongly influenced by river discharge. The per-pixel spatiotemporal correlation technique (implemented using Python) correlates chlorophyll-aconcentration (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and indicator of primary productivity) from MODIS ocean colour data with river discharge data. The method was tested globally on 11 different rivers discharging into coastal ocean regions. Our findings suggest some of the world's largest river systems, such as the Amazon River, have zones of elevated coastal chl-athat extend hundreds to thousands of km from the river mouth. These findings suggest the influence of river discharge may have been underestimated in many coastal regions of the world. The method appears more effective for larger river systems discharging to ocean waters with less complex nutrient dynamics and weaker seasonal productivity patterns, most notably in temperate regions. Increasing our understanding of the specific areas influenced by river discharge, and the degree of influence over space and time, is an important step towards the improved river and coastal management. This method will increase the capacity of researchers to monitor how, when and where coastal waters are affected as river discharge continues to change into the future.

TI  - An estimation and multi-step ahead prediction study of monthly snow cover area, based on efficient atmospheric-oceanic dynamics
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to examine the temporal impacts of atmospheric-oceanic patterns, on snow cover variations of the widest snow-prone zone in Iran (Central Alborz mountains similar to 400,000 km(2)). For this purpose, the snow cover area was derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor images during 2000-2016 years. Thirty indices related to atmospheric-oceanic patterns were provided from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website. The strongest significant teleconnection effects occur with time lags. Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), North Pacific pattern (NP), Hurricane Activity (HA), Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), Extreme Eastern ENSO (Nino [1 + 2[), and Eastern ENSO (Nino [3]), were the most effective signals on the snow cover variations in Central Alborz region. The AMM, HA, and WHWP indices, were the directly related ones with 2-, 4- and 4-month time lags, respectively. Indices NP, Nino (1 +2), and Nino (3) were the inversely related signals and their most severe effects appeared after a 1-, 4-, and 4-month lags, respectively. A wavelet coherence analysis was also used for teleconnection investigation. It has illustrated that the mentioned time lags of these signals, have a significant 9-15-months period' relation with snow cover variations, during the whole study years. In the following, the time lags of the indices were applied as inputs to forecast the snow cover area. The models including the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and group method of data handling (GMDH) were utilized for this purpose. According to the values of normalized root mean square error (between 0.1 and 0.2) and Nash-Sutcliff (> 0.75), the GMDH had acceptable predictions, especially for long-term forecasting horizons (12- and 24-month-ahead). The applied input approach can have research value for forecasting snow cover area in other mountainous regions of the world, and also to reconstruct the snow data, in the years when satellite imagery was not available.

TI  - Early Diagnosis of Delirium in Palliative Care Patients Decreases Mortality and Necessity of Palliative Sedation: Results of a Prospective Observational Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Delirium in end-of-life patients is reported to be between 13% and 42% and up to 80% in the terminal phase. It is a serious clinical situation, often a cause of death due to the frequent ineffectiveness of treatments. This study aimed to assess whether and how much precocity of diagnosis, hitherto little considered, could affect the outcomes and prognosis of delirium in palliative care settings.Methods: Patients consecutively admitted to a palliative care unit (PCU) between October 2018 and December 2019, cared for both in hospice and home programs, were analyzed. All patients were subjected to a careful procedure aimed at recognizing the onset of delirium. The first step was the detection of prodromal "sentinel" symptoms related to incoming delirium. PCU staff and family members/caregivers were trained to observe the patients and immediately identify the appearance of even one symptom. The final diagnosis was performed with the 4AT (4 A's test). Patients were then included in the categories of "early" or "slow" diagnosis (cut-off: four hours) depending on the time between sentinel symptom observation and the final diagnosis of delirium.Results: Among 503 admitted patients, 95 developed delirium. Confusion was the most frequent sentinel symptom (49.5%). The early diagnosis was more frequent in hospice than in home care (p-value<0.0001). Delirium was positively resolved in 43 patients, of which 25 with an early diagnosis (p-value=0.038). Time to resolution was shorter in the case of early diagnosis (7.1 vs. 13.7 hours in hospice patients; p-value=0.018). Palliative sedation was performed on 25 patients, but only 8 of them had an early diagnosis.Conclusion: Time of diagnosis was important in determining the clinical outcomes of patients in charge of PCU who experienced delirium. The early diagnosis reduced both mortality and the necessity of palliative sedation.

TI  - Regional Nodal Management in the Setting of Up-Front Surgery
T2  - SEMINARS IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, axillary lymph node dissection was considered necessary for regional control of breast cancer. Moreover, nodal status was the major determinant of the need for chemotherapy. The increased use of systemic therapy coupled with expanding indications for nodal irradiation has led to interest in optimizing patient outcomes by leveraging the local control benefits of radiotherapy and systemic therapy to decrease the extent of surgery. A series of landmark surgical and radiotherapeutic trials has demonstrated low rates of disease recurrence with concomitant improvements in treatment-associated lymphedema and quality of life with the use of sentinel node biopsy and nodal irradiation as opposed to complete axillary dissection in the management of node positive breast cancer. This chapter will explore the evolution of regional nodal management, culminating in current approaches to tailored patient selection for axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant regional nodal irradiation.

TI  - Seasonal climate drivers of peak NDVI in a series of Arctic peatlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in plant cover and productivity are important in driving Arctic soil carbon dynamics and sequestration, especially in peatlands. Warming trends in the Arctic are known to have resulted in changes in plant productivity, extent and community composition, but more data are still needed to improve understanding of the complex controls and processes involved. Here we assess plant productivity response to climate variability between 1985 and 2020 by comparing peak growing season NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index data from Landsat 5 and 7), to seasonal average weather data (temperature, precipitation and snow-melt timing) in nine locations containing peatlands in high-and low-Arctic regions in Europe and Canada. We find that spring (correlation 0.36 for peat dominant and 0.39 for mosaic; MLR coefficient 0.20 for peat, 0.29 for mosaic), summer (0.47, 0.42; 0.18, 0.17) and preceding autumn (0.35, 0.25; 0.33, 0.27) temperature are linked to peak growing season NDVI at our sites between 1985 and 2020, whilst spring snow melt timing (0.42, 0.45; 0.25, 0.32) is also important, and growing season water availability is likely site-specific. According to regression trees, a warm preceding autumn (September-October-November) is more important than a warm summer (June-July-August) in predicting the highest peak season productivity in the peat-dominated areas. Mechanisms linked to soil processes may explain the importance of previous-Autumn conditions on productivity. We further find that peak productivity increases in these Arctic peatlands are comparable to those in the surrounding non-peatland-dominant vegetation. Increased productivity in and around Arctic peatlands suggests a potential to increased soil carbon sequestration with future warming, but further work is needed to test whether this is evident in observations of recent peat accumulation and extent.

TI  - Significant increase in azithromycin "resistance" and susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> isolates in 26 European countries, 2019
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP) performs annual sentinel surveillance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae susceptibility to therapeutically relevant antimicrobials across the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). We present the Euro-GASP results from 2019 (26 countries), linked to patient epidemiological data, and compared with data from previous years. Methods Agar dilution and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) gradient strip methodologies were used to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility (using EUCAST clinical breakpoints, where available) of 3239 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from 26 countries across the EU/EEA. Significance of differences compared with Euro-GASP results in previous years was analysed using Z-test and the Pearson's chi 2 test was used to assess significance of odds ratios for associations between patient epidemiological data and antimicrobial resistance. Results European N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected between 2016 and 2019 displayed shifting MIC distributions for; ceftriaxone, with highly susceptible isolates increasing over time and occasional resistant isolates each year; cefixime, with highly-susceptible isolates becoming increasingly common; azithromycin, with a shift away from lower MICs towards higher MICs above the EUCAST epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF); and ciprofloxacin which is displaying a similar shift in MICs as observed for azithromycin. In 2019, two isolates displayed ceftriaxone resistance, but both isolates had MICs below the azithromycin ECOFF. Cefixime resistance (0.8%) was associated with patient sex, with resistance higher in females compared with male heterosexuals and men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). The number of countries reporting isolates with azithromycin MICs above the ECOFF increased from 76.9% (20/26) in 2016 to 92.3% (24/26) in 2019. Isolates with azithromycin MICs above the ECOFF (9.0%) were associated with pharyngeal infection sites. Following multivariable analysis, ciprofloxacin resistance remained associated with isolates from MSM and heterosexual males compared with females, the absence of a concurrent chlamydial infection, pharyngeal infection sites and patients >= 25 years of age. Conclusions Resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime remained uncommon in EU/EEA countries in 2019 with a significant decrease in cefixime resistance observed between 2016 and 2019. The significant increase in azithromycin "resistance" (azithromycin MICs above the ECOFF) threatens the effectiveness of the dual therapy (ceftriaxone + azithromycin), i.e., for ceftriaxone-resistant cases, currently recommended in many countries internationally and requires close monitoring.

TI  - Performance analysis of different DCNN models in remote sensing image object detection
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, deep learning, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), has made great progress. Many researchers use different DCNN models to detect remote sensing targets. Different DCNN models have different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we use YoloV4 as the detector to "fine-tune" various mainstream deep convolutional neural networks on two large public remote sensing data sets-LEVIR data set and DOTA data set to compare the advantages of various networks. This paper analyzes the reasons why the effect of "fine-tuning" convolutional neural networks is sometimes not good, and points out the difficulties of object detection in optical remote sensing images. To improve the detection accuracy of optical remote sensing targets, in addition to "fine-tuning" convolutional neural network, we also provide a variety of adaptive multi-scale feature fusion methods to improve the detection accuracy. In addition, for the large number of parameters generated by deep convolutional neural network, we provide a method to save storage space.

TI  - Shifts in land-greening hotspots in the Yellow River Eco-Economic Belt during the last four decades and their connections to human activities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial patterns of Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) changes and their potential causes in the Yellow River Eco-Economic Belt (YREEB) during the last four decades remain unclear. To clarify this issue, this study first depicts the spatial patterns of the NDVI changes by combining GIMMS3g NDVI data and MODIS NDVI data; second, regression residual analysis, cluster analysis and the generalized additive model (GAM) approach are used to explore the potential causes of the NDVI changes. The results show that (1) the regional mean NDVI exhibited an uptrend with a slope of 0.001 per decade from 1982 to 2019, which consists of two prominent uptrend periods, i.e, 1982-1990 and 2004-2019, with slopes of 0.038 per decade and 0.027 per decade, respectively, as well as one trendless period between them. (2) There has been greening hotspots shift. The first prominent greening trend from 1982 to 1990 mainly occurred in the eastern agricultural area, while the second prominent greening uptrend from 2004 to 2019 mainly occurred in the Loess Plateau. (3) The greening trend and greening hotspots shift were slightly caused by climate change while mainly caused by human activities. The first greening trend was closely related to the winter wheat sowing area, and the second greening trend was related to the afforestation area.

TI  - Detecting Li-bearing pegmatites using geospatial technology: the case of SW Konar Province, Eastern Afghanistan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithium-cesium-tantalum (LCT) pegmatites are widely distributed in northeastern, eastern, and central Afghanistan. The largest rare-metal pegmatites having Lithium (Li)-bearing minerals occur in the Nuristan pegmatite belt in Eastern Afghanistan. The main aim of this study is to detect and highlight the Li-bearing pegmatites using spectral analysis within the Southwest Konar province in the east of Afghanistan and to establish self-proposed spectral indices for the detection of Li-rich minerals. To achieve the study's objective, we apply several algorithms, for example, false color composite, band ratio, and spectral angle mapper on ASTER, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and Sentinel-2MSI data. Considering the spectral characteristics of key mineral spodumene and other diagnostic minerals, for example, lepidolite, amblygonite, and cookeite, which are considered diagnostic minerals of LCT pegmatites, particularly lithium, we utilize the ECOSTRESS Spectral Library-Version 1.0 for the interpretation of reflectance and absorption determinants of these minerals. Based on the diagnostic characteristics of the selected Li-bearing minerals, we examine several BRs and thresholding and consequently, propose new spectral indices which show a high concentration of spodumene, cookeite, and lepidolite over the northern regions of the study area. According to the obtained results, ASTER data and thresholded BRs present effective results compared to Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. Based on the final outputs, we define nine zones having Li-bearing pegmatites, particularly over the Chapa Dara and Dara-e-Pech districts of southwestern Konar province, which could be promising areas of interest for further detailed exploration. Lastly, we compare the 118 known Li-bearing points collected from previous studies and field observations with the newly-defined zones to validate accuracy. The study's overall accuracy is 71.1%, indicating a good match between our findings and the reference points.

TI  - Terrain sensitive climate mapping for the Arequipa Department in Peru
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate is a powerful driver of agricultural and natural systems, and spatial climate datasets are currently in great demand. This is especially true in the Arequipa Department of Peru, a region with low seasonal precipitation, remarkable topographic variability, and significant water demand in a highly managed water system. This paper presents the Arequipa Climate Maps (ACM) datasets, a high resolution (1 km) spatial 30-year (1988-2017) climate dataset for the Arequipa Region, in Peru. Four interpolation methods, and combinations of those methods, were tested to produce 30 years of daily precipitation, maximum and minimum air temperature: Ordinary Kriging (OK), Thin Plate Splines (TPS), Regression Kriging (RK), and Regression Thin Plate Splines (RTPS). The mixed method RTPS-TPS and RTPS using locally fitted polynomial and potential regressions were found to best represent the spatial variability of precipitation and daily extreme temperatures, respectively, and helped compensate the bias resulting from the lack of weather stations at higher elevations. These methods were then selected to create the ACM dataset, which contains climate maps of 30-year annual and monthly climate normals (ACM-Normals) and 30 years of annual, monthly, and daily climate maps (ACM-YMD). In addition, insights on weather station gap filling in mountainous areas and bias corrections for avoidance of anomalous precipitation and to assure consistency between annual, monthly and daily data are presented, together with discussion about the quality and limitations of the dataset, and its comparison with other datasets.

TI  - Identifying spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 transmissions and the drivers of the patterns in Toronto: a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal modelling
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns and trends of COVID-19 at a local spatial scale using Bayesian approaches are hardly observed in literature. Also, studies rarely use satellite-derived long time-series data on the environment to predict COVID-19 risk at a spatial scale. In this study, we modelled the COVID-19 pandemic risk using a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model that incorporates satellite-derived remote sensing data on land surface temperature (LST) from January 2020 to October 2021 (89 weeks) and several socioeconomic covariates of the 140 neighbourhoods in Toronto. The spatial patterns of risk were heterogeneous in space with multiple high-risk neighbourhoods in Western and Southern Toronto. Higher risk was observed during Spring 2021. The spatiotemporal risk patterns identified 60% of neighbourhoods had a stable, 37% had an increasing, and 2% had a decreasing trend over the study period. LST was positively, and higher education was negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence. We believe the use of Bayesian spatial modelling and the remote sensing technologies in this study provided a strong versatility and strengthened our analysis in identifying the spatial risk of COVID-19. The findings would help in prevention planning, and the framework of this study may be replicated in other highly transmissible infectious diseases.

TI  - Anthropogenic Land Use and Land Cover Changes-A Review on Its Environmental Consequences and Climate Change
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The global demand for food and bioenergy changes associated with land use and land cover change (LULCC) has raised concerns about the environment, global warming, and climate change. There is enough evidence that we are passing through human-induced changes which may lead to sixth mass extinction. Information of spatial representation of land use and land cover and its dynamics of landscape pattern and habitat organisation are vital for developing land use policy, adapting, and mitigating climate change impacts and nature-based solutions, including proposing areas for conservation. Spatial data is also a leading way of providing geographically linked or located data with the help of remote sensing (including drones), geographical information systems, Global Positioning Systems, and real-time in situ measurements. This article attempts to critically review the current research on the congruence of LULCC with climate and its processes. The article discusses current research on LULCC, its environmental consequences, and its impact on regulatory systems of the terrestrial biosphere, ecosystem services, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. Finally, it emphasises the need to evolve land use policy based on scientific analysis of LULCC to achieve sustainability goals and overall socioeconomic development with a special focus on climate change. The commitments of international agreements and protocols also require land use policy which accounts for concerns of climate change.

TI  - Predicting terrain erosion susceptibility from drainage basin morphometry using ALOS-PALSAR DEM: analysis from PCA-weighted AHP approach in a river system of Eastern India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an attempt has been made to ascertain the erosion susceptibility of the Mayurakshi Drainage System in Eastern India using the 12.5 m resolution ALOS-PALSAR DEM dataset by the morphometric attributes viz. relief, surface, drainage texture and topography. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was carried out for ascertaining the erosion susceptibility of the area under consideration. The methodology followed essentially differs from the traditional AHP technique because while assigning weights to multiple parameters, the study has depended on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) instead of the opinion of the experts which are often contradictory. The relative importance of each parameter was calculated from the loading ratios of different parameters under PCA. Furthermore, instead of taking only one PC, we have taken six PCs with a cumulative explained variance of 99.13%. Finally, these AHP-based erosion susceptibility maps were weighted with respect to their explained variances (obtained from PCA for individual component) and the final map displaying the spatial variation of erosion susceptibility in the Mayurakshi Drainage System was obtained. Analysis reveals that, by and large, the area is characterized by lower susceptibility scores with the solitary exception of the middle domain of the Mayurakshi Basin and the upper reach of the Dwarka River. Here, the erosion susceptibility is greatly elevated due to the fact that the rivers have to encounter and incise across a number of low-lying hills which may be considered to be offshoots of the Chhotanagpur Plateau. In other areas, the susceptibility of erosion is reasonably modest.

TI  - Earthquake-Induced Ground Deformation Assessment via Sentinel-1 Radar Aided at Darbandikhan Town
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deformation monitoring has conventional increasing consideration in recent years due to its great importance in modern engineering. Darbandikhan town was hit by a strong earthquake on 12(th) November 2017 which is the Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique has been used to investigate Darbandikhan town stability and the surrounding areas of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. The purpose of this research is to estimate the ground vertical displacement induced by the earthquake as well as the east-west deformation components. Moreover, previous research covered more of Iran's side country that the earthquake had an impact on with little on Iraq's side (Northern-eastern of Iraq), so it was worth researching on Darbandikhan town and surrounding structures to estimate the displacement on its infrastructures. For this study, two pairs of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are used from each ascending and descending tracks over the study area to validate the work. Then, two differential interferograms are created from these images, along Darbandikhan town and the surrounding areas. These differential interferograms are then converted to line of sight (LOS) displacements using open source software (SNAP 8.0). The overall vertical displacement of the residential area of Darbandikhan was estimated from -4 to -10 cm after the earthquake, and the overall east-west displacement was ranging from 2 to 6.4 cm. The current study does not only examine the northern east of Iraq but the whole area of Iran and Iraq in general that lies within the influence of the earthquake. This research could be useful to estimate the overall deformation of Darbandikhan town in particular and the whole area in general. Therefore, the authorities and civil engineers could think of more sustainable buildings and structures before they start to plan within the area of earthquake impact.

TI  - Discover the desirable landscape structure for mitigating urban heat: The urban-rural gradient approach for an ancient Chinese city
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat is one of the most prominent challenges of urbanization. The nature of extraordinarily spatially heterogeneous landscape in cities may provide nature-based solutions to solving the urban heat problems. Here we aimed to discover the most desirable landscape structure vividly demonstrated in urban areas that we can adopt for heat mitigation. We conducted our study in Xi'an, an ancient capital of China, using land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from Landsat8, landscape features interpreted from SPOT6 along with the urban-rural gradient. We found that large LST variability (as high as 18.11 degrees C) existed within the same urban intensity (UI) and it is very promising to see that potential of heat mitigation broadened with increasing urbanization. This is very likely thanks to the archaic urban design of Xi'an, which incorporates and preserves the wisdom of the ancients in the urban landscape layout. We revealed two landscape composition associated desirable cooling landscape structure models (i.e., the enhancement of blue spaces and the enhancement of green spaces) generally applicable for all urban environments, and three landscape configuration related desirable cooling models, that are the complex grey infrastructure model, the aggregated green space model, and the connected and regular model of both grey and green infrastructures, which can be exquisitely adopted at low, high and intermediate urban intensity gradients.

TI  - Regional Nodal Management After Preoperative Systemic Therapy
T2  - SEMINARS IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While historically reserved for patients with locally advanced breast cancer, the indications for preoperative systemic therapy have expanded in parallel with our increased understanding of breast cancer biology. Patient selection for preoperative chemotherapy is now primarily driven by breast cancer subtype and the incorporation of targeted therapies in HER2 + disease as well as immunotherapy in triple negative breast cancer have resulted in increasing response rates and more tailored treatment approaches. Potential benefits with respect to local therapy, now include both tumor downstaging to facilitate breast conservation as well as de-escalation of both axillary surgery and/or nodal radiation for patients who experience a pathologic complete response. Implementing these strategies requires a multidisciplinary approach and best practices for managing the breast and axilla after preoperative chemotherapy continue to evolve. Here we review the current landscape and future directions for local therapy considerations after preoperative chemotherapy. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nonlinear forces in urban thermal environment using Bayesian optimization-based ensemble learning
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization witnessed unprecedented development globally, which causes citizens and urban temperature to become increasingly intertwined. Although researchers were interested in the field, most studies focused on holistic linear links between the characteristics of the urban built-up environment and temperature. The study used Bayesian optimization ensemble learning and Shapley value to decouple the urban thermal environment by Landsat satellite data. This work's novelties reveal the specific driving effect of different value ranges of urban features in the overall process on the urban thermal environment and advancing an optimum observation buffer zone of the urban surface temperature. The study's results were only for daytime and Beijing scope. The following are the main findings: (1) The 2 km observation buffer zone is best to analyze the urban thermal environment for this dataset. (2) The ecological environment factors have a more significant effect on the urban temperature than the urban morphology factors. (3) In summer, when the vegetation coverage exceeds 58.1%, every 10% increase could reduce the temperature by 0.84 degrees C. In contrast to summer, when vegetation coverage exceeds 64.7% and 73.2%, respectively, in spring and fall, there will be a significant marginal utility. (4) The effect of the building height has seasonal variations. It has the greatest cooling effect in the spring when the height is between 18 m and 75 m, and the daytime surface temperature at the time of Landsat overpass will drop by 1.25 degrees C. These findings will aid in understanding how building construction influences urban surface temperature and provide statistical support for planners.

TI  - A multi-platform, open-source, and quantitative remote sensing framework for dam-related hazard investigation: Insights into the 2020 Sardoba dam collapse
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring dam deformation and reservoir conditions plays an important role in routine dam safety assessment. However, maintaining a real-time dam monitoring system and conducting frequent site surveys come with high costs, which may hinder the detection and mitigation of potentially hazardous dam conditions or incident in-vestigations. In view of inaccessibility of in situ data for the scientific community and the need for rapid dam failure hazard investigation, we propose an end-to-end framework that relies on multiple and open-source remote sensing data for the dam-related hazard investigation (RSDHI). The proposed RSDHI framework in-cludes three modules that are capable of monitoring the post-construction deformation status of the dam and the reservoir and provide the first-order and quantitative examination of the hazard causality based on numerical models. We apply and validate the RSDHI framework to a case study of the 2020 Sardoba dam failure in Uzbekistan. We show that the Sardoba Dam experienced continuing subsidence and a local ~ 4.7 cm differential settlement near the breached section. We reveal that the secondary consolidation controls post-construction deformation. The failure was likely related to the compound effect of transverse structural cracks that resulted from the differential settlement and water loading, yet the exact reason for its failure remains unknown. This study demonstrates that the RSDHI framework can combine multi-sensor remote sensing observations and nu-merical modeling to provide a complete and up-to-date status report of dam conditions, thereby providing in-sights into potential instability of dams around the world and enabling rapid investigation of their failures even when no in situ data is available.

TI  - Spatial differentiation of determinants for water conservation dynamics in a dryland mountain
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water conservation (WC) is a key ecosystem service offered by dryland mountains given its effect in flood prevention and drought relief. However, the consequence of climate change on WC services is largely unknown, particularly in mountain areas with limited data availability. By using a parametric model driven by ground and satellite remote sensing data, the spatial distribution of WC and its inter-annual trends and variability were assessed in the Qilian Mountains to differentiate the main factors for WC dynamics. Our results showed that the spatiotemporal variation of modeled WC and remotely sensed soil moisture was consistent. Mean annual WC showed a contrary trend with increasing annual mean air temperature and precipitation and was higher in forests than grasslands and deserts. In the context of warm and humid climates, percentage of the area with a significant increase and decrease in annual WC from 2000 to 2019 was 32.2% and 4.2% (p < 0.05), respectively. WC declines appeared mainly in a forest steppe zone at an altitude of 2600-3300 m, as increased vegetation growth boosted water consumption and eventually led to soil drying. Increases in WC were largely attributed to increasing precipitation and decreasing solar radiation, making a contribution of 39.4 and 38.4%, respectively. WC was positively correlated with precipitation but negatively related to land surface temperature (p < 0.05). A negative relationship between WC and solar radiation was prevalent in deserts. Precipitation and vegetation growth explained 50.1% and 22.8%, respectively, of the inter-annual variability in WC. The findings of this study highlight the importance of evapotranspiration in controlling WC dynamics in the forest steppe zone of a dryland mountain, where a risk from reduced water conservation may increase under future climate warming. To conserve grassland and desert ecosystems is more beneficial to improve the WC function of the Qilian Mountains as compared to afforestation.

TI  - Characteristics of newly formed mesoscale convective systems during the abnormal precipitation over the Yangtze River basin from June to July, 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 62-day "extremely violent Meiyu" occurred in the Yangtze River basin from June to July in 2020, and its abnormal precipitation caused serious losses to the social economy. In this paper, the characteristics of newly formed mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and the environmental conditions affecting the MCS formation during this abnormal precipitation event are investigated based on hourly datasets, including the temperature of brightness blackbody (T-BB) data derived from the FY-2F geostationary meteorological satellite, and the three-source merged precipitation products from China Meteorological Administration. The results show that there were 31,778 times of short-duration heavy precipitation (hourly precipitation exceeding 20 mm) occurred in the Yangtze River basin from June to July in 2020. The 69.3% of short-duration heavy precipitation (hourly precipitation exceeding 20 mm) are closely related to the MCSs. The increase of newly formed MCSs leaded to more short-duration heavy precipitation. The abnormal precipitation in the Yangtze River basin from June to July is mainly caused by elongated MCSs with an average lifetime of 6 h. The number of the newly formed MCSs presents obvious diurnal variations, with the most frequent at 20:00 (Beijing Time, the same below). The newly formed MCSs are prone to appear near the Yangtze-Huaihe shear line, and the magnitude of southerly wind at 500 hPa determines the distance between the MCSs and the shear line. The enhancement of vorticity advection at 500 hPa and water vapor convergence are conducive to the MCS formation. The weakening of low-level jet corresponds to the increase of newborn MCS.

TI  - Assessment of ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalysis data on atmospheric corrections for InSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has achieved remarkable success in deformation monitoring and many related fields but ordinarily suffers from inherent drawbacks stemming from atmospheric effects. In the meantime, the continuously progressing numerical weather models (NWMs) offer a feasible approach to this problem. This paper aims to further investigate the usability of the NWMs. The latest European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis ERA5 and its predecessor ERA-Interim (ERAI) were evaluated using 48 pairs of Sentinel-1 A/B interferograms located in nine subregions of China, covering different seasons, climate types, and landforms. In particular, we focus on the nonlinear component of the InSAR atmospheric error, which is the most difficult to correct. The results show that two reanalyses are the most effective in winter and the least effective in summer. In addition, the correction effect varies between climate types and is further complicated by local topography, water vapor resources, etc. Regions at higher latitude, farther from the sea, and with more moderate topography are more suitable for correction with the two reanalyses. Furthermore, ERA5 shows comparable performance to ERAI in correcting for nonlinear atmospheric effects, and superior performance to ERAI if the spatial linear trend component is retained. Nevertheless, some detailed features of the atmospheric impact, particularly small-scale local turbulence, remain difficult to capture and spatial resolution may not determine their correction effects. Further improvements to NWM are needed in the future, particularly through the assimilation of more accurate meteorological observations with higher spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - The Source Mechanism and Fault Movement Characterization of the 2022 Mw6.7 Menyuan Earthquake Revealed by the Joint Inversion With InSAR and Teleseismic Observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of active fault movements are essential for estimating the earthquake potential on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in a complex geological setting. The 2022 Menyuan Mw6.7 earthquake was studied by a joint seismological and geodetic methodology to deepen the scientific understanding of the source parameters and deformation mechanisms. Firstly, the entire InSAR co-seismic deformation field is obtained based on ascending and descending Sentinel-1A imagery. Subsequently, a Bayesian algorithm is applied in fault geometry and slip distribution determination by combining InSAR measurements and teleseismic data. And the fault movement characteristics of the 2022 Menyuan earthquake are analyzed. Finally, a comprehensive "surface-subsurface" analysis of the effects caused by this earthquake was carried out by combining InSAR and fault data. The results demonstrate that the ground settlement and uplift induced by the 2022 Menyuan earthquake are significant, with a maximum relative deformation of 56 cm. The seismogenic fault is on the junction of the Lenglongling (LLL) and Tuolaishan (TLS) faults, and the main body is in the western part of the LLL fault, a high dip left-lateral strike-slip fault with NWW-SEE strike. The slip distribution results indicate that the largest slip of 3.45 m occurs at about 5 km below the ground, and the earthquake magnitude is Mw6.63. And further analysis by integrated geological structure and inversion results reveals that the earthquakes that occurred on the North Lenglongling Fault (NLLL) in 1986 and 2016 have contributed to the 2022 Menyuan earthquake.

AB  - Mapping hydrothermal alteration is an important means of mineral exploration, therefore, effective improvement of the accuracy of identification of hydrothermal alteration minerals is a hot topic. In this study, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Sentinel-2A data were selected for the Pulang copper deposit, to improve the accuracy of hydrothermal alteration mineral mapping. Three data fusion methods of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Gram-Schmidt (GS) and High-Pass Filtering (HPF) were employed, and method of spectral matching was introduced to obtain high spatial resolution and high spectral fidelity fused data. The comparison showed that the HPF fusion method had the best effect. The fused data by the HPF fusion method were then implemented to map hydrothermal alteration minerals by using a multifractal-based method of PCA + Spectrum-Area. Through the verification of a field investigation, the results exhibited a similar hydrothermal alteration distribution, compared with the results obtained from the original ASTER data, but with higher identification accuracy. Therefore, the case study strongly suggests that the image fusion method with spectral matching is an effective tool to increase spatial resolution, while maintaining high spectral fidelity. Thus, it is a valuable and economic method for improving the identification accuracy of hydrothermal alteration minerals.

TI  - Atypical Spitz tumours: an epidemiological, clinical and dermoscopic multicentre study with 16 years of follow-up
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Atypical Spitz tumours (ASTs) are regarded as an intermediate category distinguished from prototypical Spitz naevus by presenting one or more atypical features and often by an uncertain malignant potential. Clinical and dermoscopic features may play a relevant role in the diagnostic approach. Aim To evaluate the clinical and dermoscopic features of ASTs, and their evolution over time. Methods This was a descriptive, multicentre study of the clinical and dermoscopic characteristics of ASTs. Data on clinical and dermoscopic characteristics, histopathology, local extension, therapy and follow-up, lymph node staging, complete lymph node dissection, and outcome were collected from the databases of four Italian Dermatology Units for the period 2004-2021. Results The study population consisted of 99 patients (62 female, 37 male) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of AST, including age at presentation ranged from 2 to 70 years (mean 28.1 years, median 24 years). Of the 99 patients, 29 (29.3%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, which showed evidence of micrometastases in three cases (10.3%); all three patients underwent complete lymph node dissection with no evidence of further metastasis. Considering the whole study population, the clinical outcome was excellent, as all of the patients have no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 216 months (mean 81.6 months, median 78 months). In addition, we collected data on the clinical and dermoscopic features of 26 lesions. The most frequent dermoscopic pattern observed was the multicomponent pattern (34.6%), followed by homogeneous (26.9%) and nonspecific (23.2%). In 66.7% of amelanotic ASTs, we observed glomerular (coiled) vessels uniformly distributed within the entire lesion, without asymmetry. Conclusion The results of our study with a long follow-up show no recurrence or distant metastases, confirming the good clinical outcome, even in the case of sentinel lymph node positivity. From a diagnostic point of view, our series identified a typical dermoscopic picture for amelanotic ASTs, with a glomerular vascular pattern throughout the lesion in the absence of other dermoscopic parameters, making the correct diagnosis possible.

TI  - Estimation of heavy metal concentrations (Cd and Pb) in plant leaves using optimal spectral indicators and artificial neural networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The necessity of continuously monitoring the agricultural products in terms of their health has enforced the development of rapid, low-cost, and non-destructive monitoring solutions. Heavy metal contamination of the plants is known as a source of health threats that are made by their proximities with pollutant soil, water, and air. In this paper, a method was proposed to measure lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) contamination of plant leaves through field spectrometry as a low-cost solution for continuous monitoring. The study area was Mahneshan county of Zanjan province in Iran with rich heavy metal mines that have more potential for plant contamination. At first, we collected different plant samples throughout the study area and measured the Pb and Cd concentrations using ICP-AES, in which we observed that the concentrations of Pb and Cd are in the range of 1.4 similar to 282.6 and 0.3 similar to 66.7 mu gg(-1), respectively, and then we tried to find the optimum estimator model through a multi-objective version of genetic algorithm (GA) optimization that finds simultaneously the structure of an artificial neural network and its input features. The features extracted from the raw spectrums have been collimated to be compatible with the Sentinel-2 multispectral bands for the possibility of further developments. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the optimum estimator model in estimation of the leaves' Pb and Cd contamination, irrespective of the plant type, which has reached the R-2 of 0.99 and 0.85 for Pb and Cd, respectively. Additionally, the results suggested that the 783-, 842-, and 865-nm spectral bands, which are similar to the 7, 8, and 8a sentinel-2 spectral bands, are more efficient for this purpose.

TI  - Integrating Aster 07XT, Landsat 8, and aeromagnetic data for the delineation of potential mineralization sites in North Cameroon
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In mineral exploration, detailed hydrothermally altered minerals mapping is an important approach prior to the field campaign. The study area contains several gold-bearing quartz veins associated with hydrothermally altered zones rich in sulphides, muscovite/sericite, iron oxides, and hydrous silica. In this study, Aster 07XT, Landsat 8, and aeromagnetic data were integrated to detect potential zones associated with gold mineralization in Northern Cameroon. For this purpose, the relative band absorption depth, band ratioing, and analytic signal techniques were applied to enhance, identify and map hydrothermal alteration minerals, that is, hydroxyl-bearing, iron oxide/hydroxide. In addition, a semi-automatic approach was applied to extract remotely sensed and aeromagnetic lineaments from PCI Geomatica and Centre for Exploration Targeting Grid Analysis respectively. Hence, several potential mining targets were delineated from the processing of both remote sensing and aeromagnetic data. The major directions of the lineaments affecting the area include NE-SW/ENE-WSW, E-W, and N-S. Detailed field campaigns, petrographic analyses, and spectral measurements of rock samples were carried out in Tchollire and environs to verify the results from remotely sensed data. The analytical observations indicated the presence of quartz, epidote, chlorite, magnetite, haematite, sericite, galena, sulphide, telluride minerals, etc. Moreover, the target hydrothermal alteration zones were proved to be spatially associated with known mining areas and gold occurrences in the study area. Consequently, new prospective mining areas have been designated. This study confirmed the reliability and applicability of the processing of satellite imagery in mineral exploration in Northern Cameroon. It is suggested that the dataset used in this study provides a suitable tool for mapping hydrothermal alteration minerals linked to gold deposits and can be applied in other provinces with similar geological settings.

TI  - Combined analysis of remote sensing, gravity and magnetic data across Moyar Bhavani Shear Zone, Southern Granulite Terrane (SGT), India: appraisals for crustal architecture and tectonics
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a combined analysis of remote sensing, gravity and magnetic data across Moyar Bhavani Shear Zone (MBSZ), Southern Granulite Terrane (SGT), India to study crustal architecture and tectonics. The horizontal gradient of gravity data shows strong density inhomogeneity across the MBSZ. The magnetic data and residual gravity analysis shows corroboration of a NE-SW trending linear magnetic anomaly zone and residual gravity high strip along the MBSZ. The low magnetic anomalies dominate the northern part of the MBSZ, while the southern part is dominated by moderate to high anomalies. The integration of potential data and remote sensing data clearly reveals that ENE-WSW is the dominant structural trend that coincides with the Mettur Shear Zone (MeSZ) trend. The joint gravity and magnetic modelling suggest that the MBSZ, is characterized by the disposition of melange of moderate to high-density rocks of diamagnetic nature.

TI  - Multiplexed serotype-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assays - A valuable tool to support large-scale surveillance for bluetongue virus infection
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been increasingly adopted for bluetongue diagnosis with both broadly reactive and serotype-specific assays widely used. The use of these assays and nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enhanced bluetongue virus detection, resulting in the identification of a number of new serotypes. As a result, 27 different serotypes are officially recognised, and at least three more are proposed. Rapid identification of the virus serotype is essential for matching of antigens used in vaccines and to undertake surveillance and epidemiological studies to assist risk management. However, it is not uncommon for multiple serotypes to circulate in a region either concurrently or in successive years. It is therefore necessary to have a large suite of assays available to ensure that the full spectrum of viruses is detected. Nevertheless, covering a large range of virus serotypes is demanding from both a time and resource perspective. To overcome these challenges, real-time PCR assays were optimised to match local virus strains and then combined in a panel of quadriplex assays, resulting in three assays to detect 12 serotypes directly from blood samples from cattle and sheep. These multiplex assays have been used extensively for bluetongue surveillance in both sentinel animals and opportunistically collected samples. A protocol to adapt these assays to capture variations in local strains of bluetongue virus and to expand the panel is described. Collectively, these assays provide powerful tools for surveillance and the rapid identification of bluetongue virus serotypes directly from animal blood samples.

TI  - A Radiomics Model for Preoperative Predicting Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Based on Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo develop a radiomics model based on preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to identify sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in breast cancer (BC) patients. Materials and MethodsThe MRI images and clinicopathological data of 142 female primary BC patients from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in this study. The patients were randomly divided into the training and testing cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Four types of radiomics models were built: 1) a radiomics model based on the region of interest (ROI) of breast tumor; 2) a radiomics model based on the ROI of intra- and peri-breast tumor; 3) a radiomics model based on the ROI of axillary lymph node (ALN); 4) a radiomics model based on the ROI of ALN and breast tumor. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the performance of the three radiomics models. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) through decision matrix analysis was used to select the best model. ResultsModels 1, 2, 3, and 4 yielded AUCs of 0.977, 0.999, 0.882, and 1.000 in the training set and 0.699, 0.817, 0.906, and 0.696 in the testing set, respectively, in terms of predicting SLN metastasis. Model 3 had the highest AUC in the testing cohort, and only the difference from Model 1 was statistically significant (p = 0.022). DCA showed that Model 3 yielded a greater net benefit to predict SLN metastasis than the other three models in the testing cohort. The best model analyzed by TOPSIS was Model 3, and the method's names for normalization, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and classification are mean, principal component analysis (PCA), ANOVA, and support vector machine (SVM), respectively. ConclusionALN radiomics feature extraction on DCE-MRI is a potential method to evaluate SLN status in BC patients.

TI  - Land use/land cover and change detection mapping in Rahuri watershed area (MS), India using the google earth engine and machine learning approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The change detection and land use and land cover (LULC) maps are more important powerful forces behind numerous ecological systems and fallow land. The current research focuses on demarcating the spatiotemporal LULC changes, NDVI and change detections maps. These effects directly affect the ecosystem, land resources, cropping pattern and agriculture. LULC assessment and surveillance are essential for long-term planning and sustainable use of natural resources. However, we have developed the soft computing machine learning algorithm for mapping land use and land cover based on the Google earth engine (GEE) platform and change detection mapping done by SAGA GIS software. It is significantly used for ecological safety and planning under various climate variations. To accurately describe the land use and land cover classes with changes are identified in the area. This area exclusively uses the multitemporal Landsat-5 (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m) imageries in LULC mapping. The GEE is a cloud-computing platform with the prevailing classification ability of random forest (RF) models to make five-year interval LULC maps for 2010, 2015 and 2020. To unique multiple RF models established as a classifier in the algorithm created by JavaScript and GEE. SAGA GIS has provided the best platform for detecting changes in land use and land cover classes. NDVI maps are created based on the cloud-based platform. These maps value ranges between -0.68 to -0.15, 0.76 to -0.29 and 0.66 to -0.11 in 2010, 2015 and 2020. Experimental outcomes indicate five classes such as water bodies, built up, barren, cropland and fallow land during 2010, 2015 and 2020. The overall accuracy of User and Producer for 2010, 2015 and 2019 years in between 86.23%, 88.34%, 85.53% and 92.51%, 94.34% and 91.54%, respectively. We have observed that (2010, 2015 - 2020) agriculture and built-up land increased by 1040.76 ha, 1246.32 ha, 1500.93 ha and 34.96 ha, 37.08 ha, 42.58 ha, respectively. Other side degraded land, fallow land, waterbodies areas (953.19 ha, 679.23 ha, 937.24 ha and 1385.73 ha, 1513.53 ha, 991.08 ha and 32.85 ha, 21.33 ha, 25.66 ha) are increased during the year of 2010, 2015 and 2020, respectively. While results have been done by GEE cloud platform and remote sensing data, this developed algorithm easily classified the land use maps from Landsat-5 and Sentinel-2 TM imagery in the machine learning approach. The determined 30-m and 10-m three-year LULC maps are made-up to deliver vital data on the changes, monitoring and understanding of which types of LULC classes and changes have occupied a place in the Rahuri area.

TI  - MNPmApp: An image analysis tool to quantify mononuclear phagocyte distribution in mucosal tissues
T2  - CYTOMETRY PART A
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) such as dendritic cells and macrophages perform key sentinel functions in mucosal tissues and are responsible for inducing and maintaining adaptive immune responses to mucosal pathogens. Positioning of MNPs at the epithelial interface facilitates their access to luminally-derived antigens and regulates MNP function through soluble mediators or surface receptor interactions. Therefore, accurately quantifying the distribution of MNPs within mucosal tissues as well as their spatial relationship with other cells is important to infer functional cellular interactions in health and disease. In this study, we developed and validated a MATLAB-based tissue cytometry platform, termed "MNP mapping application" (MNPmApp), that performs high throughput analyses of MNP density and distribution in the gastrointestinal mucosa based on digital multicolor fluorescence microscopy images and that integrates a Monte Carlo modeling feature to assess randomness of MNP distribution. MNPmApp identified MNPs in tissue sections of the human gastric mucosa with 98 +/- 2% specificity and 76 +/- 15% sensitivity for HLA-DR+ MNPs and 98 +/- 1% specificity and 85 +/- 12% sensitivity for CD11c(+) MNPs. Monte Carlo modeling revealed that mean MNP-MNP distances for both HLA-DR+ and CD11c(+) MNPs were significantly lower than anticipated based on random cell placement, whereas MNP-epithelial distances were similar to randomly placed cells. Surprisingly, H. pylori infection had no significant impact on the number of HLA-DR and CD11c MNPs or their distribution within the gastric lamina propria. However, our study demonstrated that MNPmApp is a reliable and user-friendly tool for unbiased quantitation of MNPs and their distribution at mucosal sites.

TI  - Decision tree-based machine learning models for above-ground biomass estimation using multi-source remote sensing data and object-based image analysis
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation provides valuable information about the carbon cycle. Thus, the overall goal of this paper is to present an approach to enhance the accuracy of the AGB estimation. The main objectives are to: 1) investigate the performance of remote sensing data sources, including airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), optical, SAR, and their combination to improve the AGB predictions, 2) examine the capability of tree-based machine learning models, and 3) compare the performance of pixel-based and object-based image analysis (OBIA). To investigate the performance of machine learning models, multiple tree-based algorithms were fitted to predictors derived from airborne LiDAR data, Landsat, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and PALSAR-2/PALSAR SAR data collected within New York's Adirondack Park. Combining remote sensing data from multiple sources improved the model accuracy (RMSE: 52.14 Mg ha(-1) and R-2: 0.49). There was no significant difference among gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. In addition, pixel-based and object-based models were compared using the airborne LiDAR-derived AGB raster as a training/testing sample. The OBIA provided the best results with the RMSE of 33.77 Mg ha(-1) and R-2 of 0.81 for the combination of optical and SAR data in the GBM model.

TI  - World-wide InSAR sensitivity index for landslide deformation tracking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major geohazard in hilly and mountainous environments. In-situ inspection of downslope motion is costly, sometimes dangerous and, requires prior knowledge of the existence of a landslide. Remote sensing from space is a way to detect and characterize landslides systematically at large scale. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has shown to be a valuable resource of deformation information, but it requires expert knowledge and considerable computational efforts. Moreover, the successful application of InSAR for landslides requires a favorable acquisition geometry relative to the landslide deformation pattern. Consequently, there is a need for a widely applicable tool to assess the potential of InSAR at a particular location a priori. Here we present a novel, generic approach to assess the potential of InSAR-based deformation tracking, providing a standardised and automated method applicable on any slope. We define the detection potential as the sensitivity of InSAR to detect downslope displacement combined with the presence of coherently scattering surfaces. We show that deformation can be detected on at least 91% of the global landslide-prone slopes, and provide an open source Google Earth Engine tool for the quick assessment of the availability of potential coherent scatterers. This tool enables any person interested in applying InSAR to routinely assess the potential for monitoring landslide deformation in their region of interest.

TI  - Potential of UAV-based sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence to detect water stress in beet
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a direct indicator of plant photosynthetic activities and can potentially indicate plant physiological changes caused by water stress. However, the direct effect of water stress on the physiological SIF responses in crops at the field level still needs further research to clearly understand the involved mechanisms. To study this relationship, we made use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are flexible and cost-effective to acquire SIF data at a high temporal resolution. We acquired near-infrared SIF (760 nm) and red SIF (687 nm) measurements using a UAV platform over irrigated and non-irrigated sugar beet plots. To represent physiological changes in crops, we calculated the apparent SIF yield (SIF normalized by the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) at 760 and 687 nm (Phi F-760yield and Phi F-687yield), the fluorescence emission yield at 760 nm (43F760), and the SIFratio (the ratio between SIF687 and SIF760). Phi F(760 )was estimated using the recently developed NIRvH approach. For an improved interpretation of the response of these SIF indicators, we also acquired additional UAV-based hyperspectral and thermal data. We found that on June 28, when sugar beets were experiencing water stress, SIF687yield, Phi F-760, and SIFr(atio )all showed a significant response to the recovery of the irrigated sugar beets (p-value < 0.05). On the other hand, on July 24 when both water stress and heat stress affected the crop, only Phi F(760 )and SIFratio weakly tracked the changes induced by the irrigation (p-value < 0.1). Phi F-760 had similar changes to SIF(760yield )in both June and July, but Phi F(760 )was more sensitive to irrigation. This indicates the importance of correcting for the structural effect when interpreting the SIF response. The findings suggest that SIF indicators can indicate water stress at the field level, but its value to detect the changes of photosynthetic activities under severe stress needs more investigation.

TI  - Difference in seasonal peak timing of soybean far-red SIF and GPP explained by canopy structure and chlorophyll content
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have provided an exciting and promising opportunity for estimating gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies mainly focused on the linear correlation between SIF and GPP and the slope of the SIF-GPP relationship, both of which lack rigorous consideration of the seasonal trajectories of SIF and GPP. Here, we investigated the timing of seasonal peaks of far-red SIF and GPP in soybean fields by integrating tower data, satellite data, and process-based Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE, v2.0) model simulations. We found inconsistency between the seasonal peak timing of far-red SIF and GPP in three of four soybean fields based on tower far-red SIF and eddy-covariance measurements. In particular, far-red SIF reached its seasonal maximum 14-17 days earlier than GPP. This far-red SIF-GPP difference in peak timing degraded the correlation between sunny-day far-red SIF and GPP at daily scale (Pearson r = 0.83-0.87 at the site with 14-17 days difference and Pearson r = 0.96 at the site with no difference), and it can be explained by a divergence in the seasonality between absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) and canopy chlorophyll content (Chl(Canopy)). We found that the seasonality of far-red SIF - a byproduct of the light reactions of photosynthesis - was primarily controlled by APAR, whereas GPP seasonality was dominated by Chl(Canopy). Further, SCOPE model simulations showed that the seasonal patterns of leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)) and leaf angle distribution (LAD) could affect the different peak timing of SIF and GPP and consequently the seasonal relationship between far-red SIF and GPP. A further increase in LAI after the fraction of light absorption (FPAR) saturates and a later peak of Chl(Leaf) compared to LAI results in a later peak of GPP compared to far-red SIF. More horizontal leaf angles can further exacerbate this difference. Our results advance mechanistic understanding of the SIF-GPP relationships and combining chlorophyll content information with SIF could potentially improve remote-sensing-based GPP estimation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal estimation of gross primary production for terrestrial wetlands using satellite and field data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this study was to determine the GPP at the Biebrza Wetlands for sedges, reeds and grasses habitats, applying satellite data. The ground measurements of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and respiration (RESP) were conducted at 26 sites at the peatland using chamber method during the vegetation growth from April to October 2015-2020. Applying round-theclock registrations of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and one ground measurement of NEE and RESP the simulation of the daily course of GPP was performed. GPP daily mean values were the object of estimation applying the models based on the satellite data derived from Sentinel 2, Sentinel 3 and MODIS. The main factors of photosynthetic carbon uptake - greenness and moisture were described by satellite vegetation indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Accumulated Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR), evapotranspiration, latent heat and the differences of surface temperature (Ts) and air temperature (Ta). The models presented as a result of this research can be used applying solely the satellite data. The results of the analysis revealed that NDVI index is the driving factor for the assessment of GPP independently on the type of satellite data (r = 0.64) Up to 40% of GPP variance is explained by the variable connected with the vegetation greenness. The contribution of vegetation moisture indices is about two times smaller. The best fit has been achieved for the Sentinel-3 models with inclusion of the environmental parameters, as NDVI, temperature difference (Ts-Ta), latent heat. The differences of uptake the CO2 between the habitats depending on their phases of phenological development have been presented.

TI  - The environmental drivers of tree cover and forest-savanna mosaics in Southeast Asia
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest-savanna mosaics exist across all major tropical regions. Yet, the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of these mosaics is not well explored, limiting our understanding of the environmental constraints on savannas especially in Southeast Asia, where most savannas exist in mosaics. Despite clear structural and functional characteristics indicative of savannas, most SE Asian savannas continue to be classified as forest. This designation is problematic because SE Asian savannas are threatened by both fragmentation and forest-centric management practices. By studying forest-savanna mosaics across SE Asia, we aimed to parse out how landscape mosaics of forest and savanna may be constrained by fire, climate and soil characteristics. We used remotely sensed data to characterize the distribution of tree cover and forest-savanna mosaics. Using regression models, we quantified the relative effects of precipitation, fire frequency, seasonality and soil characteristics on average tree cover and landscape patchiness. We found that low tree cover, indicative of savannas, occurs in drier, seasonal subregions that experience frequent fire. Further, our results demonstrate that fire and precipitation strongly shape landscape patchiness. Landscapes were patchiest in subregions with low precipitation and intermediate fire frequency. These results demonstrate that the environmental factors important in delineating the distribution of savannas globally shape the distribution of tree cover and landscape patchiness across SE Asia. Fire especially drives patterns of tree cover across scales. In a region where fire suppression is a common management strategy, our results suggest that further research studying vegetation response to fire and fire suppression is needed to improve management and conservation of these mosaic landscapes. More broadly, this work demonstrates a useful approach for studying the environmental drivers that influence the distribution of forest-savanna mosaics.

TI  - Personalized response-directed surgery and adjuvant therapy after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab in high-risk stage III melanoma: the PRADO trial
T2  - NATURE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab induces high pathologic response rates (pRRs) in clinical stage III nodal melanoma, and pathologic response is strongly associated with prolonged relapse-free survival (RFS). The PRADO extension cohort of the OpACIN-neo trial (NCT02977052) addressed the feasibility and effect on clinical outcome of using pathologic response after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab as a criterion for further treatment personalization. In total, 99 patients with clinical stage IIIb-d nodal melanoma were included and treated with 6 weeks of neoadjuvant ipilimumab 1 mg kg(-1) and nivolumab 3 mg kg(-1). In patients achieving major pathologic response (MPR, <= 10% viable tumor) in their index lymph node (ILN, the largest lymph node metastasis at baseline), therapeutic lymph node dissection (TLND) and adjuvant therapy were omitted. Patients with pathologic partial response (pPR; >10 to <= 50% viable tumor) underwent TLND only, whereas patients with pathologic non-response (pNR; >50% viable tumor) underwent TLND and adjuvant systemic therapy +/- synchronous radiotherapy. Primary objectives were confirmation of pRR (ILN, at week 6) of the winner neoadjuvant combination scheme identified in OpACIN-neo; to investigate whether TLND can be safely omitted in patients achieving MPR; and to investigate whether RFS at 24 months can be improved for patients achieving pNR. ILN resection and ILN-response-tailored treatment were feasible. The pRR was 72%, including 61% MPR. Grade 3-4 toxicity within the first 12 weeks was observed in 22 (22%) patients. TLND was omitted in 59 of 60 patients with MPR, resulting in significantly lower surgical morbidity and better quality of life. The 24-month relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 93% and 98% in patients with MPR, 64% and 64% in patients with pPR, and 71% and 76% in patients with pNR, respectively. These findings provide a strong rationale for randomized clinical trials testing response-directed treatment personalization after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy on quality of life in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a proven method for staging the neck in patients with early oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma because it results in less comorbidity than the traditional method of selective neck dissection, with the same oncological results. However, the real effect of that method on the quality of life of such patients remains unknown.Objective The present study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma T1/T2N0 submitted to sentinel lymph node biopsy compared to those that received selective neck dissection.Methods Cross-sectional study including 24 patients, after a 36 month follow-up, 15 of them submitted to the sentinel lymph node biopsy and 9 to selective neck dissection. All patients answered the University of Washington quality of life questionnaire.Results The evaluation of the questionnaires showed a late worsening of the domains appearance (p = 0.035) and chewing (p = 0.041), as well as a decrease of about 10% of general quality of life (p = 0.025) in patients undergoing selective neck dissection in comparison to those undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy.Conclusion Patients with early-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy presented better late results of general quality of life, mainly regarding appearance and chewing, when compared to patients submitted to selective neck dissection.

TI  - Inferring the joint operation of high Aswan dam and Toshka depression using multi-sensor satellite approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions have been successful in overcoming the challenge of data availability in ungauged basins. In this study, we applied a Multi-Sensor Satellite (MSS) approach to understand the reservoir operation in the Nile river basin (NRB) with the focus on the joint operation of High Aswan Dam (HAD) and Toshka depression, located in the southwestern part of HAD. The MSS data, which integrates Landsat (5-8), Sentinel-2A, MODIS with hydrological model outputs, are used in a water balance model to derive the operation of HAD reservoir and Toshka depression. The results show that the MSS approach has a reasonable skill when modelling the Toshka inflow (i.e. HAD spillway outflow) with a Relative Error and R-2 of -19.14% and 0.79, respectively (for the period 1998-2002). Overall, our study provides a framework that harnesses free available sensors to infer the operation of lakes and reservoirs in the NRB.

TI  - Delineation of urban expansion and drought-prone areas using vegetation conditions and other geospatial indices
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a dominant climatic feature in arid and semiarid regions. Climate change, temperature variability, and anthropogenic activities caused an increase in agricultural droughts in many regions. Investigation of drought dynamics is important for innovative planning and management of natural resources in drought-prone areas. Remote sensing indices and earth observational datasets were used in this study to investigate droughts in the Bikaner city of Rajasthan, India. Vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), and vegetation health index (VHI), estimated from multitemporal Landsat datasets, were used for monitoring the drought-prone areas. Land use land cover (LULC) map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and surface temperature were also calculated for monitoring the decadal changes in surface features. The results showed that barren lands decreased from around 162.75 to 79.59 km(2). The annual average temperature increased by 0.72 degrees C, while agricultural land increased by 33.83 km(2) during 1990-2020. There was a gradual increase in droughts, but the increase was more in recent years than in the early period. The climatic condition revealed from VCI, TCI, and NDVI maps indicated most of the Bikaner city is prone to moderate and extreme droughts. The study indicates the need for VCI-based real-time drought monitoring for drought management.

TI  - Transformation of rural landscapes in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta from 1990 to 2019: a spatio-temporal analysis
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we aimed to explore the rural landscape transformation through the analysis of land use/land cover (LULC) spatio-temporal dynamics in the entire Vietnamese Mekong Delta over the three decades, using Landsat imageries and a supervised random forest classifier. Results indicated that in the 1990s, dominant LULC types were arable cropland, wetland, and permanent crops, which covered approximately half of the delta, 28% and 8%, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the wetland area decreased from 28% to 5% due to the expansion of aquaculture and the arable cropland. The aquaculture, however, expanded more rapidly than other land use conversions, namely, from 2% to 19%. Although mangrove forests slightly recovered by 58 km(2) from 2005 to 2019, the overall trend (1990-2019) showed an intense loss of 740 km(2) due to widespread conversions into aquaculture. The paper unravels the complex dynamics between land-cover change, socio-economic development and associated land-use policies, which have significant implications for the change in rural landscapes.

TI  - Prediction of land use land cover changes of a river basin using the CA-Markov model
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation and prediction of land use land cover (LULC) has been presented using Hybrid CA-Markov model for the Mahi River basin. LULC information for the year 2000, 2010, and 2020 have been obtained from classification of Landsat TM, IRS -LISS III, and Sentinel 2 sensors, respectively. Fuzzy membership function and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) have been used for LULC change suitability map preparation. Population density, distance from road, settlement, streams, and reservoir/lakes, slope, and DEM are used as biophysical and socio-economic LULC change drivers. Model results have been validated for year 2020 and accuracy has been found as satisfactory 2020. Results revealed a significant change in forest, agriculture, barren and built-up LULC classes during different years. Agriculture and the built-up area may increase by 641 and 21 sq.km, respectively in 2030. The predicted LULC information provides necessary data to investigate the future hydrological and climatological scenario.

TI  - A Novel Fascial Flap Technique After Inguinal Complete Lymph Node Dissection for Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Inguinal complete lymph node dissection (CLND) for metastatic melanoma exposes the femoral vein and artery. To protect femoral vessels while preserving the sartorius muscle, we developed a novel sartorius and adductor fascial flap (SAFF) technique for coverage.Methods: The SAFF technique includes dissection of fascia off sartorius and/or adductor muscles, rotation over femoral vasculature, and suturing into place. Patientswhounderwent inguinal CLND with SAFF for melanoma at our institution were identified retrospectively from a prospectively-collected database. Patient characteristics and post-operative outcomes were obtained. Multivariate logistic regression assessed associations of palpable and non-palpable disease with wound complications.Results: From 2008 to 2019, 51 patients underwent CLND with SAFF. Median age was 62 years, and 59% were female. Thirty-one (61%) patients were presented with palpable disease and 20 (39%) had non-palpable disease. Fifty-five percent (95% confidence interval CI: 40%-69%) experienced at least one wound complication: wound infection was most common (45%; 95% CI: 31%-60%), while bleeding was the least (2%; 95% CI: 0.05%-11%). Complications were similar, with and without palpable disease.Conclusions: The SAFF procedure covers femoral vessels, minimizes bleeding, preserves the sartorius muscle, and uses standard surgical techniques easily adoptable by surgeons who perform inguinal CLND.

AB  - Indigenous communities worldwide face threats to their linguistic and epistemic heritage with the unabated spread of dominant colonial languages and global monocultures, such as English and the neoliberal, imperialistic worldview. There is considerable strain on the relatively few Elders and speakers of Indigenous languages to maintain cultures and languages decimated by centuries of colonialism. One shared and common goal for Indigenous language revitalization initiatives is to reinvigorate intergenerational language transmission in the home, the community and beyond in as many ways as possible. How can technology support this nuanced process and existing initiatives? Following an Indigenous research paradigm, this article explores an immersive, community-led Indigenous language acquisition approach - TEK-nology (traditional ecological knowledge [TEK] and technology) - to support Anishinaabemowin language revitalization and reclamation (ALRR) in the Canadian context. The TEK-nology pilot project identifies (1) the impacts of centring Indigenous worldviews in technology, language learning and teaching; (2) how we can develop and co-create technology-enabled, culturally and environmentally responsive pedagogies and (3) the important implications of decolonizing language education for Indigenous and majority languages. The TEK-nology pilot project demonstrates how community-led, relational technology and immersive Indigenous language acquisition can support ALRR and foster more equitable multicultural and multilingual education practice and policy.

TI  - Regional-scale evaluation of 14 satellite-based precipitation products in characterising extreme events and delineating rainfall thresholds for flood hazards
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gridded satellite-based rainfall products have not been so far evaluated for flood hazards monitoring through empirical methods, especially over large areas. Therefore, the main aims of this study are (i) to assess the quality of satellite-based precipitation products for identifying extreme rainfall events able to produce flood events, and (ii) to evaluate the use of satellite-based precipitation products for creating rainfall thresholds to support decision making for issuing flood warnings. Eight products fully based on satellite data (i.e., uncorrected) and six gauge-corrected products were evaluated based on ground-based data obtained from 583 sub-daily rainfall gauges and considering a catalogue of 551 flood occurrences in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for a period of five years (2015-2019). The gauged values were compared with the precipitation products for six different time steps (3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 10 d) and considering rainfall-duration thresholds for six non-exceedance probabilities (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%). Results show that all analysed products tend to large underestimate the extreme rainfall events (i.e., when and where flood events were registered), mainly for sub-daily scales, with the best results found for two uncorrected products (i.e., PDIR-Now and GPM + SM2RAIN) considering 10-days accumulated precipitation. Considerable underestimations were also identified for the rainfall thresholds delineated by the satellite-based products, with the best performances obtained by CHIRP V2.0 (uncorrected) and IMERG-F (corrected) considering tolerance levels of 20%. Based on our findings, the rainfall satellite-based products dataset, even less accurate than the ground-based observations, can be applied, when multi-daily accumulated data are considered, as an alternative source of data for determining precipitation thresholds in some regions that present low-density of RAIN gauges but not replace the gauged data in regions with a high-density of rain gauges with sub-daily data available

TI  - Detecting slow-moving landslides in parts of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya, NE India: quantitative constraints from PSInSAR and its relation to the structural discontinuities
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The difficulty of monitoring slow-moving landslides is attributed to its highly dynamic spatial and temporal character, especially in a tectonic regime like the Himalayas, where the control of structural discontinuities to determine the risk at a local and regional scale is essential. Although many methods have been used for landslide monitoring in the past, the identification, measurement and categorization of landslide-induced relative surface displacements, its relevant relationship with relative slope and structural features, and forecasting remain elusive. The present work explores a holistic approach towards studying slow-moving landslides in and around the urban locales (Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Gangtok) of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya. In order to establish an effective relationship, 109 successive C-band Sentinel-1A dataset acquired from February 2017 to October 2020 has been analysed using PSInSAR to identify the potential landslide risk zone in the selected blocks. Results indicate nearly 10.63% (similar to 42km(2)) of the total Sikkim monitoring area (similar to 395km(2)) is subjected to a 20-40 mm/yr of mean annual displacement rate and thus considered to be under the expression of potential risk. The contextual relationship between slope instabilities and regional thrusts/faults is also established. The derived time series displacement estimates are further integrated with corresponding slope estimates derived from the ALOS PALSAR DEM to determine the nature of Line of Sight (LOS) displacement followed by its classification into different categories and are further used in forecasting using ARIMA (1,1,1; 2,1,1) model. Results indicated that the area may experience cumulative displacement of 200-240 mm with a predicted 2.5-threefold increase between 2020 and 2023.

TI  - Surveillance of influenza B severe hospitalized cases during 10 seasons in Catalonia: Does the lineage make a difference?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza B viruses circulate in two lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata). Although classically affecting children, recently it has shown a high rate of infection and increased hospitalization in the elderly. To describe and analyze the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of severe hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza B virus (SHLCI-B) cases in Catalonia associated with mismatch from Influenza B virus strain included in the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). SHLCI-B was registered by the influenza sentinel surveillance system of Catalonia (PIDIRAC) during ten surveillance seasons from 2010 to 2020. Variables age, comorbidities, and vaccination status were recorded. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1-OR) for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05. A total of 1159 SHLCI-B were registered, of these 68.2% (791) corresponded to the 2017-2018 season; 21.8% (253) were admitted to ICU and 13.8% (160) were exitus; 62.5% (725) cases occurred in those aged >64 years; most frequent risk factor was cardiovascular disease (35.1%, 407) followed by chronic pulmonary obstructive disease-COPD (24.6%, 285) and diabetes (24.1%, 279). In four seasons, the predominant circulating lineage was B/Victoria, in two seasons the B/Yamagata lineage and four seasons had no IBV activity. Four seasons presented discordance with the strain included within the TIV. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent ICU admission was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4%-51%; p = 0.03); being 29% (95% CI: -3% to 51%) in discordant and 43% (95% CI:-43% to 77%) in concordant seasons. Significant differences were observed in the number of affected aged > 64 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.9-3.4; p < 0.001) and in patients with heart disease (OR = 2.40 95% CI: 1.7-3.4; p < 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.6 95% CI: 1.1-2.3; p = 0.01), and diabetes (OR = 1.5 95% CI: 1.1-2.1; p = 0.04) between discordant and concordant seasons. The increase in hospitalization rate in people> 64 years of age and those presenting comorbidities in seasons with circulating influenza B virus belonging to a lineage discordant with the strain included in the TIV and the decrease of VE to prevent ICU admissions evidence the vital need to administer the quadrivalent influenza vaccine regardless of the findings of predominant circulation in the previous season.

TI  - Improving the remote estimation of soil organic carbon in complex ecosystems with Sentinel-2 and GIS using Gaussian processes regression
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims The quantitative retrieval of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, particularly for soils with a large potential for carbon sequestration, is of global interest due to its link with the carbon cycle and the mitigation of climate change. However, complex ecosystems with good soil qualities for SOC storage are poorly studied. Methods The interrelation between SOC and various vegetation remote sensing drivers is understood to demonstrate the link between the carbon stored in the vegetation layer and SOC of the top soil layers. Based on the mapping of SOC in two horizons (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) we predict SOC with high accuracy in the complex and mountainous heterogeneous paramo system in Ecuador. A large SOC database (in weight % and in Mg/ha) of 493 and 494 SOC sampling data points from 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm soil profiles, respectively, were used to calibrate GPR models using Sentinel-2 and GIS predictors (i.e., Temperature, Elevation, Soil Taxonomy, Geological Unit, Slope Length and Steepness (LS Factor), Orientation and Precipitation). Results In the 0-30 cm soil profile, the models achieved a R-2 of 0.85 (SOC%) and a R-2 of 0.79 (SOC Mg/ha). In the 30-60 cm soil profile, models achieved a R-2 of 0.86 (SOC%), and a R-2 of 0.79 (SOC Mg/ha). Conclusions The used Sentinel-2 variables (FVC, CWC, LCC/C-ab, band 5 (705 nm) and SeLI index) were able to improve the estimation accuracy between 3-21% compared to previous results of the same study area. CWC emerged as the most relevant biophysical variable for SOC prediction.

TI  - Estimation of canopy nitrogen content in winter wheat from Sentinel-2 images for operational agricultural monitoring
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy nitrogen content (CNC, kg/ha) provides crucial information for site-specific crop fertilization and the usability of Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data for CNC monitoring at high fertilization levels in managed agricultural fields is still underexplored. Winter wheat samples were collected in France and Belgium in 2017 (n = 126) and 2018 (n = 18), analysed for CNC and S2-spectra were extracted at the sample locations. A comparison of three established remote sensing methods to retrieve CNC was carried out: (1) look-up-table (LUT) inversion of the canopy reflectance model PROSAIL, (2) Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) and (3) nitrogen-sensitive vegetation indices (VI). The spatial and temporal model transferability to new data was rigorously assessed. The PROSAIL-LUT approach predicted CNC with a root mean squared error of 33.9 kg/ha on the 2017 dataset and a slightly larger value of 36.8 kg/ha on the 2018 dataset. Contrary, PLSR showed an error of 27.9 kg N/ha (R2 = 0.52) in the calibration dataset (2017) but a substantially larger error of 38.4 kg N/ha on the independent dataset (2018). VIs revealed calibration errors were slightly larger than the PLSR results but showed much higher validation errors for the independent dataset (> 50 kg/ha). The PROSAIL inversion was more stable and robust than the PLSR and VI methods when applied to new data. The obtained CNC maps may support farmers in adapting their fertilization management according to the actual crop nitrogen status.

TI  - The new era of regional coastal bathymetry from space: A showcase for West Africa using optical Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale coastal bathymetry is paramount to understand natural and human-induced coastal behaviour and plays a vital role in coastal research and governance. Here, we use a recently developed algorithm, S2Shores (Satellite to Shores), to invert coastal bathymetry from wave kinematics, based on the linear dispersion relation. Wave numbers and celerity are extracted from optical Sentinel-2 imagery, by exploiting the small temporal offset between the image bands of its Multi-Spectral Instrument. Inverted depths are output at 200 m resolution, and individual depth points are merged to create a composite bathymetry using a weighted average of images from 10 different dates. The resulting bathymetry mosaic spans 4000 km along the West African coast. S2Shores is able to detect depths up to 35 m, depending on mean incident wave conditions and cloud cover, which varies by location. Underwater features are well reproduced by S2Shores, such as flow channels in Guinea, the St. Ann's Shoal in Sierra Leone, and ebb delta lobes at several outlets along the Niger River Delta. S2Shores results match well (r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 4.9 m) with a bathymetry survey along the Senegalese coast. As a difference with traditional satellite-derived bathymetry methods based on water colour, a wave-based approach allows estimations in turbid areas and relatively deep waters, which suggest that the two approaches are complementary and should be used in combination to cover coastal environments in their diversity. The new possibility offered by this regional coastal atlas opens the door to increased research and planning capabilities and sets an example that can be applied to the rest of the world.

TI  - Plastic waste cleanup priorities to reduce marine pollution: A spatiotemporal analysis for Accra and Lagos with satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic waste, with an estimated lifetime of centuries, accounts for the major share of marine litter. Each year, thousands of fish, sea birds, sea turtles, and other marine species are killed by ingesting or becoming entangled with plastic debris. Reducing marine plastic pollution is particularly challenging for developing countries owing to the wide dispersal of plastic waste disposal and scarce public cleanup resources. To costeffectively reduce marine pollution, resources should target "hotspot" areas, where large volumes of plastic litter have a high likelihood of ending up in the ocean.Using new public information, this study develops a hotspot targeting strategy for Accra and Lagos, which are major sources of marine plastic pollution in West Africa. The same global information sources can support hotspot analyses for many other coastal cities that generate marine plastic waste. The methodology combines georeferenced household survey data on plastic use, measures of seasonal variation in marine plastic pollution from satellite imagery, and a model of plastic waste transport to the ocean that uses information on topography, seasonal rainfall, drainage to rivers, and river transport to the ocean. For cleanup, the results for West Africa assign the highest locational priority to areas with heavy plastic-waste disposal along river channels or in steeply sloped locations with high rainfall runoff potential near rivers. They assign the highest temporal priority to just before the onset of the first-semester rainy season, when runoff from the first rains transports large volumes of plastic waste that have accumulated during the dry season.

TI  - Comparison of UAV and SAR performance for Crop type classification using machine learning algorithms: a case study of humid forest ecology experimental research site of West Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Food insecurity is one of the major challenges facing African countries; therefore, timely and accurate information on agricultural production is essential to feed the growing population on the continent. A synergistic approach comprising a high-resolution multispectral UAV optical dataset and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can help understand spectral features of target objects, especially with crop type identification. We conducted this work on the experimental plots using high spatial resolution multispectral UAV data (12 cm, re-sampled to 50 cm) in combination with the Sentinel 1C Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset. We generated 11 agronomically relevent vegetation indices from the UAV multispectral image. Multiple combinations of the UAV datasets were analysed to assess the impact of canopy height model (CHM) on classification accuracy and to determine the optimum dataset (including spatial resolution) for the land cover classification. We also appraise the impact of variable spatial resolution on classification accuracy. A combination of VH and VV polarizations of Sentinel-1 SAR data was also analysed to classify the crop types while comparing its accuracy with the UAV-derived models. Our results show that model accuracy is improved- for all the data combination pairs, when CHM is added to the modelling. We also observed a decreasing trend in classification accuracy with respect to increasing spatial resolution. Generally, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier produced an overall accuracy of 94.78% and 81.72% for UAV and SAR datasets, respectively. In comparison, the random forest (RF) achieved an accuracy of 93.84% and 92.58%, for UAV and SAR datasets, respectively. The outputs from ground-based validation corroborate the results from model-based classification coupled with acceptable simple models' agreement ratio (SMAR), exceeding 90% in some cases. The combined techniques can be useful in precision agriculture over small and large agricultural fields to support food security assessment and planning.

A1  - Chlamydia Trachomatis Lab Sentinel
TI  - Prevalence of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> in the general population in Germany - a triangulation of data from two population-based health surveys and a laboratory sentinel system
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) is a common, frequently asymptomatic, sexually transmitted infection. It can result in severe sequelae, such as ectopic pregnancy and infertility. In Germany, chlamydia is not notifiable. An opportunistic screening program for women < 25 years was introduced in 2008. The aim of this research was to triangulate different data sources to describe the epidemiological situation of chlamydia in Germany and to investigate whether the current target group of the chlamydia screening program aligns with these findings. Methods Urine specimens from participants from population-based health examination surveys of children (2014-17) and adults (2008-11) were tested for chlamydia, using nucleic acid amplification testing. These data were used to generate weighted chlamydia prevalence estimates by age group and sex. Data from a nationwide chlamydia laboratory sentinel system (2014-16) were used to calculate the positive proportion among individuals tested for chlamydia by age, sex and test reason. Results Using data from the population-based surveys, we found a chlamydia prevalence estimate of 2.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-7.5%) among all 15- to 17-year-old girls and of 9.6% (95% CI 0.0-23) among those reporting to be sexually active. In adult women, we found the highest prevalence among 18- to 24-year-olds (all: 2.3%; 95% CI 1.0-5.3%; sexually active: 3.1%; 95% CI 1.3-7.0%). In adult men, we found the highest prevalence among 25- to 29-year-olds (all: 3.5%; 95% CI 1.6-7.7%; sexually active: 3.3%; 95% CI 1.3-7.8%). Data from the chlamydia laboratory sentinel showed the highest positive proportion among those opportunistically screened in 19-year-old women (6.1%; 95%- CI 5.9-6.4%), among those screened due to pregnancy in 15-year-old girls (10%; 95% CI 8.5-12%), and among those tested due to symptoms or a positive partner in 19-year-old women (10%; 95% CI 9.8-11%) and 19-year-old men (24%; 95% CI 22-26%). Conclusions Chlamydia seems to mainly affect adolescents and young adults in Germany, with similar overall prevalence in men and women, but with slightly different age distributions. Women at highest risk of chlamydia are covered by the current screening program but given the on-going discussions in high-income countries on cost-effectiveness and benefit-to-harm ratio of these programs, the program-aim needs reconsideration.

TI  - <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> O10:K4: An Emergent Serotype with Pandemic Virulence Traits as Predominant Clone Detected by Whole-Genome Sequence Analysis - Beijing Municipality, China, 2021
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) is a common foodborne pathogen which causes gastroenteritis in humans, especially the O3:K6 pandemic clone which is still a prominent serotype in Beijing, China. In this study, we observed a novel serotype O10:K4 isolated from clinical diarrhea cases, which became the most prevalent clone in 2021.Methods: 73 clinical isolates were collected through sentinel hospitals' surveillance in 2021. Serum agglutination testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were conducted. Whole genome sequencing was applied to characterize 73 V. parahaemolyticus strains and complete phylogenetic analysis.Results: Seven serotypes were identified among 73 strains. O10:K4 was the most common serotype (83.6%), followed by O2:KUT, O4:KUT, and O1:KUT. Multilocus sequence typing divided the 73 isolates into 10 sequence types (STs) with ST3 as the most prevalent, which covered all O10:K4 strains. Most isolates were sensitive to common antimicrobial agents apart from colistin. All the O10:K4 isolates were positive for the thermostable direct hemolysin gene, toxRS/new, and orf8, and negative for the TDH-related hemolysin gene. The whole genome sequencing-single nucleotide polymorphism phylogenetic analysis revealed O10:K4 strains formed a main genetic lineage, which was genetically distinct from other serotypes. We also demonstrated the presence of two type III secretion system genes (T3SS1 and T3SS2) and beta lactamase resistance gene blaCARB-22 in all O10:K4 strains.Conclusions: The study confirmed the emergence of V. parahaemolyticus O10:K4 possessing virulence factors similar to the O3:K6 pandemic clone, which may have enabled them to become prevalent in Beijing, China.

AB  - Integrating the special electromagnetic characteristics of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in deep neural networks is essential in order to enhance the explainability and physics awareness of deep learning. In this paper, we first propose a novel physically explainable convolutional neural network for SAR image classification, namely physics guided and injected learning (PGIL). It comprises three parts: (1) explainable models (XM) to provide prior physics knowledge, (2) physics guided network (PGN) to encode the knowledge into physics-aware features, and (3) physics injected network (PIN) to adaptively introduce the physics-aware features into classification pipeline for label prediction. A hybrid Image-Physics SAR dataset format is proposed for evaluation, with both Sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 SAR data being experimented. The results show that the proposed PGIL substantially improve the classification performance in case of limited labeled data compared with the counterpart data driven CNN and other pre-training methods. Additionally, the physics explanations are discussed to indicate the interpretability and the physical consistency preserved in the predictions. We deem the proposed method would promote the development of physically explainable deep learning in SAR image interpretation field.

TI  - Uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among people who inject drugs
T2  - HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background People who inject drugs (PWID) may be at elevated risk of adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake among PWID are scarce. This study aimed to determine COVID-19 vaccine uptake among PWID, identify factors associated with sub-optimal uptake, and compare uptake to the general population. Methods The Australian Needle Syringe Program Survey is an annual sentinel surveillance project, comprising a self-completed questionnaire and provision of a dried blood sample for HIV and HCV testing. In 2021, respondents provided information on their COVID-19 vaccination status. Multivariate logistic regression models identified correlates of vaccine uptake. Results Among 1166 respondents, 49% had been vaccinated and in most states and territories, vaccine uptake was significantly lower than among the general population. Independent predictors of vaccine uptake were longer duration of vaccine eligibility (AOR 3.42, 95% CI 2.65, 4.41); prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing (AOR 2.90, 95% CI 2.22, 3.79); injection of opioids (AOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.20, 3.05); and current opioid agonist therapy (AOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.23, 2.33). Women (AOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54, 0.92) and those who reported daily or more frequent injection (AOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57, 1.00) were significantly less likely to be vaccinated. Conclusions In most Australian states and territories, uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among PWID lagged uptake among the general population. Increased efforts are required to ensure PWID have equitable access to vaccination. Vaccination programmes within harm reduction services and via outreach, coupled with increased support for peers to act as vaccine champions, are likely to reduce barriers and improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake in this population.

TI  - Monitoring the spatial dispersion of an oil slick by enhancing and noise-filtering SAR images using SENTINEL-1 satellite repeat-pass observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a method for monitoring the spatial dispersion of an oil slick and the temporal changes it experiences by enhancing and noise-filtering synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude images. When accidental oil spills occur, spatial dispersion of the initial oil cover and assessing the temporal changes that affect it are important factors for recovery operations. Herein, the method proposed aims to facilitate a better understanding of the potential oil spread and oil-float flow from the source of the spill to adjacent coastal zones. Space-borne wide-swath SAR data is used in this regard, as it covers relatively large areas compared with other ground-based remote-sensing techniques and offer day and night observation under all weather conditions in coastal zones. The backscattered radar signal from a VV polarimetric channel, which showed a higher sensitivity for changes in the sea-surface roughness, was used. Heterogeneous surface-scattering phenomena were observed, and the amplitude image was a prominent factor in the formation of a Bragg surface around the seashore, which facilitated a better understanding of the spatial dispersion of a spilt oil layer and its temporal changes. The proposed method was applied to an oil-slick spread that happened after an oil tanker ran aground on a coral reef near Blue Bay Marine Park, south-east of the Mauritius Island, in July 2020. The method for deriving the separability between the oil and the non-oil sea surface was to render per-pixel classifiers more efficient for both speckle smoothing and texture preservation in satellite images. Furthermore, sea wind speed and direction, derived from SAR amplitude images, were used to assess the limitations and reliability of the proposed method. Based on the results, the proposed method indicated a substantial impact for facilitating a better understanding of the spatial dispersion of oil slicks and the temporal changes that affect them.

TI  - High-resolution global water body datasets underestimate the extent of small rivers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several 30-m high-resolution global water body datasets have been developed in recent years and raised prospects for studying small (<300 m wide) rivers. River mapping accuracy is a key factor in determining the applicability and usefulness of a certain water body dataset, and accuracy assessment commonly requires numerous water validation points. However, in practice, the number of water validation points is limited, and their spatial distribution is not sufficiently representative (most points are located in lakes, coastal areas, or large rivers). As a result, although current water body datasets perform well to represent global surface water distribution, their ability to map small rivers remains poorly quantified. In this study, we propose that stable and comprehensive river centerlines derived from the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) dataset can be used to generate sufficient and representative validation points, and to estimate the river mapping producer's accuracies. Six 30-m high-resolution, state-of-the-art global water body datasets were evaluated, including four global water body datasets (G1WBM, GIW, GSW, and GSWD) and two land-cover datasets (GlobeLand30 and FROM-GLC). The results show that the small river mapping producer's accuracies (0.51-0.94) estimated for these datasets were considerably lower than their surface water producers' accuracy (0.86-0.99). The estimated river mapping producer's accuracies increase with river width, suggesting that these datasets perform better in mapping large rivers than small rivers. When river width increases from 90 m to 300 m (and above), the average river mapping producer's accuracy of the six water body datasets increases from 0.79 +/- 0.12 to 0.94 +/- 0.03. Our analysis urges caution when using current global water datasets to study rivers, particularly small rivers narrower than 300 m.

TI  - Water quality monitoring using remote sensing, lower manyame Sub-catchment, Zimbabwe
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Manyame Sub-catchment (LMS) is one of the most heavily polluted in Zimbabwe. Its waters are valuable for irrigation, domestic and industrial purposes. LMS has serious eutrophication problems emanating from human activities within it, and lakes Manyame and Chivero upstream. Data collected from October 2018 to April 2019 were used to test an integrated methodology based on field measurements and remote sensing. This study illustrates the production of multitemporal spatialised maps of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) concentrations from satellite data acquired from Sentinel-2. The analysis confirmed the pollution (eutrophic and organic matter) status of LMS water, for the period considered by this research. As a result, careful land planning must be done through the joint operation of local authorities, regional agencies and regional institutions, since Manyame River is a tributary of the Zambezi River (a transboundary river).

TI  - Solar illumination effects on the dry-season variability of spectral and spatial attributes calculated from PlanetScope data over tropical forests of the Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral variability of tropical forests during the Amazonian dry season is not entirely understood because of the divergent responses in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (VIs) measured under-increased water deficit and high insolation. Here, we used a dataset composed of 493 cloud-free PlanetScope (PS) images to investigate possible effects of solar illumination on the dry-season variability of spectral and spatial attributes. The attributes were calculated from June to September over dense tropical forests of the Amazon. The dry-season images were obtained at nadir viewing between 2017 and 2019 over 12 selected sites representing different climatic and environmental conditions. To detect dry-season patterns of vegetation brightness with changes in the geometry of image acquisition, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) over the PS surface reflectance. We plotted the average surface reflectance (2017-2019) for each of the four PS bands and inspected the variability of two VIs with distinct levels of anisotropy to bidirectional effects: the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also investigated the signal of textural metrics from Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) obtained from the near-infrared (NIR) band of PS. Finally, we generated shade fractions from Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), correlated the spectral and spatial attributes of vegetation with solar angles, and observed the dry-season variability in reflectance and VIs over pseudo-invariant soil surfaces. The results showed the existence of solar illumination effects on PS image acquisition during the dry season of the Amazon, which affected differently the NDVI and EVI. From the beginning (June) to the end (September) of the dry season, the solar zenith angle (SZA) decreased and the solar azimuth angle (SAA) increased during the period of acquisition of the PS images. The amplitude of SZA between June and September increased towards south of the Amazon, while the amplitude of SAA increased towards north of this region. Changes in vegetation brightness from June to September were captured by PCA over some sites. Because of the overall increase in both red and NIR band reflectance, solar illumination effects were compensated during the NDVI calculation. In contrast, because the EVI is largely driven by changes in NIR reflectance, these effects contributed to increase the EVI signal at the end of the dry season. For most sites, GLCM texture mean increased towards the end of the dry season, while texture variance decreased in the opposite direction. Shade fractions decreased towards September when reduced amounts of canopy shadows were sensed by PS. EVI was more anisotropic than NDVI and presented higher negative correlations with SZA and shade fractions and higher positive correlations with SAA and texture mean. The dry-season increase in EVI with solar illumination effects was also observed over pseudo-invariant soil surfaces. From this unprecedent scale of observations at high spatial and temporal resolutions, we recommend caution when using anisotropic VIs for large-scale phenological studies over the Amazon because biophysical and non-biophysical signals may be coupled together.

TI  - Estimating thin ice thickness around Svalbard using MODIS satellite imagery
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the state of the Arctic sea ice is becoming increasingly important. This paper describes an approach for automatic retrieval of daily thin sea ice thickness maps around Svalbard. The algorithm uses thermal satellite imagery from MODIS to estimate the surface temperature of the ice and further uses a thermal model of the ice surface to estimate the thickness of the sea ice. The approach is usable for thin sea ice, up to ca. 50 cm thick, during cold weather (freezing) conditions and without cloud cover present. The algorithm is compared with helicopter-borne electromagnetic ice thickness measurements. The comparison yields increasing root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for thicker ice. The lowest RMSD found is 8.7 cm for ice thickness in the range 10 cm < h(i) <= 20 cm. The highest RMSD found is 25.2 cm for ice thickness in the range 30 cm < h(i) <= 40 cm. The bias shows no such trend, and the overall bias is found to be -5.5 cm. The results show that this is a promising approach, allowing monitoring of thin sea ice thickness at relatively higher spatial resolution.

TI  - Surgical Management of Melanoma: Advances and Updates
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review To review and update surgeons about the evolving complexities in the surgical management of melanoma including lymph node staging and treatment.Recent Findings Primary resection with adequate margins continues to be the standard of care for localized cutaneous melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is confirmed to be a powerful tool due to its prognostic value and informative guidance for adjuvant treatments and surveillance. Due to the lack of benefit in melanoma-specific survival and distant metastasis-free survival, completion lymph node dissection is not performed routinely after a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. Neoadjuvant systemic treatment approaches for advanced loco-regional disease show promise in phase I and II clinical trial data, and phase III studies.Summary The surgical management of cutaneous melanoma continues to evolve with further de-escalation of the extent of excision of primary melanomas and the management of lymph node disease.

TI  - The role of sentinel node tumor burden in modeling the prognosis of melanoma patients with positive sentinel node biopsy: an Italian melanoma intergroup study (<i>N</i>=2,086)
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The management of melanoma patients with metastatic melanoma in the sentinel nodes (SN) is evolving based on the results of trials questioning the impact of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and demonstrating the efficacy of new adjuvant treatments. In this landscape, new prognostic tools for fine risk stratification are eagerly sought to optimize the therapeutic path of these patients. Methods A retrospective cohort of 2,086 patients treated with CLND after a positive SN biopsy in thirteen Italian Melanoma Centers was reviewed. Overall survival (OS) was the outcome of interest; included independent variables were the following: age, gender, primary melanoma site, Breslow thickness, ulceration, sentinel node tumor burden (SNTB), number of positive SN, non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSN) status. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results The 3-year, 5-year and 10-year OS rates were 79%, 70% and 54%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all variables, except for primary melanoma body site, were found to be statistically significant prognostic factors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that older age (P < 0.0001), male gender (P = 0.04), increasing Breslow thickness (P < 0.0001), presence of ulceration (P = 0.004), SNTB size (P < 0.0001) and metastatic NSN (P < 0.0001) were independent negative predictors of OS. Conclusion The above results were utilized to build a nomogram in order to ease the practical implementation of our prognostic model, which might improve treatment personalization.

TI  - Oil spill detection based on texture analysis: how does feature importance matter in classification?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill mapping and detection represent a relevant issue from an environmental point of view, given the effects on marine ecosystems. This study presents a new feature space assessment protocol for oil spill mapping using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). First, we selected five free Sentinel-1A sensor images from the GEE catalogue. Next, we processed the features evaluated from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) spectral and texture data. A recursive protocol that comprises a sequential classification of the evaluated image was also applied, wherein each iteration, the feature with less importance, was removed based on the Gini index. We used the Random Forest algorithm for image classification. Each image was trained on 10,000 points and evaluated for accuracy, with an equal number of points collected independently. Our results showed that the Sum Average (Savg), Convolution Smooth (Smooth), Cluster Shade Shade, and Gray level Correlation (Corr) features were essential to identify oil spills and increase the accuracy values. The best classification results based on the features removal experiment and global accuracy were Angola (0.9960), Trinidad and Tobago (0.9829), Italy (0.9506), Kuwait (0.9547), and Dubai (0.9344). Furthermore, it revealed that the protocol created was essential for better understanding the parameter space to detect oil spills with SAR images.

TI  - A Novel Computed Tomographic Angiography Tortuosity Index to Predict Successful Sentinel Cerebral Embolic Protection Delivery for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
T2  - STRUCTURAL HEART-THE JOURNAL OF THE HEART TEAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Percutaneous transradial placement of the Sentinel cerebral embolic protection device (CEPD) (Boston Scientific) is indicated during transcatheter aortic valve replacement to capture embolic material in patients without excessive tortuosity of the right subclavian/innominate arteries. We aimed to generate a quantitative tortuosity index (TI) from the preoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) as an objective measure of tortuosity to determine suitability for CEPD placement.Methods: Eighty-one patients considered for CEPD were included in this study. A centerline of the right subclavian/innominate arteries was generated from preoperative CTA scans. Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of landmarks along the centerline were used to calculate curvature. Tortuosity was derived as a change in angulation along each vessel segment. Peak and average TI values were calculated.Results: Sixty-seven patients had CEPD placement attempted. Unsuccessful CEPD placement occurred in 3 of 67 (4.4%) patients. The peak tortuosity for the successful, unsuccessful, and visually tortuous (not attempted) cohorts were 49.66 + 11.96 degrees/cm, 113.92 + 5.70 degrees/cm, and 70.44 + 17.01 degrees/cm, respectively. The peak and average TI of the successful cohort follows a normal distribution. A proposed TI cutoff for safe CEPD was peak tortuosity of 74 degrees/cm and average tortuosity of 30 degrees/cm, 2 standard deviations above the peak and average TI of the successful cohort. All unsuccessful CEPD patients fell outside the boundaries. Half of the visually tortuous patients were within the boundaries but did not have CEPD attempted.Conclusions: A novel TI based on preoperative CTA can assist in selecting patients for transradial CEPD. Our proposed quantitative tool may help to appropriately include and exclude patients for CEPD placement.

TI  - Incorporation of a Sentinel Lymph-Node Mapping Algorithm in Patients with Clinical Stage-I Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) is now as alternative to pelvic and para-aortic lymph-node dissection (PPALND) for managing endometrial cancers. These data have been largely published from high-volume specialized institutions, but complete PPALND is still performed by many surgeons at smaller nonspecialized centers. The aim of this research was to demonstrate that SLNB is feasible, reproducible, and sensitive without affecting cancer-specific outcomes when implemented at nonspecialized centers.Materials and Methods: Cases of patients with clinical stage-I endometrial cancer were retrospectively reviewed from September 2016 through February 2020. Endometrioid, uterine papillary serous (UPSC), malignant mixed-mesodermal tumor (MMMT), and clear-cell (CC) histologies were included. All patients had undergone either robot-assisted or laparoscopic hysterectomies with SLNB. Indocyanine green was injected into the cervix bilaterally. Per the algorithm, patients with suboptimal lymph-node mapping or nodes suspicious for metastasis underwent a side-specific pelvic lymph-node dissection (LND). Para-aortic LND was performed at the discretion of the surgeon. In addition to SLNB, PPALND was performed for patients with MMMT, UPSC, or CC. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were evaluated using ultrastaging protocols with serial sectioning and cytokeratin staining. The medical records were queried for clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrences.Results: A total of 92 cases were included: 69 stage IA; 12 stage IB; 3 stage II; and 8 stage III (2 IIIA, 2 IIIC1, 4 IIIC2). The majority of cancers were endometrioid (73%), followed by UPSC (15.0%), MMMT (5.0%), and CC (4%). At least 1 SLN was detected in 95.4% of cases. The rate of bilateral SLN detection was 74.3% and improved over time from 2017 to 2019: 70% (2017); 74.4% (2018); and 80% (2019). Twenty patients underwent PPALND. Non-SLNs were positive in 3 patients, all with high-risk histologies. No other patients had false-negative SLNs. No recurrences occurred in this cohort with a median follow-up of 22 months.Conclusions: SLNB is a sensitive and specific method for assessing lymph-node involvement in patients with clinical stage-I endometrial cancers. These results are comparable to the rates reported in the literature and shows that, in nonspecialized centers, this approach is safe and reproducible without affecting cancer-specific outcomes.

TI  - Mapping tree species in natural and planted forests using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote-sensing technology to accurately map the composition and distribution of tree species is vital for sustainable forest resource management. Sentinel-2 data with the dense time-series observations enable to identify tree species. However, few studies clarify the differences in classification using Sentinel-2 images in natural forest and planted forest. Two study areas with different forest environments (planted forest and natural forest) were selected to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery. Our results show that red-edge band, short-wave infrared (SWIR) band and vegetation indices (VIs), such as Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ReNDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), have important effects on tree species classification, especially in the growing season. By using two machine learning algorithms (support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]), the results show that the classification accuracy for planted forests (91.27% in SVM and 88.35% in RF) significantly exceeds that of natural forests (84.34% in SVM and 81.03% in RF). This accuracy difference may be related to the spatial heterogeneity inside the forest and the surrounding environmental implications. Although the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images produce satisfactory accuracy for classifying tree species, further research is needed to improve the classification accuracy.

TI  - A deep learning based oil spill detector using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Mediterranean Sea has been known as an oil pollution hotspot due to its heavy marine traffic and an increasing number of oil and gas exploration activities. To provide automatic detection of oil pollution from not only maritime accidents but also deliberate discharges in this region, a deep learning-based object detector was developed utilizing freely available Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. A total of 9768 oil objects were collected from 5930 Sentinel-1 scenes from 2015 to 2018 and used for training and validating the object detector and evaluating its performance. The trained object detector has an average precision (AP) of 69.10% and 68.69% on the validation and test sets, respectively, and it could be applied for building an early-stage oil contamination surveillance system.

TI  - Source and variability of formaldehyde (HCHO) at northern high latitudes: an integrated satellite, aircraft, and model study
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we use satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column densities (VCD) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), aircraft measurements, combined with a nested regional chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem at 0.5 x 0.625 degrees resolution), to better understand the variability and sources of summertime HCHO in Alaska. We first evaluate GEOS -Chem with in-situ airborne measurements during the Atmospheric Tomography Mission 1 (ATom-1) aircraft campaign. We show reasonable agreement between observed and modeled HCHO, isoprene, monoterpenes and the sum of methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein (MVK+MACR) in the continental boundary layer. In particular, HCHO profiles show spatial homogeneity in Alaska, suggesting a minor contribution of biogenic emissions to HCHO VCD. We further examine the TROPOMI HCHO product in Alaska in summer, reprocessed by GEOS-Chem model output for a priori profiles and shape factors. For years with low wildfire activity (e.g., 2018), we find that HCHO VCDs are largely dominated by background HCHO (58 %-71 %), with minor contributions from wildfires (20 %-32 %) and biogenic VOC emissions (8 %-10 %). For years with intense wildfires (e.g., 2019), summertime HCHO VCD is dominated by wildfire emissions (50 %-72 %), with minor contributions from background (22 %-41 %) and biogenic VOCs (6 %-10 %). In particular, the model indicates a major contribution of wildfires from direct emissions of HCHO, instead of secondary production of HCHO from oxidation of larger VOCs. We find that the column contributed by biogenic VOC is often small and below the TROPOMI detection limit, in part due to the slow HCHO production from isoprene oxidation under low NOx conditions. This work highlights challenges for quantifying HCHO and its precursors in remote pristine regions.

TI  - Assimilating remote sensing-based VPM GPP into the WOFOST model for improving regional winter wheat yield estimation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth models are powerful tools for predicting crop growth and yield. Gross primary production (GPP) is a major photosynthetic flux that is directly linked to crop grain yield. To better understand the potential of GPP for regional crop yield estimation, in this study, a novel crop data-model assimilation (CDMA) framework was proposed that assimilates accumulative GPP estimates from the satellite-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm to estimate winter wheat GPP and grain yield. Results showed that the WOFOST simulated GPP agreed with the GPPEC derived from eddy flux tower (R2 = 0.74 and 0.47 in 2015 and 2016, respectively). Assimilating GPPVPM into the WOFOST model improved site-scale GPP estimation (R-2 = 0.87 and 0.67 in 2015 and 2016, respectively), and also improved regional-scale winter wheat yield estimates (R-2 = 0.36 and 0.29; RMSE= 479 and 572 kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively) compared with the open loop simulations (R-2 = 0.14 and 0.10; RMSE= 801 and 788 kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively). Our study demonstrated that assimilation of remotely sensed GPP optimized the results of carbon simulation in the WOFOST model and highlighted the potential of GPP for regional winter wheat yield estimation using a data assimilation framework.

TI  - An ecological assessment process based on integrated remote sensing model: A case from Kaikukang-Walagan District, Greater Khingan Range, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the impacts of global climate change, rapid economic development, and anthropogenic activities on the environment are intensifying, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we need to understand ecological conditions and their responses to climate change and human disturbances. The objective of this study was to present an ecological assessment of the Kaikukang-Walagan District using the remotely sensed ecological index (RSEI) and the newly introduced integrated ecological environment index (IEEI). This assessment will reveal the ecological responses to disturbances, and place-specific emphasis on ecological conservation. Various data such as Landsat images, advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM), moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) water vapor products, meteorological records, soil thickness, and soil N content data were collected and sampled. First, land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), brightness, and wetness were obtained. Second, the RSEI was determined using LST, NDVI, brightness, and wetness via principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, IEEI was derived from the band operation between the standardized RSEI (RSEIS) and slope, soil thickness, and soil N content data. The results show that the mean RSEIS for 2000, 2002, 2007, 2011, and 2017 ranged from 0.26 to 0.48, and the coefficient of variation was 0.22. The number of areas with very good or excellent ecological conditions increased between 2000 and 2002, then fluctuated between 2002 and 2011, and reached a peak in 2017. The influence of climate change in the study area was not evident. The standardized IEEI (IEEIS) revealed that most of the study areas possessed excellent or very good ecological conditions; areas with good or fair ecological conditions were primarily located and bare land surrounded by vegetation, and areas with poor ecological conditions were primarily distributed in the urban areas of Walagan and Xiufeng. It was also shown that the IEEI is suitable for a comprehensive ecological assessment incorporating multiple ecological factors.

TI  - Trends in sulfur dioxide over the Indian subcontinent during 2003-2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and its oxidation products profoundly impact the air quality and climate. In recent decades, contrasting SO2 trends have been observed over different regions of the globe due to urbanization, energy generation and control measures. In this study, we have investigated the SO2 trends over the rapidly developing Indian subcontinent using model reanalysis, satellite data, and emission inventories during 2003-2019 period. Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis shows rapid SO2 growth up to 0.4 ppbv yr(-1) during 2003-2009, particularly significant over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and eastern India. However, the growth becomes slower after 2010 and is followed by a stabilization or slight reduction. The CAMS results agree with the satellite-based observations, however, the model underestimates enhancements over eastern India. The analysis of inventory datasets also suggests slower growths in SO2 emissions and coal-fired electricity generation in recent years. Besides the changes in regional emissions, the enhancements in water vapor and OH radical coinciding with SO2 stabilization indicate strengthening of the sink processes. Model simulation (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2-MERRA-2) with constant emissions shows reduction in SO2 which confirms the stronger chemical losses. Overall, the SO2 trends over the Indian subcontinent are found to be a manifestation of the combined effects of the regional emission change and chemistry. Our findings highlight the need for studies to assess the impacts of changing SO2 trends in India on the regional and global climate.

TI  - Paths to research-driven decision making in the realms of environment and water
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Now more than ever it is critical for researchers and decision makers to work together to improve how we manage and preserve the planet's natural resources. Water managers in the western U.S., as in many regions of the world, are facing unprecedented challenges including increasing water demands and diminishing or unpredictable supplies. The transfer of knowledge (KT) and technology (TT) between researchers and entities that manage natural resources can help address these issues. However, numerous barriers impede the advancement of such transfer, particularly between organizations that do not operate in a profit-oriented context and for which best practices for university-industry collaborative engagement may not be sufficient. Frameworks designed around environmental KT - such as the recently-developed Research-Integration-Utilization (RIU) model - can be leveraged to address these barriers. Here, we examine two examples in which NASA Earth science satellite data and remote-sensing technology are used to improve the management of water availability and quality. Despite differences in scope and outcomes, both of these case studies adopt KT and TT best practices and can be further understood through the lens of the RIU model. We show how these insights could be adopted by NASA through a conceptual framework that charts individual- and organizational-level integration milestones alongside technical milestones. Environmental organizations can learn from this approach and adapt it to fit their own institutional needs, integrating KT/TT models and best practices while recognizing and leveraging existing institutional logics that suit their organization's unique history, technical capability and priorities.

TI  - Effectiveness of the integration of data balancing techniques and tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithms for spatially-explicit land cover accuracy prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of remote sensing images has become a common practice in providing land use/ land cover (LULC) maps. Among the main elements of a successful LC mapping task, accuracy assessment significantly influences the quality of decisions taken by the end users and prevents potential misinterpretations. The use of conventional accuracy assessment approaches often overlooks the spatial variation of LC accuracy. In this manner, per-pixel land cover accuracy (PLCA) mapping which provides spatially-explicit accuracy information of classified remote sensing images, emerged as a viable alternative to the traditional accuracy assessment approaches. This study comprehensively compared three tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithms including random forest (RF), rotation forest (RoF), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) for PLCA mapping. Moreover, considering the efficiency of the LC mapping practices, there are normally more instances linked with correctly classified pixels than incorrectly classified pixels in a given LC map. This condition leads to a serious challenge for PLCA mapping known as the class imbalance problem. Accordingly, this study also examined the feasibility of coupling three data balancing (DB) techniques (random over-sampling (ROS), synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and adaptive synthetic sampling approach for unbalanced learning (ADASYN)) with the selected PLCA mapping algorithms for addressing the class imbalance problem. The experiments were employed on five different Sentinel-2 images with 20 km x 20 km dimensions acquired at different times and parts of Iran. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), geometric mean (GM), and overall accuracy (OA) were used to assess performance of the employed PLCA mapping methods. Among the PLCA mapping methods, RF-SMOTE was ranked first (with an average, AUROC = 0.84, AUPRC = of 0.91, GM = 0.81, and OA = 0.82), and was followed by RF-ADASYN and RoF-SMOTE. The results showed that integration of the SMOTE technique with the RF algorithm was the most successful practice for improving the performance of PLCA mapping and significantly outperformed all the algorithms without integration of DB techniques. As the PLCA maps provide the LULC's accuracy locally, they can be of significant use in refining the LULC mapping practices.

T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the reflection of the ideological and aesthetic struggle and socio-cultural life of Russia at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries in the memoirs of A.N. Benois. The scope of traditional studies of memoirs of the Silver Age figures as sources of cultural achievements of the period has been expanded. The factors that influenced the development of Benois's worldview, his political beliefs, and played a significant role in determining his public stance in relation to certain phenomena of public life has been considered. First, such factors include the patriarchal way of life of the family distinguished by rich cultural traditions, the years of study at Karl May's School where he met his future friends in creative activity, meetings at lectures with Professor N. Korkunov, acquaintance with masterpieces of Russian art.The evolution of the national identity of A. Benois developed from partial neglect through acquaintance with great creative achievements to admiration and glorification of Russian culture, in particular through the organization of the Ballets Russes in Paris. The analysis of the artist's creative activity makes it possible to identify his aesthetic views that predetermined his relationship with the aristocracy of talent and art patrons. The comparative study of Benois's memoirs with the works of professional historians and memoirists shows their objectivity and the author's proper understanding of the socio-political situation in the country.

TI  - Annual paddy rice planting area and cropping intensity datasets and their dynamics in the Asian monsoon region from 2000 to 2020
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Timely information on the spatiotemporal trends in annual paddy rice planting areas (PRA) and cropping intensity (CI) in Asia is important for food security warnings and water use planning. However, longtime series datasets for these are generally unavailable. The spatiotemporal dynamics of annual paddy rice and cropping intensity over the last 20 years have rarely been investigated at the continental scale. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to generate a publicly available database on annual PRA and CI and investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of annual PRA and CI across the Asian monsoon region (AMR) over the last 20 years. METHODS: The annual PRA and cropping CI maps at 500-m resolution across the AMR from 2000 to 2020 were generated by the improved methods based on remote sensing data from multiple sources. Also, the spatiotemporal trends of paddy rice fields and cropping intensity were further analyzed based on Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the resultant annual PRA and CI were correlated with that based on field samples and census data. They were also consistent with the spatial distribution of existing high-resolution products in a specific year and region. The paddy rice planting area increased significantly (p < 0.05) in northeastern China and northwestern India and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in southern China during 2000-2020. Single- and double-cropping were dominant in the AMR. Both double-cropping and triple- cropping increased significantly (p < 0.05) during 2001-2020. Single-cropping was converted to double- cropping in approximately 198.1 x 105 ha of areas, mainly in the North China Plain and northern India. And double-cropping was converted to triple-cropping in approximately 9.5 x 105 ha of areas, mainly in the Mekong Delta in Southeast Asia. However, the cropping intensity in some regions such as southern China declined from 2001 to 2020. SIGNIFICANCE: The results and datasets of this study will be useful for providing fundamental information for designing scientific policies, food security, and climate change, providing key data for yield forecasting, crop model building, and greenhouse gas estimating.

TI  - Using spatiotemporal fusion algorithms to fill in potentially absent satellite images for calculating soil salinity: A feasibility study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, remote sensing technology has unique advantages in monitoring soil salinity information, but it is vulnerable to the quality of imaging, and spatiotemporal fusion algorithms can fill these missing images. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of four commonly used spatiotemporal fusion algorithms for monitoring soil salinity. The applicability of four spatiotemporal fusion techniques for generating fused images based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data was examined. To estimate soil salinity in the oasis intersection zone region of Xinjiang, China, random forest regression models were built using measured soil salinity and multiple fused images. The results show that the spatiotemporal fusion algorithm can generate fused images with good accuracy and the constructed random forest regression model can assess soil salinity well. We conclude that using a spatiotemporal fusion technique to generate fused pictures can solve the missing data problem caused by poor imaging quality, and that the fused images are well suited for monitoring soil parameters sensitive to environmental changes, such as soil salinity. One of the key influencing variables on the accuracy of the developed assessment model is the correctness of the fused images. When dealing with incomplete data, this work can serve as a scientific reference for monitoring soil salinity utilizing remote sensing methods.

TI  - Spectral invariants in ultra-high spatial resolution hyperspectral images
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Current operational optical satellite-based Earth observation methods targeting at vegetation are optimised for the high- and medium-resolution satellites with pixels sizes starting at ten meters. This resolution is coarser than the typical size of a vegetation structural element, such as a tree crown, and much coarser that of scattering elements, such as leaves. For this reason, vegetation can be treated as a continuous medium and the variation in the local illumination conditions on individual leaves or tree crowns can be ignored. This does not hold anymore for very and ultra-high resolution imagery, obtained from new satellite systems or unmanned aerial vehicles, where individual tree crowns or even leaves can be discerned. We tested the applicability of the spectral invariant theory to this type of imagery for characterising the local illumination conditions on plant leaves using Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations. The simulations corroborated the direct link between the spectral invariant parameter rho and the sunlit fraction of visible leaves, earlier alleged for hyperspectral remote sensing data based on mathematical considerations. The approach allowed us to separate the direct beam and multiple scattering irradiance components and provided intuitive interpretations of the recollision probability and canopy scattering coefficient computed for each image pixel.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective and accurate estimation of heavy precipitation from typhoons is critical for the early warning of hydrological extremes and disaster mitigation. Satellite-based precipitation products are widely used for various purposes, including supporting climate, hydrology, and severe weather event monitoring and research activities. In this study, the performance of Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), and Chinese Fengyun-4A quantitative precipitation estimates (FY4A QPE) were compared to daily observations from 2018 to 2019. Further comparison of these products at an hourly scale was implemented for five typhoons that made landfall in the coastal areas of southeastern China. The results demonstrate that IMERG-Early and GSMaP-NRT performed much better than FY4A QPE, in both overall assessment and specific typhoons. All the satellite-based products showed the best correlations with the gauge observations for heavy precipitation events, and their correlations became worse with lower precipitation intensity. They tended to underestimate heavy precipitation but overestimate light precipitation. Furthermore, their random errors increased with increasing precipitation, according to an analysis of unbiased root mean squared error (ubRMSE). Based upon analyses of the probability of detection (POD) and critical success index (CSI), satellite-based products performed better during light precipitation events than moderate and heavy precipitation events. During typhoons, IMERG-Early and GSMaP-NRT had better accuracy in detecting typhoon precipitation with higher POD and CSI values. FY4A QPE showed instability in different typhoons and a low correlation with gauge observations. In addition, satellite-based products produced precipitation estimates more reliably in northern and eastern Zhejiang, but were difficult to detect heavy precipitation centers in some parts of southwestern Zhejiang with complex topography. These findings not only provide valuable references for the development of satellite-based retrieval algorithms to enhance the ability to monitor typhoon heavy precipitation but also support diverse hydrological models and applications.

TI  - Decomposition of long time-series fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation signal for distinguishing heavy metal stress in rice
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Crops are often affected by heavy metal stress and other types of stresses present in farming. Distinguishing heavy metal stress from other types of stresses can be addressed through agricultural remote sensing. Unlike color and morphology, monitoring physiological functions can lead to detect heavy metal contamination even in early stages or at low stress levels by considering characteristics that are not visible to the naked eye. We aimed to distinguish heavy metal stress in rice using physiological function variability that shows spatiotemporal stability based on the multitemporal fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). Zhuzhou City in the Hunan Province of China was selected as the study area, where Sentinel-2 remote sensing images and FAPAR data were collected. Overall, 121 Sentinel-2 remote sensing images during the April-September season from 2018 to 2020 were collected along with FAPAR data in the canopy from 25 rice paddy fields in the same region. First, the FAPAR was calculated using the biophysical processor of the Sentinel Application Platform software, and the time-series FAPAR data were determined using cubic spline interpolation. Second, different intrinsic mode function components of the FAPAR time series were derived by applying the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise at multiple scales. Third, the local spatiotemporal Moran index of the interannual and residual components was calculated. The results show that the FAPAR estimated from Sentinel-2 data suitably correlates with the measured FAPAR and can be used for detecting heavy metal stress in rice. In addition, the adopted decomposition method can successfully extract heavy metal stress signals by eliminating intra-annual and interannual components. Moreover, the local spatiotemporal Moran index of interannual and residual components correctly indicates heavy metal stress, suitably characterizing the temporal stability of spatial aggregation of heavy metal stress in rice. Therefore, combining spatiotemporal features with signal decomposition for describing a physiological function is a promising approach for identifying heavy metal stress from complex stress sources.

TI  - Assessing Grapevine Biophysical Parameters From Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 50 years, many approaches for extracting plant key parameters from remotely sensed data have been developed, especially in the last decade with the spread of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in agriculture. Multispectral sensors are very useful for the elaboration of common vegetation indices (VIs), however, the spectral accuracy and range may not be enough. In this scenario, hyperspectral (HS) technologies are gaining particular attention thanks to the highest spectral resolution, which allows deep characterization of vegetative/soil response. Literature presents few papers encompassing UAV-based HS applications in vineyard, a challenging conditions respect to other crops due to high presence of bare soil, grass cover, shadows and high heterogeneity canopy structure with different leaf inclination. The purpose of this paper is to present the first contribution combining traditional and multivariate HS data elaboration techniques, supported by strong ground truthing of vine ecophysiological, vegetative and productive variables. Firstly the research describes the UAV image acquisition and processing workflow to generate a 50 bands HS orthomosaic of a study vineyard. Subsequently, the spectral data extracted from 60 sample vines were elaborated both investigating the relationship between traditional narrowband VIs and grapevine traits. Then, multivariate calibration models were built using a double approach based on Partial Least Square (PLS) regression and interval-PLS (iPLS), to evaluate the correlation performance between the biophysical parameters and HS imagery using the whole spectral range and a selection of more relevant bands applying a variable selection algorithm, respectively. All techniques (VIs, PLS and iPLS) provided satisfactory correlation performances for the ecophysiological (R-2 = 0.65), productive (R-2 = 0.48), and qualitative (R-2 = 0.63) grape parameters. The novelty of this work is represented by the first assessment of a UAV HS dataset with the expression of the entire vine ecosystem, from the physiological and vegetative state to grapes production and quality, using narrowband VIs and multivariate PLS regressions. A correct non-destructive estimation of key parameters in vineyard, above all physiological parameters which must be measured in a short time as they are extremely influenced by the variability of environmental conditions during the day, represents a powerful tool to support the winegrower in vineyard management.

TI  - Spatial patterns and driving factors of carbon stocks in mangrove forests on Hainan Island, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Mangrove forests are important coastal wetlands for the blue carbon budget and play a significant role in mitigating global climate change. However, spatial patterns of carbon stocks in mangrove forests on an island scale have not been quantified owing to methodological limitations and lack of understanding of controlling factors. We took the entire Hainan Island as a case study and aimed to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the spatial patterns and driving factors of carbon stocks in mangrove forests. Location Southern China. Time period 2017-2020. Major taxa studied Mangrove forest. Methods The upscaling method combined with field surveys and Sentinel-2 imagery analysis were used to compare different models for optimization of mangrove ecosystem carbon stock estimations. We also used structural equation modelling (SEM) to evaluate the factors driving the distributional patterns of mangrove carbon stocks on an island scale. Results The current total mangrove carbon stock of the entire Hainan Island was estimated to be 703,181 Mg C (with a mean density of 192 Mg C/ha), with the above- and below-ground carbon stocks averaging at 44.7 and 147.3 Mg C/ha, respectively. The mangrove carbon storage in the north-eastern region of the island was the highest and in the west region the lowest. Sediment nitrogen content and plant species diversity had the most positive driving effects on the distribution of total carbon stock for Hainan Island mangroves. Main conclusions The combination of field surveys and Sentinel-2 imagery analysis can be applied to regional-scale estimations of carbon stocks for mangrove forests. Spatial pattens of mangrove carbon stocks vary among locations on Hainan Island, and soil nutrient (especially nitrogen) availability is the dominant factor regulating carbon stock variations along the land-to-sea gradient. Our findings have significant implications for better understanding the distribution of mangrove carbon stocks and quantification of the global blue carbon budget.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC), topographic elevation and land surface temperature (LST) in Ilorin, Nigeria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanization of landscapes and the increase in impervious land cover materials is known to cause significant changes in the landscape's thermal properties, typically leading to urban heat island (UHI). Although previous studies have investigated the impacts of land cover land use (LULC) and other factors on the urban land surface temperature (LST), the results of such studies are mixed. For instance, it is not yet clear what factors affect the spatial and temporal variation of the relationship between LULC and the LST, as well as the exact trajectory through which identified factors affect the thermal character of the urban landscape. In the current study, we examined the relationship between LULC, elevation and LST in Ilorin from the period of 2002-2020. The overriding aim was to understand the degree of association between LULC, elevation and LST, and the drivers of the spatial and temporal variation in the observed relationship. LST and NDVI were derived from Landsat data products. LST was derived using a mono window algorithm and NDVI was used as proxy for LULC. The spatial pattern of LULC was analyzed using Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistics. To investigate the relationship between LULC, elevation and LST, we adopted both ordinary least square (OLS) regression models and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to reveal both the linear and the geographically varying relationship between the LULC, elevation and LST. The results of the study show that the LULC pattern of Ilorin has been significantly altered during the 2000 to 2020 period. The urban proportion of the landscape has shown a significant increase, rising by more than 11% relative to 2002 figures, and the vegetation proportion, especially the forest component, has diminished within same temporal extent. LST values varied in both space and time, with high temperature clusters noticeable in the built-up areas and decreasing towards the urban periphery. The result of the autocorrelation analysis using Moran's I index reveals a significant clustering of LST in all the epochs investigated. Across the study area, minimum and maximum LST values of 0 ?? and 41 ? were recorded in 2002 and 2020 respectively. Statistically significant relationships were observed between LULC, elevation and LST. However, the relationship between elevation and LST was very weak. Temporally, the strength of the relationship between the variables (as indicated in the variables' coefficient) as well as the overall model predictive performance (indicated by in the R-2) fluctuated over the years. Spatially, the strength of relationship between LST and LULC and elevation varied significantly. LULC explained approximately between 26% and 64% of total LST variation in the city between 2002 and 2020. The study findings are relevant for efforts geared towards alleviating the degree of UHI or its impacts, generally, and in the city of Ilorin, in particular. An understanding of the spatial distribution of LULC and their impacts on the LST can be helpful in identifying areas needing attention. The observed relationship between relevant LULC classes can be incorporated into urban planning strategies to ensure a sustainable city development.

TI  - Forest leaf litter nutrient discharge patterns in snowmelt surface runoff and watershed scale remote sensed simulation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf litter decomposition is the important chain for the nutrient cycle in forest ecosystem, but its degradation dynamics and pulse discharge patterns in freeze-thawing watershed needed complete understanding. By integrating field observations and MODIS data, the temporal-spatial distributions of snow coverage and forest leaf litter biomass were analyzed. The critical period for snowmelt runoff under warming temperature and the relatively slow degradation patterns were identified. The on-site observations snowmelt runoff showed discharge concentration and fraction dynamics of typical forest leaf litter nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in thawing period. The snowmelt runoff flow and nutrient flux observed the linear regressions with the increased temperature from -8 degrees C to 6 degrees C (r(2) = 0.443-0.987). The concentration of TOC, TN, and TP reached summit value around 50.0, 6.0, and 0.5 mg L-1 in the snowmelt runoff, respectively. The fraction analysis proved that the much high composition of dissolved organic fraction and the biggest organic phosphorus percentage was 94%. The comparison experiments of forest soil with or without leaf litter cover demonstrated that the leaf litter caused a lower discharge load in the snowmelt flow, and the leaf litter cover can decease the potential transport capability of the snowmelt runoff. Coupled with remote sensing data, the watershed leaf litter nutrient discharge model was developed with snowmelt hydrological process mode. The watershed averaged discharge of TOC, TN, and TP from deciduous broad-leaved forest leaf litter was around 851.99, 75.05, and 9.78 mg.m(-2) , respectively. The yearly simulation showed the spatial distribution variance of the nutrient discharge loads were held by different forest types, elevations, and slopes. The critical loss area identification provided new mitigations solution. The findings suggested that seasonal discharge of forest leaf litter nutrient in thawing period acted as a key contributor to watershed water pollution.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of glacial lake volume estimation: A case study in the Poiqu basin, central Himalayas
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake volume is a critical parameter in the prediction of potential flood volume and peak discharge in the risk assessment of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). As existing volume-area scaling relationships often blur the complexity of lake geometry, we presented a new volume-scaling law specific to moraine-dammed lakes, derived from a large lake bathymetry dataset. The relationship was based on the premise that lake geometry parameters (i.e., area, volume, width/length ratio) scale predictably. We then critically evaluated the performance of the new approach and compared it with 19 existing empirical relationships by examining a database of glacial lake bathymetry obtained without repeated measurements. Overall, the new volume-scaling relationship showed a more robust performance than other published formulas. In addition, an intriguing result was that regional differences were not always controlled by the predictability of lake volumes, that is, there were no regional restrictions on the use of the new method, at least not in the Himalayas. Finally, using the new approach and high-resolution Landsat imagery, our results of sequential mapping of all lakes in the Poiqu basin indicated that the total lake volume has increased by 148% from 1974 to 2020. Compared with other formulas, the lake volume estimation approach proposed in this paper provides an approximate mean value, which provides a key input parameter for flood simulation and a new alternative for estimating lake volume.

TI  - Flexible User Mapping for Radio Resource Assignment in Advanced Satellite Payloads
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BROADCASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the flexible assignment of users to beams in order to match the non-uniform traffic demand in satellite systems, breaking the conventional cell boundaries and serving users not necessarily by the corresponding beams yielding more power. The smart beam-user mapping is jointly explored with adjustable bandwidth allocation per beam, and tested against different techniques for payloads with flexible radio resource allocation. Thus, both beam capacity and load are adjusted to cope with the traffic demand. The specific locations of the user terminals play a major role, although their complexity does not increase as part of the proposed scheme. Numerical results are obtained for various non-uniform traffic distributions to evaluate the performance of the solutions. The traffic profile across beams is shaped by the Dirichlet distribution, which can be conveniently parameterized, and makes simulations easily reproducible. Even with ideal conditions for the power allocation, both flexible beam-user mapping and adjustable power allocation similarly enhance the flexible assignment of the bandwidth on average. Results show that a smart pairing of users and beams provides considerable advantages in highly asymmetric demand scenarios, with improvements up to 10% and 30% in terms of the offered and the minimum user rates, respectively, in hot-spot like cases.

TI  - Breslow thickness 2.0: Why gene expression profiling is a step toward better patient selection for sentinel lymph node biopsies
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Risk-stratification of cutaneous melanoma is important. Patients want to know what to expect after diagnosis, and physicians need to decide on a treatment plan. Historically, melanoma that had spread beyond the skin and regional lymph nodes was largely incurable, and the only approach to preventing a bad outcome was surgery. Through the seminal work of Alexander Breslow and Donald Morton, a system was devised to carefully escalate surgery based on primary tumor thickness and sentinel lymph node status. Today, we know that prophylactic lymph node dissections do not improve survival, but we continue to appreciate the prognostic implications of a positive sentinel node and the benefits of removing nodal metastases, which facilitates locoregional disease control. However, the question arises whether we can better select patients for sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) as, currently, 85% of these procedures are negative and non-therapeutic. Here, we argue that gene expression profiling (GEP) of the diagnostic biopsy is a valuable step toward better patient selection when combined with reliable clinicopathologic (CP) information such as patient age and Breslow thickness. Recently, a CP-GEP-based classifier of nodal metastasis risk, the Merlin Assay, has become commercially available. While CP-GEP is still being validated in prospective studies, preliminary data suggest that it is an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, outperforming clinicopathological variables. The hunt is on for Breslow thickness 2.0.

TI  - Using remote sensing to identify liquid manure applications in eastern North Carolina
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient pollution from farm fertilizers and manure is a global concern. Excess nitrogen and phosphorous has been linked to algal blooms and a host of other water quality issues. In the U.S., most animal production occurs in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) housing a significant number of animals in a confined space. CAFOs tend to cluster in space and thus generate large quantities of manures within a small area. Liquid manure from CAFOs is often stored in open-air lagoons and then applied via irrigation to crops on nearby 'sprayfields'. The full scope and extent of CAFO impacts remain unclear because of the paucity of public information regarding animal numbers, barn and lagoon locations, and manure management practices. Where and when manure is applied on the landscape is key missing data that is needed to better understand and mitigate consequences of CAFO management practices. The aim of this study was to detect land applications of liquid manure using a remote sensing approach. We used random forest models incorporating C-Band synthetic-aperture radar, multispectral imagery, and other predictors to examine soil moisture conditions indicating probable liquid manure applications across known sprayfields in eastern North Carolina. Our models successfully distinguished saturated and unsaturated soils within corn, soybean, grassland, and 'other' crops, with 93-98% accuracy against validation for clear weather periods during the dormant, early, and late growing seasons. A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that the mean soil saturation frequency was significantly higher on sprayfields than non-sprayfields of the same crop type (p < 2.2e-16). We also found that manure applications were concentrated within similar to 1 km from the point of generation. This is the first application of satellite-based radar for identifying the location and timing of manure applications over broad areas. Future work can build on these methods to further understand manure management at CAFOs, as well as to improve pollution source tracking and modeling.

TI  - Mapping of crop types in 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019 to assess major land cover trends of the Udon Thani Province, Thailand
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop production and productivity monitoring play a crucial role for food security and livelihoods, international trade and sustainable agricultural practices. Earth Observation (EO) data provides high spectral, spatial and temporal data for various agricultural applications. However, mapping and monitoring small crop fields and complex landscapes are still challenging, in particular when attempting to trace the historical evolution of land use changes. To address this issue, a study was set up in the Udon Thani Province of Thailand, with small agricultural parcels and highly fragmented landscapes, covering an area of approximately 11,000 km2. Three decades of crop type dynamics were monitored and assessed using different combinations of multi-temporal Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat data and the random forest (RF) classifier. The combined multi-temporal EO datasets proved the most efficient for mapping crop types. Classification results achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 87.9%, 88.1%, 84.8% and 92.6% for the four base-years 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. Thanks to the availability of high-quality reference labels, the crop type map of 2019 showed the highest overall and class-specific accuracies. The 2019 classification model separated many crop classes well, especially sugarcane, cassava, rice and para rubber. On the contrary, for 1989, 1999 and 2009 drops in accuracy had to be accepted, as direct field reference observations were unavailable and reference information had to be sourced through photo-interpretation or trimming approaches. Overall, however, the RF method together with multi temporal EO satellite data from multiple platforms showed high potential and excellent efficiency in crop type classification in complex landscapes. The most dominant classes of crop types for the four base-years were rice, sugarcane, and cassava, respectively. Land cover changes indicated that transitions of 1,529 km2 (14%) occurred between 1989 and 1999, mainly as increase in sugarcane and rice areas. From 1999 to 2009, significant land changes were observed covering 2,340 km2 (21%), primarily as increased cassava and para rubber cultivation. During the most recent period 2009 to 2019, an additional 3,414 km2 (31%) were transformed, mainly through the expansion of para rubber and sugarcane plantations. The main drivers for the observed land use changes in the three decades were commodity prices and agricultural policies. The cost-efficiently derived results provide valuable information to inform land use management decisions of policymakers and other stakeholders, including the consideration of environmental aspects.

M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative assessment of the negative environmental effects of mining is vital for the eco-environmental restoration and management of mining areas. However, it remains unclear about the spatial dimension of the influence on the environment that comes from mining. Here, we constructed a new method to quantify the vegetation impact of mining activity using Sentinel-2 time series and Pareto principle, and applied it to the Liaoning Nanfen iron mining area (LNMA), the Inner Mongolia Sanheming iron mining area (IMMA), and the Sichuan Hongge iron mining area (SCMA) in China. Based on the unequal relationship of 80% of the consequences determined by 20% of the causes, the influence of mining activities on vegetation was quantified by the maximum phenological difference, the decay rate, the asymptotic value of exponential trend and the distance from the mine. Results showed that the impact of mining activities on vegetation phenology decayed exponentially along with the increase of the distance to the mines. The influence distance of mining activities on vegetation were 1566.95 m, 1959.67 m, and 1809.61 m for LNMA, IMMA and SCMA, respectively. Compared to areas 5 km away from the mining activity, the start of the growing season for vegetation surrounding the mining activity was delayed by 1.1 +/- 0.4 days, 6.1 +/- 1.9 days, and 1.5 +/- 0.7 days for LNMA, IMMA and SCMA, respectively, while the length of the growing season was successively shortened by 1.0 +/- 0.6 days, 5.4 +/- 2.5 days, and 5.1 +/- 3.9 days, respectively. Our investigation found that the dust pollution, decreases in groundwater levels, and waterborne pollution were the main factors that directly caused phenological changes around the mining area, and the distance and degree of their impact on phenology were closely related to drought and topography. This finding could provide a reference for the environmental restoration and management of mining areas and help to add insights on the assessment for the long-term impacts of mining activities on vegetation.

TI  - Potential Structural Damage Characterization through Remote Sensing Data: A Nondestructive Experimental Case Study
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric corrosion, especially in coastal environments, is a major structural problem affecting metallic structures in various sectors. Structural health monitoring systems based on satellite information can help to ensure the proper behavior of civil structures and are an interesting alternative for remote locations. The aim of this case study is to relate remote sensing information to the results of experimental studies for potential structural damage characterization. The ultimate idea is to characterize any environment without long testing periods or sampling costs. Comparative nondestructive experimental tests involving different locations, sampling techniques, and study periods are performed. The results obtained are analyzed and compared with meteorological satellite data characterization at each site. The experimental test results show sufficient statistical significance (p < 0.05), confirming that the areas potentially most susceptible to corrosion can be identified using information from remote sensing satellites based on orientation, wind conditions, and wind origin. This can be used to facilitate the remote design and monitoring of structures more accurately with a stability guarantee.

TI  - A spatialised information system to support decisions regarding grazing management in mountainous and Mediterranean rangelands
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agro-sylvo-pastoral systems are common around the Mediterranean Basin, where they provide a variety of goods and services to the local populations. Their sustainability relies on efficient grazing management, especially in Mediterranean rangelands. The diversity of pastoral resources, combined with the variety of grazing management techniques and farming objectives, has slowed down the development of digital tools to assist grazing management in these conditions. However, digital technologies could serve agro-sylvo-pastoral farms by improving the efficiency of grazing management and reducing the difficulty of the associated work. In this objective, and to take into account the variety of situations, we suggest developing an information system (IS) based on a variety of (contextualised) complementary data. For southern France, the following data can be combined: Sentinel 2 images, Registre Parcellaire Graphique (RPG), OSO land use and cover, RGE Alti altimetry data, pastoral technical references, herd GPS location and feedback from farmers. However, designing and implementing such an IS requires overcoming methodological and technical limitations concerning the integration of heterogeneous structured and unstructured data and the definition of meaningful ways to combine them to produce relevant insights for decision-making. In this article, we describe an approach to produce a spatialised IS aimed at providing farmers with relevant information to support decisions regarding grazing management in mountainous and Mediterranean rangelands. The IS was codesigned with stakeholders, including farmers, to best match their needs and to facilitate its integration into farm management. The various stakeholders were involved in choosing the types of data to be associated and, defining the functions and the conceptual model of the IS. We propose to structure the IS as a spatial data lake, designed to integrate and associate the identified heterogeneous data, and to produce decision-making insights for grazing management in mountainous and Mediterranean rangelands.

TI  - Stakeholder theory: A process-ontological perspective
T2  - BUSINESS ETHICS THE ENVIRONMENT & RESPONSIBILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advocates of stakeholder theory have long known that grasping its key insights requires a specific worldview that is, unfortunately, still not prevalent within the community of strategic management scholars. We argue that this worldview encompasses a process ontology that is radically different from the substance-ontological outlook typical of the mainstream approaches to strategic management. The unquestioned commitment of strategic management scholarship to a substance ontology leads to the viewing of corporations as macro-entities comprising aggregations of discrete autonomous actors each relying on individual choice and instrumental rationality. In contrast, within a process-ontological worldview, corporations and their stakeholders are seen to be sustained and attenuated through social practices and relationships involving interlocking chains of coping actions taken in everyday interactions. We show that adopting a process-ontological worldview presents a much-needed step that may help strategic management scholars reach a better understanding of how stakeholder theory deals with three problems of today's capitalism, those value creation and trade, ethics of capitalism, and managerial mindsets. On this basis, we discuss how to process ontology may lead stakeholder theory to further refine its understanding of business strategy, corporate social responsibility, and the common ground between the firm and stakeholders.

TI  - Anomalous surface elevation, velocity, and area changes of Split Lake Glacier, western Prince of Wales Icefield, Canadian High Arctic
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Here we use a variety of remote sensing data sets to characterize the evolving extent, surface features, dynamics, and surface elevations of Split Lake Glacier, a small outlet of the Prince of Wales Icefield, Nunavut. The glacier started advancing between 1959 and 1975, with a continued increase in terminus area up to the present day, coincident with significant upper elevation thinning and lower elevation thickening that cannot be accounted for by surface mass balance. The highest velocities reach > 600 m year(-1), with the region of fastest ice motion focused around an icefall that occurs in a bedrock constriction. Distinctive ogives are present in a 1975 air photo of the glacier for the first time, which suggests that rapid motion started by 1970. These patterns are anomalous when compared with the geometry, velocity, and area changes of all other nearby areas of western Prince of Wales Icefield and suggest that Split Lake Glacier may be a slowly surging glacier. The surge duration of 50+ years is longer than any other previously described surge within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. These results give further information concerning the wide variety of dynamic and geometrical changes of glaciers across this region.

TI  - Crop specific inversion of PROSAIL to retrieve green area index (GAI) from several decametric satellites using a Bayesian framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the performances of a semi-empirical approach based on the Bayesian theory to retrieve Green Area Index (GAI) from multiple decametric satellites. It is designed to overcome some limitations in existing Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) inversion methods, including the high dimensionality of the inverse problem, the convergence problem due to possible equifinality, and the dependence of some RTM variables on the crop-specific architecture. The PROSAIL model is first inverted in a calibration step using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm over a global dataset of ground GAI measurements (for maize, wheat, and rice) and the corresponding reflectance observations from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Quickbird to derive crop-specific distributions of PROSAIL input variables. These distributions were then used as prior information to predict GAI over an independent set of reflectance observations. Results show that the full Bayesian approach provides close estimates of GAI to ground truth, with respective Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.01, 1.33, and 0.97 for maize, wheat, and rice (R-2=0.67, 0.76 and 0.63, respectively). The performances are better than those approaches generally reported using radiative transfer models that are non-crop-specific, like the SNAP algorithm for Sentinel-2, but are slightly behind the purely empirical models based on machine learning. However, the proposed approach provides an explicit insight of the joint distribution of PROSAIL variables that are valid for any satellite platform. This constitutes a major advantage against purely empirical models, as it enables to fully exploit large observational datasets from multiple sensors and generalize to other platforms.

TI  - Improving the characterization of global aquatic land cover types using multi-source earth observation data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management of aquatic resources requires spatially explicit information on the water and vegetation presence of aquatic ecosystems. Previous Global Aquatic Land Cover (GALC) mapping has been focused on water bodies while lacking information on vegetation, and aquatic types have always been charac-terized by low accuracies in global land cover products, calling for specific attention to improve GALC mapping. The availability of a wealth of open Earth Observation (EO) data on cloud-computing platforms provides op-portunities to map aquatic land cover globally. This study aims to evaluate the potential of multi-source freely available EO data, including optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and various ancillary datasets, for improving the characterization of aquatic land cover comprising both water and vegetation types on a global scale. Using different combinations of features derived from these data, the classification performance of five land cover classes (i.e., trees, shrubs, herbaceous cover, bare/sparsely vegetated lands, and water bodies) in aquatic areas was cross-validated. Results showed that Sentinel-2 data alone achieved similarly good overall accuracy as those combining multi-source data. However, the single-sensor Sentinel-2 data cannot discriminate highly mixed and spectrally similar types, such as shrubs, trees, and herbaceous vegetation. Integrating SAR features from the ALOS/PALSAR mosaic and Sentinel-1 data with optical features provided by Sentinel-2 data could help address this limitation to some extent. Although with a lower spatial and temporal resolution, the ALOS/PALSAR mosaic had a stronger impact on GALC classification than Sentinel-1 data when they were syn-ergistically used. Features provided by ancillary datasets did not lead to significant improvement in the overall GALC classification. At class-level, topographic and soil features helped to reduce the commission error of shrubs, and climate variables were useful to improve the characterization of bare aquatic lands. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) forest canopy height dataset helped to characterize trees but also resulted in a decrease in accuracies of shrubs. By assessing multi-source earth observation data, this research represents an important step forward in the global mapping of comprehensive aquatic land cover types at high spatial reso-lution (i.e., 10 m).

TI  - Mangrove expansion at poleward range limits in North and South America: Late-Holocene climate variability or anthropocene global warming?
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are expanding poleward in North and South America, but it is unclear whether such ecotonal-shift is an Industrial-Era phenomenon, or a recurring occurrence tied to Holocene climate variability. Our multi-proxy and remote sensing data from the U.S. Gulf Coast and southeastern Brazil suggest that the Industrial Era is the first time throughout the Holocene when mangroves were able to extend their distributions to the current boreal and austral range limits. A mangrove expansion of similar to 1.3 ha (from 0.002 to 1.33 ha), 103 ha (from 23 to 126 ha), and 1.42 ha (from 0.39 to 1.81 ha) are documented at Bolivar Flats (Texas, U.S.A.), Mississippi River Delta (Louisiana, U.S.A.), and Apalachicola (Florida, U.S.A.), respectively, since the early 2000s, suggesting that mangrove expansion in North America is a 21st -century phenomenon and likely governed by warming winters. In contrast, the relatively slow mangrove expansion (from 96.1 to 106 ha between 2003 and 2019) at the austral range limit is controlled primarily by available habitats with suitable salinity and sediment substrate.

TI  - A remote sensing assessment index for urban ecological livability and its application
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing provides us with an approach for the rapid identification and monitoring of spatiotemporal changes in the urban ecological environment at different scales. This study aimed to construct a remote sensing assessment index for urban ecological livability with continuous fine spatiotemporal resolution data from Landsat and MODIS to overcome the dilemma of single image-based, single-factor analysis, due to the limitations of atmospheric conditions or the revisit period of satellite platforms. The proposed Ecological Livability Index (ELI) covers five primary ecological indicators - greenness, temperature, dryness, water-wetness, and atmospheric turbidity - which are geometrically aggregated by non-equal weights based on an entropy method. Considering multisource time-series data of each indicator, the ELI can quickly and comprehensively reflect the characteristics of the Ecological Livability Quality (ELQ) and is also comparable at different time scales. Based on the proposed ELI, the urban ecological livability in the central urban area of Wuhan, China, from 2002 to 2017, in the different seasons was analyzed every 5 years. The ELQ of Wuhan was found to be generally at the medium level (ELI approximate to 0.6) and showed an initial trend of degradation but then improved. Moreover, the ecological livability in spring and autumn and near rivers and lakes was found to be better, whereas urban expansion has led to the outward ecological degradation of Wuhan, but urban afforestation has enhanced the environment. In general, this paper demonstrates that the ELI has an exemplary embodiment in urban ecological research, which will support urban ecological protection planning and construction.

TI  - UrbanWatch: A 1-meter resolution land cover and land use database for 22 major cities in the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Very-high-resolution (VHR) land cover and land use (LCLU) is an essential baseline data for understanding finescale interactions between humans and the heterogeneous landscapes of urban environments. In this study, we developed a Fine-resolution, Large-area Urban Thematic information Extraction (FLUTE) framework to address multiple challenges facing large-area, high-resolution urban mapping, including the view angle effect, high intraclass and low interclass variation, and multiscale land cover types. FLUTE builds upon a teacher-student deep learning architecture, and includes two new feature extraction modules - Scale-aware Parsing Module (SPM) and View-aware Embedding Module (VEM). Our model was trained with a new benchmark database containing 52.43 million labeled pixels (from 2014 to 2017 NAIP airborne Imagery) to capture diverse LCLU types and spatial patterns. We assessed the credibility of FLUTE by producing a 1-meter resolution database named UrbanWatch for 22 major cities across the conterminous United States. UrbanWatch contains nine LCLU classes - building, road, parking lot, tree canopy, grass/shrub, water, agriculture, barren, and others, with an overall accuracy of 91.52%. We have further made UrbanWatch freely accessible to support urban-related research, urban planning and management, and community outreach efforts: https://urbanwatch.charlotte.edu.

TI  - Detecting and Mapping Salt-Affected Soil with Arid Integrated Indices in Feature Space Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity systems are well known as extreme environmental systems that occur either naturally or by certain human activities, in arid and semiarid regions, which may harm crop production. Soil salinity identification is essential for soil management and reclamation projects. Information derived from space data acquisition systems (e.g., Landsat, ASTER) is considered as one of the most rapid techniques in mapping Salt-Affected Soil (SAfSoil). The current study tested the previously proposed salinity indices on the northern Nile Delta region, Egypt. The results indicated that most of the indices were not suitable to detect the SAfSoil in the area, due to the interaction between the bare soils, salts, and urbanization. To resolve this issue, the current work suggested a new index for detecting and monitoring the SAfSoil in the Nile Delta region. The newly proposed index takes into consideration plant health, the salt crust at the surface of the soils, as well as urbanization. It facilitates the mapping processes of SAfSoil in the area compared to any other previously proposed index. In this respect, multi-temporal Landsat-7 and 8 satellite data, acquired in 2002, 2016, and 2021, were used. The new index was prepared using the 2002 data and verified using the 2016 and 2021 data. Field measurements and data collected during 2002, 2016, and 2021 were utilized as ground truth data to assess the accuracy of the results obtained from the proposed index. The evaluation of the results indicated that the accuracy assessment for 2002, 2016, and 2021 images was 94.58, 96.08, and 95.68%, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of using remote sensing in detecting and mapping SAfSoil is outlined.

TI  - Does Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Accurately Stage the Clinically Negative Neck in Early Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is being increasingly used worldwide as a minimally invasive option to stage the clinically node-negative neck (N0) in patients with early oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (OCSCC). We performed this trial to assess the reliability and validity of the technique.Methods: We did this prospective interventional nonrandomized study in patients with early (cT1-T2 OCSCC) and with negative neck. All patients underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy; SLNB was followed immediately by completion neck dissection (CND), thus each patient serving as their own control. The primary outcomes evaluated are sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate, SLN retrieval rate, and SLN status (positive or negative) compared with pathology of CND specimen to detect any false negatives. The secondary outcomes included SLN analyses (tumor burden, location in different levels of the neck, laterality, extracapsular spread, and total nodes positive) and overall survival.Results: Of 60 patients, 59 (98%) had successful SLN detection with the lymphoscintigram failing to localize in 1 patient. Of the remaining 59 patients, 58 (96%) had all the SLNs retrieved, resulting in 96.4% sentinel node retrieval rate. In total, 24 (41%) SLNs were positive with 1 false negative. Using a combination of SLN and CND findings as the gold standard for lymph node involvement status, SLNB had a sensitivity of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80-100%), a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 90-100%), and negative predictive value of 97% (95% CI: 85-100%).Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that SLNB is an accurate technique to assess the nodal status in patients with cT1-T2 N0 OCSCC and should be considered for eligible patients.

TI  - Dismantling the master's house: Decolonizing "Rigor" in psychological scholarship
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purported goal of social science research is to develop approaches and applications to the psychological study of social issues that allow us to know, accurately and inclusively, the lived experiences of all human beings. However, our current theoretical and methodological tools, while perceived as "objective," were founded on ahistorical and context-eliminating perspectives that privilege research designs and analytic strategies that reflect biased racial reasoning with roots in European colonial knowledge formations. By analyzing how the language of "rigor" is deployed within specific instances of social science research, we assert that it is conceptualized and operationalized to maintain a Eurocentric worldview and conception of the "human." In exploring the ways that the language of "rigor" furthers a European conception of knowledge production as normative, this manuscript provides a critical analysis that seeks to redress ongoing epistemic colonial violence by decolonizing a key term in psychological scholarship.

TI  - Influenza activity in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) in 2020-2021 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction A global reduction in influenza virus activity during the COVID-19 pandemic has been observed, including in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). However, these changes have not been thoroughly evaluated scientifically in the EMR. Objective We aim to present data on seasonal influenza activity during the pre-pandemic period (2016-2019) and compare it to the pandemic period (2020-2021) in EM countries. Methods Epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance data were retrieved from both WHO FluNet and EMFLU networks. Four pre-pandemic analytical periods were used in the comparative analysis. We compiled and calculated weekly aggregated epidemiological data on the number of enrolled patients, number of tested specimens and number of positive influenza specimens. Results 19 out of the 22 countries of the EMR have functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems, and these countries report the influenza data to WHO through FluNet and EMFLU. The number of enrolled patients and tested specimens increased gradually from 51 384 and 50 672, respectively, in 2016-2017 analytical period to 194 049 enrolled patients and 124 697 tested specimens in 2019-2020. A decrease has been witnessed in both enrolled patients and tested specimens in 2020-2021 'pandemic period' (166 576 and 44 764, respectively). By comparing influenza activity of analytical period 2020-2021 with that of 2016-2019 analytical periods, we found that there has been a decrease in influenza positivity rate in the EMR by 89%. Conclusion The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic may have also impacted the spread of influenza viruses. The low circulation of influenza viruses during 2020-2021 and the associated potential immunity gap may result in increased transmission and severity of post-pandemic influenza seasons. This necessitates high vigilance to continuous data and virus sharing to monitor circulating viruses in a timely fashion to reduce the intensity and severity of future influenza epidemics.

TI  - The story "Childhood" by L. N. Tolstoy as a pretext of "Luvers's Childhood" by B. Pasternak
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The theme of childhood, being of particular importance in the 20th century, was influenced by the tradition of describing the child's worldview in the stories of growing up in the 19th century. This work considers the story "Childhood" written by L. N. Tolstoy as a pretext to another story "Luvers's Childhood" by B. Pasternak. We analyze the echoes that arise between two stories. The method of defamiliarization (ostranenie) causes the world of childhood to be transformed into a world filled with things that exist in the space of memory and therefore undergo transformations. Although being almost imperceptible in Tolstoy's story, this transformation of things in Pasternak's story results in an enormous number of associations growing out of each image. While indicating the difference in using defamiliarization approach in the 19th and 20th centuries, we argue that the impressionistic perception caused by this method is already present in Leo Tolstoy's text. Also, the analysis covers the theme of memories and the associated motifs of the border and its crossing and the themes of sleeping and awakening, vision through dreams. These themes and motifs arising in the story of growing up suggest the authors to have introduced borderline situations and states into the narrative. Such a tradition in the Russian story of childhood, already having been presented in Tolstoy's "Childhood", was preserved in the works of the 20th century.

TI  - Moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy with suspected hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy in cooled term infants born in Tygerberg Academic Hospital: Characteristics of fetal monitoring and modifiable factors
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHILD HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In South Africa, in babies >2 500 g, intrapartum asphyxia is the main cause of neonatal death or stillbirth in those who were alive prior to labour. In a developing population, similar to 60% of neonatal encephalopathy (NE) has evidence of intrapartum hypoxic ischaemia. Therapeutic hypothermia for term babies born with NE can improve neonatal prognosis and long-term survival.Objectives. To identify the healthcare worker- and system-related modifiable factor(s) that were associated with NE in babies of >= 36 weeks' gestation born at Tygerberg Hospital (a secondary/tertiary referral hospital) between 1 January 2016 and 30 December 2018.Methods. This was an observational cross-sectional study analysing data from the Tygerberg Hospital Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy database, the electronic labour ward register, the mortality database and clinical data from patient folders.Results. A total of 118 babies were admitted for head cooling, and therefore included in the study. The hospital in-born rate for serious encephalopathy is 5.5/1 000 in singleton live-born babies (9/1 000 rate for live-born deliveries >= 36 weeks). A sentinel event was identified in 19 (16%) cases. Delay in accessing theatre was the main system-related modifiable factor (25/58 or 43% of cases delivered by emergency caesarean delivery). The average decision-to-incision time was 1 hour 40 minutes, while the average bed occupancy in the emergency maternity centre was 102%. Failure to recognise or respond to an abnormal cardiotocograph was the dominant avoidable factor related to healthcare workers in 34 cases (36.4%).Conclusion. Babies born with severe NE place a burden on parents, healthcare staff and resources. Careful intrapartum care, including utilisation of protocols for the use of oxytocin, are imperative. It is recommended that improved access to emergency theatres and appropriately trained staff for maternity units should be a priority for healthcare planners.

TI  - The Climate of <i>Orlando</i>: Woolf, Braidotti and the Anthropocene
T2  - COMPARATIVE CRITICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay brings Rosi Braidotti's recent writing on the Anthropocene into dialogue with Woolf's writing on climate in her novel Orlando (1928). As critics are beginning to notice, Woolf's novel presents the reader with vicissitudes in `the English climate' that parallel Orlando's own personal transformations, presenting itself as an early outlier of climate fiction ('cli-fi'). Less remarked upon is the radical understanding of materialism that informs Woolf's presentation of the interrelation between human life and broader nonhuman entities and systems. This article reads Woolf's material ontology, in which humans, weather systems and environments are irreversibly entangled, alongside Braidotti's 'monistic approach to subjectivity', arguing that in both we find a similar attempt to articulate a non-anthropocentric worldview which nonetheless remains alert to political and ethical issues within human society. Showing how Woolf actively historicizes the Anthropocene in Orlando, I contend that not only can Braidotti's work help to articulate Woolf's materialism, but that Woolf's attention to the sexual politics of climate change provides depth to Braidotti's posthuman feminism.

TI  - A Case Study of the Heavy Asian Dust Observed in May 2011
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - From April 29 to 30, 2011, under the influence of Asian dust originated from Mongolia, a high concentration of Asian dust was observed nationwide for 4 days in Korea. This study investigated the causes and characteristics of and weather conditions associated with Asian dust at high concentrations at its source in Mongolia. For analysis, Asian dust weather data, Asian dust monitoring tower data, satellite data, backward trajectory data, observation data (PM10 and OPC data), and ECMWF reanalysis data were used. In the synoptic analysis, it was observed that the intervals of isobars were densely distributed in the central region of Mongolia and the pressure gradient force was strong. It could be inferenced that Asian dust occurred due to strong winds. The temperature was relatively high, above 10 degrees C, just before the occurrence of Asian dust, and it decreased sharply at the onset of the dust. The relative humidity had a low value of less than approximately 40%. After the occurrence of Asian dust, it increased sharply to over 50% and then showed a tendency to decrease. In the aerosol index shown by the COMS satellite, a high concentration value of over 25 was detected in Inner Mongolia, and it was consistent with the observations made with naked eyes. In the 72-hour backward trajectory, the northwest airflow streamed into Korea, and on May 2, Heuksando showed the highest PM10 concentration of 1,025 mu g m(-)(3) (times the average). Especially, in kinematic vertical analysis, it was observed that low pressure on the ground was strengthened by cyclonic relative vorticity developed in the upper layer. Also, the vertical velocity development is considered to have played a major role in the occurrence of high concentration Asian dust.

TI  - Monitoring seasonal and phenological variability of cover management factor for wheat cropping systems under semi-arid climate conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In modeling studies, the use of spatial data derived from geographic information systems and remote sensing applications to simulate the impact of phenological and seasonal changes on soil loss has a promising effect on the accuracy of predictions. The objective of this work was to estimate the C-factor (cover management) as a dynamic-factor RUSLE (revised universal soil loss equation) model based on an NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) approach derived from high-resolution Landsat 8 and Landsat ETM7 satellite images for 140 different rain-fed wheat parcels in terms of seasonal and phenological-based by the integrated use of remote sensing and GIS. Overall, it was found that the highest C values, an average of 0.70, were estimated for the emergence period of the wheat, while the lowest value of 0.06 was found in the booting period. Seasonally, the estimated average C values in these parcels were 0.69, 0.63, 0.13, and 0.44 for the autumn, winter, spring, and summer, respectively. Corresponding soil losses for those seasons were 1.70, 1.55, 0.28, and 1.13 t ha(-1) year(-1 )respectively. Comparatively, without considering the phenological growing periods of wheat, the annual predicted soil loss rate was 11.5% higher than the conditions considered. The present study concluded that an assessment of seasonal and phenological changes in the C-factor for fragile ecosystems with weak crop-cover development could significantly improve the accuracy of the RUSLE model predictions and effectively manage limited soil and water resources.

TI  - Razzaza Lake, a natural water body: its hydraulic characteristics and water quality
T2  - INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Razzaza Lake is a depression that has been used for water storage created by the water management system in Iraq. This research examines the hydraulics characteristics and water quality of Razzaza Lake for the period 2006-2020. The hydraulic characteristics of Razzaza Lake are concerned with the quantity of Razzaza Lake storage and water level fluctuations, whilst the quality of water is concerned with the total dissolved salts (TDS), hardness of water, chlorides (Cl-) and sulfates (SO4-2). Results provide invaluable information on the water level. The monthly discharge inflow to the lake through the study period is found to be 15 m(3)/sec, which is less than the minimum designed inflow discharge of 100 m(3)/sec of the lake. This phenomenon reduced the water level from the annual average of 23.05 to 20.81 m.a.s.l. during the studied period and caused a decrease in the average annual capacity storage of the lake from 2.418 x 10(9) to 1.042 x 10(9) m(3) and shrinkage in the top surface area from 742.55 x 10(6) to 483.66 x 10(6) m(2). Results of water quality showed that the annual TDS is 11435 ppm; hardness of water is 4617.08 ppm; Cl- is 3713.58 ppm and SO4-2 is 2,951.25 ppm with extremely high rates according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study yields logical results which attributed to low rates of inflow discharges to Razzaza Lake, high rates of evaporation of 6.5 cm/month and due to low rates of rainfall for the studied period.

TI  - Earth-Observation-Based Services for National Reporting of the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators-Three Showcases in Bulgaria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) is used to monitor and assess the status of, and changes in, the natural and manmade environment via remote sensing technologies, usually involving satellites carrying imaging devices. EO applications provide important inputs to governments in planning, implementing, and monitoring the progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Along with other countries, Bulgaria has committed to all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and reflected them in its strategic documents. EO is one of the priority technologies for the development of the Bulgarian space sector. This paper analyzes how EO data could significantly help Bulgarian authorities in achieving and monitoring the progress of the SDG targets based on three specific EO monitoring pilot projects' results (showcases) focused more on the policy management approach than scientific achievement. The first project showed the opportunities of EO data for integration of a national (local) geospatial database with the existing international networks for monitoring natural disasters and accidents. The second demonstrated the time series usage of EO data for water quality monitoring. The third project integrated remote sensing data from EO and in situ measurements with ancillaries' data to provide phenology status and crop production forecast in a common geospatial database with the aim to support the Bulgarian agriculture sector modernization.

TI  - Long-Term Landsat-Based Monthly Burned Area Dataset for the Brazilian Biomes Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a significant agent of landscape transformation on Earth, and a dynamic and ephemeral process that is challenging to map. Difficulties include the seasonality of native vegetation in areas affected by fire, the high levels of spectral heterogeneity due to the spatial and temporal variability of the burned areas, distinct persistence of the fire signal, increase in cloud and smoke cover surrounding burned areas, and difficulty in detecting understory fire signals. To produce a large-scale time-series of burned area, a robust number of observations and a more efficient sampling strategy is needed. In order to overcome these challenges, we used a novel strategy based on a machine-learning algorithm to map monthly burned areas from 1985 to 2020 using Landsat-based annual quality mosaics retrieved from minimum NBR values. The annual mosaics integrated year-round observations of burned and unburned spectral data (i.e., RED, NIR, SWIR-1, and SWIR-2), and used them to train a Deep Neural Network model, which resulted in annual maps of areas burned by land use type for all six Brazilian biomes. The annual dataset was used to retrieve the frequency of the burned area, while the date on which the minimum NBR was captured in a year, was used to reconstruct 36 years of monthly burned area. Results of this effort indicated that 19.6% (1.6 million km(2)) of the Brazilian territory was burned from 1985 to 2020, with 61% of this area burned at least once. Most of the burning (83%) occurred between July and October. The Amazon and Cerrado, together, accounted for 85% of the area burned at least once in Brazil. Native vegetation was the land cover most affected by fire, representing 65% of the burned area, while the remaining 35% burned in areas dominated by anthropogenic land uses, mainly pasture. This novel dataset is crucial for understanding the spatial and long-term temporal dynamics of fire regimes that are fundamental for designing appropriate public policies for reducing and controlling fires in Brazil.

TI  - Potential Efficiency of Earth Observation for Optimum Fishing Zone Detection of the Pelagic <i>Sardinella aurita</i> Species along the Mediterranean Coast of Egypt
T2  - FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - This research utilizes the efficiency of remotely sensed data and advanced digital image processing techniques to assist in monitoring for the management of marine fisheries in Egypt (south Mediterranean Sea region). A newly developed model is applied to the Sardinella aurita fisheries to determine optimal fishing zones, and is then applied to monitor and detect the potentially optimal fishing zones for other locally important and economic fish species. This approach depends on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and sea-surface temperature (SST) characteristics that are that known to control this species communities. The ranges and distribution of SST and Chl-a were obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aqua as well as Sentinel-3 satellites during the period from 2018 to 2020. The results revealed that there is a strong link between Sardinella abundance and both the SST and the Chl-a concentration. The suitable months for the abundance of this pelagic fish species were defined to be from May to November, producing 75% of the catch (nearly 42 K tons). Low abundances were recorded during the months from December to April, below the suitable harvest levels for this species. This research highlighted the importance of using satellite data as a tool to help scientists to develop appropriate management strategies for the sustainable management of fisheries resources worldwide.

TI  - Model Selection Using <i>K</i>-Means Clustering Algorithm for the Symmetrical Segmentation of Remote Sensing Datasets
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of unsupervised clustering methods is well established in the statistics and machine learning literature. Many sophisticated unsupervised classification techniques have been made available to deal with a growing number of datasets. Due to its simplicity and efficiency in clustering a large dataset, the k-means clustering algorithm is still popular and widely used in the machine learning community. However, as with other clustering methods, it requires one to choose the balanced number of clusters in advance. This paper's primary emphasis is to develop a novel method for finding the optimum number of clusters, k, using a data-driven approach. Taking into account the cluster symmetry property, the k-means algorithm is applied multiple times to a range of k values within which the balanced optimum k value is expected. This is based on the uniqueness and symmetrical nature among the centroid values for the clusters produced, and we chose the final k value as the one for which symmetry is observed. We evaluated the proposed algorithm's performance on different simulated datasets with controlled parameters and also on real datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository. We also evaluated the performance of the proposed method with the aim of remote sensing, such as in deforestation and urbanization, using satellite images of the Islamabad region in Pakistan, taken from the Sentinel-2B satellite of the United States Geological Survey. From the experimental results and real data analysis, it is concluded that the proposed algorithm has better accuracy and minimum root mean square error than the existing methods.

TI  - Limiting the Collection of Ground Truth Data for Land Use and Land Cover Maps with Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) classification maps help understand the state and trends of agricultural production and provide insights for applications in environmental monitoring. One of the major downfalls of the LULC technique is inherently linked to its need for ground truth data to cross-validate maps. This paper aimed at evaluating the efficiency of machine learning (ML) in limiting the use of ground truth data for LULC maps. This was accomplished by (1) extracting reliable LULC information from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 s images, (2) generating remote sensing indices used to train ML algorithms, and (3) comparing the results with ground truth data. The remote sensing indices that were tested include the difference vegetation index (DVI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized built-up index (NDBI), the urban index (UI), and the normalized bare land index (NBLI). Extracted vegetation indices were evaluated on three ML algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbour (K-NN), and k dimensional-tree (KD-Tree). The accuracy of these algorithms was assessed with standard statistical measures and ground truth data randomly collected in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Results showed that high kappa coefficient values were achieved by K-NN (82% and 74%), KD-Tree (80% and 78%), and RF (83% and 73%) for Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 imagery, respectively. RF was a better classifier than K-NN and KD-Tree and had the highest overall accuracy with Sentinel-2A satellite images (92%). This approach provides the basis for limiting the collection of ground truth data and thus reduces the labour cost, time, and resources needed to collect ground truth data for LULC maps.

TI  - A lidar-based openness index to aid conservation planning for grassland wildlife.
T2  - Avian Conservation and Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Visual openness is a key element in habitat selection for many animals of grasslands and other open habitats, especially birds. Obstructions to visual openness in the form of human infrastructure or inopportune woody vegetation growth can lead to habitat avoidance, and thus pose conservation challenges. Here we introduce a remotely sensed, lidar-based index of visual openness. Like previous indices of visual openness, ours is based on the vertical angle to the horizon; however, its calculation from remotely sensed data allows it to be easily mapped across the landscape. We illustrate its potential usage by calculating the index multiple ways within two large fields in central New Jersey, USA, and evaluating the effects of openness on habitat use by a grassland bird, the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), within an occupancy modeling framework. We used the best performing model and digitally edited openness maps to project population responses under five hypothetical management scenarios of increased habitat openness. Occupancy modeling revealed that a version of the index calculated based on the maximum angle to the horizon best explained Grasshopper Sparrow occupancy patterns. Models also revealed that Grasshopper Sparrows showed a negative response to openness reductions caused by both powerlines and trees. Predictions based on the increased openness scenarios indicated that removal of tree lines and powerlines could increase patch-level occupancy of the sparrows in the affected fields by up to 15% and 9%, respectively. Where adequate data exist, this index has the potential to facilitate the study of openness-habitat use relationships in a variety of open-dwelling fauna and in a variety of habitats, from tundra to marshes to grasslands. Notably, it has promising potential for use in modeling habitat suitability and projecting potential impacts in response to anthropogenic changes in visual openness, such as wind farms, power infrastructure, or vegetation management.

TI  - A lidar-based openness index to aid conservation planning for grassland wildlife
T2  - AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Visual openness is a key element in habitat selection for many animals of grasslands and other open habitats, especially birds. Obstructions to visual openness in the form of human infrastructure or inopportune woody vegetation growth can lead to habitat avoidance, and thus pose conservation challenges. Here we introduce a remotely sensed, lidar-based index of visual openness. Like previous indices of visual openness, ours is based on the vertical angle to the horizon; however, its calculation from remotely sensed data allows it to be easily mapped across the landscape. We illustrate its potential usage by calculating the index multiple ways within two large fields in central New Jersey, USA, and evaluating the effects of openness on habitat use by a grassland bird, the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), within an occupancy modeling framework. We used the best performing model and digitally edited openness maps to project population responses under five hypothetical management scenarios of increased habitat openness. Occupancy modeling revealed that a version of the index calculated based on the maximum angle to the horizon best explained Grasshopper Sparrow occupancy patterns. Models also revealed that Grasshopper Sparrows showed a negative response to openness reductions caused by both powerlines and trees. Predictions based on the increased openness scenarios indicated that removal of tree lines and powerlines could increase patch-level occupancy of the sparrows in the affected fields by up to 15% and 9%, respectively. Where adequate data exist, this index has the potential to facilitate the study of openness-habitat use relationships in a variety of open-dwelling fauna and in a variety of habitats, from tundra to marshes to grasslands. Notably, it has promising potential for use in modeling habitat suitability and projecting potential impacts in response to anthropogenic changes in visual openness, such as wind farms, power infrastructure, or vegetation management.

TI  - Urban Land Use and Land Cover Change Analysis Using Random Forest Classification of Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient implementation of remote sensing image classification can facilitate the extraction of spatiotemporal information for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. Mapping LULC change can pave the way to investigate the impacts of different socioeconomic and environmental factors on the Earth's surface. This study presents an algorithm that uses Landsat time-series data to analyze LULC change. We applied the Random Forest (RF) classifier, a robust classification method, in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 as inputs for the 1985 to 2019 period. We also explored the performance of the pan-sharpening algorithm on Landsat bands besides the impact of different image compositions to produce a high-quality LULC map. We used a statistical pan-sharpening algorithm to increase multispectral Landsat bands' (Landsat 7-9) spatial resolution from 30 m to 15 m. In addition, we checked the impact of different image compositions based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data such as digital elevation model (DEM) and land surface temperature (LST) on final classification accuracy based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data on final classification accuracy. We compared the classification result of our proposed method and the Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers (CGLCL) map to verify the algorithm. The results show that: (1) Using pan-sharpened top-of-atmosphere (TOA) Landsat products can produce more accurate results for classification instead of using surface reflectance (SR) alone; (2) LST and DEM are essential features in classification, and using them can increase final accuracy; (3) the proposed algorithm produced higher accuracy (94.438% overall accuracy (OA), 0.93 for Kappa, and 0.93 for F1-score) than CGLCL map (84.4% OA, 0.79 for Kappa, and 0.50 for F1-score) in 2019; (4) the total agreement between the classification results and the test data exceeds 90% (93.37-97.6%), 0.9 (0.91-0.96), and 0.85 (0.86-0.95) for OA, Kappa values, and F1-score, respectively, which is acceptable in both overall and Kappa accuracy. Moreover, we provide a code repository that allows classifying Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 within GEE. This method can be quickly and easily applied to other regions of interest for LULC mapping.

TI  - Dengue virus population genetics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia prior to city-wide Wolbachia deployment
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue has been endemic in Yogyakarta, Indonesia for decades. Here, we report the dengue epidemiology, entomology, and virology in Yogyakarta in 2016-2017, prior to the commencement of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) randomized trial. Dengue epidemiological data were compiled and blood samples from dengue-suspected patients were tested for dengue virus (DENV). Ae. aegypti mosquito samples were caught from the field using BG-Sentinel traps and tested for the presence of DENV infection. Sequencing of the DENV E gene was used to determine the phylogeny and genotypes of circulating DENV. Within the last decade, the 2016-2017 dengue incidence was considered very high. Among the 649 plasma samples collected between March 2016-February 2017; and 36,910 mosquito samples collected between December 2016-May 2017, a total of 197 and 38 samples were DENV-positive by qRT-PCR, respectively. All four DENV serotypes were detected, with DENV-3 (n = 88; 44.67%) and DENV-1 (n = 87; 44.16%) as the predominant serotype, followed by DENV-4 (n = 12; 6.09%) and DENV-2 (n = 10; 5.08%). The Yogyakarta DENV-1 isolates were classified into Genotype I and IV, while DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 isolates were classified into the Cosmopolitan genotype, Genotype I, and Genotype II, respectively. Yogyakarta DENV isolates were closely related to Indonesian strains from neighboring Javanese cities, consistent with the endemic circulation of DENV on this highly populous island. Our study provides comprehensive baseline information on the DENV population genetic characteristics in Yogyakarta, which are useful as baseline data for the AWED trial and the future DENV surveillance in the city in the presence of a Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti population.

TI  - Monitoring Maize Growth and Calculating Plant Heights with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical Satellite Images
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The decrease in water resources due to climate change is expected to have a significant impact on agriculture. On the other hand, as the world population increases so does the demand for food. It is necessary to better manage environmental resources and maintain an adequate level of crop production in a world where the population is constantly increasing. Therefore, agricultural activities must be closely monitored, especially in maize fields since maize is of great importance to both humans and animals. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical satellite images were used to monitor maize growth in this study. Backscatter and interferometric coherence values derived from Sentinel-1 images, as well as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and values related to biophysical variables (such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Vegetation Cover (fCover or FVC), and Canopy Water Content (CW)) derived from Sentinel-2 images were investigated. Sentinel-1 images were also used to calculate plant heights. The Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technique was applied to calculate interferometric coherence values and plant heights. For the plant height calculation, two image pairs with the largest possible perpendicular baseline were selected. Backscatter, NDVI, LAI, fCover, and CW values were low before planting, while the interferometric coherence values were generally high. Backscatter, NDVI, LAI, fCover, and CW values increased as the maize grew, while the interferometric coherence values decreased. Among all Sentinel-derived values, fCover had the best correlation with maize height until maize height exceeded 260 cm (R-2 = 0.97). After harvest, a decrease in backscatter, NDVI, LAI, fCover, and CW values and an increase in interferometric coherence values were observed. NDVI, LAI, fCover, and CW values remained insensitive to tillage practices, whereas backscatter and interferometric coherence values were found to be sensitive to planting operations. In addition, backscatter values were also sensitive to irrigation operations, even when the average maize height was about 235 cm. Cloud cover and/or fog near the study area were found to affect NDVI, LAI, fCover, and CW values, while precipitation events had a significant impact on backscatter and interferometric coherence values. Furthermore, using Sentinel-1 images, the average plant height was calculated with an error of about 50 cm.

TI  - An extensive dust storm impact on air quality on 22 November 2018 in Sydney, Australia, using satellite remote sensing and ground data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurrent dust storms represent a significant concern in Australia because of their related hazards and damages since particulate matter (PM) has harmful impacts on the environmental, health and economic sectors. The particulate matter may be released from natural sources and human activities. The major part of natural particulate matter is emitted into the air by wind erosion processes from desert and semi-desert areas at the world scale. A huge dust storm crossed over several areas of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, including the Sydney region on 21-22 November 2018 and decreased the horizontal visibility to less than 1 km for 22 h. This study examined the synoptic weather conditions, and assessed the air quality and identified the source and transport trajectory of the dust storm over Sydney using ground and satellite remote sensing data. PM10 (< 10 mu m) concentrations were obtained from selected air quality monitoring sites operated by the Environmental Protection Agency in NSW. The highest hourly concentration of PM10 (578.7 mu g/m(3)) was recorded at Singleton in the Hunter Valley, while concentrations in Sydney ranged from 480 to 385 mu g/m(3), well above the standard air quality level in Australia (50 mu g/m(3) per 24 h). The HYSPLIT back trajectories of air parcels suggest that the potential sources of the dust episode originated from the Lake Eyre Basin and northeast South Australia, the Mundi Mundi plains west of Broken Hill, Cobar and the grazing lands and the red sandplains in northwestern NSW. It then travelled towards the east coast. These long-range airflows transported suspended dust particles, raising air quality to hazardous levels (elevated PM10 levels) over most areas of NSW. The results from the HYSPLIT model for dust movement are confirmed by MODIS satellite images. Many areas of NSW experienced this intense dust storm due to northwest wind generated by the low-pressure systems and cold fronts over South Australia and many parts of western NSW as it moved eastward.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article compares the two most famous eschatological plots in the world culture related to the description of the posthumous state of the human soul. These plots are contained in the "The Life of St. Basil the New" (10th century) and the "Divine Comedy" by Dante. The subject of the study is an artistic presentation of the posthumous fate of suicides, and the goal is a comparative analysis of two versions of the punishment for suicide as the most radical human action. Comparison of the two texts required clarification of their place in the general range of eschatological literature, as well as clarification of hypotheses about the ancient and old Eastern sources of the " Divine Comedy". The connection of "The Life of Basil the New" with the Old Testament and Christian (including apocryphal) traditions about the other world, as well as the connection of Dante's work with ancient Greek myths about the underworld (in particular, Plato) is traced. The hypothesis that Plato borrowed his eschatological myth from the ancient Armenian legend about Ara the Beautiful is critically considered. The author comes to the conclusion that, despite the common points of content and plot in the two named texts, it is necessary to recognize the difference in their key semantic accents: in the " Divine Comedy" the fate of suicides is depicted immediately after physical death, in the Life of St. Basil the New - their last fate during the Last Judgment. That is why Dante reveals a significant variability in the posthumous state of suicides, while in the Life their final fate is unambiguous. The huge popularity of these literary works indicates that the theme of retribution after death is the most important element of the religious worldview system, in which the universe itself appears as a morally oriented existential topic.

TI  - Conjunctive Use of Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS Data for Delineation of Burned Areas
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For regional-level monitoring of burned areas, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products have been operationally used. However, because of their coarser spatial resolution, such products do not allow for detection of small patches (<50 ha) of burned areas, which are very important for modeling gas emissions. In order to bridge this gap, we undertook a study to evaluate the synergy of MCD64A1 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for delineating burned areas in part of the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas, northern India. The approach involves generating a differenced normalized burn ratio image from Landsat-8 OLI data before and after fire events, refining the burned areas thus delineated using the MCD64A1 burned-area product and field data, and estimating accuracy. An overall mapping accuracy of 90.0% was achieved using Landsat-8 OLI data. Inclusion of the MODIS MCD64A1 burned-area product resulted in marginal improvement in overall accuracy (to 94.0%).

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Gujarat State has been witnessing large scale urbanization, in last two decades, resulting changes in local environment and microclimate may have also influenced the resting, feeding habits and development of Anopheles culicifacies sensu 1ato. Therefore, a systematic longitudinal study was undertaken to know the bionomics of An. culicifacies s.l. in present study.Methods: The study was conducted in four sentinel villages in Kheda and Panchmahal Districts. The mosquitoes resting indoors and outdoors were collected in early morning hours, using mouth aspirator, pyrethrum space spray and light traps. Mosquito landing collections on human volunteers was carried out from dusk to dawn. Species composition, abundance, seasonal prevalence, resting behavior (Endophily and Exophily), sibling species composition, vector potential and insecticide susceptibility status of malaria vectors was studied. Results: Six Anopheles species were collected, An. subpictus s.l. was the predominant species followed by An. culicifacies s.l., a known malaria vector was resting indoor and zoophagic behaviour. Anopheles culicifacies, sibling species B (89%) was found. The sporozoite rate (%) and entomological inoculation rate in Kheda was 2.33%, 3.09 per bite/ person/annum and they were 1.05% and 0.475 bite/person/annum in Panchmahal, respectively. Anopheles culicifacies s.l. was found possible resistance to alpha-cypermethrin.Conclusion: Anopheles culicifacies s.l. showed endophillic, zoophagic behaviour and found possible resistance to alpha-cypermethrin. Early biting behaviour of An. culicifacies s.l. in this area is a cause of concern. Therefore, there is need for frequent monitoring and evaluation of vector control measures in order to achieve the elimination target of malaria in this area.

TI  - Beijing Land Subsidence Revealed Using PS-InSAR with Long Time Series TerraSAR-X SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing is a major city suffering from land subsidence due to long-term over-exploitation of groundwater. The South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), however, has had a significant impact on the structure of water consumption since the end of 2014, and it is changing the status of land subsidence in Beijing. In this study, we employed Persistent Scatterers Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric (PS-InSAR) to investigate the decadal evolution of land subsidence in Beijing with 100 TerraSAR-X stripmap images collected from April 2010 to December 2019. The water resources, historic climate and urban construction data were compiled for the years of 2010 to 2019 to analyze changes in groundwater level, human activity, surface geology, active faults and land subsidence patterns. The results show that the changes in the water supply structure are correlated to a rise in groundwater level after 2015. These changes include an increase in the water supply from the SNWDP, a reduction in groundwater exploitation, the optimization of water consumption, replacing recycled water for environmental water and a reduction in the use of water for agriculture. Land subsidence in the study area was concentrated in the eastern regions, trending towards a decreasing velocity starting about two years after the commencement of SNWDP in 2015. Uneven subsidence in the land subsidence area was related to excavations of underground soil, and the construction of Line 6 and Line 7 led to rapid nonlinear subsidence. Our results have scientific significance for reducing subsidence hazards in the context of SNWDP and urban expansion.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article investigates some of the available measurements (Terra MODIS satellite data) of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) taken in the Arabian Gulf, a zone traditionally affected by intense sand-related (or even sand-driven) meteorological events. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals the main subspace of the data. Clustering of the series was performed after selecting the optimal number of groups using 30 different methods, such as the silhouette, gap, Duda, Dunn, Hartigan, Hubert, etc. The AOD regional and temporal tendency detection was completed utilizing an original algorithm based on the dominant cluster found at the previous stage, resulting in the regional time series (RTS) and temporal time series (TTS). It was shown that the spatially-indexed time series (SITS) agglomerates along with the first PC. In contrast, six PCs are responsible for 60.5% of the variance in the case of the temporally-indexed time series (TITS). Both RTS and TTS are stationary in trend and fit the studied data series set well.

T2  - ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter are highly prevalent among children. Reports on risk factors of patients infected with all three pathogens, not simultaneously, are scarce.Objectives: To identify risk factors for multiple infection with Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter in the same child.Methods: Using the Israel Sentinel Laboratory-Based Surveillance Network, we conducted a retrospective observational case-case-control study among children aged 0-9 years. A case was defined as a child infected with Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter at different occasions between January 1999 and December 2020. A control was defined as a child infected with a single pathogen once, during the same period. Logistic regression models were applied to determine the association between multiple infections and demographic characteristics.Results: We identified 109 cases (0.1%) infected with Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter, and 86,511 controls (99.9%) infected with only one bacteria type. In a multivariable analysis, we showed that being Jewish (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.3-4.4), having residency in Jerusalem (OR 3.2, 95%CI 1.3-7.7), or in the southern district (OR 3.7, 95%CI 1.5-8.8) were independent risk factors for multiple infection.Conclusions: Although very rare, non-simultaneous infection with multiple bacteria does occur in Israel. National and local authorities should promote programs to encourage proper hygiene practices, which are culture-adjusted.

TI  - Reflective Practice and Faith Integration: An Example from Psychology That Can Be Applied Across Disciplines
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON SCIENCE AND CHRISTIAN FAITH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although faith integration has been part of Christian ministry and pastoral counseling, it has not been included as much in clinical research, training, and practice in psychology, secular counseling, or most health professions. Reasons for exclusion include secular ethics and licensing criteria, but Christian faith can inform research and professional practice - even in secular contexts. Previous authors have discussed the integration of faith with medical practice: in some settings, using providential intervention; and in eldercare, using religious coping. This article extends that work to consider faith integration with reflective practice. Sacrifice of one's own perspective to peer inside the worldview of another, for the sake of healing, not only provides pragmatic improvements to care, but also correlates with God's commandments to love one another. Relevant techniques of reflective practice increase the quality of care given by all healthcare professionals. Many faith-integration techniques presented in this article can be applied to disciplines across the arts, sciences, and humanities.

TI  - Two distinct waves of greening in northeastern Canada: summer warming does not tell the whole story
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic vegetation cover has been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been attributed mostly to increases in temperature. Yet, the temporal dimension of this greening remains overlooked as it is often viewed as a monotonic trend. Here, using 11 year long rolling windows on 30 m resolution Landsat data, we examined the temporal variations in greening in north-eastern Canada and its dependence on summer warming. We found two significant and distinct waves of greening, centred around 1996 and 2011, and observed in all land cover types (from boreal forest to arctic tundra). The first wave was more intense and correlated with increasing summer temperature while no such relation was found for the weaker second wave. More specifically, the greening lasted longer at higher elevation during the first wave which translates to a prolonged correlation between greening and summer warming compared to low-altitude vegetation. Our work explored a forsaken complexity of high latitude greening trends and associated drivers and has raised new questions that warrant further research highlighting the importance to include temporal dimension to greening analyses in conjunction with common spatial gradients.

M3  - Article
AB  - The American Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC) "Ten things to know about ten cardiovascular disease risk factors - 2022" is a summary document regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. This 2022 update provides summary tables of ten things to know about 10 CVD risk factors and builds upon the foundation of prior annual versions of "Ten things to know about ten cardiovascular disease risk factors" published since 2020. This 2022 version provides the perspective of ASPC members and includes updated sentinel references (i. e., applicable guidelines and select reviews) for each CVD risk factor section. The ten CVD risk factors include unhealthful dietary intake, physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, pre-diabetes/diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, considerations of select populations (older age, race/ethnicity, and sex differences), thrombosis (with smoking as a potential contributor to thrombosis), kidney dysfunction and genetics/familial hypercholesterolemia. Other CVD risk factors may be relevant, beyond the CVD risk factors discussed here. However, it is the intent of the ASPC "Ten things to know about ten cardiovascular disease risk factors - 2022" to provide a tabular overview of things to know about ten of the most common CVD risk factors applicable to preventive cardiology and provide ready access to applicable guidelines and sentinel reviews.

TI  - Utilizing Optical Satellite Imagery to Monitor Temporal and Spatial Changes of Crop Water Stress: A Case Study in Alfalfa
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1980s, thermal imagery has been used to assess crop water stress. The increase in the temporal resolution of optical satellite sensors (in the range of 400-2500 nm) and the better spatial resolution compared to the thermal imagery call for the definition of a new way for crop water stress monitoring. Hence, we are suggesting a new method utilizing spectral indices from three subsequent images to address this challenge. This method predicts the current water stress with the two past images and compares it to the current stress: if the existing conditions are better than the predicted stress, the crop is not under stress and has sufficient water for development. To evaluate the suggested method, we downloaded Sentinel-2 images and compared the stress found with that method to the leaf area index, leaf water potential, and yield from seven alfalfa growth cycles. The results outline the ability of the new optical stress index to depict spatial and temporal changes in the alfalfa water stress and especially illustrated the changes in the crop water stress over the growth cycle and after each irrigation. This new method needs to be validated with different crops and satellite sensors to verify its success.

TI  - Relative Radiometric Correction of Pushbroom Satellites Using the Yaw Maneuver
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth-imaging satellites commonly acquire multispectral imagery using linear array detectors formatted as a pushbroom scanner. Landsat 8, a well-known example, uses pushbroom scanning and thus has 73,000 individual detectors. These 73,000 detectors are split among 14 different focal plane modules (FPM), and each detector and FPM exhibit unique behavior when monitoring a uniform radiance value. To correct for each detector's differences in sensor measurement, a novel technique of relative gain estimation that employs an optimized modified signal-to-noise ratio through a 90 degrees yaw maneuver, also known as side slither, is presented that allows for both FPM and detector-level relative gain calculation. A periodic model based on in-scene FPM corrections was designed as a go-to model for all bands aboard Landsat 8. Relative gains derived from the side-slither technique and applied to imagery provide a visual and statistical reduction in detector-level and FPM-level striping and banding in Landsat 8 imagery. Both reflective and thermal wavelengths are corrected to a level that rivals current operational methods. While Landsat 8 is used as an example, the methodology is applicable to all linear array sensors that can perform a 90 degrees yaw maneuver.

TI  - Modeling subgrid lake energy balance in ORCHIDEE terrestrial scheme using the FLake lake model
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The freshwater 1-D FLake lake model was coupled to the ORCHIDEE land surface model to simulate lake energy balance at the global scale. A multi-tile approach has been chosen to allow the modeling of various types of lakes within the ORCHIDEE grid cell. Thus, three different lake tiles have been defined according to lake depth which is the most influential parameter of FLake, but other properties could be considered in the future. Several depth parameterization strategies have been compared, differing by the way to aggregate the depth of the subgrid lakes, i.e., arithmetical, geometrical, harmonical mean and median. Five atmospheric reanalysis datasets available at 0.5 degrees or 0.25 degrees resolution have been used to force the model and assess model systematic errors. Simulations have been performed, evaluated and intercompared against observations of lake water surface temperatures provided by the GloboLakes database over about 1000 lakes and ice phenology derived from the Global Lake and River Ice Phenology database.The results highlighted the large impact of the atmospheric forcing on the lake energy budget simulations and the improvements brought by the highest resolution products (ERA5 and E2OFD). The median of the root square mean errors (RMSEs) calculated at global scale ranges between 3.2 and 2.7 degrees C among the forcings, CRUJRA and ERA5 leading respectively to the worst and best results. The depth parameterization strategy appeared to be less influential, with RMSE differences less than 0.1 degrees C for the four aggregation scenarios tested.The simulation of ice phenology presented systematic errors whatever the forcing and the depth parameterization used. Large systematic errors were highlighted such as negative biases on the onset and positive biases on the offset.Freezing onset was shown to be the less sensitive to atmospheric forcing with the median of the errors ranging between 10 and 14 d. Larger errors up to 25 d were observed on the simulation of the end of the freezing period. Such errors, already highlighted in previous works, could be explained by scale effects and deficiencies in the modeling of snow-ice processes not accounting for partial ice cover. Various pathways are drawn to improve the model results, including the use of remote sensing data to better constrain the lake radiative parameters (albedo and extinction coefficient) as well as the lake depth thanks to the recent and forthcoming high-resolution satellite missions.

TI  - Ecological Memory and Socio-Ecological Resilience Approach Within the Scope of Mugla Wildfires
T2  - ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate change crisis stemming from anthropogenic reasons has triggered severe weather events and disasters all over the world in recent years. In this context, the main purpose of the paper is to reveal the importance of ecological memory in the face of the wildfires threatening our living spaces and taking place between 29 July-12 August 2021 throughout Mugla Province, and to divulge basic strategies for the future of the region by questioning the resilience of ecosystem. The damage caused by wildfires are determined by using satellite images and remote sensing methods in GIS. Accordingly, the borders of burned areas were determined by using mainly remote sensing data according to the degree of burn severity on the basis of NBR. In turn, these borders were overlapped with CLC data and administrative borders at different scales for determination of the land cover types of the burned areas and the urban areas affected. Subsequently, the actual surface areas of the burned regions were calculated by using SRTM GL1 satellite images. The results show that not only forest assets, but also agricultural areas, production areas, mining areas, urban transportation network and residential areas were damaged by the wildfires. Although burned areas can be calculated by using remote sensing methods as done in this study, exact delimitation of fire zones and precise distribution of the burned areas according to land cover types also require in-situ work. Hence, the scope of the paper doesn't cover these issues that can only be addressed by future studies. Overall, the paper proposes a framework for questioning the socio-ecological resilience of the ecosystem in the upcoming period of the disasters that threaten our living spaces, and formulates a set of strategies for spatial planning by employing a socio-ecological approach for increasing the resilience of habitats by revealing ecological memory.

TI  - <i>Cannabis sativa</i> L. Spectral Discrimination and Classification Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crops such as cannabis, poppy, and coca tree are used to make illicit and addictive drugs. Detection and mapping of such crops can be significant for the controlled growth of the plants, thus supporting the prevention of illegal production. Remote sensing has the ability to monitor areas for cannabis growing. However, in the scientific literature, there is relatively little information on the spectral features of cannabis. Here in this study, we aim to: (1) offer a literature review on the studies investigating Cannabis sativa L. using remote sensing data; (2) define the spectral features of cannabis fields and other plants found in areas where cannabis is produced in northern Turkey; (3) apply machine learning algorithms for distinguishing cannabis from non-cannabis fields. For the purposes of this study, high-resolution imagery from PlanetScope satellites was used. The investigation showed that the most significant difference between cannabis and the other investigated plants was noticed in May-June. The classification results showed that, with Random Forest (RF) cannabis, fields can be accurately classified with accuracy higher than 93%. Following these results, the investigations with machine learning techniques showed promising results for classifying cannabis fields.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of cloud shadows on remotely sensed images significantly complicates the analysis of the monitored area. The paper considers the problem of cloud shadows compensation on multispectral remotely sensed data. A new algorithm for cloud shadows detection and compensation based on a robust estimate of a local shadowing coefficient is proposed. Experimental results on shadow compensation quality for RGBN channels and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) index using the dataset of ten Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral images are presented. The results show that the compensation effect by the proposed algorithm on RGBN and NDVI data is 2 times better than that of the Gray-World-based algorithm.

TI  - Testing the Robust Yield Estimation Method for Winter Wheat, Corn, Rapeseed, and Sunflower with Different Vegetation Indices and Meteorological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based crop yield estimation methods rely on vegetation indices, which depend on the availability of the number of observations during the year, influencing the value of the derived crop yield. In the present study, a robust yield estimation method was improved for estimating the yield of corn, winter wheat, sunflower, and rapeseed in Hungary for the period 2000-2020 using 16 vegetation indices. Then, meteorological data were used to reduce the differences between the estimated and census yield data. In the case of corn, the best result was obtained using the Green Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index, where the correlation between estimated and census data was R-2 = 0.888 before and R-2 = 0.968 after the meteorological correction. In the case of winter wheat, the Difference Vegetation Index produced the best result with R-2 = 0.815 and 0.894 before and after the meteorological correction. For sunflower, these correlation values were 0.730 and 0.880, and for rapeseed, 0.765 and 0.922, respectively. Using the meteorological correction, the average percentage differences between estimated and census data decreased from 7.7% to 3.9%, from 6.7% to 3.9%, from 7.2% to 4.2%, and from 7.8% to 5.1% in the case of corn, winter wheat, sunflower, and rapeseed, respectively.

TI  - Characterization of Wildfires and Harvesting Forest Disturbances and Recovery Using Landsat Time Series: A Case Study in Mediterranean Forests in Central Italy
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale forest monitoring benefits greatly from change detection analysis based on remote sensing data because it enables characterizing forest dynamics of disturbance and recovery by detecting both gradual and abrupt changes on Earth's surface. In this study, two of the main disturbances occurring in Mediterranean forests, harvesting operations and forest fires, were analyzed through the analysis of Landsat Times Series images in a case study in Central Italy (Tuscany region). Disturbances were characterized based on their distinct temporal behaviors before and after the event: a period of 20 years (1999-2018) was used to extract and analyze at pixel level spectral trajectories for each disturbance and produce descriptive temporal trends of the phenomena. Recovery metrics were used to characterize both short- (5 years) and long-term aspects of recovery for harvested and burned areas. Spectral, recovery, and trend analysis metrics were then used with the Random Forest classifier to differentiate between the two disturbance classes and to investigate their potential as predictors. Among spectral bands, the Landsat SWIR 1 band proved the best to detect areas interested by harvesting, while forest fires were better detected by the SWIR 2 band; among spectral indices, the NBR scored as the best for both classes. On average, harvested areas recovered faster in both short- and long-term aspects and showed less variability in the magnitude of the disturbance event and recovery rate over time. This tendency is confirmed by the results of the classifier, which obtained an overall accuracy of 98.6%, and identified the mean of the post-disturbance values of the trend as the best predictor to differentiate between disturbances.

TI  - ANIMAL WORLD VS HUMAN WORLD: THROUGH CULTURAL CODES TO ARCHETYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ANIMALISTIC METAPHOR
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study provides archetypal characteristics analysis of animalistic metaphors in synchronic and diachronic aspects. The analysis involves the works of I. A. Krylov and modern examples from the National Corpus of the Russian Language, which enables to identify the archetypal characteristics of the animal world when representing various aspects of the life of a modern person. The latter are understood as stable in historical changes and determining the structure of the worldview of both an individual and a nation. The paper displays a classification of the characteristics of animals presented in animalistic metaphors, received through the fable, which are recognizable in modern socio-political and economic contexts. Analysis of the target area, namely the "human world", demonstrated the presence in the content of metaphorical concepts of both personal characteristics (strength, cunning, stupidity, ignorance, arrogance) and social characteristics (hard work, unprofessionalism and incompetence, fidelity to friendship, hypocrisy, respect for experience and the collision of the new and old). At the same time, the repertoire of animalistic metaphors that verbalize the world around a person includes individual animals, groups of animals, as well as artifacts associated with animals. The conducted research testifies to the undeniable archetypal status of the metaphorical model "the world of animals. the world of man", which made a centuries-long way to get into the Russian language and culture starting with the fables of the Russian writer I. A. Krylov.

TI  - Metal Signet Rings from Yakut Burials of the 18th-19th Centuries
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal signet rings are a very attractive category of finds in the archaeological sites of the Yakuts of the XIV - XIX centuries, but at the same time there are practically no resumptive works on them. The purpose of the article is to study the origin and iconography of the Yakut signet rings based on their historical and comparative analysis with small forms of toreutics, mainly belt ornaments of Eurasian nomads of the end of the 1st - beginning of the 2nd millennium AD. The sources were the materials of the archaeological excavations of Yakut burials of the XVIII - XIX centuries, made in the regions of Central Yakutia.On the plates of most of signet rings from the Yakut burials the initials of the owners were engraved in Russian letters. That was the main reason for the formation of the opinion in scientific literature that Yakut signet rings appeared under the influence of Russian culture. However, in private and museum collections there are signet rings with runic signs of Orkhon-Yenisei script. Moreover, in the first layer of the settlement Kerdyugen, dating back to the XIV century, a bronze signet ring with the image of a lion and a unicorn was found. This image is also found on the front metal plates of Yakut parade saddles of the 19th century, matched by decor with ornamented overlays on the bows of the Kudyrginsky saddles. According to the researchers, the images of heraldic style reflect the ancient Turkic early medieval tradition, inherited in its turn from the neighboring civilizations - Sassanian Iran and China.The artistic and decorative design of the Yakut signet rings, along with the traditional floral ornament, contains the elements of the so-called steppe ornamentalism: the motifs of "crown", "flaming pearls", "tied palmetta" and "fig flower". The most extensive analogies of them are found in the decoration of the belt and harness sets in the Khoitsegorsk cemetery in Western Transbaikalia and cultural monuments of the Yenisei Kyrgyz in Central Tuva and the Kuznetsk Basin of Altai. The motives under consideration, although present in the engraving of Yakut silver products, including band patches, are still beyond the attention of specialists. Indeed, a German anthropologist U. Johansen once noted that the individual motifs of Yakut ornament show similar features with the elements of the fine arts of Asia Minor cultures.The presence of ornamental motifs of religious content in the art of the Yakuts is accompanied by the presence of a number of elements of Manichaean mythology and early Buddhism in their worldview and beliefs, apparently received from the medieval population of Pribaikalye or the Yenisei Kyrgyz. It is noteworthy that in the engraving of single silver products of the Yakuts Manichaean symbols are fixed.The article suggests that signet rings in a jewelry set of the Yakuts, along with earrings in the form of a "question mark", neck hryvnias with loop-like folds, could be the heritage of the medieval Kypchaks culture, and the elements of their iconography - toreutics of Yenisei Kyrgyz.

TI  - Automated versus Manual Mapping of Gravel Pit Lakes from South-Eastern Romania for Detailed Morphometry and Vegetation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the accelerated development of the remote sensing domain and the improvement of the resolution and frequency of satellite images allowed the increase in the accuracy of the evaluation of morphometric characteristics and the spatiotemporal distribution of pit lakes, including the small ones. Our study quantitatively analyzes small-scale pit lakes in the piedmont and subsidence plains from contact with the Getic and Curvature Subcarpathians from Romania using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and data series, with different resolutions, from Landsat 8, Google Earth, and Sentinel 2A. The problems encountered in extracting the contours of the gravel pit lakes were determined by the different resolution of the images, the uneven quality of the images exported from Google Earth, and an additional challenge was given by the diversity of the analyzed land surfaces, the land use, and the optical properties of the lakes. A comparison of the obtained NDWI values using data series from Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8 highlighted the importance of resolution and also showed a larger spectral difference between the identified water bodies and the surrounding land in favor of Sentinel 2A. Regarding the vegetation-derived indices, superior leaf area index (1.8-3) was recorded in low-lying plains and mixed areas (tall shrubs, wetlands, etc.) because the river banks have increased moisture that supports taller species with denser foliage and the sparsely vegetated areas are located in agricultural crops and in/near villages. Changes in vegetation richness and abundance can be spatiotemporally monitored using indices derived from the spectral bands of satellite imagery.

TI  - BROADWAY MUSICAL COMMERCIAL THEATER IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SOCIO-CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE 70S OF THE XX CENTURY
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Broadway musicals created in the 70s of the XX century are a reflection of many socio-cultural phenomena taking place in the USA at that time. Their dynamic, originally formed musical dramaturgy, an appeal to topical topics consonant with the public consciousness of the era of the 70s, makes this period of development truly unique. The works created during these years by Stephen Sondheim, Stephen Schwartz, John Kander, Fred Ebb, Marvin Hamlisch, Edward Kleban greatly influenced the development of the musical genre, enriching it with new musical and dramatic techniques, a fundamentally new worldview for that time. The 70s of the XX century were the heyday of the creative work of musical theater directors such as Harold Prince, Bob Foss, Jerome Robins, Michael Bennett, whose work revealed the musical and dramatic features of musicals, created an atmosphere and a unique charm of entertainment, but at the same time a special psychological depth, for which such musicals as "Chicago", "Corps de Ballet", "Company", "Little Night Music" became famous.Commercial theater is also professional management and non-trivial production solutions that promote artistic works to the market. Perhaps because of this, these musicals have become beloved by a huge audience and iconic in the history of the genre as a whole. The 70s were especially difficult for the life survival of Broadway theaters, because the conditions of the economic crisis in the United States were increasing. Society, on the one hand, became more and more divided, on the other hand, various racial and gender minorities united, intensifying the struggle for their civil rights, the women's movement for equality was gaining more and more strength.Since its inception in the middle of the XIX century and up to the beginning of the XXI century, the Broadway musical has been and remains a vibrant, viable entertainment form. The musical as a kind of musical theater has endured devastating economic and political crises, radical shifts in public consciousness and the development of much more modern, less expensive and supported mass entertainment media with enviable resilience. This type of musical and scenic art continues to live and develop steadily, and in recent years its importance in social and cultural life and popularity among the general population, including in our country, has increased significantly.The stage American musical is a constantly adapting commercial musical and theatrical entertainment form, which is the product of a dynamically developing socio-cultural environment. It is impossible to separate the processes occurring in the genre-stylistic evolution of the musical from the economic, socio-political and social phenomena occurring at each individual historical stage of the development of society. That is why the materials presented in the article are interdisciplinary. They are connected not only with the musical as a kind of musical and scenic art, but, what is fundamentally important and new for this kind of research, with the socio-historical background that influenced the formation of certain trends in the development and formation of musical theater.

TI  - "GENRE AS A MEMORY OF CULTURE": AN ESSAY BY A.M. GORKY ABOUT GARIN-MIKHAILOVSKY AND TEITEL
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The author of the article relies on the formula of M. M. Bakhtin: Genre is the memory of. Genre memory is one of the most important representatives of culture influencing society. The structure of the genre captures and conveys the values and horizons of culture. In this methodological context, a specific essay by A.M. Gorky, written back in the 1930s, however, which had a retrospective, and at the same time, relevant character to this day. The essay by the already famous writer and architect of Soviet culture is dedicated to two representatives of the Samara intelligentsia. In their circle, the novice journalist Maxim Gorky was back in 1895-1896. "Doublethink", "double meaning", "externality" permeate the content of the essay, the heroes of which were Gorky's pre-revolutionary acquaintances: engineer and writer N.G. Garin-Mikhailovsky, as well as lawyer Ya.L. Teitel. While still a novice writer, Gorky communicated with them when he lived briefly in Samara and worked in Samara Newspaper. Gorky presents his old acquaintances as people of high culture and professionalism. He compares them with the most outstanding figures of world culture: the righteous and the founders of new socio-cultural institutions. An essay dedicated to old acquaintances from Samara was written in 1925, and subsequently placed in Volume 17 of Gorky's. This volume was published only in 1952. The belief of the "Soviet classic No. 1" in a culture capable of transforming the people played a significant role in his worldview. According to the author of the article, all the activities of A. M. Gorky of the late period.He created unique cultural projects, including the academic edition of World Literature, the Life of Remarkable People series popular to this day, the Children's Literature publishing house, and the creation of creative Unions of writers, composers, and artists. In the same row is the concept of a relatively small essay dedicated to Garin-Mikhailovsky and Teitel. It is typical of the later writings and cultural projects of the writer. The meaning and structure of this essay (representing two intelligent people of the Russian province) resembles a hologram - a tiny fragment that reflects the general understanding of the role of culture by a mature writer and a global builder of culture.

TI  - THE ONTOLOGICAL MEANING OF THE CATEGORY "VIRTUAL REALITY" IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FORMATION OF THE DIGITAL PARADIGM
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the problem of determining the ontological meaning of the category "virtual reality" in the context of the formation of the digital paradigm. Currently, in the era of the implementation of the megatrends of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), the interdisciplinary consideration of such a sociocultural and technical phenomenon as virtual reality (VR) is being updated. Virtual reality as a given (along with objective and subjective reality), as an integral part of the modern worldview, determines the philosophical research and determination of its ontological status. The historical and philosophical analysis of metaphysical concepts carried out in this work focuses on the ontological possibility of virtual reality. The analysis shows that various philosophers and philosophical traditions have addressed the question of the ontological possibility of reality, different from the usual reality of the surrounding world, and answer it as follows: any reality is ontologically possible due to the action of certain laws of change in general and the implementation of the process "from possibility (dynamism) - through action (energy) - to realizability (entelechy)" (Aristotle); the ontological possibility of any reality finds its potential in our consciousness, because "everything is consciousness" (yogachara); transcending, going beyond the usual empirical explanation of reality, determines the manifestations of the a priori form of pure reason, expressed in the conclusion about the ontological possibility of reality (Kant). Thus, the thesis about the ontological possibility of any reality, including virtual reality, which in the process of implementation acquires objective (materialized, felt) and subjective (thought) characteristics, is substantiated. Currently, virtual reality is a full-fledged reality that has an ontological status, acquired during the creation and implementation of digital technologies, for example, such as virtual (VR), augmented (AR), mixed (MR) reality, the main purpose of which from a scientific point of view is to substantiate the digital picture of the world (digital paradigm), and from a sociocultural point of view to improve the quality of life of a modern person.

TI  - A horse in the traditional funeral rites of the Khakas (late 19th - mid-20th centuries)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to characterize the horse, and its image, as an animal included in the ideological and ritual system of the Khakas associated with funerals. The chronological framework of the work covers the late 19th - mid-20th centuries. The choice of such time limits is determined by the state of the source base on the research topic. Leading in the study is the principle of historicism, when any cultural phenomenon is considered in development and taking into account a specific situation. Historical, ethnographic, folklore and linguistic materials are used as sources, some of which are published for the first time. The research methodology is based on historical and ethnographic methods: remnants (relic), semantic and comparative historical analysis. As a result of the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: in the traditional culture of the Khakas, in particular in funeral rites, the horse and its image were important because of their utilitarian and sacred functions. The hoylaga horse served as a riding animal that accompanied the owner when moving to another world. The rite of burial with a horse is determined by the ideas of the posthumous existence of its owner. The conditions for a safe transfer of a deceased person to the afterlife depended on compliance with the rules of funeral rites, which included providing the person with everything necessary, including horse equipment, following body transportation rules, etc. In the worldview of the Khakas, the image of a horse had a close connection with the image of a male warrior, which is reflected in the funeral ritual. Only men were buried with horses. The ceremony of burial with a horse was distinguished by complexity and large fmancial costs. The inclusion of the horse in the funeral process had pragmatic goals. Horse meat was a product preferred from a ritual point of view, belonged to the category of "prestigious food" and was widely used in the funeral feast. The act of eating horse meat by the participants of the funeral rite carried a religious and symbolic function of sending the horse to another world. The funeral and memorial rituals of the Khakas were characterized by variability due to the ethnolocal traditions of the people, which was expressed in the timing of the killing of the horse of the deceased. Over time, due to historical reasons, the burial rite with the hoylaga horse transformed. People began to practice only the symbolic sending of the horse to the deceased, without interrupting the animal's life. The ritual function of sending a horse with its owner in funeral rites was reflected in folklore that contains archaic sacred representations and rituals of the people in relic form.

TI  - Machine-Learning for Mapping and Monitoring Shallow Coral Reef Habitats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Mapping and monitoring coral reef benthic composition using remotely sensed imagery provides a large-scale inference of spatial and temporal dynamics. These maps have become essential components in marine science and management, with their utility being dependent upon accuracy, scale, and repeatability. One of the primary factors that affects the utility of a coral reef benthic composition map is the choice of the machine-learning algorithm used to classify the coral reef benthic classes. Current machine-learning algorithms used to map coral reef benthic composition and detect changes over time achieve moderate to high overall accuracies yet have not demonstrated spatio-temporal generalisation. The inability to generalise limits their scalability to only those reefs where in situ reference data samples are present. This limitation is becoming more pronounced given the rapid increase in the availability of high temporal (daily) and high spatial resolution (<5 m) multispectral satellite imagery. Therefore, there is presently a need to identify algorithms capable of spatio-temporal generalisation in order to increase the scalability of coral reef benthic composition mapping and change detection. This review focuses on the most commonly used machine-learning algorithms applied to map coral reef benthic composition and detect benthic changes over time using multispectral satellite imagery. The review then introduces convolutional neural networks that have recently demonstrated an ability to spatially and temporally generalise in relation to coral reef benthic mapping; and recurrent neural networks that have demonstrated spatio-temporal generalisation in the field of land cover change detection. A clear conclusion of this review is that existing convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network frameworks hold the most potential in relation to increasing the spatio-temporal scalability of coral reef benthic composition mapping and change detection due to their ability to spatially and temporally generalise.

TI  - Use of the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Satellites for Water Quality Monitoring: An Early Warning Tool in the Mar Menor Coastal Lagoon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During recent years, several eutrophication processes and subsequent environmental crises have occurred in Mar Menor, the largest hypersaline coastal lagoon in the Western Mediterranean Sea. In this study, the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites are jointly used to examine the evolution of the main water quality descriptors during the latest ecological crisis in 2021, resulting in an important loss of benthic vegetation and unusual mortality events affecting different aquatic species. Several field campaigns were carried out in March, July, August, and November 2021 to measure water quality variables over 10 control points. The validation of satellite biogeochemical variables against on-site measurements indicates precise results of the water quality algorithms with median errors of 0.41 mg/m(3) and 2.04 FNU for chlorophyll-a and turbidity, respectively. The satellite preprocessing scheme shows consistent performance for both satellites; therefore, using them in tandem can improve mapping strategies. The findings demonstrate the suitability of the methodology to capture the spatiotemporal distribution of turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration at 10-30 m spatial resolution on a systematic basis and in a cost-effective way. The multitemporal products allow the identification of the main critical areas close to the mouth of the Albujon watercourse and the beginning of the eutrophication process with chlorophyll-a concentration above 3 mg/m(3). These innovative tools can support decision makers in improving current monitoring strategies as early warning systems for timely assistance during these ecological disasters, thus preventing detrimental conditions in the lagoon.

TI  - Quantifying Dynamic Coupling Coordination Degree of Human-Environmental Interactions during Urban-Rural Land Transitions of China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban-rural land transition and the coordination of coupled human-environmental systems are two important issues in the process of global urban-rural development. Although existing studies have explored the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of human-environmental interactions under the context of urbanization, few studies have taken land transitions into consideration. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of CCD in China from 2001 to 2018 using multisource remote sensing data and quantified the CCD changes in land transitions among urban construction land (UCL), rural residential land (RRL), and non-construction land (NCL). The CCD alterations mainly occurred in the decline in NCL stock, the increase in UCL stock, and especially the losses during RRL to NCL transfers. We urge academics and government decision-makers to pay more attention to the CCD transfers and losses during urban-rural transitions. This study provides scientific guidance for the development of urban-rural integration and is expected to assist the coordinated evaluation of human-environmental interactions in the process of sustainable development.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Images via Linear Compression of Bands: An Experiment Using RIT-18
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery is a basic task for many applications, such as forest monitoring, cloud detection, and land-use planning. Many state-of-the-art networks used for this task are based on RGB image datasets and, as such, prefer three-band images as their input data. However, many remotely sensed images contain more than three spectral bands. Although it is technically possible to feed multispectral images directly to those networks, poor segmentation accuracy was often obtained. To overcome this issue, the current image dimension reduction methods are either to use feature extraction or to select an optimal combination of three bands through different trial processes. However, it is well understood that the former is often comparatively less effective, because it is not optimized towards segmentation accuracy, while the latter is less efficient due to repeated trial selections of three bands for the optimal combination. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore alternative methods that can utilize multiple spectral bands efficiently in the state-of-the-art networks for semantic segmentation of similar accuracy as the trial selection approach. In this study, a hot-swappable stem structure (LC-Net) is proposed to linearly compress the input bands to fit the input preference of typical networks. For the three commonly used network structures tested on the RIT-18 dataset (having six spectral bands), the approach proposed was found to be an equivalently effective but much more efficient alternative to the trial selection approach.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Data in the Philippines from 2010 to 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing for air quality assessment provides information over a large spatial coverage and time period that shows the trends and effects of anthropogenic activities. Using data collected from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite from the years 2010 to 2020, the spatiotemporal variations to aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Koronadal City and Quezon City were studied. Validation showed a strong relationship between the MODIS AOD values and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD values (R-2 = 0.83) and a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.26. Annual variation in the AOD of the two study areas showed a peak AOD value in 2015 due to an immense biomass burning in Indonesia and a low AOD value in 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Koronadal City experienced a high AOD value during the fall season due to aerosols from biomass burning in Indonesia that were carried by the southwest monsoon. Quezon City experienced a high AOD value during spring from increased local sources, as well as long-range transport pollutants from East Asia that were carried by northeasterly winds. Overall, this study provides an understanding of the spatiotemporal variations in aerosols in the Philippines, which could be used in environmental management, air quality regulations, and health assessment studies. This shows the urgency of monitoring and mitigating poor air quality in the Philippines.

TI  - Trends and Contributing Factors in Medicolegal Cases Involving Spine Surgery
T2  - SPINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Design. Retrospective descriptive study. Objective. The aim of this study was to describe closed medicolegal cases involving physicians and spine surgery in Canada from a trend and patient safety perspective. Summary of Background Data. Spine surgery is a source of medicolegal complaints against surgeons partly owing to the potential severity of associated complications. In previous medicolegal studies, researchers applied a medicolegal lens to their analyses without applying a quality improvement or patient safety lens. Methods. The study comprised a 15-year medicolegal trend analysis and a 5-year contributing factors analysis of cases (civil legal and regulatory authority matters) from the Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA), representing an estimated 95% of physicians in Canada. Included cases were closed by the CMPA between 2004 and 2018 (trends) or 2014 and 2018 (contributing factors). We fit a linear trend line to the annual rates of spine surgery cases per 1000 physician-years of CMPA membership for physicians in a neurosurgery or orthopedic surgery specialty. We then applied an ANOVA type III sum of squares test to determine the statistical significance of the annualized change rate over time. For the contributing factors analysis, we reported descriptive statistics for patient and physician characteristics, patient harm, and peer expert criticisms in each case. Results. Our trend analysis included 340 cases. Case rates decreased significantly at an annualized change rate of -4.7% (P = 0.0017). Our contributing factors analysis included 81 civil legal and 19 regulatory authority cases. Most patients experienced health care-related harm (89/100, 89.0%). Peer experts identified intraoperative injuries (29/89, 32.6%), diagnostic errors (14/89, 15.7%), and wrong site surgeries (16/89, 18.0%) as the top patient safety indicators. The top factor contributing to medicolegal risk was physician clinical decision-making. Conclusion and Relevance. Although case rates decreased, patient harm was attributable to health care in the majority of recently closed cases. Therefore, crucial opportunities remain to enhance patient safety in spine surgery.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of Grassland SOS Estimation Accuracy Based on Different MODIS-Landsat Spatio-Temporal Fusion Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the Start of Growing Season (SOS) of grassland on the global scale is an important scientific issue since it can reflect the response of the terrestrial ecosystem to environmental changes and determine the start time of grazing. However, most remote sensing data has coarse-temporal and spatial resolution, resulting in low accuracy of SOS retrieval based on remote sensing methods. In recent years, much research has focused on multi-source data fusion technology to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of remote sensing information, and to provide a feasible path for high-accuracy remote sensing inversion of SOS. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of quantitative evaluation for the accuracy of these data fusion methods in SOS estimation. Therefore, in this study, the SOS estimation accuracy is quantitatively evaluated based on the spatio-temporal fusion daily datasets through the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and other models in Xilinhot City, Inner Mongolia, China. The results show that: (1) the accuracy of SOS estimation based on spatio-temporal fusion daily datasets has been slightly improved, the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of SOS based on 8d composite datasets is 11.1d, and the best is 9.7d (f(star fm)(8)(2) the estimation accuracy based on 8d composite datasets ((RMSE) over bar = 11.1d) is better than daily fusion datasets ((RMSE) over bar = 18.2d); (3) the lack of the Landsat data during the SOS would decrease the quality of the fusion datasets, which ultimately reduces the accuracy of the SOS estimation. The (RMSE) over bar of SOS based on all three models increases by 11.1d, and the STARFM is least affected, just increases 2.7d. The results highlight the potential of the spatio-temporal data fusion method in high-accuracy grassland SOS estimation. It also shows that the dataset fused by the STARFM algorithm and composed for 8 days is better for SOS estimation.

TI  - A large multicenter propensity match study of sentinel lymph node biopsy feasibility in endometrioid variants of endometrial cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy algorithm has been routinely applied in all endometrial endometrioid tumors, however, no studies analyzed the feasibility of SLN mapping in endometrioid variants (EV), which included villoglandular, secretory, ciliated cell, mucinous, and squamous differentiation. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of SLN biopsy in EV of EC.Materials and methods: All patients undergoing minimally invasive surgical treatment for early-stage EC were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 study groups: Group 1 which included patients with EV, and Group 2 which included patients with typical endometrioid histology. A propensity match analysis was performed according to age (>= 65 years vs. no), BMI (>= 30 kg/m(2) vs. no), and LVSI (present vs. absent).Results: After a 1:5 propensity-matched analysis, a total of 458 patients were identified (Group 1 n = 77, Group 2 n = 381). Overall detection rate was not statistically significant between the EV and the typical endometrioid group (94.8% vs. 92.4%, p = 0.319). Furthermore, neither bilateral nor unilateral detection rate was different between the two groups (70.1% vs. 74.8%, p = 0.267, and 23.4% vs.17.8%, p = 0.120). BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) was the only factor influencing SLN failure (p = 0.013). SLN technique showed excellent sensitivity in both the EV (100% sensitivity, p < 0.001) and the typical endometrioid unit (93.8% sensitivity, p < 0.001).Conclusion: SLN research/detection for EV of endometrial cancer is a feasible and highly sensitive technique. Obesity was confirmed to be a risk factor for SLN failure. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Entangle, Entangled, Entanglements: Reimagining a Child and Youth Engagement Model Using a Common Worlds Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILDHOOD STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper responds to the call to explore pedagogical relations and dialogues in considering how to create climate pedagogies that are responsive, dynamic, and transformative in thinking about human and nonhuman relations. Using the lens of entanglement, the paper attempts to bring into dialogue children's rights and more-than-human ways of thinking to understand what, if any, commonalities lie in these two projects and whether and how a rights-respecting approach can be productively reconfigured in envisaging a dynamic climate pedagogy It considers several tensions that arise from this entangled dialogue to probe both the overlaps and points of incommensurability in the two approaches. This includes viewing asymmetrical power and logics of coloniality that assert themselves through rights discourses and rights-based techniques based in an Anglo-Eurocentric worldview that narrowly defines who is included in the "human" of human rights. To illustrate these entanglements, the paper draws on a child/youth-led and child/youth-driven participatory model called Shaking the Movers (STM) created in 2007 by the Landon Pearson Centre and used with youth as well as with children in early childhood and other settings across Canada each year The model aims to enable children's civil and political rights. Shaking the Movers was used as the framework for a workshop held in Williams Lake, British Columbia in 2017. The workshop serves as a case study in this paper to illustrate some of the entanglements that arise in practice when considering rights-respecting and more-than-human approaches. The analysis draws on scholarship from several disciplinary locations, including Stuart Aitkens critical childhood concept of the postchild, Veronica Pacini-Ketchabaw and Affrica Taylor's notion of agency as not exclusively human and conceived as collective rather than an outcome of individual intent, and Shenila Khoja-Moolji:s analysis of an ethic of interdependency and alliance when understanding human rights in context. Each of these perspectives informs a contemplation of how to reconfigure the Shaking the Movers model amplity its strengths. The paper concludes with thoughts on the ways entanglements create a productive space both for bringing together a more-than-human and understanding how to meaningfully engage children located in interconnected and interdependent worlds.

TI  - Omission of Axillary Staging and Survival in Elderly Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
T2  - Annals of surgery open : perspectives of surgical history, education, and clinical approaches
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objectives: Determine if axillary staging is associated with survival in elderly women with breast cancer.Background: Axillary staging in women ≥ 70 years with early-stage breast cancer is controversial. Older randomized evidence has not shown axillary staging improves survival, but recent observational studies have been mixed and widespread de-implementation of the practice has not occurred.Methods: This was a population-based cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Women ≥ 70 years diagnosed with T1-T2 invasive breast cancer from 2005 to 2015 were included. Overlap propensity score weighting was used to adjust for confounders. Overall survival (OS) was determined and hazard ratios (HRs) reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was determined using competing risks analysis and subdistribution hazard ratios (sdHRs) reported. Additional adjustment was performed for receipt of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.Results: One hundred forty-four thousand three hundred twenty-nine elderly women were included, of whom 22,621 (15.7%) did not undergo axillary staging. After overlap propensity score weighting, baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 groups. Women who did not undergo axillary staging were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy (adjusted relative risk, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.54-0.62) or radiotherapy (adjusted relative risk, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.52-0.54), and had significantly worse OS (adjusted HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.25), and BCSS (adjusted sdHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08-1.21) compared to those that had staging.Conclusions: These findings suggest elderly women with early-stage breast cancer who do not undergo axillary staging experience worse outcomes. Reasons for this disparity may be multifactorial and require further investigation.

TI  - Monitoring the Water Mass Balance Variability of Small Shallow Lakes by an ERA5-Land Reanalysis and Water Level Measurement-Based Model. An Application to the Trasimeno Lake, Italy
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has a strong impact on inland water bodies such as lakes. This means that the increase in lake temperature recorded in recent decades-in Europe as well-can change the evaporation regime of the lakes. This, together with the variation of the water cycle, in particular precipitation, implies that the water mass balance of lakes may vary due to climate change. Water mass balance modeling is therefore of paramount importance to monitor lakes in the context of global warming. Although many studies have focused on such a modeling, there is no shared approach that can be used for any lake across the globe, irrespective of the size. This becomes even more problematic for shallow and small lakes, for which few studies exist. For this reason, in this paper the use of reanalysis data, in particular ERA5-Land provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), is proposed for the mass balance modeling. In fact, ERA5-Land has a global coverage and it is the only data source comprising a specific model for lakes, the Fresh-water Lake model (FLake). The chosen case study is the Trasimeno lake, a small and shallow lake located in Central Italy. The use of the reanalysis was preceded by data validation by considering both ground-based and satellite observations. The results show that there is a good agreement between the observed monthly variation of the lake level, Delta H, and the corresponding values of the water storage, delta, computed by means of the ERA5-Land data (Pearson coefficient larger than 70%). Discrepancies between observations and the ERA5-Land data happen in periods characterized in Europe by an extreme climate anomaly. This promising result encourages the use of ERA5-Land for other lakes.

TI  - Machine Learning Classification of Fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Image Data towards Mapping Fruit Plantations in Highly Heterogenous Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping smallholder fruit plantations using optical data is challenging due to morphological landscape heterogeneity and crop types having overlapping spectral signatures. Furthermore, cloud covers limit the use of optical sensing, especially in subtropical climates where they are persistent. This research assessed the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for mapping fruit trees and co-existing land-use types by using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers independently. These classifiers were also applied to fused data from the two sensors. Feature ranks were extracted using the RF mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and forward variable selection (FVS) to identify optimal spectral windows to classify fruit trees. Based on RF MDA and FVS, the SVM classifier resulted in relatively high classification accuracy with overall accuracy (OA) = 0.91.6% and kappa coefficient = 0.91% when applied to the fused satellite data. Application of SVM to S1, S2, S2 selected variables and S1S2 fusion independently produced OA = 27.64, Kappa coefficient = 0.13%; OA= 87%, Kappa coefficient = 86.89%; OA = 69.33, Kappa coefficient = 69. %; OA = 87.01%, Kappa coefficient = 87%, respectively. Results also indicated that the optimal spectral bands for fruit trees mapping are green (B3) and SWIR_2 (B10) for S2, whereas for S1, the vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization band. Including the textural metrics from the VV channel improved crop discrimination and co-existing land use cover types. The fusion approach proved robust and well suited for accurate smallholder fruit plantation mapping.

TI  - Evaluation and Prediction of Landslide Susceptibility in Yichang Section of Yangtze River Basin Based on Integrated Deep Learning Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) refers to the probability of landslide occurrence in a region under a specific geological environment and trigger conditions, which is crucial to preventing and controlling landslide risk. The mainstream of the Yangtze River in Yichang City belongs to the largest basin in the Three Gorges Reservoir area and is prone to landslides. Affected by global climate change, seismic activity, and accelerated urbanization, geological disasters such as landslide collapses and debris flows in the study area have increased significantly. Therefore, it is urgent to carry out the LSE in the Yichang section of the Yangtze River Basin. The main results are as follows: (1) Based on historical landslide catalog, geological data, geographic data, hydrological data, remote sensing data, and other multi-source spatial-temporal big data, we construct the LSE index system; (2) In this paper, unsupervised Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC) algorithm and deep integration network (Capsule Neural Network based on SENet: SE-CapNet) are used for the first time to participate in non-landslide sample selection, and LSE in the study area and the accuracy of the algorithm is 96.29; (3) Based on the constructed sensitivity model and rainfall forecast data, the main driving mechanisms of landslides in the Yangtze River Basin were revealed. In this paper, the study area's mid-long term LSE prediction and trend analysis are carried out. (4) The complete results show that the method has good performance and high precision, providing a reference for subsequent LSE, landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP), and change rule research, and providing a scientific basis for landslide disaster prevention.

TI  - Do Stroke Care Processes Modify Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Stroke-Associated Pneumonia? A Registry Cohort Study in England and Wales
T2  - CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: It is not known whether modern stroke unit care reduces the impact of stroke complications, such as stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP), on clinical outcomes. We investigated the relationship between SAP and clinical outcomes, adjusting for the confounding effects of stroke care processes and their timing. Methods: The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme provided patient data for all confirmed strokes between April 2013 and December 2018. SAP was defined as new antibiotic initiation for suspected pneumonia within the first 7 days from stroke admission. We compared outcomes after SAP versus non-SAP in appropriate multilevel mixed models. Each model was adjusted for patient and clinical characteristics, as well as markers of stroke care and their timing within the first 72 h. The appropriate effect estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Results: Of 201,778 patients, SAP was present in 14.2%. After adjustment for timing of acute stroke care processes and clinical characteristics, adverse outcomes remained for SAP versus non-SAP patients. In these adjusted analyses, patients with SAP maintained an increased risk of longer length of in-hospital stay (IRR of 1.27; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.30), increased odds of worse functional outcome at discharge (OR of 2.9; 95% CI: 2.9, 3.0), and increased risk of in-hospital mortality (HR of 1.78; 95% CI: 1.74, 1.82). Conclusion: We show for the first time that SAP remains associated with worse clinical outcomes, even after adjusting for processes of acute stroke care and their timing. These findings highlight the importance of continued research efforts aimed at preventing SAP.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic process of the wetland can reflect its impact on the environment, and finding a balance point supporting harmonious coexistence between man and nature has become an issue of increasing concern. On the basis of previous studies that have focused on local coastal wetlands, the temporal and spatial changes and driving forces of wetlands in the Yancheng coastal area from 1991 to 2021 were analyzed over a larger area. According to the study findings: (1) The results of the study of the Yancheng coastal wetland with a larger scope differed significantly from findings resulting from a study of coastal wetland only. This difference was mainly reflected in the relatively stable situation of wetland ecology as a whole, while the changes in local surface features were more significant. (2) Natural wetlands were transformed into artificial wetlands and non-wetland types, and artificial wetlands were transformed into non-wetland types; additionally, reverse transformations and internal transformations of surface features also took place. For instance, the saltpan was transformed into mudflats (86.26 km(2)), and some mudflats into herbaceous vegetation (193.47 km(2)). (3) When analyzing the impact intensity of human activities on the Yancheng wetland, it was found that this factor has experienced a process of first rising and then falling. The index was 0.650, 0.653, 0.664, 0.661, and 0.641 in 1991, 2000, 2008, 2016, and 2021, respectively. (4) Lastly, an analysis of factors driving wetland change revealed that human factors were the most critical reasons for wetland landscape change. Our work can play a reference and inspiration role in the monitoring and protection of similar coastal wetlands.

TI  - Comparison of Methods for Reconstructing MODIS Land Surface Temperature under Cloudy Conditions
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a vital parameter associated with the land-atmosphere interface. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product can provide precise LST with high time resolution, and is widely applied in various remote sensing temperature research. However, due to its inability to penetrate the cloud and fog, its quality is not able to meet the requirements of actual research. Hence, obtaining continuous and cloudless MODIS LST datasets remains challenging for researchers. The critical point is to reconstruct missing pixels. To compare the performance of different methods, first, three kinds of methods were used to reconstruct the missing pixels, namely, temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal methods. The predicted values using these methods were validated by the automatic weather system data (AWS) in the Heihe river basin of China. The results demonstrated that, compared with other methods, linear temporal interpolation using Aqua data had the best performance in MODIS LST reconstruction in the Heihe river basin, with an RMSE of 7.13 K and an R-2 of 0.82, and the NSE and PBias were 0.78 and -0.76%, respectively. Furthermore, the interpolation method was improved using adaptive windows and robust regression. First, the international Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) classification was employed to distinguish the different land surface types. Then, the invalid LST values were reconstructed using adjacent days' effective LST values combined with a robust regression. Finally, a mean filter was applied to eliminate outliers. The overall results combined with ERA5 data were validated by AWS, with an RMSE of 6.96 K and an R-2 of 0.79 and the NSE and PBias were 0.77 and -0.20%, respectively. The validation demonstrated that the scheme proposed in this paper is able to accurately reconstruct the missing values and improve the accuracy of the interpolation method to a certain extent when reconstructing MODIS LST.

TI  - Enhanced Automatic Identification of Urban Community Green Space Based on Semantic Segmentation
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - At the neighborhood scale, recognizing urban community green space (UCGS) is important for residential living condition assessment and urban planning. However, current studies have embodied two key issues. Firstly, existing studies have focused on large geographic scales, mixing urban and rural areas, neglecting the accuracy of green space contours at fine geographic scales. Secondly, the green spaces covered by shadows often suffer misclassification. To address these issues, we created a neighborhood-scale urban community green space (UCGS) dataset and proposed a segmentation decoder for HRNet backbone with two auxiliary decoders. Our proposed model adds two additional branches to the low-resolution representations to improve their discriminative ability, thus enhancing the overall performance when the high- and low-resolution representations are fused. To evaluate the performance of the model, we tested it on a dataset that includes satellite images of Shanghai, China. The model outperformed the other nine models in UCGS extraction, with a precision of 83.01, recall of 85.69, IoU of 72.91, F1-score of 84.33, and OA of 89.31. Our model also improved the integrity of the identification of shaded green spaces over HRNetV2. The proposed method could offer a useful tool for efficient UCGS detection and mapping in urban planning.

TI  - Fire Monitoring Algorithm and Its Application on the Geo-Kompsat-2A Geostationary Meteorological Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geo-Kompsat-2A (GK-2A) is the third new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite that orbits Asia and monitors China and its surrounding areas, following the Himawari-8 and Fengyun-4A satellites. The nadir point positioning and satellite channel parameters of the GK-2A are better than those of the Himawari-8 and FY-4A, which are more conducive to fire monitoring in China. In this study, a new fire detection algorithm is proposed based on GK-2A satellite data. That is, considering the large solar zenith angle correction for reflectance and the proportion information of background pixels in the existing spatial threshold method, fires under the different underlying surface types and solar radiation states can be automatically identified. Moreover, the accuracy of the Himawari-8 fire monitoring algorithm and the present algorithm of GK-2A is compared and analyzed through the ground truth fire spot data. The results show that compared with the original fire monitoring algorithm with fixed parameter thresholds, the brightness temperature difference of this algorithm is reduced by 0.55 K, and the correction coefficient is reduced by 0.6 times, the fire can be found earlier, and the monitoring sensitivity is improved. According to the practical fire case, the present fire monitoring algorithm of GK-2A has better monitoring accuracy than the fire monitoring algorithm of Himawari-8. The present fire monitoring algorithm of GK-2A can meet the fire monitoring requirements under different sun angles, different cloud cover ratios and vegetation ratios with good versatility.

TI  - Improved Object-Based Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass by Integrating LiDAR Data from GEDI and ICESat-2 with Multi-Sensor Images in a Heterogeneous Mountainous Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and effective mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in heterogeneous mountainous regions is a huge challenge but an urgent demand for resource managements and carbon storage monitoring. Conventional studies have related the plot-measured or LiDAR-based biomass to remote sensing data using pixel-based approaches. The object-based relationship between AGB and multi-source data from LiDAR, multi-frequency radar, and optical sensors were insufficiently studied. It deserves the further exploration that maps forest AGB using the object-based approach and combines LiDAR data with multi-sensor images, which has the smaller uncertainty of positional discrepancy and local heterogeneity, in heterogeneous mountainous regions. To address the improvement of mapping accuracy, satellite LiDAR data from GEDI and ICEsat-2, and images of ALOS-2 yearly mosaic L band SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-1 C band SAR, Sentinel-2 MSI, and ALOS-1 DSM were combined for pixel- and object-based forest AGB mapping in a vital heterogeneous mountainous forest. For the object-based approach, optimized objects during a multiresolution segmentation were acquired by the ESP (Estimation of the Scale Parameter) tool, and suitable predictors were selected using an algorithm named VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forests). The LiDAR variables at the footprint-level were extracted to connect field plots to the multi-sensor objects as a linear bridge. It was shown that forests' AGB values varied by elevations with a mean value of 142.58 Mg/ha, ranging from 12.61 to 514.28 Mg/ha. The north slope with the lowest elevation (<1100 m) had the largest mean AGB, while the smallest mean AGB was located in the south slope with the altitude above 2000 m. Using independent validation samples, it was indicated by the accuracy comparison that the object-based approach performed better on the precision with relative improvement based on root-mean-square errors (RIRMSE) of 4.46%. The object-based approach also selected more optimized predictors and markedly decreased the prediction time than the pixel-based analysis. Canopy cover and height explained forest AGB with their effects on biomass varying according to the elevation. The elevation from DSM and variables involved in red-edge bands from MSI were the most contributive predictors in heterogeneous temperate forests. This study is a pioneering exploration of object-based AGB mapping by combining satellite data from LiDAR, MSI, and SAR, which offers an improved methodology for regional carbon mapping in the heterogeneous mountainous forests.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of oasis dynamics in China's drylands between 1987 and 2017
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oases are among the most productive and vulnerable ecosystems on drylands as well as central areas of human life and economic development. In China, oasis expansion and degradation are directly related to the survival and development of tens of millions of inhabitants who live within them, profoundly affecting human well-being. However, our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of China's oases has been limited. This creates a challenge to accurately assess the environmental impacts of oasis dynamics and sustainable oasis development. Here we analyzed Landsat images (5 TM, 7 ETM+, and 8 OIL, similar to 61 900 images) over the period 1987-2017, and we produced annual maps of China's oases (30 m spatial resolution) using trajectories and spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm (LandTrendr) and machine-learning methods (Random Forest). We found that oasis areas increased significantly between 1987 and 2017 (+8.82 Mha). Grasslands and croplands expanded the most, and reclamation of deserts and grasslands made cropland the largest gainer. At the provincial scale, oasis expansion in Inner Mongolia and Qinghai was mainly attributed to grassland restoration. In Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia, reclamation of croplands was also an important factor in addition to grassland restoration. With the expansion of the oasis similar to 73.36% of areas showed decreasing trends of soil moisture, and even desertification in some areas. The overexpansion of oases might cause a great challenge to regional water security. Our dataset and results can provide a basis for identifying trade-off areas/regions between development benefits and environmental impacts, helping policymakers to identify high-priority areas for intervention and reasonably plan land-use spatial structure in oasis areas for sustainable development of oases.

TI  - Two-Stepwise Hierarchical Adaptive Threshold Method for Automatic Rapeseed Mapping over Jiangsu Using Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapeseed distribution mapping is a crucial issue for food and oil security, entertainment, and tourism development. Previous studies have used various remote sensing approaches to map rapeseed. However, the time-consuming and labor-intensive sample data used in these supervised classification methods greatly limit the development of large-scale mapping in rapeseed studies. Regarding threshold methods, some empirical thresholding methods still need sample data to select the optimal threshold value, and their accuracies decrease when a fixed threshold is applied in complex and diverse environments. This study first developed the Normalized Difference Rapeseed Index (NDRI), defined as the difference in green and short-wave infrared bands divided by their sum, to find a suitable feature to distinguish rapeseed from other types of crops. Next, a two-stepwise hierarchical adaptive thresholding (THAT) algorithm requiring no training data was used to automatically extract rapeseed in Xinghua. Finally, two adaptive thresholding methods of the standalone Otsu and Otsu with Canny Edge Detection (OCED) were used to extract rapeseed across Jiangsu province. The results show that (1) NDRI can separate rapeseed from other vegetation well; (2) the OCED-THAT method can accurately map rapeseed in Jiangsu with an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.9559 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8569, and it performed better than the Otsu-THAT method; (3) the OCED-THAT method had a lower but acceptable accuracy than the Random Forest method (OA = 0.9806 and Kappa = 0.9391). This study indicates that the THAT model is a promising automatic method for mapping rapeseed.

TI  - Elastic and Inelastic Ground Deformation in Shanghai Lingang Area Revealed by Sentinel-1, Leveling, and Groundwater Level Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shanghai Lingang New City, located in the southeast corner of Shanghai, was constructed by land reclamation from 2002 to 2005, in an area where the geological structure is prone to subsidence over time. Firstly, we explore the spatio-temporal pattern of ground subsidence and its mechanism using the Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique by processing 50 scenes of Sentinel-1A images acquired from May 2016 to May 2018. In order to assess the accuracy of PSInSAR derived deformation, we collect the first-class leveling data at two benchmarks located in the study area; the comparison between the two settlement indicates that the maximum difference is 1.93 mm and 2.9 mm, respectively, which validates the PSInSAR's high accuracy. We then obtain the skeleton release coefficients by the joint analysis of PSInSAR measurements and groundwater level data. Finally, we find that this coastal area has undergone both elastic and inelastic deformation from 2016 to 2018. The outcome shows that the combination of different techniques is conductive to understand the deformation mechanism of the aquifer system in these coastal areas, which is expected to be a valuable reference for ground subsidence monitoring and groundwater extraction management.

TI  - Extraction of Photovoltaic Plants Using Machine Learning Methods: A Case Study of the Pilot Energy City of Golmud, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy is an abundant, clean, and renewable source that can mitigate global climate change, environmental pollution, and energy shortage. However, comprehensive datasets and efficient identification models for the spatial distribution of photovoltaic (PV) plants locally and globally over time remain limited. In the present study, a model that combines original spectral features, PV extraction indexes, and terrain features for the identification of PV plants is established based on the pilot energy city Golmud in China, which covers 71,298.7 km(2) and has the highest density of PV plants in the world. High-performance machine learning algorithms were integrated with PV plant extraction models, and performances of the XGBoost, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were compared. According to results from the investigations, the XGBoost produced the highest accuracy (OA = 99.65%, F1score = 0.9631) using Landsat 8 OLI imagery. The total area occupied by PV plants in Golmud City in 2020 was 10,715.85 ha based on the optimum model. The model also revealed that the area covered by the PV plant park in the east of Golmud City increased by approximately 10% from 2018 (5344.2 ha) to 2020 (5879.34 ha). The proposed approach in this study is one of the first attempts to identify time-series large-scale PV plants based on a pixel-based machine learning algorithm with medium-resolution free images in an efficient way. The study also confirmed the effectiveness of combining original spectral features, PV extraction indexes, and terrain features for the identification of PV plants. It will shed light on larger- and longer-scale identification of PV plants around the world and the evaluation of the associated dynamics of PV plants.

TI  - Assessing the Spatio-Temporal Pattern and Development Characteristics of Regional Ecological Resources for Sustainable Development: A Case Study on Guizhou Province, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development is a common challenge for all global economies, and the assessment of the spatial distribution and development process of ecological resources is the basis of sustainable development. Considering the heterogeneity of regional ecological resource endowment, it is necessary to conduct a targeted assessment for different regions. In this study, we selected Guizhou Province, which is rich in ecological resources, but has a fragile environment, as our study area, and cultivated land, woodland, grassland, and water resources were selected as critical evaluation indicators. Notably, we applied Kernel density analysis methods, based on the remote sensing data of 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, to explore the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and evolution pattern of regional ecological resources. The results indicated that the evolution of ecological resource development in Guizhou could be divided into three phases: degenerative (2000-2005), recovery (2005-2015), and development (2015-2020). The spatial distribution of Guizhou's ecological resource was shown to be heterogeneous in the north and south and more homogeneous in the middle regions. Guizhou has diverse land-use types, with obvious regional differences in land-use structure. Notably, even though the development of ecological resources in Guizhou has improved, the development and utilization degree of ecological resources is still low, and the ecological damage is serious. This study can be used as a scientific reference by policymakers and decisionmakers to develop new regulations for ecological resources protection and sustainable development in China. We suggest that different regions should adopt more detailed measures; particularly, it is important to establish a spatial governance system to promote ecological resources development in the context of local conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - School manuals have special place among the socio-cultural acquisition of the past, which are the kind of reflection of certain era, the level of knowledge, worldview and prevailing stereotypes in the field of education. The manual is a carrier of the content of education, definitions, storage of knowledge and methods of learning that is necessary in this society. The complexity of the manual, the richness of its types, structure, diversity of its content and functions define it as a valuable historical document, the research of which provides opportunities to study the features and patterns of development and formation of the manual in different historical periods and using modern manuals. The research of the history of school manual development begins with the establishment by scientists the fact of the manual origin, which historians associate with clay tablets on which the Sumerians placed manuals five thousand years ago. The formation of the pedagogical theory of the manual is associated with the idea that the manual was first defined as a special book created on the basis of pedagogical principles as one that implements a certain content of education.

TI  - Covid-19 Lockdown in Italy as a Potential Transformative Experience: A Pilot Study
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformation can be deemed as a process composed of specific emotional (e.g., awe) and cognitive components (worldview and mental schema) interacting together to trigger impactful experiences of transformation (TE). Several theories posited that one trigger of transformation can be something able to violate people's current worldview. In Italy, the lockdown - requested by the Government to limit the consequences of pandemic - represented an unprecedented experience for Italian citizens. Although COVID-19 home confinement significantly impacted psychosocial wellbeing and encouraged the adoption of new communication technologies to overcome lockdown loneliness, no difference emerged in relation to lockdown intensity. However, the potential transformative impact of this event has not been tested yet. In this study, we measured fluctuations of nine healthy Italian people's cognitive worldview and personality traits, as well as their disposition to live the complex emotion of awe in three timeframes (i.e., at the beginning of Italian Lockdown period, at the end, and one month after the end of the lockdown). No significant changes emerged from data analyses, thus suggesting that, despite the potential impact of this worldwide event, people's stable worldview, personality factors, and complex emotion dispositions persisted, at least, immediately after the first lockdown period.

TI  - INFERENCE FOR STOCHASTIC KINETIC MODELS FROM MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES FOR JOINT ESTIMATION OF INFECTION DYNAMICS FROM AGGREGATE REPORTS AND VIROLOGICAL DATA
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Before the current pandemic, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the leading etiological agents of seasonal acute respiratory infections (ARI) around the world. In this setting, medical doctors typically based the diagnosis of ARI on patients' symptoms alone and did not routinely conduct virological tests necessary to identify individual viruses, limiting the ability to study the interaction between multiple pathogens and to make public health recommendations. We consider a stochastic kinetic model (SKM) for two interacting ARI pathogens circulating in a large population and an empirically-motivated background process for infections with other pathogens causing similar symptoms. An extended marginal sampling approach, based on the linear noise approximation to the SKM, integrates multiple data sources and additional model components. We infer the parameters defining the pathogens' dynamics and interaction within a Bayesian model and explore the posterior trajectories of infections for each illness based on aggregate infection reports from six epidemic seasons collected by the state health department and a subset of virological tests from a sentinel program at a general hospital in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. We interpret the results and make recommendations for future data collection strategies.

TI  - Category II Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate Patterns Unassociated With Recognized Sentinel Events Castles in the Air
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of continuous electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring has presented the obstetrician with a critical clinical conundrum: basic science observations suggest that such monitoring might be associated with improved long-term neurologic outcomes, yet, after a half century of use and millions of cesarean deliveries based on FHR monitoring, evidence for such improvement remains absent. This dichotomy appears to be related to widespread misconceptions regarding the physiology underlying various FHR patterns and the developmental origins of cerebral palsy. These misconceptions are strengthened by a reliance on anecdotal experience and tradition in lieu of evidence-based medicine, the confusing "category II" FHR designation, medical-legal considerations, and our tendency to view fetal monitoring, as originally conceptualized, as a single, indivisible entity whose concepts must be accepted or rejected en bloc. Ill-defined and largely imaginary conditions such as "depletion of fetal reserve" are particularly harmful and their use in clinical medicine uniquely not evidence based. A solution to this self-inflicted injury to our specialty will require a concerted effort involving teachers, authors, and researchers.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node melanoma metastases: Assessment of tumor burden for clinical prediction of outcome in the first Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-I)
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: As clinical management decisions in patients with Stage III melanoma have become more complex, precise pathologic characterization of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases has become critical to guide management. The extent of SLN involvement correlates with risk of adverse outcomes, but reported methods of disease quantification vary. We examined SLN metastases from patients participating in an international clinical trial and compared several methods of tumor burden quantification.Methods: SLNs from 146 node-positive patients in the first Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-I) were centrally-reviewed and characterized by number of tumor-positive nodes, percent nodal area tumor replacement, maximum dimension of largest metastasis, tumor penetrative depth, number of tumor foci, metastasis microanatomic location, and extracapsular extension. These data were analyzed for correlation with non-SLN metastasis and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).Results: The median number of tumor-involved SLNs was 1. The median maximum metastasis dimension was 1.11 mm. Median SLN area involvement was 1.5%. Tumor burden measures were highly correlated with each other. Factors associated with non-SLN metastasis by univariable analysis were primary tumor ulceration and extent of metastases. Tumor thickness, ulceration, non-SLN metastasis and multiple measures of SLN tumor burden were significantly related to MSS on univariable analysis. After multivariable adjustment, number of involved SLNs (p = 0.05) and percent nodal area tumor replacement (p = 0.02) were independent predictors of MSS.Conclusion: Central review of MSLT-I pathology indicates that primary tumor and SLN tumor characteristics predict non-SLN metastasis and MSS. Percent nodal involvement was more powerfully prognostic than the more commonly used maximum dimension of largest metastasis.

TI  - Estimating Productivity Measures in Guayule Using UAS Imagery and Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) is a perennial desert shrub currently under investigation as a viable commercial alternative to the Para rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), the traditional source of natural rubber. Previous studies on guayule have shown a close association between morphological traits or biomass and rubber content. We collected multispectral and RGB-derived Structure-from-motion (SfM) data using an unmanned aircraft system (UAS; drone) to determine if incorporating both high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an indicator of plant health) and canopy height (CH) information could support model predictions of crop productivity. Ground-truth resource allocation in guayule was measured at four elevations (i.e., tiers) along the crop's vertical profile using both traditional biomass measurement techniques and a novel volumetric measurement technique. Multiple linear regression models estimating fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), fresh volume (FV), fresh-weight-density (FWD), and dry-weight-density (DWD) were developed and their performance compared. Of the crop productivity measures considered, a model predicting FWD (i.e., the fresh weight of plant material adjusted by its freshly harvested volume) and incorporating NDVI, CH, NDVI:CH interaction, and tier parameters reported the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between field measurements and predictions, ranging from 9 to 13%. A reduced FWD model incorporating only NDVI and tier parameters was developed to explore the scalability of model predictions to medium spatial resolutions with Sentinel-2 satellite data. Across all UAS surveys and corresponding satellite imagery compared, MAPE between FWD model predictions for UAS and satellite data were below 3% irrespective of soil pixel influence.

TI  - A Conventional Cruise and Felled-Tree Validation of Individual Tree Diameter, Height and Volume Derived from Airborne Laser Scanning Data of a Loblolly Pine (<i>P. taeda</i>) Stand in Eastern Texas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, remotely sensed data and, in particular, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), are being assessed by the forestry industry for their ability to acquire accurate forest inventories at an individual-tree level. This pilot study compares an inventory derived using the ForestView (R) biometrics analysis system to traditional cruise measurements and felled tree measurements for 139 Pinus taeda sp. (loblolly pine) trees in eastern Texas. The Individual Tree Detection (ITD) accuracy of ForestView (R) was 97.1%. In terms of tree height accuracy, ForestView (R) results had an overall lower mean bias and RMSE than the traditional cruise techniques when both datasets were compared to the felled tree data (LiDAR: mean bias = 1.1 cm, RMSE = 41.2 cm; Cruise: mean bias = 13.8 cm, RMSE = 57.5 cm). No significant difference in mean tree height was observed between the felled tree, cruise, and LiDAR measurements (p-value = 0.58). ForestView-derived DBH exhibited a -2.1 cm bias compared to felled-tree measurements. This study demonstrates the utility of this newly emerging ITD software as an approach to characterize forest structure on similar coniferous forests landscapes.

TI  - Estimating COVID-19 Hospitalizations in the United States With Surveillance Data Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model: Modeling Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the United States, COVID-19 is a nationally notifiable disease, meaning cases and hospitalizations are reported by states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Identifying and reporting every case from every facility in the United States may not be feasible in the long term. Creating sustainable methods for estimating the burden of COVID-19 from established sentinel surveillance systems is becoming more important.Objective: We aimed to provide a method leveraging surveillance data to create a long-term solution to estimate monthly rates of hospitalizations for COVID-19.Methods: We estimated monthly hospitalization rates for COVID-19 from May 2020 through April 2021 for the 50 states using surveillance data from the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) and a Bayesian hierarchical model for extrapolation. Hospitalization rates were calculated from patients hospitalized with a lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test during or within 14 days before admission. We created a model for 6 age groups (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84, and >= 85 years) separately. We identified covariates from multiple data sources that varied by age, state, and month and performed covariate selection for each age group based on 2 methods, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and spike and slab selection methods. We validated our method by checking the sensitivity of model estimates to covariate selection and model extrapolation as well as comparing our results to external data.Results: We estimated 3,583,100 (90% credible interval [CrI] 3,250,500-3,945,400) hospitalizations for a cumulative incidence of 1093.9 (992.4-1204.6) hospitalizations per 100,000 population with COVID-19 in the United States from May 2020 through April 2021. Cumulative incidence varied from 359 to 1856 per 100,000 between states. The age group with the highest cumulative incidence was those aged ???85 years (5575.6; 90% CrI 5066.4-6133.7). The monthly hospitalization rate was highest in December (183.7; 90% CrI 154.3-217.4). Our monthly estimates by state showed variations in magnitudes of peak rates, number of peaks, and timing of peaks between states.Conclusions: Our novel approach to estimate hospitalizations for COVID-19 has potential to provide sustainable estimates for monitoring COVID-19 burden as well as a flexible framework leveraging surveillance data.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variation of vegetation water use efficiency and its relationship with climate factors over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is an effective indicator to study the coupling of terrestrial carbon and water cycles. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the most important ecological security barrier in my country. Understanding the characteristics and changing mechanisms of WUE is of great significance for the study of carbon and water cycles in plateau ecosystems and the rational use of water resources. . Based on the gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), data of MODIS, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of WUE on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the impact of climate factors on WUE. The results showed that from 2001 to 2020, under the combined effect of GPP and ET, the WUE of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau showed an upward trend; the areas with higher average WUE values were in the southeastern and northeastern parts of the plateau, and the low-value area was in the middle of the plateau. The WUE of grassland, swamp and alpine vegetation showed an increasing trend, while the shrub, broad-leaved forest and coniferous forest showed a decreasing trend. There is a significant positive correlation between WUE and annual mean temperature, and the sensitivity increases with the increase of temperature; WUE has a nonlinear relationship with annual precipitation. When the precipitation is less than 700 mm, the sensitivity of WUE to precipitation decreases with the increase of precipitation. , the precipitation is greater than 700 mm, and the precipitation sensitivity increases with the increase of precipitation. More than 75% of the area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has a negative correlation between WUE and precipitation. Compared with air temperature, the area of WUE affected by precipitation is larger, and future climate warming and humidification will lead to a decrease in WUE.

TI  - Assessing potential impacts of sea level rise on mangrove ecosystems in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) due to global climate change negatively impacts coastal zones, in particular wetland and mangrove ecosystems. Mangroves in the Mekong Delta (MD) in Vietnam provide critical ecosystem services in the region; however, escalated relative SLR is likely to affect all ecosystems in the region, with mangroves probably more vulnerable than others. Given the fact that documented information and studies on SLR impacts on mangroves are limited for the region, this study aims to investigate potential changes in mangrove distribution in response to future SLR scenarios in the coastal area in the south of the MD using the Sea Level Affects Marshes Model (SLAMM). Wetland maps for 2013 derived from Landsat 8 OLI sensor, digital elevation model (DEM), and localized site-specific parameters (i.e., subsidence/accretion, erosion, historic trend of SLR, and over-wash) were used as input for the SLAMM to simulate spatial distribution of mangroves under different relative SLR scenarios (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5, more extreme SLR), and surface elevation change (i.e., subsidence, stable, and accretion) scenarios by the year 2100. Simulation results show that the average annual mangrove losses are likely to be 0.54% and 0.22% for subsidence and stable scenarios, respectively. The findings demonstrate the considerable impacts of SLR on MD mangrove ecosystems and the strong influence of subsidence processes. Inundation was also identified as a main driver responsible for the mangrove loss by the end of this century. Our results are in agreement with findings of other studies at global scales and observed data at regional scales. The results also demonstrate the potential of the approach developed herein for simulating mangrove dynamics under future relative SLR scenarios in the region with acceptable accuracy. The findings from the present study are useful sources for development of proper strategies for minimizing the impacts of SLR on mangrove ecosystems and their vital associated services, to protect and conserve the mangrove ecosystems in the region.

TI  - Radial-Concentric Structures in the Basement of an Ancient Craton and Formation Conditions of Hydrocarbon Kitchens: Reconstruction from Seismotectonic Data
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the identification of hydrocarbon generation foci (hydrocarbon kitchens) by state-of-the-art methods has been carried out. Radial-concentric structures in the basement of the East European Craton as potential hydrocarbon kitchens are discussed. The seismic geological signs and the tectonic setting of their inception and development were studied with reference to the southwestern part of Orenburg oblast. The article presents an interpretation of the time sections of regional seismic profiles shot in the study area using the method of successive approximations and detailing, as well as the results of analysis of geological-geophysical and remote sensing data. It was established that flower structures are present in the time sections of seismic profiles shot in the areas of geodynamically active hydrocarbon kitchens in the sedimentary cover. The Lower Permian salt of the Kungurian Stage forms large domes above hydrocarbon accumulations (the area of the East Orenburg geodynamically active hydrocarbon kitchen and oil and gas fields within the Cis-Uralian Foredeep and its junction with the East European Craton) or are upthrown within fault blocks (the area of the West Orenburg geodynamically active kitchen, oil and gas fields of the Sol-Iletsk arch). A chaotic, subvertically oriented, locally enhanced seismic record, which extends beneath the reflector, interpreted as the roof of basement rocks, has been noted below the roof of Devonian deposits within the areal extent of hydrocarbon pools. A sketch map of the basement fault network genetically related to neotectonic shear was compiled based on structural constructions, taking the configuration of hydrocarbon fields into account. The known hydrocarbon fields and structures identified by seismic surveys have a regular distribution inside four large radial-concentric structures. The constructions are confirmed by modern geotectonic process monitoring and interpretation of satellite image data. We assume that the centers of the structures are geodynamically active hydrocarbon kitchens and that hydrocarbon migration takes place along radial and concentric fault zones. By analogy with the Orenburg tectonic node, a few other large hydrocarbon accumulation centers have been identified, in which further oil and gas prospecting and exploration operations are advisable.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vulnerability of SLR varies from place to place with 20(th) century observing greatest threat to it. Mangroves along the shore are the one to first sustain this impact of SLR. In the present study, an attempt has been made to understand the relation between shoreline changes with mangrove habitat through remote sensing data and geospatial technique. Shoreline change rate has been calculated for the years 2000, 2012 and 2019, in Digital Shoreline Analysis System by End Point Rate. Change analysis indicates that in last 20 years erosion dominated the study area with an average rate of -0.02m/yr. During 2000 to 2012, relatively higher erosional rates (-0.35m/yr) were observed. While from 2012 to 2019 accretion process dominated this area with a rate of 0.43m/yr. Sonakothakar, Mothe Bhal and Dadar with denudation, have observed landward progradation of mangroves whereas, at Aware, a zone of accretion exhibited a seaward progradation of mangroves. A direct relation with the shoreline change has been observed with mangrove habitat. Mangroves are consider as salt feeder and so spatial changes in their colony is ought to be frequent in the present context of climate change and SLR. This type of integrated study will help to understand active process over the shore and help to conserve mangrove habitat. Such regional scale studies should be carried out before implementing any coastal conservation projects.

TI  - Analysing the change in water quality parameters along river Ganga at Varanasi, Mirzapur and Ghazipur using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data during pre-lockdown, lockdown and post-lockdown associated with COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper functioning of the river ecosystem has been symbolised by healthy aquatic life. The river Ganga has shown signs of rejuvenation due to lockdown. In this study, an attempt has been made to analyse the change in river water quality using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imageries. The quantitative analysis has been performed for temperature and normalised difference turbidity index (NDTI). The qualitative analysis has been performed for pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and total suspended solids (TSSs). Ghazipur, Varanasi and Mirzapur stretches have been selected for this study. In the Ghazipur stretch, the river temperature decreased by 7.14% in May 2020 (lockdown period) as compared to May 2019 (1 year before lockdown). Similarly, in the Varanasi stretch, this decrease has been by 8.62%, and in the Mirzapur stretch, this decrease has been by 12.06% in May 2020 compared to May 2019. For the same period, NDTI in the Ghazipur, Varanasi and Mirzapur stretch has been decreased by 0.22, 0.26 and 0.24, respectively. The pH and DO of the river increased, and TSS decreased for the considered time period. The lockdown during the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 was not helpful for river rejuvenation. This study elicited how the behaviour of the parameters changed during the lockdown.

TI  - Microbial uptake in oral mucosa-draining lymph nodes leads to rapid release of cytotoxic CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells lacking a gut-homing phenotype
T2  - SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract constitutes an essential barrier against ingested microbes, including potential pathogens. Although immune reactions are well studied in the lower GI tract, it remains unclear how adaptive immune responses are initiated during microbial challenge of the oral mucosa (OM), the primary site of microbial encounter in the upper GI tract. Here, we identify mandibular lymph nodes (mandLNs) as sentinel lymphoid organs that intercept ingested Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Oral Lm uptake led to local activation and release of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells that constituted most of the early circulating effector T cell (T-EFF) pool. MandLN-primed T-EFF disseminated to lymphoid organs, lung, and OM and contributed substantially to rapid elimination of target cells. In contrast to CD8(+) T EFF generated in mesenteric LN (MLN) during intragastric infection, mandLN-primed T(EFF)( )lacked a gut-seeking phenotype, which correlated with low expression of enzymes required for gut-homing imprinting by mandLN stromal and dendritic cells. Accordingly, mandLN-primed T-EFF decreased Lm burden in spleen but not MLN after intestinal infection. Our findings extend the concept of regional specialization of immune responses along the length of the GI tract, with CD8(+) T-EFF generated in the upper GI tract displaying homing profiles that differ from those imprinted by lymphoid tissue of the lower GI tract.

TI  - Praying Soldiers: How Continental Soldiers Experienced Religion during the Revolutionary War, 1775-1783
T2  - EARLY AMERICAN STUDIES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - While enduring the hardships of battle, many Revolutionary War soldiers recorded more about their personal religious lives than perhaps any other single topic. New and extreme circumstances tested the religious preconceptions of those who enlisted in ways that they had rarely encountered in civilian life. Their religion took on new importance for them as soldiers relied on it both as an interpretive lens and as a source of stability amid a chaotic war. This article examines how the exigencies of the Revolutionary War affected the religious lives of Whig soldiers across denominations and colonies. It will argue that ordinary soldiers' religious worldview caused them to interpret the war in ways distinct from that of their ministers and commanding officers, who have often overshadowed them in analyses of the Revolutionary movement. Neither wholly political nor militaristic, the war, for many soldiers, was a formative religious experience.

TI  - Seasonal effect on biomarker responses in sentinel species: innovation in mangrove conservation status assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the environmental quality in mangrove areas of the Western Atlantic with different levels and history of contamination, considering biomarkers for the crab Ucides cordatus. For this purpose, specimens were collected in two climatic seasons (rainy and dry seasons) and assays of genotoxicity (MN, micronucleus), cytotoxicity (NRRT, neutral red retention time) and biochemical (MT, metallothionein; and LPO, lipoperoxidation) were conducted. In the most impacted mangroves, there was an increase in the mean of micronucleus (frequency of MN/1000), which was associated with a shorter retention time (minutes of NRRT). In contrast, the most pristine areas showed MN < 3 and NRRT < 100 min, with no seasonal effect, indicating a lower effect of degenerative processes by xenobiotics. The rainy season was more harmful, especially regarding cytogenotoxicity. The use of bioindicator species for environmental monitoring should be guided by an analysis of biomarkers considering the season, because during the period of highest rainfall, biomarkers values can change.

TI  - Surface Reflectance-Derived Spectral Indices for Drought Detection: Application to the Guadalupe Valley Basin, Baja California, Mexico
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating how meteorological drought affects areas covered by natural ecosystems is challenging due to the lack of ground-based climate data, historical records, and weather station observation with limited coverage. This research tests how the surface reflectance-derived indices (SRDI) may solve this problem by assessing the condition and vegetation dynamics. We use long-term, monthly surface reflectance data (26 hydrological years, 1992/93-2017/18) from Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, and 8 OLI/TIRS satellites and calculated the following five SRDI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI). The SRDI allows us to detect, classify, and quantify the area affected by drought in the Guadalupe Valley Basin (GVB) via correlations with the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (weather station-based data). For particular SRDI-RDI and SRDI-SPI combinations, we find positive seasonal correlations during April-May (IS2) and for annual (AN) values (MSAVI IS2-RDI AN, R = 0.90; NDWI IS2-SPI AN, R = 0.89; VHI AN-RDI AN, R = 0.86). The drought-affected GVB area accounted for >87% during 2001/02, 2006/07, 2013/14, and 2017/18. MSAVI and NDWI are the best meteorological drought indicators in this region, and their application minimizes the dependence on the availability of climatic data series.

T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Neural angiostrongyliasis is an emerging zoonosis caused by the rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis. In humans, infection with this nematode often results in eosinophilic meningitis and other severe disorders of the central nervous system. Europe was deemed a nonendemic region until 2018, when A. cantonensis worms were detected on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, Spain, a tourism hotspot. Since that time, a sentinel surveillance system and a molecular approach have been used to follow the invasion path of the rat lungworm on the island. A. cantonensis worms have been found in animals from 8 locations on the island over 3 consecutive years. Our preliminary results show a recognizable pattern of clinical signs in infected hedgehogs and a single mitochondrial haplotype circulating in Mallorca. We present strong evidence confirming that the rat lungworm has successfully established and colonized an island in Europe and discuss observations and possible strategies for its early detection across continental Europe.

TI  - Global Development of the Supersubstorm of May 28, 2011
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper gives an analysis of the isolated supersubstorm observed during the main phase of the moderate magnetic storm on May 28, 2011 (SYM/H similar to -95 nT), which was caused by the solar wind magnetic cloud. This supersubstorm peaked at around similar to 0850 UT (SML = similar to -2600 nT). The study was based on data from the global SuperMAG and IMAGE magnetometer networks and satellite data from the AMPERE project. Like those in other supersubstorms, the ionospheric currents in this event were found to develop on a global scale: an intense and extended westward electrojet (with a maximum around midnight) was observed in the midnight, morning, and daytime sectors and an intense eastward electrojet was observed in the afternoon and evening sectors. The development of global currents was accompanied by intense positive bays. This was reflected by large values of the MPB index (similar to 4000 nT(2)). It has been shown that, during the peak development of the supersubstorm, there was a significant increase in the eastward electrojet in the evening sector (similar to 15-18 MLT), an additional affluent longitudinal electric current, and an additional ring current that appeared concurrently in this sector. These facts suggest the hypothesis about the development of an additional substorm current wedge that appeared on the evening side during the supersubstorm and closed on the eastward electrojet.

TI  - Time series SAR interferometry approach for landslide identification in mountainous areas of Western Ghats, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of Earth's surface processes is efficiently performed by Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) techniques with the availability of open access Copernicus Sentinel-1A and 1B SAR data products having 6 days temporal resolution. With over 750 landslides triggered in Kodagu district, Karnataka, India, interferometric wide swath (IW) mode Sentinel-1 datasets are used to identify landslide locations. Interferograms from DInSAR obtained using Sentinel-1 VV polarization data are corrected using zenith total delay (ZTD) maps obtained from GACOS, which successfully assisted to identify major landslides in the study area. Sentinel-1 DInSAR analysis has limitations over dense vegetative regions and terrain conditions (particularly in mountainous regions) due to spatial and temporal decorrelation. With the aid of InSAR time series analysis, integration of deformation recognized and land use/land cover pattern helps experts in providing near real-time mitigation measures during a disaster event.

TI  - Automatic extraction and analysis of lineament features using ASTER and Sentinel 1 SAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, automatic lineament extraction has gained huge popularity as it circumvents the issues such as errors and time constraints associated with manual extraction procedure. Another impediment in the lineament extraction process is that linear features existing near sub-surface or occluded due to vegetation cover cannot be identified solely by optical data. To mitigate these issues, a multi-sensor fusion-based automatic extraction process using EO-based optical and SAR data is proposed. Use of moderate resolution optical data such as ASTER minimizes erroneous identification and misclassification of anthropogenic features as geological features. In addition to this, a component loading-based band selection approach is proposed to select the most informative bands from the available optical bands for improved extraction of lineament features. Finally, a new HSV-based mapping method for visualization and directional analysis of the extracted linear features is discussed. The results are validated using the published seismo-tectonic map of the region and field investigation studies which corroborates that the proposed algorithm can successfully extract most of the geological lineaments in the study area with minimum errors.

TI  - The Outburst of a Lake and Its Impacts on Redistribution of Surface Water Bodies in High-Altitude Permafrost Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lakes distributed in permafrost areas on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have been experiencing significant changes during the past few decades as a result of the climate warming and regional wetting. In September 2011, an outburst occurred on an endorheic lake (Zonag Lake) in the interior of the TP, which caused the spatial expansion of three downstream lakes (Kusai Lake, Haidingnor Lake and Salt Lake) and modified the four independent lake catchments to one basin. In this study, we investigate the changes in surficial areas and water volumes of the outburst lake and related downstream water bodies 10 years after the outburst. Based on the meteorological and satellite data, the reasons for the expansion of downstream lakes were analyzed. Additionally, the importance of the permafrost layer in determining hydrological process on the TP and the influence of from lake expansion on engineering infrastructures were discussed. The results in this study showed the downstream lakes increased both in area and volume after the outburst of the headwater. Meanwhile, we hope to provide a reference about surface water changes and permafrost degradation for the management of lake overflow and flood on the TP in the background of climate warming and wetting.

TI  - Following the cosmic-ray-neutron-sensing-based soil moisture under grassland and forest: Exploring the potential of optical and SAR remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving soil moisture content (SMC) at the regional scale with different spatial and temporal land cover changes is still a challenge for active and passive remote sensing systems, often coped with machine learning methods. So far, the reference measurements of the data-driven approaches are usually based on point data, which entails a scale gap to the resolution of the remote sensing data. Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) indirectly provides SMC estimates of a soil volume covering more than 1 ha and vertical depth up to 80 cm and is thus able to narrow this scale gap. So far, the CRNS-based SMC has only been used as validation source of remote sensing based SMC products. Its beneficial large sensing volume, especially in depth, has not been exploited yet. However, the sensing volume of the CRNS, which is changing with hydrological conditions, bears challenges for the comparison with remote sensing observations. This study, for the fist time, aims to understand the direct linkage of optical (Sentinel 2) and SAR (Sentinel 1) data with CRNS-based SMC. Thereby, the CRNS-based SMC is obtained by an experimental CRNS cluster that covers the high temporal and spatial SMC variability of an entire pre-alpine subcatchment. Using different Random Forest regressions, we analyze the potentials and limitations of both remote sensing sensors to follow the CRNS-based SMC signal. Our results show that it is possible to link the CRNS-based SMC signal with SAR and optical remote sensing observations via Random Forest modelling. We found that Sentinel 2 data is able to separate wet from dry periods with a R2 of 0.68. It is less affected by the changing soil volume that contributes to the CRNS-based SMC signal and it is able to assign a land cover specific SMC distribution. However, Sentinel 2 regression models are not accurate (R2 < 0.21) in mapping the CRNSbased SMC for the frequently mowed grassland areas of the study site. It requires soil type and topographical information to accurately follow the CRNS-based SMC signal with Random Forest regression. Sentinel 1 data instead is affected by the changing soil volume that contributes to the CRNS-based SMC signal. It has reasonable model performance (R2 = 0.34) when the CRNS data correspond to surface SMC. Also for Sentinel 1 the retrieval is impacted by the mowing activities at the test site. When separating the CRNS data set into dry and wet periods, soil properties and topography are the main drivers of SMC estimation. Sentinel 1 or Sentinel 2 data add the existing temporal variability to the regression models. The analysis underlines the need of combining optical and SAR observations (Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2) as well as soil property and topographical information to understand and follow the CRNS-based SMC signal for different hydrological conditions and land cover types.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Track Prediction with an Encoding-to-Forecasting Deep Learning Model
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, with the accumulation of remote sensing data, the traditional tropical cyclone (TC) track prediction methods (e.g., dynamic methods and statistical methods) have limitations in prediction efficiency and accuracy when dealing with a large amount of data. However, deep learning methods begin to show their advantages to capture the complex spatiotemporal features in high-dimensional data. The task of TC track prediction based on remote sensing images can be formulated as a spatiotemporal sequence-to-sequence problem. Therefore, a novel encoding-to-forecasting model with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and spatial attention network (SAN-EFSModel) was proposed to predict TC tracks in this paper, which can fully extract the long-term spatial and temporal features. The proposed model was evaluated on the real remote sensing images in the western North Pacific Ocean to forecast 24-h TC tracks. Compared with ECMWF-HRES model and NCEP-GFS model, the proposed method has a better prediction accuracy in the testing set with an average position error about 30 km less. Compared with the deep learning methods, the proposed method also has the best performance. Significance StatementTropical cyclones have a great impact on human life and natural environment due to their high frequency of occurrence, heavy degree of harm, wide impact range, and long disaster chain. In this article, we propose an encoding-to-forecasting model with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and spatial attention network (SAN-EFSModel) to predict tropical cyclone tracks, in which the SAN module and the convolution module of ConvLSTM have the ability to extract spatial features, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) module of ConvLSTM can extract temporal features from remote sensing images and tropical cyclone tracks. The results show that the average position error (APE) of our proposed method has about 30% improvement in a 24-h forecast compared with prevailing numerical weather prediction models.

TI  - Forest Fire Detection of FY-3D Using Genetic Algorithm and Brightness Temperature Change
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of China's new generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, FengYun-3D (FY-3D) provides critical data for forest fire detection. Most of the existing related methods identify fire points by comparing the spatial features and setting thresholds empirically. However, they ignore temporal features that are associated with forest fires. Besides, they are difficult to generalize to multiple areas with different environmental characteristics. A novel method based on FY-3D combining the genetic algorithm and brightness temperature change detection is proposed in this work to improve these problems. After analyzing the spatial features of the FY-3D data, it adaptively detects potential fire points based on these features using the genetic algorithm, then filters the points with contextual information. To address the false alarms resulting from the confusing spectral characteristics between fire pixels and conventional hotspots, temporal information is introduced and the "MIR change rate" based on the multitemporal brightness temperature change is further proposed. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several fire events occurring in different areas are used for testing. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MYD14) is chosen as the validation data to assess the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. A comparison of results demonstrates that the algorithm can identify fire points effectively and obtain a higher accuracy than the previous FY-3D algorithm.

TI  - Time-Series Calibration and Verification of GF1-WFV Based on Kalman Filtering
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a time-series calibration method based on Kalman filtering to monitor the changes in the on-orbit radiometric performance of satellite sensors, increase the frequency and accuracy of calibration, and meet the application requirements of quantitative remote sensing in the new era. Taking the Dunhuang radiation calibration field as the test field, we obtain the multi-scene images of the GF1 wide field of view (GF1-WFV) sensor in the sites of Dunhuang from 2013 to 2020. First, the gray values of the images are normalized, and the standard deviation is used to eliminate outliers; thus, valid images are filtered out. Then, the time-series calibration method based on stable targets with historical data is employed to calculate the calibration coefficients, and the idea of Kalman filtering is applied to further process the calibration coefficients. Finally, the calibration results in this paper are compared with the calibration results of the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (CCRS) and Landsat8 calibration results separately. The results reveal that the maximum annual attenuation rate of the GF1 sensor during the on-orbit operation period does not exceed 0.3%, which indicates that the sensor has not significantly attenuated. Through the comparison and verification of the calibration results, we find that the calibration results obtained by the time-series calibration method based on Kalman filtering are more accurate than those of CCRS, and the maximum reduction in the average relative error of each band is 16.14%. This demonstrates that the time-series calibration method based on Kalman filtering has good reliability and stability.

TI  - Characteristics of the Total Suspended Matter Concentration in the Hongze Lake during 1984-2019 Based on Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hongze Lake is the fourth largest freshwater lake in China and an important lake for the East Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. The water quality of the lake affects social development and the lives of residents. To assess the impacts of environmental changes and human activities on the distribution of the total suspended matter (TSM) in the Hongze Lake, we developed an algorithm that utilizes the near-infrared (NIR) band to estimate TSM based on in situ measurements. The algorithm was applied to Landsat images to derive TSM distribution maps from 1984 to 2019, revealing significant inter-annual, seasonal, and spatial variability. The relationship between TSM, precipitation, and wind speed was analyzed, and we found that: (1) The estimation model of TSM concentration in the Hongze Lake constructed for TM and OLI has a high accuracy, and it can be used to jointly monitor TSM concentration in the Hongze Lake for long-term series; (2) From 1984 to 2019, the concentration of TSM in the Hongze Lake showed a trend of first rising and then falling, with the maximum value in 2010 at 100.18 mg/L mainly caused by sand mining activities. Precipitation and wind speed weakly influence the inter-annual variation of TSM concentration; (3) The concentration of TSM in the Hongze Lake in summer is easily affected by flooding in the Huai River, and the concentration of TSM in other seasons is significantly negatively correlated with precipitation; (4) TSM is highest in the Huaihe Bay, followed by the Lihe Bay and Chengzi Bay. The main reason for this is that the input of the Huaihe Bay flows directly into this lake area and is also the main navigation channel. The results of this study are of great significance for the protection and management of the water environment of the Hongze Lake.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Snow Cover Frequency in the Qilian Mountains (Northwestern China) during 2000-2020 and Associated Circulation Mechanisms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Linking snow cover frequency (SCF) and atmospheric circulation is vital for comprehension of hemispheric-scale change mechanisms and for accurate forecasting. This study combined MODIS imagery with meteorological observations to investigate the variation of annual SCFs in the Qilian Mountains. Results indicated that more than 80% of annual SCF is distributed at high elevations and mostly on northern slopes, and that SCF is greater in the west than in the east. Abrupt change in the increase in annual SCF was not detected; however, significant (0.05 confidence level) variation with quasi-3-year and quasi-5-year periods indicated potential connection with monsoons. Topographically, SCF increased at high elevations and decreased in valleys. Moreover, SCF increased significantly with a rise in slope below 23 degrees and then decreased between 23 degrees and 45 degrees, and it decreased with a change in aspect from 70 degrees to 200 degrees and then increased from 200 degrees to 310 degrees. Annual SCF variation in the Qilian Mountains is dominated by precipitation rather than by temperature. In the years with high SCFs, southeasterly winds associated with an anticyclone over southeastern China and southwesterly winds associated with the cyclone over the Iranian Plateau brought warm moisture across northwestern China, favoring snowfall in the Qilian Mountains. Meanwhile, cold moisture outbreaks from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes are conducive to maintaining snow cover. However, in the years with low SCFs, the cold air might be difficultly transporting out of the Arctic region due to the strengthening polar vortex. Moreover, the water vapor was less than that of the mean state and divergence over the Qilian Mountains, which difficultly conduced snowfall over the Qilian Mountains.

TI  - Thunderstorm Activity over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Indicated by the Combined Data of the FY-2E Geostationary Satellite and WWLLN
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thunderstorm activity over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has important climatic effects and disaster impacts. Using the thunderstorm feature dataset (TFD) established based on the black body temperature (TBB) and cloud classification (CLC) products of the Fengyun-2E (FY-2E) geostationary satellite, as well as the lightning data of the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), the temporal and spatial distributions and some cloud properties of the thunderstorms over the QTP were analyzed. Approximately 93.9% and 82.7% of thunderstorms over the QTP occur from May to September and from 12 to 21 o'clock local time, and the corresponding peaks are in August and at 14:00, respectively. There are three centers featuring frequent thunderstorms in the southeast, south-central, and southwest regions of the QTP. The average thunderstorm cloud area (the region with TBB <= -32 degrees C) is 1.8 x 10(4) km(2). Approximately 32.9% of thunderstorms have strong convective cells (SCCs) composed of areas with TBB <= -52 degrees C. The average number and area ratio of SCCs are 3.6 and 25.4%, respectively, and their spatial distribution is given. The average cloud area and the number and area ratio of SCCs of extreme-lightning thunderstorms (thunderstorms with the top 10% of lightning numbers) are approximately 30.0, 3.9, and 1.5 times those of normal thunderstorms. The spatial distribution of the thunderstorm activity is quite different from that of lightning activity given by the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) over the northeastern and southwestern QTP, which may mean that the convection intensity, cloud structure, and charge structure of the thunderstorms over the QTP are different between different regions and seasons.

TI  - Recent Advances in Forest Insect Pests and Diseases Monitoring Using UAV-Based Data: A Systematic Review
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are platforms that have been increasingly used over the last decade to collect data for forest insect pest and disease (FIPD) monitoring. These machines provide flexibility, cost efficiency, and a high temporal and spatial resolution of remotely sensed data. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent contributions and to identify knowledge gaps in UAV remote sensing for FIPD monitoring. A systematic review was performed using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol. We reviewed the full text of 49 studies published between 2015 and 2021. The parameters examined were the taxonomic characteristics, the type of UAV and sensor, data collection and pre-processing, processing and analytical methods, and software used. We found that the number of papers on this topic has increased in recent years, with most being studies located in China and Europe. The main FIPDs studied were pine wilt disease (PWD) and bark beetles (BB) using UAV multirotor architectures. Among the sensor types, multispectral and red-green-blue (RGB) bands were preferred for the monitoring tasks. Regarding the analytical methods, random forest (RF) and deep learning (DL) classifiers were the most frequently applied in UAV imagery processing. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations associated with the use of UAVs and the processing methods for FIPDs, and research gaps and challenges are presented.

TI  - Importance of HALP Score in Breast Cancer and its Diagnostic Value in Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Status
T2  - JCPSP-JOURNAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PAKISTAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the diagnostic value of the haemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score in predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement.Study Design: Observational study.Place and Duration of Study: Department of General Surgery, Balikesir University and Mersin City Hospital, Turkey from January 2016-December 2021.Methodology: Included in the study were 307 patients who underwent surgical treatment for breast cancer. HALP values were calculated by multiplying the haemoglobin, albumin, and lymphocyte values and dividing the resulting value by the platelet number. The patients were divided in two groups, being those with low HALP ( Group 1) and high HALP (Group 2) scores. We examined the potential of the HALP score for the prediction of ALN involvement.Result: Group 1 had 65 patients and the Group 2 had 242 patients. At the cut-off point, a HALP score of <29.01 predicted the presence of axillary involvement with a sensitivity of 84.33% and a specificity of 26.1%. The sentinel lymph node sampling rate was similar in both groups (12.3% vs. 16.9% p=0.365). The presence of positive lymph nodes in the axilla was higher in group 1 (67.7% vs. 53.3% p=0.038). There was no correlation between HALP score, and the metastatic lymph node and total lymph node count.Conclusion: The use of HALP score alone for the prediction of axillary lymph node positivity in patients with breast cancer is not advised. In the present study, a low HALP score was associated with aggressive tumour activity, such as advanced tumour and axillary lymph node positivity.

TI  - A new high resolution object-oriented approach to define the spatiotemporal dynamics of the cover-management factor in soil erosion modelling
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The cover management factor (C-factor) calculation requires the assessment of the intra-annual spatiotemporal variability of biomass cover, owed to the natural growth cycle of vegetation and the impact of agriculture on land cover. However, this is frequently omitted, and the vegetation conditions are approximated by assigning constant values to static classified Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps, such as the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC). Using as test site the Sperchios River catchment, Central Greece, this study introduces a new approach to estimate C-factor in a spatiotemporally exhaustive manner. The goal is to increase estimation accuracy in erosion modelling applications. The C-factor computations are performed on monthly scale, based on LULC maps that portray the basin's agricultural areas in unprecedented detail. The methodology involves the use of a biophysical index, namely Fraction of Vegetation Cover (F-cover) and empirical literature data on crop types. F-cover was developed from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery in 10-m analysis. Such analysis (compared to the 300-m one provided by the EU) is a major improvement towards a more precise estimation of C-factor. The study identified the monthly C-factor fluctuation at basin scale, and the most susceptible months seasons at localities in terms of land cover/soil loss potential. The higher C-factor values were acquired in October and the lower in May. Mean annual (numerical) C-factor complies with the value of July. All monthly values are significantly higher - almost double - than the mean annual stationary one. The revealed patterns would not have been detected in a lower temporal (e.g., annual) resolution without the incorporation of vegetation density seasonality. The study shows high reproducibility and upscaling potential, as the utilized datasets are available in all European Union (EU) Member States, having similar structure, thus they can be harmonized towards a unified continental approach.

TI  - Evaluation of Historical Wildfires in Tohoku Region Using Satellite-Based High-Fire-Severity Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crown fires represent an extreme fire behavior that leads to high fire severity, and dryness plays a vital role in this behavior. Due to the lack of fire severity data in Tohoku, high fire severity was estimated using a satellite-based high-fire-severity index (HFSI). HFSI is the ratio of the identified area of high fire severity sensed using the Landsat-differenced normalized difference vegetation index (dNDVI) to the reported total burnt area. Using the HFSI, only six wildfires could be identified as having high fire severity areas from an evaluation of 55 wildfires with burnt areas greater than 0.1 km(2) reported in Tohoku from 1995 to 2017. The low HFSI values computed for these wildfires implied that fireline intensity was not high for crown fires to occur in Tohoku. Additionally, the soil moisture (SM) content for three layers, the surface, root, and recharge zones simulated using a land surface model (the Simple Biosphere Model including Urban Canopy (SiBUC) model), were used to assess the dryness. The highest HFSI value calculated among all wildfires was that of the largest wildfire that ever occurred in Japan in the period between 1995 and 2017, the 2017 Kamaishi wildfire. The conditions before this fire were among the driest of the six wildfires with HFSI values.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Urban Heat Islands in Relation to Urban Development, in the Vicinity of the Atacama Desert
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Near the Atacama Desert, Tacna city in Peru is among the largest arid cities with constant urban development, thus understanding of the urban surface thermal pattern is needed. We propose a comprehensive study of the urban heat island phenomenon, with the objective of (1) determining the spatial and temporal variations of the urban heat islands (UHIs), in the period 1985 to 2020; (2) analyzing the relationship between the UHI and influencing factors such as vegetation, urban area, and population, using indices calculated with satellite images. The Google Earth Engine repository was used to evaluate the corrected images from the years 1985 to 2020. The coincidence between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) was good, negative between NDVI and the land surface temperature (LST), attributable to dense vegetation, and negative and very high (-0.81) between NDBI and NDVI, as massive urbanization leads to the reduction in the vegetal surface. The NDBI has a high impact on the LST; a coefficient of connections is recorded as 0.46. Tacna is a very arid region, and an increase in the time of the LST occurred with the increase in industrialization and urbanization. The land use/cover change (LUCC) evidences change in the climate in the city of Tacna; temperatures of 24.2 degrees C to 44.2 degrees C are observed in the built-up areas. In vegetated areas, the temperature remains below 24 degrees C, which is associated with a high rate of potential evapotranspiration. Thus, this study shows that variations in urban form and growth have produced the development of intraurban surface thermal patterns.

TI  - Assessing the Contribution of EC<sub>a</sub> and NDVI in the Delineation of Management Zones in a Vineyard
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision fertilization implies the need to identify the variability of soil fertility, which is costly and time-consuming. Remotely measured data can be a solution. Using this strategy, a study was conducted, in a vineyard, to delineate different management zones using two indicators: apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). To understand the contribution of each indicator, three scenarios were used for zone definition: (1) using only NDVI, (2) only ECa, or (3) using a combination of the two. Then the differences in soil fertility between these zones were assessed using simple statistical methods. The results indicate that the most beneficial strategy is the combined use of the two indicators, as it allowed the definition of three distinct zones regarding important soil variables and crop nutrients, such as soil total nitrogen, Mg2+ cation, exchange acidity, and effective cation exchange capacity, and some relevant cation ratios. This strategy also allowed the identification of an ionic unbalance in the soil chemistry, due to an excess of Mg2+, that was harming crop health, as reported by NDVI. This also impacted ECa and NDVI relationship, which was negative in this study. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantages of using remotely sensed data, mainly more than one type of sensing data, and suggest a high potential for differential crop fertilization and soil management in the study area.

TI  - Contributions of climatic and social factors to two water use efficiency indicators in the Yellow River
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracing the spatiotemporal tendency and driving forces of water use efficiency (WUE) is of great significance for understanding the carbon-water balance, especially in large river basins. The lack of differential comparisons regarding the tendencies and driving forces of WUE indicators between the upper and lower reaches of rivers often affects the collaborative allocation and utilization of water resources at the basin scale, especially social factors such as population and economy distributions. Using remote sensing data and hierarchical decomposition methods, we identified the spatiotemporal distribution of the WUE of ecosystems (WUEe) and the WUE of canopies (WUEc) in the Yellow River Basin from 2003 to 2017 as well as the contribution rates of climatic and social factors to WUEe and WUEc. Our results show that WUEe had a different distribution pattern than WUEc. An increase in WUEe was accompanied by a decrease in WUEc, and these changes varied among the upper, middle and lower reaches. WUEc was most negatively correlated with pressure (| r | = 0.65), while WUEe was most positively correlated with the precipitation rate (| r | = 0.68). The contribution rates of climatic factors to both WUEc and WUEe in the upper reaches were higher than 95%. The middle reaches were mainly driven by climatic factors, with contribution rates higher than 90%. In the lower reaches, the contribution rates of social factors to WUEe were higher than 30%. These differentiated contributions indicated the importance of considering social factors in the lower reaches than in the upper reaches when managing WUEe under the dominance of climatic factors on WUEc.

TI  - Efficiency Analysis of Land Use and the Degree of Coupling Link between Population Growth and Global Built-Up Area in the Subregion of West Africa
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The main challenge for land use efficiency is population growth. Using a coupling coordination model and the Sustainable Development Goal 11.3.1 (Land Consumption Rate to Population Growth Rate, LCRPGR), the present study unravels the evolution of land use types and efficiency of land use in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) from 2003 to 2019. We interpreted the temporal land use types based on the long-time series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MCD12Q1-V6) land use images in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019. The World Bank data on population and socioeconomics were used to support the investigation on the coupled link. Our results showed that from 2003 to 2019, the total area of agricultural land decreased by -1.4%, while the built-up area expanded by 25.80%. Globally, the LCRPGR was 0.82, of which Cabo-Verdi and Niger had the highest (1.69) and lowest index (0.58), respectively. Correspondingly, the coupled coordination model indicated an overall value of 6.81, in which the highest and lowest value occurred in Liberia (29.78) and Niger (0.31), respectively. Furthermore, a rapidly growing population had become one of the most important factors causing inefficient land use in the study area. In summary, the ECOWAS was confronted with a lack of management to improve land use efficiency. Thus, future land use policies should pay more attention to balancing the coupled relationship between urban expansion and socio-economic interests.

TI  - Monitoring Desertification Using Machine-Learning Techniques with Multiple Indicators Derived from MODIS Images in Mu Us Sandy Land, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mu Us Sandy Land is a typical semi-arid vulnerable ecological zone, characterized by vegetation degradation and severe desertification. Effectively identifying desertification changes has been a topical environmental issue in China. However, most previous studies have used a single method or remote sensing index to monitor desertification, and lacked an efficient and high-precision monitoring system. In this study, an optimal monitoring scheme that considers multiple indicators combination and different machine learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree-Decision Tree, CART-DT; Random Forest, RF; Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN) was developed and used to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns of desertification from 2000 to 2018 in Mu Us Sandy Land. The results showed that: (a) The random forest model performed best for monitoring desertification based on medium and low-resolution remote sensing images, and the four-index combination (Albedo, NDVI, LST and TGSI) obtained the highest classification accuracy (OA = 87.67%) in Mu Us Sandy Land. Surprisingly, the model accuracy of the three-index combination (NDVI, LST and TGSI) (OA = 85.74%) is comparable to the four-index combination. (b) The TGSI index used to characterize soil information performs well, while the LST is not conducive to the extraction of desertified land in several desertification monitoring indicators. (c) Since 2000, the area of extremely severe desertified land has shown a reversal trend; however, there is significant interannual fluctuation in the total and light desertification land area affected by extreme climate. This research provides a novel approach and a valuable reference for monitoring the evolution of desertification in regional studies, and the results improve the research system of desertification and provide a data basis for desertification cause analysis and prevention.

TI  - Developing an Enhanced Ecological Evaluation Index (EEEI) Based on Remotely Sensed Data and Assessing Spatiotemporal Ecological Quality in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological changes affected by increasing human activities have highlighted the importance of ecological quality assessments. An appropriate and efficient selection of ecological parameters is fundamental for ecological quality assessments. On the basis of remote sensing data and methods, this study developed an enhanced ecological evaluation index (EEEI) with five integrated ecological parameters by containing pixel and sub-pixel information: normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface coverage, soil coverage, land surface temperature, and wetness component of tasseled cap transformation. Significantly, the EEEI simultaneously considered the five aspects of land surface ecological conditions (i.e., greenness, human activities, dryness, heat, and moisture), which provided an effective guide for the systematic selection of ecological parameters. The EEEI has a clear theoretical framework, and all the parameters can be obtained quickly on the basis of the remote sensing datasets and methods, which is suitable for the promotion and application of ecological quality assessments to various areas and scales. Furthermore, the EEEI was applied to assess and detect the ecological quality of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China. Assessment results indicated that the ecological quality of the GBA is currently facing great challenges with a degradation trend from 2000 to 2020, which emphasizes the significance and urgency for eco-environmental protection of the GBA. This provided evidence that the EEEI can be used as an effective index for scientific, objective, quantitative, and comprehensive ecological quality assessment, which can also aid regional environmental management and ecological protection.

TI  - A Case Study of the Snow Leopard in Sanjiangyuan National Park Boundaries regarding Park Boundary Divergence
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper uses remote sensing data from the Sanjiangyuan National Park (SNP) to explore the divergence between the boundaries of national parks and the distribution of natural habitats. Results are used to argue that these discrepancies evolve along with the potential impact of global warming. Using the example of the habitat change of snow leopards and the conflicts between local people and snow leopards, we reflect on the consequences of this divergence. Results show that divergence between the political boundaries and natural habitats as well as the consequent influence on the living conditions of local people are strikingly visible, and the effects of global warming on such conflicts are apparent. The authors conclude that both notions of 'political boundaries' and 'natural habitats' are expected to come together as the SNP region is spatially configured, while 'global warming' seems to be relevant as an essential reference when delimiting the region in the future. Finally, the proposal for the establishment of cooperative conservation areas is presented, emphasizing the role of cooperative governance in/around national parks.

TI  - Monitoring of Land Desertification Changes in Urat Front Banner from 2010 to 2020 Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of desertification is critical for desertification control. Using the Urat front flag as the study area, Landsat remote sensing images between 2010 and 2020 were selected as data sources, along with MOD17A3H as auxiliary data. Additionally, RS and GIS theories and methods were used to establish an Albedo-NDVI feature space based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface albedo. The desertification difference index (DDI) was developed to investigate the dynamic change and factors contributing to desertification in the Urat front banner. The results show that: ① the Albedo-NDVI feature space method is effective and precise at extracting and classifying desertification information, which is beneficial for quantitative analysis and monitoring of desertification; ② from 2010 to 2020, the spatial distribution of desertification degree in the Urat front banner gradually decreased from south to north; ③ throughout the study period, the area of moderate desertification land increased the most, at an annual rate of 8.2%, while the area of extremely serious desertification land decreased significantly, at an annual rate of 9.2%, indicating that desertification degree improved during the study period; ④ the transformation of desertification types in Urat former banner is mainly from very severe to moderate, from severe to undeserted, and from mild to undeserted, with respective areas of 22.5045 km(2), 44.0478 km(2), and 319.2160 km(2). Over a 10-year period, the desertification restoration areas in the study area ranged from extremely serious desertification to moderate desertification, from serious desertification to non-desertification, and from weak desertification to non-desertification, while the desertification aggravation areas ranged mainly from serious desertification to moderate desertification; ⑤ NPP dynamic changes in vegetation demonstrated a zonal increase in distribution from west to east, and significant progress was made in desertification control. The change in desertification has accelerated significantly over the last decade. Climate change and irresponsible human activities have exacerbated desertification in the eastern part of the study area.

TI  - 'Assuming our place in the concert of nations': Burundi as imagined in Pierre Nkurunziza's political speeches
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pierre Nkurunziza died in 2020, just a few months short of completing his tenure as the first post-civil war President of Burundi. Critics have cast him as yet another rebel-turned-politician who came to office on a promise of a democratic transformation but became progressively authoritarian, particularly during his third, disputed term in office. As a political figure, however, Nkurunziza remains poorly understood. What kind of a worldview motivated his politics? Drawing on critical discourse analysis, we identify three recurring themes in Nkurunziza's key political speeches: anti-colonialism; unity and self-sufficiency; and discourse around 'politics of a new beginning'. These themes were stable across time, indicating Nkurunziza's consistent worldview, but became more pronounced and radical as he faced growing challenges to his legitimacy from within and without. Far from being confined to rhetoric, the themes also manifested in concrete policy decisions, underscoring the urgent need to take ideology seriously in understanding the political trajectories of African leaders.

TI  - Robust Satellite-Based Identification and Monitoring of Forests Having Undergone Climate-Change-Related Stress
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-induced drought events are responsible for forest decline and mortality in different areas of the world. Forest response to drought stress periods may be different, in time and space, depending on vegetation type and local factors. Stress analysis may be carried out by using field methods, but the use of remote sensing may be needed to highlight the effects of climate-change-induced phenomena at a larger spatial and temporal scale. In this context, satellite-based analyses are presented in this work to evaluate the drought effects during the 2000s and the possible climatological forcing over oak forests in Southern Italy. To this aim, two approaches based on the well-known Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used: one based on NDVI values, averaged over selected decaying and non-decaying forests; another based on the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST). The analysis of the first approach mainly gave us overall information about 1984-2011 rising NDVI trends, despite a general decrease around the 2000s. The second, more refined approach was able to highlight a different drought stress impact over decaying and non-decaying forests. The combined use of the RST-based approach, Landsat satellite data, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform allowed us to identify in space domain and monitor over time significant oak forest changes and climate-driven effects (e.g., in 2001) from the local to the Basilicata region scale. By this way, the decaying status of the Gorgoglione forest was highlighted two years before the first visual field evidence (e.g., dryness of apical branches, bark detachment, root rot disease). The RST exportability to different satellite sensors and vegetation types, the availability of suitable satellite data, and the potential of GEE suggest the possibility of long-term monitoring of forest health, from the local to the global scale, to provide useful information to different end-user classes.

T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study assesses dynamics of phytoplankton biomass in the surface layer, the depth of the upper mixed layer, and the photic zone based on satellite data in the deep sea and coastal regions of the Black Sea for 1998-2015. The annual biomass dynamics had the same character in all regions and was described by a U-shaped curve with some deviation in the spring. Average seasonal values were at the maximum in winter and minimum in summer, differing by 2-2.5-fold. Phytoplankton blooms with an average duration 1-2.5 months were present in all seasons, but with different frequencies. The highest numbers were recorded in spring, minimal numbers in summer and fall; during the bloom, biomass was twice as much as the background values. Phytoplankton biomass grew with decrease in water temperature and increase in mixed layer depth during fall. There was no such dependence during the other seasons. The dynamics of the annual average biomass showed negative trend in the deep sea from 1998 to 2015, the latter was not observed in the coastal zone. The strongest decrease in biomass was recorded in spring and summer; it was not observed in winter and fall.

T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - My contribution will focus on secular and non-religious worldviews and will aim to reconstruct secular relationships with the world that develop from lived values and their transmission in the family. I will try to show in detail how a non-religious habitus develops in socialization over several generations, becomes entrenched in later biographical positioning, and shapes how a person relates to the world, including their view of religion. After a brief outline of the religious field in Germany, I will concentrate on a family case whose first generation (grandparents) grew up in the GDR. This family has had no religious socialization or child baptisms for three generations and secularity has become a positive point of reference for how its members justify their own life patterns. For the members of this non-religious family, religion still becomes selectively relevant. Using concrete situations and contexts where the family has contact with religion, I will show how these encounters become a marker for drawing boundaries. In conclusion, I will follow Quack and Schuh's distinction between "indifference to religiosity" on the one hand, and "indifference to religion" on the other, and argue that indifference to religiosity, but not indifference to religion, can be clearly identified.

TI  - Environmental Pollution Analysis and Impact Study-A Case Study for the Salton Sea in California
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A natural experiment conducted on the shrinking Salton Sea, a saline lake in California, showed that each one foot drop in lake elevation resulted in a 2.6% average increase in PM2.5 concentrations. The shrinking has caused the asthma rate continues to increase among children, with one in five children being sent to the emergency department, which is related to asthma. In this paper, several data-driven machine learning (ML) models are developed for forecasting air quality and dust emission to study, evaluate and predict the impacts on human health due to the shrinkage of the sea, such as the Salton Sea. The paper presents an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict the hourly air quality (O-3 and CO) based on air pollutants and weather data in the previous 5 h. According to our experiment results, the model generates a very good R2 score of 0.924 and 0.835 for O-3 and CO, respectively. In addition, the paper proposes an ensemble model based on random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GBoost) algorithms for forecasting hourly PM2.5 and PM10 using the air quality and weather data in the previous 5 h. Furthermore, the paper shares our research results for PM2.5 and PM10 prediction based on the proposed ensemble ML models using satellite remote sensing data. Daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentration maps in 2018 are created to display the regional air pollution density and severity. Finally, the paper reports Artificial Intelligence (AI) based research findings of measuring air pollution impact on asthma prevalence rate of local residents in the Salton Sea region. A stacked ensemble model based on support vector regression (SVR), elastic net regression (ENR), RF and GBoost is developed for asthma prediction with a good R2 score of 0.978.

TI  - Spatial Sustainable Development Assessment Using Fusing Multisource Data from the Perspective of Production-Living-Ecological Space Division: A Case of Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - United Nations Sustainable Development Goal SDG11.3.1-the ratio of land consumption rate (LCR) to population growth rate (PGR) (LCRPGR)-aims to measure the efficiency and sustainability of urban land use. In recent years, SDG11.3.1 has been widely used in sustainable urban development research. However, previous studies have focused on the urban core area, while the sustainable development status of the urban peripheral areas (suburban and rural areas) that contribute significantly to the ecological environment has been neglected. To this end, relying on land use/cover change (LUCC) data obtained from high-resolution remote sensing satellite images rather than the single impervious surface data used in traditional research, according to the multiple functions of the land use type, the city is divided into three types of space: production, living, and ecological spaces. Research from the perspective of multi-scale coordination is of great significance for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the sustainable development status of urban space. Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China as an example, in this paper, LUCC remote sensing data and comprehensive population and gross domestic product (GDP) data are used. From the multi-functional production-living-ecological space perspective, based on the original land use efficiency indicator, the ratio of land consumption rate (LCR) to economic growth rate (EGR) (LCREGR) is introduced and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to comprehensively evaluate the sustainable development level (SDL) of the space between 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 on the urban agglomeration and prefecture-level city scales. The results show that (1) the level of and changes in the spatial sustainable development are significantly different at different scales; (2) the division of the production-living-ecological spaces can guide cities to optimize different types of spaces in the future. This paper proposes a new evaluation method for spatial sustainable development, which provides a useful reference for any country or region in the world.

TI  - Glacier Mass Balance Pattern and Its Variation Mechanism in the West Kunlun Mountains in Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass balance observations are beneficial for assessing climate change in different world regions. This study analyzed the glacier elevation change, ice flux divergence, and surface mass balance (SMB) in the West Kunlun Mountains (WKM) on the Tibetan Plateau using remote sensing data, including satellite altimetry, glacier surface velocity, and thickness fields. Seventeen local glaciers were examined in detail and showed varying surface elevation changes from -0.39 +/- 0.11 to 0.83 +/- 0.10 m/a. Overall, we obtained a reasonably rapid elevation trend of 0.21 +/- 0.14 m/a. By combining the ice flux divergence and surface mass balance, the overall thickness change of the WKM glacier over time is almost zero, and the WKM glacier shows a positive mass balance of 0.21 +/- 0.98 m/a. Moreover, the ice flux divergence is more significant on the ice tongue than in the flat region due to the more considerable gradient of surface velocity and thickness fields. We found that glacier heterogeneity dynamics were associated with a surging dynamic mechanism concentrated in the glacier tongue and were induced by inner terrain instabilities. The glacier surging causes a drastic drop in glacier elevation but does not cause a glacier mass gain or loss, and it has an enhanced effect on the ice flux divergence. Therefore, glacier surging is the main reason for the decline of the two glaciers monitored. In addition, the long-term meteorological data analysis found that, since 2000, the air temperature warming hiatus may have balanced the three glaciers, and significantly increasing precipitation variation may cause the glacier to thicken the most.

TI  - Above-Ground Biomass Estimation of Plantation with Different Tree Species Using Airborne LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is an important index to evaluate forest carbon sequestration capacity, which is very important to maintain the stability of forest ecosystems. At present, the wide use of remote sensing technology makes it possible to estimate the large-scale forest AGB accurately and efficiently. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data can obtain rich spectral information and spatial structure information on the forest canopy with the characteristics of high spatial and hyperspectral resolution. Airborne LiDAR data can describe the three-dimensional structure characteristics of a forest and provide vertical structure information related to biomass. Based on the characteristics of the two data sources, this study takes Gaofeng forest farm in Nanning, Guangxi, as the study area, Chinese fir, pine tree, eucalyptus and other broadleaved trees as the research object, and constructs the AGB estimation models of different tree species by fusing airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral features. Firstly, spectral features, texture features, vegetation index, wavelet transform features and edge features are extracted from hyperspectral data. Canopy structure features, point cloud structure features, point cloud density features and terrain features are extracted from airborne LiDAR data. Secondly, the random forest (RF) method is used to screen the features of the two sets of data, and the features with the highest importance are selected. Finally, based on the optimal features of the two data sources, the forest AGB model is constructed using the multiple stepwise regression method. The results show that the texture features extracted by wavelet transform can be used for AGB modeling. The AGB of eucalyptus has high correlation with height features derived from airborne LiDAR, the AGB of other broadleaved trees mostly depends on the wavelet transform texture features from airborne hyperspectral data, while the AGB of Chinese fir and pine tree has high correlation with both height features and spectral features. Feature-fusion-based LiDAR and hyperspectral data can greatly improve the accuracy of the AGB models. The accuracy of the optimal AGB models of Chinese fir, pine tree, eucalyptus and other broadleaved trees is 0.78, 0.95, 0.72 and 0.89, respectively. In conclusion, more accurate estimation results can be obtained by combining active and passive remote sensing data for forest AGB estimation, which provides a solution for carbon storage assessment and forest ecosystem assessment.

TI  - Coupled Heterogeneous Tucker Decomposition: A Feature Extraction Method for Multisource Fusion and Domain Adaptation Using Multisource Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To excavate adequately the rich information contained in multisource remote sensing data, feature extraction as basic yet important research has two typical applications: one of which is to extract complementary information of multisource data to improve classification; and the other is to extract shared information across sources for domain adaptation. However, typical feature extraction methods require the input represented as vectors or homogeneous tensors and fail to process multisource data represented as heterogeneous tensors. Therefore, the coupled heterogeneous Tucker decomposition (C-HTD) containing two sub-methods, namely coupled factor matrix-based HTD (CFM-HTD) and coupled core tensor-based HTD (CCT-HTD), is proposed to establish a unified feature extraction framework for multisource fusion and domain adaptation. To handle multisource heterogeneous tensors, multiple Tucker models were constructed to extract features of different sources separately. To cope with the supervised and semi-supervised cases, the class-indicator factor matrix was built to enhance the separability of features using known labels and learned labels. To mine the complementarity of paired multisource samples, coupling constraint was imposed on multiple factor matrices to form CFM-HTD to extract multisource information jointly. To extract domain-adapted features, coupling constraint was imposed on multiple core tensors to form CCT-HTD to encourage data from different sources to have the same class centroid. In addition, to reduce the impact of interference samples on domain adaptation, an adaptive sample-weighting matrix was designed to autonomously remove outliers. Using multiresolution multiangle optical and MSTAR datasets, experimental results show that the C-HTD outperforms typical multisource fusion and domain adaptation methods.

TI  - Attention-Unet-Based Near-Real-Time Precipitation Estimation from Fengyun-4A Satellite Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable near-real-time precipitation estimation is crucial for scientific research and resistance to natural disasters such as floods. Compared with ground-based precipitation measurements, satellite-based precipitation measurements have great advantages, but precipitation estimation based on satellite is still a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model named Attention-Unet for precipitation estimation. The model utilizes the high temporal, spatial and spectral resolution data of the FY4A satellite to improve the accuracy of precipitation estimation. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compare it with operational near-real-time satellite-based precipitation products and deep learning models which proved to be effective in precipitation estimation. We use classification metrics such as Probability of detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), Critical success index (CSI), and regression metrics including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) to evaluate the performance of precipitation identification and precipitation amounts estimation, respectively. Furthermore, we select an extreme precipitation event to validate the generalization ability of our proposed model. Statistics and visualizations of the experimental results show the proposed model has better performance than operational precipitation products and baseline deep learning models in both precipitation identification and precipitation amounts estimation. Therefore, the proposed model has the potential to serve as a more accurate and reliable satellite-based precipitation estimation product. This study suggests that applying an appropriate deep learning algorithm may provide an opportunity to improve the quality of satellite-based precipitation products.

TI  - Today's Mistakes and Tomorrow's Wisdom in the Surgical Treatment of Barrett's Adenocarcinoma.
T2  - Visceral medicine
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition caused by longstanding gastroesophageal reflux disease and may progress to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and finally esophageal adenocarcinoma.Summary: Barrett's adenocarcinoma can be treated either by endoscopic or surgical resection, depending on the clinical staging. Endoscopic resection is a safe and adequate treatment option for HGD, mucosal tumors, and low-risk submucosal tumors. Its role in the treatment of high-risk submucosal tumors and the role of organ-preserving sentinel node navigated surgery are still under investigation. Esophagectomy with neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative chemotherapy is considered the standard of care for locally advanced Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Regarding operative technique, there is no proven superiority of one technique over another, although a minimally invasive transthoracic technique seems most commonly applied nowadays. In this review, state-of-the-art evidence and future expectations are presented regarding indications for resection, neoadjuvant or perioperative therapy, type of surgery, and postoperative follow-up for Barrett's adenocarcinoma.Key Messages: In Barrett's adenocarcinoma, endoscopic resection is the standard treatment option for low-risk mucosal and submucosal tumors. For high-risk submucosal tumors, endoscopic submucosal dissection with close surveillance and sentinel node navigated surgery are currently being studied. For locally advanced cancer, a multimodal therapy including esophagectomy is the standard of care. Nowadays, in high-volume centers, a minimally invasive transthoracic esophagectomy with an intrathoracic anastomosis is the most common procedure for Barrett's adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Retrieval Using S-SEBI Model with Landsat-8 Split-Window Land Surface Temperature Products over Two European Agricultural Crops
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable within the global hydrological cycle to account for the irrigation scheduling, water budgeting, and planning of the water resources associated with irrigation in croplands. Remote sensing techniques provide geophysical information at a large spatial scale and over a relatively long time series, and even make possible the retrieval of ET at high spatiotemporal resolutions. The present short study analyzed the daily ET maps generated with the S-SEBI model, adapted to Landsat-8 retrieved land surface temperatures and broadband albedos, at two different crop sites for two consecutive years (2017-2018). Maps of land surface temperatures were determined using Landsat-8 Collection 2 data, after applying the split-window (SW) algorithm proposed for the operational SW product, which will be implemented in the future Collection 3. Preliminary results showed a good agreement with ground reference data for the main surface energy balance fluxes R-n and LE, and for daily ET values, with RMSEs around 50 W/m(2) and 0.9 mm/d, respectively, and high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.72-0.91). The acceptable uncertainties observed when comparing with local ground data were reaffirmed after the regional (spatial resolution of 9 km) comparison with reanalysis data obtained from ERA5-Land model, showing a StDev of 0.9 mm/d, RMSE = 1.1 mm/d, MAE = 0.9 mm/d, and MBE = -0.3 mm/d. This short communication tries to show some preliminary findings in the framework of the ongoing Tool4Extreme research project, in which one of the main objectives is the understanding and characterization of the hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean region, since it is key to improve the management of water resources in the context of climate change effects.

TI  - An operational land cover and land cover change toolbox: processing open-source data with open-source software
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are vital for underpinning evidence-based landscape management decision-making. However, the technical skills required to extract tailored information about land cover dynamics from these open-access geospatial data often limit their use by those making landscape management decisions. Using Dartmoor National Park as an example, we demonstrate an open-source toolkit which uses open-source software (QGIS and RStudio) to process freely available Sentinel-2 and public LiDAR data sets to produce fine scale (10 m(2) grain size) land cover maps. The toolbox has been designed for use by staff within the national park, for example, enabling land cover maps to be updated as required in the future. An area of 945 km(2) was mapped using a trained random forest classifier following a classification scheme tailored to the needs of the national park. A 2019 land cover map had an overall user's accuracy of 79%, with 13 out of 17 land cover classes achieving greater than 70% accuracy. Spatially, accuracy was related via logistical regression to blue band surface reflectance in the spring and topographic slope derived from LiDAR (1 m resolution), with greater accuracy in steeper terrain and areas exhibiting higher blue reflectance. Between an earlier (2017-2019) and later (2019-2021) time frame, 8% of pixels changed, most of the change by area occurred in the most common classes. However, the largest proportional increase occurred in Upland Meadows, Lowland Meadows and Blanket Bog, all habitats subject to restoration efforts. Identifying areas of change enables future field work to be better targeted. We discuss the application of this mapping to land management within the Dartmoor national park and of the potential of tailored land cover and land cover change mapping, via this toolbox, to evidence-based environmental decision-making more widely.

TI  - Soybean Cultivars Identification Using Remotely Sensed Image and Machine Learning Models
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing combined with machine learning (ML) techniques is a promising approach to classify soybean cultivars. Therefore, the objectives of this study are (i) to verify which input dataset configuration (using only spectral bands, only vegetation indices, or both) is more accurate in the identification of soybean cultivars, and (ii) to verify which ML technique is more accurate in the identification of soybean cultivars. Information was extracted from five central irrigation pivots in the same region and with the same sowing date in the 2015/2016 crop year, in which each pivot was cultivated with a different cultivar, in which the cultivars used were: CV1-P98y12 RR, CV2-Desafio RR, CV3-M6410 IPRO, CV4-M7110 IPRO, and CV5-NA5909 RR. A cloud-free orbital image of the site was acquired from the Google Earth Engine platform. In addition to the spectral bands alone, a total of 13 vegetation indices were calculated. The models tested were: artificial neural networks (ANN), radial basis function network (RBF), decision tree algorithms J48 (DT) and reduced error pruning tree (REP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The five soybean cultivars were classified by the six-machine learning (ML) models in stratified randomized cross-validation with k-fold = 10 and 10 repetitions (100 runs for each model). After obtaining the r and MAE statistics, analysis of variance was performed considering a 6 x 3 factorial scheme (models versus inputs) with 10 repetitions (folds). The means were grouped by the Scott-Knott test at 5% probability. The spectral bands were the most accurate among the tested inputs in the identification of soybean cultivars. ANN was the most accurate model in identifying soybean cultivars.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Wildlife on Vegetation Cover Change, Northeast Namibia, Based on MODIS Satellite Imagery (2002-2021)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-wildlife conflict in the Zambezi region of northeast Namibia is well documented, but the impact of wildlife (e.g., elephants) on vegetation cover change has not been adequately addressed. Here, we assessed human-wildlife interaction and impact on vegetation cover change. We analyzed the 250 m MODIS and ERA5 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees drone and GPS-collar datasets. We used Time Series Segmented Residual Trends (TSS-RESTREND), Mann-Kendall Test Statistics, Sen's Slope, ensemble, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and Pearson correlation methods. Our results revealed (i) widespread vegetation browning along elephant migration routes and within National Parks, (ii) Pearson correlation (p-value = 5.5 x 10(-8)) showed that vegetation browning areas do not sustain high population densities of elephants. Currently, the Zambezi has about 12,008 elephants while these numbers were 1468, 7950, and 5242 in 1989, 1994, and 2005, respectively, (iii) settlements and artificial barriers have a negative impact on wildlife movement, driving vegetation browning, and (iv) vegetation greening was found mostly within communal areas where intensive farming and cattle grazing is a common practice. The findings of this study will serve as a reference for policy and decision makers. Future studies should consider integrating higher resolution multi-platform datasets for detailed micro analysis and mapping of vegetation cover change.

TI  - Geoscience-aware deep learning: A new paradigm for remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information extraction is a key activity for remote sensing images. A common distinction exists between knowledge-driven and data-driven methods. Knowledge-driven methods have advanced reasoning ability and interpretability, but have difficulty in handling complicated tasks since prior knowledge is usually limited when facing the highly complex spatial patterns and geoscience phenomena found in reality. Data-driven models, especially those emerging in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have achieved substantial progress in geoscience and remote sensing applications. Although DL models have powerful feature learning and representation capabilities, traditional DL has inherent problems including working as a black box and generally requiring a large number of labeled training data. The focus of this paper is on methods that integrate domain knowledge, such as geoscience knowledge and geoscience features (GK/GFs), into the design of DL models. The paper introduces the new paradigm of geoscience-aware deep learning (GADL), in which GK/GFs and DL models are combined deeply to extract information from remote sensing data. It first provides a comprehensive summary of GK/GFs used in GADL, which forms the basis for subsequent integration of GK/GFs with DL models. This is followed by a taxonomy of approaches for integrating GK/GFs with DL models. Several approaches are detailed using illustrative examples. Challenges and research prospects in GADL are then discussed. Developing more novel and advanced methods in GADL is expected to become the prevailing trend in advancing remotely sensed information extraction in the future.

TI  - The Feasibility of Sentinel Lymph-Node, Mapped with Indocyanine Green, Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives. Systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy (LND) is an essential part of lymph-node status evaluation in endometrial cancer (EC) patients to tailor the adjuvant treatment. However, it is associated with the post-operative lymphatic complications and does not improve the outcomes of the disease. Indocyanine green (ICG) mapped sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLB) has recently been introduced into the clinical practice as an alternative for the surgical lymph-node evaluation in EC patients with the potential to decrease LND related complications. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of ICG mapped SLB in low, intermediate, and high-risk EC patients in a center with no previous experience on endoscopic SLB procedure. Materials and Methods: The prospective study was performed. 170 patients with histologically confirmed EC were included. Sentinel lymph-nodes (SLs) were mapped with ICG dye and removed ahead of the total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Low-risk patients received only SLB, while SLB and LND were performed for intermediate and high-risk patients. Results: The overall detection rate of SLs was 88.8%. Bilateral mapping was achieved in 68.2% of the patients. The overall detection rate for low-risk patients was 93.7%, 85.0% for the intermediate-risk group, and 100% for high-risk patients (p = 0.232). The most common anatomical sites of SLs were the external iliac (45.8% on the right and 46.6% on the left) and obturator regions (20.9% and 25.6%, respectively). Positive lymph-nodes were found in 8 (4.7%) patients. The sensitivity of SLB was 75.0% and negative predictive value (NPV)-97.2%. Conclusions: Even in the center with no previous experience, sentinel lymph-node biopsy using ICG mapping is feasible. However, the favorable outcomes might be associated with the learning process of newly established method.

TI  - Estimating regional-scale daytime net surface radiation in cloudless skies from GEO-LEO satellite observations using data fusion approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Net surface radiation (R-n) at earth surface comprises of outgoing and incoming components of longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes at the surface. This influences energy and mass exchange over earth surface at sub-daily, seasonal and annual time scales. This is a critical component for land surface models which characterize climatic, ecological and biological processes. Measured net radiation datasets are rarely available and can be subjected to errors and high uncertainties due to equipment malfunctions and failure. In this study, a regional-scale model is developed and implemented to estimate the net surface radiation fluxes over Indian landmass under cloudless sky conditions using the data from an Indian Geostationary (GEO) Meteorological satellite (INSAT 3D) and polar-orbiting (LEO) MODIS-Aqua for daytime conditions. The estimates were evaluated over a 6-month period (Nov 2019-Apr 2020) during winter and summer months, at three in situ measurement sites, located in cropland and grassland. The results showed a correlation of 0.86 between satellite-based R-n estimates and in situ measurements with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 40.4 W m(-2) (4.6% of measured mean) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.6% of measured mean. The modelled estimates were compared with NCEP (National Center for Environmental Protection) reanalysis global surface radiation estimates diurnally. The NCEP model tends to under- or over-estimate during the study time period especially in the month of January.

TI  - Potential use of spectral analysis to delineate coastal boundary of a landmass based on estimation soil salinity and salt water intrusion: a preliminary result
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining coastal boundaries on land is essential to understanding the process of soil salinization. Once, It can be observed, and the coastal boundaries may help explain these areas' damage levels. This study aimed to observe the change in soil salinity and saltwater intrusion and use both values to determine the coastal boundaries in Subang, Indramayu, and Cirebon regencies. This study employed a multi-temporal data of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS satellite imageries (2009-2015), the water spectral reflectance collected from the field survey, and the elevation data to gain the elevation information. The corrected Landsat and water reflectance data were combined and processed to obtain the saltwater intrusion using soil salinity index (SSI), salinity index (SI), brightness index (BI), normalized difference salinity index (NDSI), soil salinity index (S SI), and water salinity index (WSI). Besides that, five linear and multiple regression equations as a semi-empirical model, namely saltwater intrusion index (SWII), are also used. Only BI, SSI, and two SWII models show reasonable saltwater intrusion with 44%, 24%, and 52% accuracy. These models with below 0.2 (dS/m) represented the non-saline, while others used the saline regime to determine the boundaries. The spatial distribution of saltwater intrusion may become unreliable since its accuracy does not always relate to the land cover. Since the acceptable models mostly elucidate that the entire region in Indramayu regency has been experiencing saltwater intrusion since 2015, the boundaries are far from the coastline.

TI  - Assessment of satellite orbit-drift artifacts in the long-term AVHRR FireCCILT11 global burned area data set
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent 1982-2018 FireCCILT11 burned area (BA) product derived from NOAA AVHRR data is examined with regard to its suitability for long-term BA analyses. We focus on identifying NOAA AVHRR satellite orbit-drift artifacts within the FireCCILT11 BA time series since the occurrence of such artifacts can render any BA data set inappropriate for long-term analyses. We show that significant orbit-drift artifacts are present in the FireCCILT11 product over numerous large spatial patches located on every continent except Antarctica. In addition, the BA mapped by the FireCCILT11 in the United States is compared to independent ground-based records compiled by the National Interagency Fire Center. Prior to 2001, the FireCCILT11 product drastically overestimated BA within this region, to the point of falsely suggesting an abrupt radical change in fire regime at the turn of the century. Our findings indicate that caution is required when using the FireCCILT11 product for longterm BA studies, particularly within the tropics or the United States for the periods 1982-2000 and 2018. Studies requiring gridded BA data for these years, particularly at local and regional scales, should explicitly consider AVHRR orbit-drift artifacts that may result in FireCCILT11-reported BA that is substantially different (for example, several times greater) than the actual BA.

TI  - Periostin in lymph node pre-metastatic niches governs lymphatic endothelial cell functions and metastatic colonization
T2  - CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although lymph node (LN) metastasis is an important prognostic parameter in cervical cancer, the tissue remodeling at a pre-metastatic state is poorly documented in LNs. We here identified periostin (POSTN) as a component of non-metastatic LNs by applying proteomic analyses and computerized image quantifications on LNs of patients with cervical cancer. We provide evidence for remarkable modifications of POSTN and lymphatic vessel distributions and densities in non-metastatic sentinel and metastatic human LNs, when compared to distant non-metastatic LNs. POSTN deposition at a pre-metastatic stage was demonstrated in a pre-clinical murine model (the ear sponge assay). Its expression by fibroblastic LN cells was assessed by in situ hybridization and in vitro cultures. In vitro, POSTN promoted lymphatic endothelial cell functions and tumor cell proliferation. Accordingly, the in vivo injection of recombinant POSTN together with VEGF-C boosted the lymphangiogenic response, while the metastatic potential of tumor cells was drastically reduced using a POSTN blocking antibody. This translational study also supports the existence of an unprecedented dialog "in cascade", between the primary tumor and the first pelvic nodal relay in early cervical cancer, and subsequently from pelvic LN to para-aortic LNs in locally advanced cervical cancers. Collectively, this work highlights the association of POSTN deposition with lymphangiogenesis in LNs, and provides evidence for a key contribution of POSTN in promoting VEGF-C driven lymphangiogenesis and the seeding of metastatic cells.

TI  - The Use of the Exploratory Sequential Approach in Mixed-Method Research: A Case of Contextual Top Leadership Interventions in Construction H&S
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality and rigour remain central to the methodological process in research. The use of qualitative and quantitative methods in a single study was justified here against using a single method; the empirical output from the literature review should direct the current worldview and, subsequently, the methodologies applied in research. It is critical to gather contextual behavioural data from subject matter experts-this helps establish context and confirm the hypotheses arising from the literature, which leads to the refinement of the theory's applicability for developing a conceptual model. This paper identified the top leaders in construction organisations as subject matter experts. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted, representing the South African construction industry grading. The output of the refined hypothesis was followed by a survey that targeted n = 182 multi-level senior leaders to gather further perspectives and validate the conceptual model. The outcome resulting from the rigorous validation process adopted-the analysis process, which included Spearman rank correlation, ordinal logistic regression and multinomial generalised linear modelling-demonstrated that the lack of H&S commitment in top leadership persists, despite high awareness of the cruciality of H&S in their organisations. Contextual competence, exaggerated by the local setting, is one source of this deficiency. This paper provides guidelines for using the exploratory sequential approach in mixed-method research to effectively deal with contextual issues based on non-parametric modelling data in top leadership H&S interventions.

TI  - Carbon fluxes from contemporary forest disturbances in North Carolina evaluated using a grid-based carbon accounting model and fine resolution remote sensing products
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change is a key component in terrestrial carbon cycle, yet there are still large uncertainties in the terrestrial carbon budget. To reduce such uncertainties and refine the spatial distribution of carbon flux, a 30-m Grid-based Carbon Accounting (GCA) model was proposed. We adapted a well-established bookkeeping model into a spatial-explicit model to utilize Landsat time series stacks and to calculate the carbon fluxes resulting from three types of forest disturbances including forest harvesting, forest-to-urban conversion, and fire. Our model results provide spatial details at sub-ha scale that are crucial for carbon management at individual landowner levels. Sensitivity analysis revealed that both pre-disturbance forest carbon and disturbance intensity had large impact on carbon flux estimates arising from forest disturbances that occurred between 1986 and 2010 in North Carolina. At the state level, forest harvesting and fire from 1986 to 2010 released 88.5 MT and 1.6 MT carbon respectively. During the same period, regrowing trees over the logged area absorbed 142.7 MT carbon while those over burned area absorbed 1.6 MT more. The net flux from harvesting, fire, and post-disturbance growth was -52.5 MT. Conversion of forest to urban resulted in a net source of 5.3 MT. Overall, the areas subject to the three types of disturbances and post-disturbance growth was a net sink of 47.2 MT carbon over the entire study period. While our modeling framework was tested at the 30 m spatial resolution in this study, it can be adapted for use with finer spatial and/or temporal resolution remote sensing products that will become more readily available in the coming years, thus further improve the carbon flux estimates.

TI  - Salinization of Soils in the Don Valley under Conditions of Terminated Irrigation
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a study for the identification of the current salt state of the soils of the General Irrigation System built near the Tsimlyansk reservoir in 1959 in the dry-steppe zone of Volgograd oblast in the Don Valley. The system is currently in a 30-year irrigation shutdown period. In the interpolation study, soil-salinity maps that cover different soil depths were constructed. They are based on field surveys and water-extract data (1 : 5) from soil samples taken in 2020. Water-extract data obtained at the Volgograd Hydrogeological and Land Reclamation Expedition in 2018 were also used. The key area of study was located on the second floodplain left-bank terrace of the Don River and included a territory in which a high groundwater level (1.5-3 m) with strong mineralization (3-10 g/L) formed by the beginning of the 1990s during a long period of irrigation. This led to the formation of a meadow solonchak and secondary saline soils with a high degree of salinity, which prompted us to map the salinity of soils in this area and to determine the changes over the past period. Analysis of the soil-salinity maps made it possible to assess the current salt state of soils located on various relief elements of the second terrace of the Don River and to compare the current salt state of soils with the period of the late 1980s-early 1990s, which showed a gradual desalinization of previously saline areas and the development of alkalization of the upper soil horizons. The desalinization was caused by the cessation of irrigation, and alkalization was caused by the location of the general system in the solonetz zone, the long period of irrigation from 1960 to 1992, and irrigation from the Tsimlyansk reservoir with water with a high sodium concentration. Salinity maps showing the depth of the salt horizon provide information necessary for the development and selection of optimal reclamation measures to restore the soil fertility. Preliminary recommendations for the solution of this problem upon the resumption of can include quality control of the irrigation water, the use of periodic (once every several years) water-charging spring washing of the 0- to 70-cm layer to push accumulated salts out of the aeration zone, gypsum to ensure the displacement of exchangeable sodium, suppression of the alkalinity and the removal of water-soluble sodium to the underlying horizons beyond the root layer, the use of drip irrigation, and an increase in the share of perennial legumes and cereals in the structure of sown areas. The article also shows that the spectral indices given in the literature cannot be used to determine the soil salinity from space information in relation to the selected study area. This was confirmed with multiple regression analysis, in which the values of the spectral indices in four image channels from the Sentinel-2 satellite and the salinity values of different soil horizons at the sampling points obtained as a result of field and laboratory work were used as features. According to the results of regression analysis, no significant relationship between the spectral indices and salinity values was revealed in any soil horizon. The resulting correlation coefficients were less than 0.5, and, hence, the relationship was very low.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms for Biophysical Classification of Lithuanian Lakes Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters are dynamic systems that are under pressure from anthropogenic activities, thus constant observation of these waters is essential. Remote sensing provides a great opportunity to have frequent observations of inland waters. The aim of this study was to create a data-driven model that uses a machine learning algorithm and Sentinel-2 data to classify lake observations into four biophysical classes: Clear, Moderate, Chla-dominated, and Turbid. We used biophysical variables such as water transparency, chlorophyll concentration, and suspended matter to define these classes. We tested six machine learning algorithms that use spectral features of lakes as input and chose random forest classifiers, which yielded the most accurate results. We applied our two-step model on 19,292 lake spectra for the years 2015-2020, from 226 lakes. The prevalent class in 67% of lakes was Clear, while 19% of lakes were likely affected by strong algal blooms (Chla-dominated class). The models created in this study can be applied to lakes in other regions where similar lake classes are found. Biophysical lake classification using Sentinel-2 MSI data can help to observe long-term and short-term changes in lakes, thus it can be a useful tool for water management experts and for the public.

TI  - Optimizing ExoMars Rover Remote Sensing Multispectral Science: Cross-Rover Comparison Using Laboratory and Orbital Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral imaging instruments have been core payload components of Mars lander and rover missions for several decades. In order to place into context the future performance of the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the spectral performance of three visible and near-infrared (VNIR) multispectral instruments. We have determined the root mean square error (RMSE) between the expected multispectral sampling of the instruments and high-resolution spectral reflectance data, using both laboratory spectral libraries and Mars orbital hyperspectral data. ExoMars Panoramic Camera (PanCam) and Mars2020 Perseverance Mastcam-Z instruments have similar values of RMSE, and are consistently lower than for Mars Science Laboratory Mastcam, across both laboratory and orbital remote sensing data sets. The performance across mineral groups is similar across all instruments, with the lowest RMSE values for hematite, basalt, and basaltic soil. Minerals with broader, or absent, absorption features in these visible wavelengths, such as olivine, saponite, and vermiculite have overall larger RMSE values. Instrument RMSE as a function of filter wavelength and bandwidth suggests that spectral parameters that use shorter wavelengths are likely to perform better. Our simulations of the spectral performance of the PanCam instrument will allow the future use of targeted filter selection during ExoMars 2022 Rosalind Franklin operations on Mars.Plain Language Summary Mars landers and rovers tend to carry camera instruments that record images at a range of different wavelengths. Such multispectral instruments can be used to help determine the composition of the surface, and guide both scientific analyses and mission operations. Subtle differences in the exact wavelengths that are sampled on different instruments mean that comparison across missions is not straightforward. In this study we simulate the performance of three different multispectral camera instruments: ExoMars Panoramic Camera (PanCam), Mars Science Laboratory Mastcam, and Mars2020 Perseverance Mastcam-Z. We compare the ability of each instrument to determine the true spectral response for both laboratory data compiled into spectral libraries, and for hyperspectral data recorded of the surface of Mars. We find that the choice of filters for PanCam and Mastcam-Z result in similar performance between these two instruments, with both apparently performing better than Mastcam. This study will allow more confident comparison of results from across instruments, and help the development of best practice for the future use of the ExoMars PanCam instrument.

TI  - PolSAR Ship Detection Based on a SIFT-like PolSAR Keypoint Detector
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of ships on the open sea is an important issue for both military and civilian fields. As an active microwave imaging sensor, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a useful device in marine supervision. To extract small and weak ships precisely in the marine areas, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data have been used more and more widely. We propose a new PolSAR ship detection method which is based on a keypoint detector, referred to as a PolSAR-SIFT keypoint detector, and a patch variation indicator in this paper. The PolSAR-SIFT keypoint detector proposed in this paper is inspired by the SAR-SIFT keypoint detector. We improve the gradient definition in the SAR-SIFT keypoint detector to adapt to the properties of PolSAR data by defining a new gradient based on the distance measurement of polarimetric covariance matrices. We present the application of PolSAR-SIFT keypoint detector to the detection of ship targets in PolSAR data by combining the PolSAR-SIFT keypoint detector with the patch variation indicator we proposed before. The keypoints extracted by the PolSAR-SIFT keypoint detector are usually located in regions with corner structures, which are likely to be ship regions. Then, the patch variation indicator is used to characterize the context information of the extracted keypoints, and the keypoints located on the sea area are filtered out by setting a constant false alarm rate threshold for the patch variation indicator. Finally, a patch centered on each filtered keypoint is selected. Then, the detection statistics in the patch are calculated. The detection statistics are binarized according to the local threshold set by the detection statistic value of the keypoint to complete the ship detection. Experiments on three data sets obtained from the RADARSAT-2 and AIRSAR quad-polarization data demonstrate that the proposed detector is effective for ship detection.

TI  - Satellite On-Board Change Detection via Auto-Associative Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in remote sensing satellite imagery with high spatial and temporal resolutions has enabled the development of a wide variety of applications for Earth observation and monitoring. At the same time, it requires new techniques that are able to manage the amount of data stored and transmitted to the ground. Advanced techniques for on-board data processing answer this problem, offering the possibility to select only the data of interest for a specific application or to extract specific information from data. However, the computational resources that exist on-board are limited compared to the ground segment availability. Alternatively, in applications such as change detection, only images containing changes are useful and worth being stored and sent to the ground. In this paper, we propose a change detection scheme that could be run on-board. It relies on a feature-based representation of the acquired images which is obtained by means of an auto-associative neural network (AANN). Once the AANN is trained, the dissimilarity between two images is evaluated in terms of the extracted features. This information can be subsequently turned into a change detection result. This study, which presents one of the first techniques for on-board change detection, yielded encouraging results on a set of Sentinel-2 images, even in light of comparison with a benchmark technique.

TI  - Semi-Supervised Cloud Detection in Satellite Images by Considering the Domain Shift Problem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In terms of semi-supervised cloud detection work, efforts are being made to learn a promising cloud detection model via a limited number of pixel-wise labeled images and a large number of unlabeled ones. However, remote sensing images obtained from the same satellite sensor often show a data distribution drift problem due to the different cloud shapes and land-cover types on the Earth's surface. Therefore, there are domain distribution gaps between labeled and unlabeled satellite images. To solve this problem, we take the domain shift problem into account for the semi-supervised learning (SSL) network. Feature-level and output-level domain adaptations are applied to reduce the domain distribution gaps between labeled and unlabeled images, thus improving predicted results accuracy of the SSL network. Experimental results on Landsat-8 OLI and GF-1 WFV multispectral images demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised cloud detection network (SSCDnet) is able to achieve promising cloud detection performance when using a limited number of labeled samples and outperforms several state-of-the-art SSL methods.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variation Characteristics and Influencing Factors of Soil Moisture in the Yellow River Basin Using ESA CCI SM Products
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in regulating terrestrial-atmospheric water circulation and energy balance. Most of the existing studies have explored the dynamic patterns of SM based on experimental methods. However, the analysis of large-scale regions and long-term SM sequences was limited. Alternatively, satellite remote sensing data is a potential source for SM analysis for large-scale basins. Therefore, the SM data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) from 2000 to 2015 is used in this paper to analyze the SM spatial-temporal changes in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Further, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and meteorological data are used to explore the relationships between SM and NDVI, precipitation, air temperature, and wind speed, respectively. The results showed that the overall trend of SM in the YRB was decreasing from southeast to northwest during the past 16 years. The upper reaches of the YRB had shown a humid trend, with a value of 0.00047 m(3)center dot m(-3)center dot year(-1), mainly due to the increase in precipitation; there was an obvious drought trend in the middle reaches of the YRB, especially in Shanxi Province and Henan Province, with a value of -0.00030 m(3)center dot m(-3)center dot year(-1), which may be owed to vegetation greening increasing the soil evaporation. Overall, it is determined that the main factors influencing SM changes were NDVI and precipitation, followed by air temperature and wind speed. This study can provide a scientific basis for the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics and attributions of SM in the YRB over a long time series.

TI  - Optical Spectrometer Design of Combined Unfolded Czerny-Turner Spectrometer Sharing One Common Linear-array Detector
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Czerny Turner spectrometer has been found for widespread application in the detection of Raman, fluorescence, and atmospheric remote sensing because of its simple structure and high resolution. The conventional Czerny Turner configuration also known as unfolded C-T spectrometer, consists of two concave mirrors where the light path has no folded part. It can detect a wide range of light, so it is very suitable for dual band detection. Dual band spectral detection is mostly used for dual channel spectral detection systems in the visible infrared band, dual wavelength excitation particle fluorescence spectrometer. However, for dual-band or multi-band detection, the spectrometer based on the Czerny-Turner structure often needs to be deformed, and the detector is always selected as area array detectors and detectors even need more than one. It makes the structure of the system more complex and increases the cost. Considering that linear array detectors are more beneficial than planar array detectors for the detection of one-dimensional spectral information, and linear array photomultiplier tube has higher detection efficiency for weak signals and has been verified for effectiveness in the dual-laser-induced fluorescence detection system. We proposed a modified optical design of a combined unfolded Czerny-Turner Spectrometer sharing one common linear-array detector. In the proposed design, the astigmatism of the system is controlled by using divergent illumination on the grating without introducing any additional optical elements, which is used for the correction of astigmatism in the Czerny-Turner spectrometer. By considering the condition of sharing one detector and the astigmatism correction method of the illuminating grating, the proposed design method of the system is provided, and the proposed design method of the system is provided. Zemax is used for simulation and optimization of the proposed optical system model. The spectrometer can detect two bands of light i. e., 280 similar to 460 nm and 380 similar to 560 nm. We have also analyzed the reciprocal linear dispersion, which demonstrates that the reciprocal linear dispersion at the central wavelength of two wavebands are 6.03 nm/mm, 6.10 nm/mm, respectively. That means the proposed system satisfies the spectral resolution of 6 nm, and the spectral resolution difference of the two spectrometers in a whole working band is less than 0.6 nm. Finally, the RMS spot size of the system is also analyzed theoretically. In the first band (i.e., 280 similar to 460 nm) the maximum RMS spot is 67.1 mu m at 280 nm, while in the second band (i.e., 380 similar to 560 nm) the maximum RMS spot is 53.2 mu m at 560 nm. The 80% range of RMS spot radius is less than 50 mu m in these two bands. In view of the design and simulation results, the prototype model is developed and the experimental verification finished. Mercury lamp was used for the optical inlet of spectrometer as a light source, and the experimental results were obtained by 32 linear array photomultiplier tube , the results demonstrate that the positions of several spectrum peaks detected are consistent with the simulation. This proposed method extends the application of the system structure with two light paths and one common linear detector in the elaborate and expensive designs , which may be beneficial for the non-imaging design of dual-waveband spectral systems.

TI  - Synchronization, Decoupling, and Regime Shift of Urban Thermal Conditions in Xi'an, an Ancient City in China under Rapid Expansion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has profound impacts on economic development and environmental quality. Some of the serious consequences of urbanization are the changes in the thermal environment, which directly affect the greater environment and quality of life. Although many studies have been performed on urban heat islands, few have specifically examined the thermal evolution of rapidly expanding ancient cities and the impacts of urbanization on the thermal environments of important heritage sites. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of the thermal environment quantified as the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and land surface temperature (LST) values from 2000 to 2018 in Xi'an, an ancient city with rich cultural heritage in China. Specifically, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the thermal environments of the functional zones and heritage sites and explore their coupling relationships with the overall temperature of the study area using a statistical analysis approach. Furthermore, we revealed time-sensitive changes in temperature regimes using the newly proposed double temperature curve approach (DTCA). The results showed that the heat island phenomenon has been intensifying in Xi'an, as evidenced by the summer daytime mean SUHI values being greater than 7 degrees C continuously since 2010 and the increased frequency of high-intensity SUHI effects. Extreme heat conditions were more frequent in the old urban area (built-up and in existence before 2000) than in the new urban area, while SUHI values in the new area deteriorated more rapidly. The changes in temperature in the functional zones were strongly synchronized with the overall temperature changes in Xi'an, and the temperature differences increased linearly with the overall temperature. The LST values in the four major historical heritage sites investigated in this study were 2-8 degrees C higher than the background temperature and were decoupled from background temperature changes. From the DTCA, we found the time periods of the thermal environment regime changes for each functional zone or heritage site, which were largely the result of policy guidance. Regional synchronization, site decoupling, and regime shifts in LST suggest opportunities for regional planning and urban landscape optimization to reduce adverse effects of urbanization on the urban environment, particularly in cities with rich historical heritage sites.

TI  - Detection of thermal pollution of urban reservoirs using the method of IR-radiometry based on the example of the Lake Kenon, Zabaykalsky Krai
T2  - NEXO REVISTA CIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Water bodies (e.g., rivers, lakes, and reservoirs) are an integral part of the urban environment. The infrastructure of the city affects their condition, in particular, pollution, including heat, which can lead to an increase in phyto- and zooplankton, including blue-green algae, and the appearance of toxins in the water. Identification of places where warm water is discharged into reservoirs is an urgent task. One of the methods of solving this problem is the monitoring of reservoirs from space. Thus, with the help of infrared satellite images, thermal anomalies are visible. In the work, we studied Lake Kenon located in the city of Chita. The satellite images were obtained from the Lansat-8. The channels used were 10 and 11, with a resolution of 60 meters. We revealed that (1) the optimal time for detecting thermal anomalies is the time before freezing in calm weather; (2) the cause of the thermal anomaly of this reservoir is a thermal power plant; (3) analysis of the last 5 years has shown that the water area with an increased surface temperature of the reservoir does not change; (4) the temperature gradient between cold and warm areas is 5 degrees C; (5) the area of the heat spot does not exceed 10% of the total area of the lake. The above conclusions were confirmed using field measurements.

TI  - Delineating the Crop-Land Dynamic due to Extreme Environment Using Landsat Datasets: A Case Study
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme climatic conditions and natural hazard-related phenomenon have been affecting coastal regions and riverine areas. Floods, cyclones, and climate change phenomena have hammered the natural environment and increased the land dynamic, socio-economic vulnerability, and food scarcity. Saltwater intrusion has also triggered cropland vulnerability and, therefore, increased the area of inland brackish water fishery. The cropland area has decreased due to low soil fertility; around 252.06 km(2) of cropland area has been lost, and 326.58 km(2) of water bodies or inland fishery area has been added in just thirty years in the selected blocks of the North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India. After saltwater intrusion, soil fertility appears to have been decreased and crop production has been greatly reduced. The cropland areas were 586.52 km(2) (1990), 419.92 km(2) (2000), 361.67 km(2) (2010) and 334.46 km(2) (2020). Gradually the water body areas were increased 156.21 km(2) (1990), 328.15 km(2) (2000), 397.77 km(2) (2010) and 482.78 km(2) (2020). The vegetated land area also decreased due to it being converted into inland fishery areas, and around 79.15 km(2) were degraded during the last thirty years. The super cyclone Aila, along with other super cyclones and other environmental stresses, like water-logging, soil salinity, and irrigation water scarcity were the reasons for the development of the new fishery areas in the selected blocks. There is a need for proper planning for sustainable development of this area.

TI  - Quantifying Water Consumption through the Satellite Estimation of Land Use/Land Cover and Groundwater Storage Changes in a Hyper-Arid Region of Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the areas that show the most visible effects of human-induced land alterations is also the world's most essential resource: water. Decision-makers in arid regions face considerable difficulties in providing and maintaining sustainable water resource management. However, developing appropriate and straightforward approaches for quantifying water use in arid/hyper-arid regions is still a formidable challenge. Meanwhile, a better knowledge of the effects of land use land cover (LULC) changes on natural resources and environmental systems is required. The purpose of this study was to quantify the water consumption in a hyper-arid region (New Valley, Egypt) using two different approaches-LULC based on optical remote sensing data and groundwater storage changes based on Gravity Recovery Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data-and to compare and contrast the quantitative results of the two approaches. The LULC of the study area was constructed from 1986 to 2021 to identify the land cover changes and investigate the primary water consumption patterns. The analysis of groundwater storage changes utilized two GRACE mascon solutions from 2002 to 2021 in New Valley. The results showed an increase in agricultural areas in New Valley's oases. They also showed an increased in irrigation water usage and a continuous decrease in the groundwater storage of New Valley. The overall water usage in New Valley for domestic and irrigation was calculated as 18.62 km(3) (0.93 km(3)/yr) based on the LULC estimates. Moreover, the groundwater storage changes of New Valley were extracted using GRACE and calculated to be 19.36 +/- 7.96 km(3) (0.97 +/- 0.39 km(3)/yr). The results indicated that the water use calculated from LULC was consistent with the depletion in groundwater storage calculated by applying GRACE. This study provides an essential reference for regional sustainability and water resource management in arid/hyper-arid regions.

TI  - Influence of Climate and Coastal Flooding on Eastern Red Cedar Growth along a Marsh-Forest Ecotone
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal forests in the Mid-Atlantic region are threatened by sea level rise through chronic and episodic salinization and hydrologic alterations, leading to inland marsh migration and the occurrence of ghost forests. This study uses dendrochronology to explore the impact of rising sea level on the annual growth of Juniperus virginiana (the Eastern red cedar) at the St. Jones component of the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve in Dover, DE. Chronologies from low and high elevations were developed, and a difference chronology (high-low) was generated. A rapid field assessment of tree stress indicated greater stress in low elevation trees, and low elevation soil tests showed higher soil moisture and salt content compared to samples from high elevation. Ring width indices were analyzed in relation to water level, precipitation, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, and temperature, with Pearson's correlation analysis. Trees growing at low elevation showed greater climate sensitivity and responded favorably to cool, wet summers. Over time, correlations between growth and climate variables decreased, while negative correlations with tidal water level increased-a pattern that presented nearly a decade earlier in the low elevation system. Given the widespread distribution of the Eastern red cedar and its sensitivity to changes in sea level, this species may be particularly useful as a sentinel of change in coastal landscapes as sea levels rise.

TI  - Remote Sensing Analysis of Ecological Maintenance in Subtropical Coastal Mountain Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain areas in China account for 69% of the total land area; however, it is still an urgent that we grasp the special ecological structure of mountain areas and maximize the resource advantages of mountain areas under the principle of maintaining a certain ecological level. In this paper, Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A images were used as data sources to monitor and analyze land development and ecological change in Gui 'an in 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2021, so as to explore ecological maintenance mechanisms. Firstly, random forest classification based on multi-source remote sensing data was used to classify land, and the five phases of land-use change were assessed using quantitative analysis, in order to analyze the mountain region's land-use-change characteristics at different stages of development. The results show that Gui 'an has the "two-stage", rapid-development, rapid-recovery mode. Each stage includes a development-and-expansion period and a construction-and-protection period. In the construction period, ecological recovery construction will be emphasized, and the change intensity and rate of the second stage are lower than that of the first stage. Secondly, using a remote sensing ecological index, vegetation coverage, and a landscape index, an ecological evaluation model of the study area was constructed to analyze changes in the ecological environment and its protection in the process of land development. The ecological maintenance status of the five stages was quantitatively monitored using the analysis methods of difference change and coefficient of variation. The results showed that in the first stage of land development and expansion, the landscape pattern and ecological quality fluctuated greatly, and the proportion of ecological quality of an excellent grade decreased by 28.46%. However, in the second stage, the change slowed down and remained unchanged, and gradually moved to the middle and upper level. The results show that there is a close relationship between ecological maintenance and the land development mode, and new mountain towns can maintain ecological quality and achieve sustainable development through a reasonable land development mode. At the end of this paper, the factors affecting the ecological maintenance capacity of Gui 'an are discussed, providing effective reference material and development models for the development of mountainous areas.

TI  - Long-Term Effects of Fire Severity and Climatic Factors on Post-Forest-Fire Vegetation Recovery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a major disturbance to forest ecosystems, wildfires pose a serious threat to the ecological environment. Monitoring post-fire vegetation recovery is critical to quantifying the effects of wildfire on ecosystems and conducting forest resource management. Most previous studies have analyzed short-term (less than five years) post-fire recovery and limited the driving factors to temperature and precipitation. The lack of long-term and multi-faceted observational analyses has limited our understanding of the long-term effects of fire on vegetation recovery. This study utilized multi-source remote sensing data for a long time series analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery in China based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) were selected to quantify the low, moderate, and high severity of burned areas. Ridge Regression Model (RRM) was used to analyze the relationship between 15 driving factors and the vegetation regeneration process. The results show that it took at least 7-10 years for the vegetation index to recover to the pre-fire level after a forest fire. The recovery rate of high severity combustion areas was the fastest within the first two years. From the results of Ridge Regression, it came out that the overall fitting degree of the model with NDVI as the dependent variable was superior than that with EVI. The four variables of temperature, precipitation, soil temperature, and soil moisture were able to explain the change in more detail in vegetation indices. Our study enriches the research cases of global forest fires and vegetation recovery, provides a scientific basis for the sustainable development of forest ecosystems in China, and provides insight into environmental issues and resource management.

TI  - Water Deficit May Cause Vegetation Browning in Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is consistent evidence of vegetation greening in Central Asia over the past four decades. However, in the early 1990s, the greening temporarily stagnated and even for a time reversed. In this study, we evaluate changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the long-term satellite-derived remote sensing data systems of the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI from 1981 to 2013 and MODIS NDVI from 2000 to 2020 to determine whether the vegetation in Central Asia has browned. Our findings indicate that the seasonal sequence of NDVI is summer > spring > autumn > winter, and the spatial distribution pattern is a semicircular distribution, with the Aral Sea Basin as its core and an upward tendency from inside to outside. Around the mid-1990s, the region's vegetation experienced two climatic environments with opposing trends (cold and wet; dry and hot). Prior to 1994, NDVI increased substantially throughout the growth phase (April-October), but this trend reversed after 1994, when vegetation began to brown. Our findings suggest that changes in vegetation NDVI are linked to climate change induced by increased CO2. The state of water deficit caused by temperature changes is a major cause of the browning turning point across the study area. At the same time, changes in vegetation NDVI were consistent with changes in drought degree (PDSI). This research is relevant for monitoring vegetation NDVI and carbon neutralization in Central Asian ecosystems.

TI  - Generating continuous fine-scale land cover mapping by edge-guided maximum a posteriori based spatiotemporal sub-pixel mapping
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land cover mapping activities are of great important for retrieving the environment we are living in. However, the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution makes it difficult to obtain the continuous fine scale land cover product for detail and frequent land surface analysis. To overcome the difficulty, this study proposed a modified maximum a posteriori (MAP) based spatiotemporal sub-pixel mapping (SSM), for a longterm and fine-scale land cover mapping. The proposed approach consists of three parts, i.e., data fidelity term, spatial regularization term, and enhanced temporal regularization term, which can make use of historical fine-scale image for a better super-resolution of the current coarse image. One regional experiment was implemented for the algorithm validation, and one real experiment was investigated, by generating continuous land cover mapping products (2010-2015) at Landsat-like spatial resolution from time series of MODIS images. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach reconstructed more pleasant spatial details and had greater quantitative accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal sub-pixel mapping method by averagely 2.58% for all the inspected dates in OA metric. This study not only provides a generalized research framework for generating continuous fine-scale land cover product from daily available MODIS images, but also validates the usability of the time series products for detail land cover monitoring, and reveals a finding that the study area of Wuhan is a well practitioner of the sustainable development policy during its urbanization process.

TI  - Identification of Radioactive Mineralized Lithology and Mineral Prospectivity Mapping Based on Remote Sensing in High-Latitude Regions: A Case Study on the Narsaq Region of Greenland
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The harsh environment of high-latitude areas with large amounts of snow and ice cover makes it difficult to carry out full geological field surveys. Uranium resources are abundant within the Ilimaussaq Complex in the Narsaq region of Greenland, where the uranium ore body is strictly controlled by the Lujavrite formation, which is the main ore-bearing rock in the complex rock mass. Further, large aggregations of radioactive minerals appear as thermal anomalies on remote sensing thermal infrared imagery, which is indicative of deposits of highly radioactive elements. Using a weight-of-evidence analysis method that combines machine-learned lithological classification information with information on surface temperature thermal anomalies, the prediction of radioactive element-bearing deposits at high latitudes was carried out. Through the use of Worldview-2 (WV-2) remote sensing images, support vector machine algorithms based on texture features and topographic features were used to identify Lujavrite. In addition, the distribution of thermal anomalies associated with radioactive elements was inverted using Landsat 8 TIRS thermal infrared data. From the results, it was found that the overall accuracy of the SVM algorithm-based lithology mapping was 89.57%. The surface temperature thermal anomaly had a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.63 with the total airborne measured uranium gamma radiation. The lithological classification information was integrated with surface temperature thermal anomalies and other multi-source remote sensing mineralization elements to calculate mineralization-favorable areas through a weight-of-evidence model, with high-value mineralization probability areas being spatially consistent with known mineralization areas. In conclusion, a multifaceted remote sensing information finding method, focusing on surface temperature thermal anomalies in high-latitude areas, provides guidance and has reference value for the exploration of potential mineralization areas for deposits containing radioactive elements.

TI  - Sensitivity Testing of Microwave Temperature Sounder-II Onboard the Fengyun-3 Satellite to Sea Surface Barometric Pressure Based on Deep Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface barometric pressure contributes to calculating the surface transmissivity so that the observations of Microwave Temperature Sounder-II channels with non-zero surface transmissivity contain the sea surface barometric pressure information. Meanwhile, all channels of Microwave Temperature Sounder-II are sensitive to sea surface barometric pressure due to the correlation between channels. However, the traditional sensitivity test method based on the radiative transfer model cannot characterize the sensitivity of Microwave Temperature Sounder-II to sea surface barometric pressure due to the correlations between channels. In this study, the relationship between atmospheric parameters and Microwave Temperature Sounder-II observations is studied by a deep neural network, and the deep neural network-based model for Microwave Temperature Sounder-II simulations is established. Then, the deep neural network-based test method for the sensitivity of Microwave Temperature Sounder-II to sea surface barometric pressure is developed, and the sensitivity test experiments are carried out. The experimental results show that the sensitivity of all channels of Microwave Temperature Sounder-II to sea surface barometric pressure is captured by the deep neural network-based test method. In addition, the retrieval experiments of sea surface barometric pressure using Microwave Temperature Sounder-II observations are carried out, and the retrieval results further validate the feasibility of the deep neural network-based test method.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Analysis of the Urban Heat Island Using Satellite Images: Capitals of Andalusia
T2  - ACE-ARCHITECTURE CITY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for new techniques that make it possible to determine economically and precisely the phenomenon of urban climate alteration called Urban Heat Istand (ICU) has become one of the great challenges of society. Their knowledge of cities would allow the implementation of mitigation and resilience measures that tend to minimize their effects and the economic cost that they entail. In this research, the Terrestrial Surface Temperature (TST) and the ICU have been determined through Sentinel 3 satellite images of the eight capitals of Andalusia (Spain) during the year 2020. These are located in an area classified as highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which, together with the use of local climate zones (ZCL), allows the results to be extrapolated to other cities with the same types of climate zones. The results obtained indicate that during the morning there is an urban cooling island with an average temperature of -0.76 degrees C and during the night an ICU with an average temperature of 1.29 degrees C. Both present higher intensities in compact ZCL of medium and low density in contrast to open and industrial ZCL. The seasonal variability of the diurnal ICU is intensified during the summer and winter and the nocturnal one during the winter and autumn. The existence of negative diurnal relationships significant at 99% (p <0.01) between the ICU and environmental contamination and of nocturnal relationships in the same conditions between the ICU and the TST, plant fraction (Pv) and contamination are verified.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study mapped and analyzed urban tree canopy change between 2014 and 2019 within the Urban Development Boundary of Miami-Dade County, Florida. The goal was to identify local areas of tree canopy gain or loss over this 5-year period. The comparison is based on land cover maps delineated from WorldView-2 satellite data applying a random forest classification algorithm, in combination with publicly available vector data of infrastructure (roads, railroads) and land use maps (water, cropland). Existing urban tree canopy (EUTC) was computed for census block groups and municipalities to compare tree canopy cover loss or gain to support strategic planning of equitable urban reforestation. For the entire study area, the percentage of EUTC did not change significantly between 2014 (19.9 +/- 1.2%) and 2019 (20.1 +/- 1.5%). However, some municipalities experienced changes in EUTC by over 10%. Comparison of Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared satellite imagery between both periods identified land cover change patterns that were associated with an increase or decrease in surface temperature. A significantly negative relationship between percentage of African American population and tree canopy in 2014 turned statistically insignificant in 2019, whereas the negative relationship with percentage of Hispanic population further strengthened in 2019 compared to 2014.

TI  - Land Use Dynamic Changes in an Arid Inland River Basin Based on Multi-Scenario Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tarim River Basin is the largest inland river basin in China. It is located in an extremely arid region, where agriculture and animal husbandry are the main development industries. The recent rapid rise in population and land demand has intensified the competition for urban land use, making the water body ecosystem increasingly fragile. In light of these issues, it is important to comprehensively grasp regional land structure changes, improve the degree of land use, and reasonably allocate water resources to achieve the sustainable development of both the social economy and the ecological environment. This study uses the CA-Markov model, the PLUS model and the gray prediction model to simulate and validate land use/cover change (LUCC) in the Tarim River Basin, based on remote sensing data. The aim of this research is to discern the dynamic LUCC patterns and predict the evolution of future spatial and temporal patterns of land use. The study results show that grassland and barren land are currently the main land types in the Tarim River Basin. Furthermore, the significant expansion of cropland area and reduction in barren land area are the main characteristics of the changes during the study period (1992-2020), when about 1.60% of grassland and 1.36% of barren land converted to cropland. Over the next 10 years, we anticipate that land-use types in the basin will be dominated by changes in grassland and barren land, with an increasing trend in land area other than for cropland and barren land. Grassland will add 31,241.96 km2, mainly in the Dina River and the lower parts of the Weigan-Kuqu, Kashgar, Kriya, and Qarqan rivers, while barren land will decline 2.77%, with significant decreases in the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River Basin. The findings of this study will provide a solid scientific basis for future land resource planning.

TI  - Evaluating the Vulnerability of Siberian Crane Habitats and the Influences of Water Level Intervals in Poyang Lake Wetland, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological situations of wetlands are critical to the habitat qualities of wintering migratory birds. It is of great value to evaluate the habitat vulnerabilities within more precise intervals of water levels and quantitatively assess the influences of water level changes. The findings are advantageous for managing wetland ecosystems and for migratory bird habitat protection. This study identified the ideal habitats for wintering Siberian cranes in Poyang Lake wetland within 1-meter water level intervals (from 5 to 16 m) based on the Landsat thematic mapper (TM), enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and operational land imager (OLI) remote sensing images taken on multiple dates in the past 30 years. Three indicators-sustainability, stability, and variety-were used to evaluate the vulnerabilities of crane habitats within various water level intervals; the spatial variations and distribution patterns of the habitat vulnerabilities were further explored. The explanatory powers of water level intervals (and others) and their paired interactive effects on the habitat vulnerabilities were quantified using the geographical detector method. The results showed that crane habitat vulnerabilities were significantly sensitive to the water level changes of Poyang Lake; the habitat vulnerabilities and their spatial distribution patterns both exhibited specific tendencies with water level increases. A water level of 12 m was identified as the potential upper threshold for the maintenance of sustainable crane habitats and a water level interval of 9-10 m was expected to be the optimal interval for facilitating the aggregation features of crane habitats. The water level interval was identified as the most dominant factor in habitat vulnerability. It explained 14.46%, 42.89%, and 21.78% of the sustainability, stability, and variety of crane habitats; the numbers were expected to increase to 22%, 49.25%, and 25.84%, respectively, with water level intervals interacting with other factors. This article provides a novel perspective in evaluating the habitat vulnerabilities of wintering migratory birds and quantifying the responses to water level changes in wetlands; the proposed approaches are applicable and practicable for habitat vulnerability assessments of other wintering birds in other typical wetlands.

AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is one of the most productive ecosystems, and it has unique ecological functions and great social and economic value. Accurate mangrove mapping is very important for mangrove dynamic moni-toring and management. Many studies have yielded good results in mangrove mapping, and the optical remote sensing images are used as the main data source for mangrove index construction and mangrove mapping. However, less information is available for optical images affected by clouds and fog. This study constructed an Optical and SAR images Combined Mangrove Index (OSCMI) based on the idea of multi-feature fusion. An OSCMI-based classification scheme for rapid and accurate mangrove mapping was proposed, and the effect of tidal inundation is considered. We have carried out extraction experiments in four different types of typical mangrove areas in China using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images. Several groups of comparative experiments were conducted to verify the superiority of OSCMI and the necessity of VV polarization mode. The results show that OSCMI performs well in the four typical mangrove areas of different types and has great application potential in mangrove large-scale mapping. And the introduction of VV polarization mode infor-mation is helpful to improve the accuracy of mangrove extraction.

TI  - High spatial resolution vegetation gross primary production product: Algorithm and validation
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation gross primary production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems is a key element of the carbon cycle, and its estimation highly determines the accuracy of carbon budget assessments. Currently, several global datasets of vegetation production are available at coarse or moderate spatial resolutions, but globally they still have large uncertainties, which hindered the application of GPP, especially in strongly heterogeneous agriculture ecosystems and mountainous areas. Here, we used the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach with the footprints of FLUXNET data to optimize the parameters of the high resolution of Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) GPP algorithm (i.e., the revised EC-LUE model) using 30 m spatial resolution Landsat data as driving data. Then, we generated a new set of algorithm parameters for high resolution GPP estimates. We used the optimized parameters with integrating footprint to calculate Hi-GLASS GPP based on Landsat data and our results revealed that on average, Hi-GLASS GPP explained 76% of variance in tower GPP at the total of 78 sites across ten vegetation types. Moreover, compared with previous 500 m GPP product such as GLASS GPP and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP, our optimized Hi-GLASS algorithm using Landsat data had large superiority in simulating GPP for wetlands, savannas, shrubland and C3, C4 cropland ecosystems, and had a slightly improvement for deciduous broadleaf forests and evergreen broadleaf forest ecosystem. Our study is an effort to optimize and quantify parameter uncertainty of Hi-GLASS algorithm using high spatial resolution (30 m) Landsat data and improve the high resolution GPP estimation for better understanding global ecosystem carbon dynamics and carbon-climate feedbacks.

TI  - Response of a Mesoscale Dipole Eddy to the Passage of a Tropical Cyclone: A Case Study Using Satellite Observations and Numerical Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies occurring in the world's oceans typically exist in pairs known as mesoscale dipole eddies or simply dipole eddies. Tropical cyclones (hereafter TCs) that move over the world's oceans often encounter and interact with these dipole eddies. Through this interaction, TCs induce significant perturbations in the mesoscale eddies. However, the specific influences that the passage of a TC on a dipole eddy have not been addressed. In this paper, a case study of the dipole eddy's response to the passage of a TC is conducted by using satellite observations and numerical simulation. The passage of a TC induces a long-duration response in the dipole eddy. First, the cyclonic ocean eddy component (COE) of the dipole is amplified, and the anticyclonic ocean eddy component (AOE) is weakened or even destroyed during the interaction. The amplification of the COE and weakening of the AOE primarily manifests as a change in their amplitudes and radii and as the adjustment of their vertical structure. The dipole eddy's response to the interaction with a TC manifests as an upwelling anomaly and the injection of positive relative vorticity. Following the passage of the TC, the COE gradually stabilizes, and AOE slowly recovers after the disturbance energy from the interaction dissipates, which facilitates the reestablishment of the dipole eddy. The dipole reaches an equilibrium state through a quasi-geostrophic adjustment process. As a consequence, the overall effect of the interaction of the dipole with the TC leads to an asymmetric signature on the dipole eddy. The eddy-eddy interaction in a dipole may allow it to stabilize in a shorter time relative to that of a solitary eddy.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Population Growth and Roads on Forest Cover: A Temporal Approach to Reconstruct the Deforestation Process in District Kurram, Pakistan, since 1972
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in remote mountainous regions is considered to be one of the fundamental elements for triggering changes in the biophysical environment driven by various socioeconomic parameters, particularly population growth and road construction in a previously inaccessible environment. A sudden increase in population exerts adverse impacts on the local natural resources, specifically forests. The present study is conducted in Tribal District Kurram, located in the northwestern mountainous belt of Pakistan. This study is aimed to analyze the temporal pattern of deforestation and to explore the impacts of population growth and accessibility on forest cover. It is based on remotely sensed data, focused group discussions, interviews and field observations. The satellite images were processed and classified using ArcGIS and ERDAS IMAGINE. The time span of this study is 1972 to 2019, which is further divided into three periods. The results revealed that almost half (48%) of the forest cover was reduced in ca. five decades. However, considerable variation has been observed in the deforestation rate during the study period. The results of this study revealed that both population change and accessibility have played a vital role in the deforestation process.

TI  - Improving LST Downscaling Quality on Regional and Field-Scale by Parameterizing the DisTrad Method
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scientists have been investigating Land Surface Temperature (LST) because of its relevance in water management science due to its direct influence on the hydrological water cycle. This effect stems from being one of the most significant variables influencing evapotranspiration. One of the most important reasons for the evapotranspiration retrieved from MODIS data's limited suitability for scheduling and planning irrigation schemes is the lack of spatial resolution. As a result, high-resolution LST is required for estimating evapotranspiration. The goal of this study is to improve the resolution of the available LST data, to improve evapotranspiration (ETa) estimation using statistical downscaling with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a predictor. The DisTrad (Disaggregation of Radiometric Surface Temperature) method was used for the LST downscaling procedure, which is based on aggregating the NDVI map to the LST map resolution and then calculating the coefficient of variation of the native NDVI map within the aggregated pixel and classifying the aggregated map into three classes: NDVI < 0.2 for the bare soil, 0.2 <= NDVI <= 0.5 for the partial vegetation, and NDVI > 0.5 for the full vegetation. DisTrad uses 25% of the pixels with the lowest coefficient of variation from each class to calculate the regression coefficients. In this work, adjustments to the DisTrad method were implemented to enhance downscaling LST and to examine the impacts of that alteration on the evapotranspiration estimation. The linear regression model was tested as an alternative to the original second-order polynomial. In using 10% of the pixels instead of the originally proposed 25% with the lowest coefficient of variation values, it is assumed that a group of pixels with a lower coefficient of variation represents a more homogeneous area, thus it gives more accurate values. The downscaled LST map retrieval was validated using Landsat 8 thermal maps (100 m). Applying the modified DisTrad approach to disaggregate Landsat LST to 30 m (NDVI resolution) yielded an R-2 of 0.72 for the 10%, 0.74 for the 25% and 0.61 for the second-order polynomial lowest coefficient of variation compared to native LST Landsat, which means that 10% can be used as an alternative. Applying the downscaled LST map to estimate ETa yielded R-2 0.84 in both cases, compared to ETa yielded from the native Landsat LST. These results prove that using the robust linear regression provided better results than using polynomial regression. With the downscaled Land Surface Temperature data, it was possible to create detailed ETa maps of the small agricultural fields in the test area.

TI  - A Smart Procedure for Assessing the Health Status of Terrestrial Habitats in Protected Areas: The Case of the Natura 2000 Ecological Network in Basilicata (Southern Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natura 2000 is the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world, which has been established to preserve rare habitats and threatened species at the European Community level. Generally, tools for habitat quality assessment are based on the analyses of land-use/land-cover changes, thus, highlighting already overt habitat modifications. To evaluate the general quality conditions of terrestrial habitats and detect habitat degradation processes at an early stage, a direct and cost-effective procedure based on satellite imagery (Landsat data) and GIS (Geographic Information System) tools is proposed. It focuses on the detection of anomalies in vegetation matrix (stress/fragmentation), estimated for each habitat at the level of both a single protected site and local network, to identify habitat priority areas (HPA), i.e., areas needing priority interventions, and to support a rational use of resources (field surveys, recovery actions). By analyzing the statistical distributions of standardized NDVI for all the enclosed habitats (at the site or network level), the Degree of Habitat Consistency (DHC) was also defined. The index allows the assessment of the general status of a protected site/network, and the comparison of the environmental conditions of a certain habitat within a given protected site (SCI, SAC) with those belonging to the other sites of the network. The procedure was tested over the Natura 2000 network of the Basilicata region (Southern Italy), considered as a hotspot of great natural and landscape interest. An overall accuracy of similar to 97% was obtained, with quite low percentages of commission (similar to 8%) and omission (similar to 6%) errors. By examining the diachronic evolution (1985-2009) of DHC and HPA, it was possible to track progress or degradation of the analyzed areas over time and to recognize the efficaciousness/failure of past managements and interventions (e.g., controlled disturbances), providing decision-makers with a thorough understanding for setting up the most suitable mitigation/contrast measures.

TI  - UAV Remote Sensing for High-Throughput Phenotyping and for Yield Prediction of <i>Miscanthus</i> by Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Miscanthus holds a great potential in the frame of the bioeconomy, and yield prediction can help improve Miscanthus' logistic supply chain. Breeding programs in several countries are attempting to produce high-yielding Miscanthus hybrids better adapted to different climates and end-uses. Multispectral images acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Italy and in the UK in 2021 and 2022 were used to investigate the feasibility of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) of novel Miscanthus hybrids for yield prediction and crop traits estimation. An intercalibration procedure was performed using simulated data from the PROSAIL model to link vegetation indices (VIs) derived from two different multispectral sensors. The random forest algorithm estimated with good accuracy yield traits (light interception, plant height, green leaf biomass, and standing biomass) using 15 VIs time series, and predicted yield using peak descriptors derived from these VIs time series with root mean square error of 2.3 Mg DM ha(-1). The study demonstrates the potential of UAVs' multispectral images in HTP applications and in yield prediction, providing important information needed to increase sustainable biomass production.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasion is recognized as the second most severe threat to biodiversity, following habitat loss. As one of the world's worst invasive alien plant species, Prosopis juliflora (Mesquite) has severely affected the majority of the Earth's dry ecosystems. Hence, this study attempted to identify the distribution, dominance, and changes in the vegetation characteristics of Mesquite-invaded regions along a series of coastal ecosystems in Southern Iran. Mesquite and other tree/shrub types were successfully classified using a temporarily-median-filtered Landsat 8-OLI image with acceptable kappa coefficient and overall accuracy values of 80.66 and 84.75, respectively. The multi-resolution segmentation was used to divide the region into spectrally homogenous parcels, then calculating the percentage cover (dominance) of Mesquite relative to other tree/shrub types. Analysis of MODIS NDVI products in highly invaded parcels showed a steady increase in NDVI values from 0.27 to 0.53 during 2000-2020 with a significant difference (z = -3.12, 0.183, sig <= .05, 2-tailed) from that of the low-invaded regions whose NDVI values oscillated constantly in a range between 0.15 and 0.28. Mesquite distribution also showed a local invasion pattern from areas with a steady or saturated status to neighboring parcels. In regions susceptible to Mesquite invasion, constant investigation of uncommon changes in NDVI whose vegetation characteristics differ significantly from that expected in poor dry vegetation covers of southern Iran can be considered as a conservation tool to identify and manage areas with early Mesquite establishment.

AB  - Climate change is the single biggest threat facing the global food system. Irrefutable impacts of climate change on the food systems are recently acknowledged. Therefore, extensive scientific efforts around the globe are dedicated to investigating and evaluating the short and long-term effects of climate change on the development of global food systems. In this study, an integrated approach of two methodologies, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), was employed to extrapolate the long-term changes in agronomic areas from 2000 to 2020 in the Dukan Dam Watershed (DDW), Northern Iraq. The link between agricultural areas and the primary production of essential crops (Wheat, Barley, Rice, Maize, and Sunflower) is proposed to be altered due to the impact of climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, Iraq is one of the semi-arid regions in the world that has recently been characterized by water scarcity and limited agronomic areas. Three independent variables (rainfall, temperature, and agriculture area) were used in the multiple regression analysis to understand the impact of the main drivers affecting the production of crops in DDW. Obtained results showed an increasing trend in crop production as a result of the frequent use of groundwater and surface water sources along with the implementation of greenhouse cultivation. Correlation analysis shows that the crop production was significantly related to the annual precipitation with a 59-63% in winter crops like wheat and barley, but was less sensitive to the temperature with a 20-40% in summer crops like rice, maize, and sunflower.

TI  - Leveraging the Historical Landsat Catalog for a Remote Sensing Model of Wetland Accretion in Coastal Louisiana
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A wetland's ability to vertically accrete-capturing sediment and biological matter for soil accumulation-is key for maintaining elevation to counter soil subsidence and sea level rise. Wetland soil accretion is comprised of organic and inorganic components largely governed by net primary productivity and sedimentation. Sea level, land elevation, primary productivity, and sediment accretion are all changing across Louisiana's coastline, destabilizing much of its wetland ecosystems. In coastal Louisiana, analysis from 1984 to 2020 shows an estimated 1940.858 km(2) of total loss at an average rate of 53.913 km(2)/year. Here we hypothesize that remote sensing timeseries data can provide suitable proxies for organic and inorganic accretionary components to estimate local accretion rates. The Landsat catalog offers decades of imagery applicable to tracking land extent changes across coastal Louisiana. This dataset's expansiveness allows it to be combined with the Coastwide Reference Monitoring System's point-based accretion data. We exported normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red-band surface reflectance data for every available Landsat 4-8 scene across the coast using Google Earth Engine. Water pixels from the red-band were transformed into estimates of total suspended solids to represent sediment deposition-the inorganic accretionary component. NDVI values over land pixels were used to estimate bioproductivity-representing accretion's organic component. We then developed a Random Forest regression model that predicts wetland accretion rates (R-2 = 0.586, MAE = 0.333 cm/year). This model can inform wetland vulnerability assessments and loss predictions, and is to our knowledge the first remote sensing-based model that directly estimates accretion rates in coastal wetlands.

AB  - As the advanced satellite network can provide extremely diverse data to various types of users, it is of vital importance to achieve data security using encryption over satellite channels. However, since the avalanche effect makes encryption techniques vulnerable to bit errors in the wireless channel, a more powerful encryption technique is required for data confidentiality. In addition, an efficient method for exchanging encryption keys between receivers and transmitters should be capable of managing a large scale of satellites in the network. In this article, we propose a novel superencryption method of joint encryption and channel coding, cipher feedback-advanced encryption standard (CFB-AES)-TURBO, which combines AES in the upper layer and turbo coding as bulk encryption in the physical layer. Because we introduce turbo coding in the CFB mode with AES for each block, our scheme can accomplish dual goals of data protection and bit error correction. We select an encryption block size to maximize throughput based on channel conditions and the security level required for a user, and present a key exchanging solution. We derive processing time gains and analyze computational complexity of the CFB-AES-TURBO. The bit error rate performance improvement with about 12-dB coding gain is achieved. We also enhance the security performance by 10(15000) times and provide indistinguishability. Finally, we analyze the total expected latency, suggest the minimum key refresh time of geostationary Earth orbit satellites.

TI  - Deriving 3-D Surface Deformation Time Series with Strain Model and Kalman Filter from GNSS and InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new set of processing procedures based on the strain model and the Kalman filter (SM-Kalman) to obtain high-precision three-dimensional surface deformation time series from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data. Implementing the Kalman filter requires the establishment of state and observation equations. In the time domain, the state equation is generated by fitting the pre-existing deformation time series based on a deformation model containing linear and seasonal terms. In the space domain, the observation equation is established with the assistance of the strain model to realize the spatial combination of InSAR and GNSS observation data at each moment. Benefiting from the application of the Kalman filter, InSAR and GNSS data at different moments can be synchronized. The time and measurement update steps are performed dynamically to generate a 3-D deformation time series with high precision and a high resolution in the temporal and spatial domains. Sentinel-1 SAR and GNSS datasets in the Los Angeles area are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The datasets include twenty-seven ascending track SAR images, thirty-four descending track SAR images and the daily time series of forty-eight GNSS stations from January 2016 to November 2018. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed SM-Kalman method can produce high-precision deformation results at the millimeter level and provide two types of 3-D deformation time series with the same temporal resolution as InSAR or GNSS observations according to the needs of users. The new method achieves a high degree of temporal and spatial fusion of GNSS and InSAR data.

TI  - Glacier area changes in the Nujiang-Salween River Basin over the past 45 years
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated image classification and visual interpretation of Landsat imagery were used to extract the glacier boundary in the Nujiang-Salween River Basin (NSRB) around the years 1975, 2000, and 2020. The spatiotemporal characteristics of glacier area changes in the NSRB were determined and the reasons for the spatial heterogeneity in glacier area changes were discussed, based on comparative analyses of temperature and precipitation data from meteorological stations around the NSRB. The results indicate that 1) the total glacier area in the NSRB decreased by 477.78 km(2) (28.17%) at a rate of similar to 0.62%/a in 1975-2020. Most shrinkage occurred at low and mid altitudes, with the most severe occurring at 5290-5540 m, accounting for 40% of the total shrinkage. Considering other river basins in China, the relative glacier area change rate in the NSRB was similar to that for typical inland river basins in northwest China but lower than that for other transboundary river basins in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. 2) These areal changes in the NSRB presented obvious regional differences. The glaciers in the Hengduan Mountains retreated significantly, followed by those in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains, with relatively low shrinkage observed in the Tanggula Mountains. The number of cold and hot spots indicating areal changes increased after 2000, along with their spatial heterogeneity. 3) The glacier shrinkage rate over different time intervals was positively correlated with temperature. Thus, spatial heterogeneity of climate change effects could elucidate differences in the glacier area change rate in different regions of the NSRB. The temperature rise was determined as the primary reason for the significant glacial retreat over the past 45 years. As the significant warming trend continues, the glacier area in the NSRB is likely to shrink further.

TI  - Generating a 2-km, all-sky, hourly land surface temperature product from Advanced Baseline Imager data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - By characterizing high-frequency surface thermal dynamics at a medium spatial scale, hourly land surface temperatures (LST), retrieved from geostationary satellite thermal infrared (TIR) observations, shows great potential to be used across a range of scientific applications; however, cloud cover typically leads to data gaps and degraded retrieval accuracy in TIR LST products, such as the official Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) LST product. Studies have focused on the LST gap reconstruction; however, most interpolation-based methods only work for a short-term cloud duration and are unable to adequately compensate for cloud effects, and traditional surface energy balance (SEB)-based methods are able to handle cloud coverage while they are not feasible for use at night. Moreover, few studies have concentrated on recovering the abnormal retrievals of partial cloud pixels. In this study, an all-sky diurnal, hourly LST estimation method based on SEB theory was proposed; the proposed method involved three major steps: 1) an original spatiotemporal dynamic model of LST was constructed from ECMWF Reanalysis v.5 (ERA5); 2) clear-sky ABI LST was then assimilated to the dynamic model to generate a continuous LST series; 3) the diurnal cloud effects were superimposed on cloudy time estimated by an innovative optimization method from satellite radiation products. A 2-km, all-sky, hourly LST product was produced over the contiguous US and Mexico from July 2017 to June 2021. Validation was conducted using ground measurements at 18 sites from Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) and core AmeriFlux networks, and produced an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.44 K, a bias of-0.19 K, and an R-2 of 0.97 based on 408,300 samples. For clear-sky samples, the RMSE values were 2.37 and 2.24 K for day and nighttime, respectively, which was a notable improvement over the corresponding values of the official ABI LST product (2.73 and 2.86 K, respectively). The RMSE values on cloudy-sky were 2.78 and 2.23 K for day and nighttime, respectively. The daily mean LST by aggregating all-sky, hourly LST had an RMSE of 1.13 K and R-2 of 0.99. Overall, this product showed reliability under consistent cloud durations, although it was slightly affected by surface elevation. The diurnal temperature cycle climatology of major land cover types was also characterized. The product is freely available at: http://glass.umd.edu/allsky_LST/ABI/.

TI  - A Novel Method for Long Time Series Passive Microwave Soil Moisture Downscaling over Central Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coarse scale of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) is not suitable for regional agricultural and hydrological applications such as drought monitoring and irrigation management. The optical/thermal infrared (OTI) data-based passive microwave SSM downscaling method can effectively improve its spatial resolution to fine scale for regional applications. However, the estimation capability of SSM with long time series is limited by OTI data, which are heavily polluted by clouds. To reduce the dependence of the method on OTI data, an SSM retrieval and spatio-temporal fusion model (SMRFM) is proposed in the study. Specifically, a model coupling in situ data, MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) OTI data, and topographic information is developed to retrieve MODIS SSM (1 km) using the least squares method. Then the retrieved MODIS SSM and the spatio-temporal fusion model are employed to downscale the passive microwave SSM from coarse scale to 1 km. The proposed SMRFM is implemented in a grassland dominated area over Naqu, central Tibet Plateau, for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System sensor (AMSR-E) SSM downscaling in unfrozen period. The in situ SSM and Noah land surface model 0.01 degrees SSM are used to validate the estimated MODIS SSM with long time series. The evaluations show that the estimated MODIS SSM has the same temporal resolution with AMSR-E and obtains significantly improved detailed spatial information. Moreover, the temporal accuracy of estimated MODIS SSM against in situ data (r = 0.673, mu bRMSE = 0.070 m(3)/m(3)) is better than the AMSR-E (r = 0.661, mu bRMSE = 0.111 m(3)/m(3)). In addition, the temporal r of estimated MODIS SSM is obviously higher than that of Noah data. Therefore, this suggests that the SMRFM can be used to estimate MODIS SSM with long time series by AMSR-E SSM downscaling in the study. Overall, the study can provide help for the development and application of microwave SSM-related scientific research at the regional scale.

TI  - Estimation of Downwelling Surface Longwave Radiation with the Combination of Parameterization and Artificial Neural Network from Remotely Sensed Data for Cloudy Sky Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work proposes a new method for estimating downwelling surface longwave radiation (DSLR) under cloudy-sky conditions based on a parameterization method and a genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) algorithm. The new method establishes a GA-ANN model based on simulated data, and then combines MODIS satellite data and ERA5 reanalysis data to estimate the DSLR. According to the validation results of the field sites, the bias and RMSE are -9.18 and 34.88 W/m(2), respectively. Compared with the existing research, the new method can achieve reasonable accuracy. Parameter analysis using independently simulated data shows that the near-surface air temperature (T-a) and cloud base height (CBH) have an important influence on DSLR estimation under cloudy-sky conditions. With an increase in CBH, DSLR gradually decreases; however, with an increase in T-a, DSLR shows a trend of gradual increase. When estimating DSLR under cloudy-sky conditions, under the influence of clouds, except for cirrus, the change in DSLRs with CBH and T-a is greater than 20 W/m(2).

TI  - Hydrological Characteristics Change of Hala Lake and Its Response to Climate Change, 1987-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are an indicator of global climate change. The study on the factors driving lake change on the TP can help us understand its response to climate change. In this study, Landsat and ICESat data were used to obtain the variations of area, water level, and storage of Hala Lake and the area of glaciers in the Hala Lake Basin during 1987-2018. Combined with meteorological data, climate change trends and the factors driving Hala Lake change in the last 30 years were analyzed. The contribution of glacier mass loss to lake recharge was estimated by the water balance of Hala Lake. The results showed that Hala Lake has experienced three stages: slight expansion (1987-1994), shrinkage (1995-2001) and rapid expansion (2002-2018) during the study period. The rate of glacial melting continued to decline during the study period. Precipitation was the main factor that drove the hydrological characteristic changes in Hala Lake. The step change points of annual precipitation and temperature occurred in 2001, almost the same time that Hala Lake began expanding rapidly.

TI  - Recognition of the Airspace Affected by the Presence of Volcanic Ash from Popocatepetl Volcano Using Historical Satellite Images
T2  - AEROSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - A volcanic eruption can produce large ash clouds in the atmosphere around a volcano, affecting commercial aviation use of the airspace around the volcano. Encountering these ash clouds can cause severe damage to different parts of the aircraft, mainly the engines. This work seeks to contribute to the development of methods for observing the dispersion of volcanic ash and to complement computational methods that are currently used for the prediction of ash dispersion. The method presented here is based on the frequency of occurrence of the regions of airspace areas affected by ash emission during a volcanic eruption. Popocatepetl volcano, 60 km east of Mexico City is taken as a case study. A temporal wind analysis was carried out at different atmospheric levels, to identify the direction towards which the wind disperses ash at different times of the year. This information showed two different trends, related to seasons in the direction of dispersion: the first from November to May and the second from July to September. To identify the ash cloud and estimate its area, a set of 920 MODIS images that recorded Popocatepetl volcanic activity between 2000 and 2021 was used. These satellite images were subjected to a semi-automatic, digital pre-processing of binarization by thresholds, according to the level of the brightness temperature difference between band 31 (11 mu m) and band 32 (12 mu m), followed by manual evaluation of each binarized image. With the information obtained by the processing of the MODIS image, an information table was built with the geographical position of each pixel characterized by the presence of ash for each event. With these data, the areas around Popocatepetl volcano with the highest frequency of affectation by ash emissions were identified during the period analyzed. This study seeks to complement the results obtained by numerical models that make forecasts of ash dispersions and that are very important for the prevention of air navigation risks.

TI  - Pronounced Changes in Thermal Signals Associated with the Madoi (China) M 7.3 Earthquake from Passive Microwave and Infrared Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal variations in surface and atmosphere observed from multiple satellites prior to strong earthquakes have been widely reported ever since seismic thermal anomalies were discovered three decades ago. These thermal changes are related to stress accumulation caused by the tectonic activities in the final stage of earthquake preparation. In the present paper, we focused on the thermal changes associated with the 2021 Madoi M 7.3 earthquake in China and analyzed the temporal and spatial evolution of the Index of Microwave Radiation Anomaly (IMRA) and the Index of Longwave Radiation Anomaly (ILRA) based on 8-year microwave brightness temperature (MWBT) and 14-year outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data collected by satellites. We also explored their responses in different tectonic units (seismogenic fault zone and active tectonic block). Our results indicated that the enhanced IMRA was distributed along the seismogenic fault since mid-February and reappeared for a longer time and with stronger intensity in March and April 2021. The pronounced enhancement in the ILRA was observed within one month over Bayan Har tectonic and adjacent blocks. The higher ILRA over the tectonic blocks in the southern Tibet Plateau at the beginning of 2021 could be associated with the regional stress accumulation, as proven by the occurrences of two moderate earthquakes during this period.

TI  - Groundwater Potential Assessment Using GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques: Case Study of West Arsi Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a crucial source of water supply due to its continuous availability, reasonable natural quality, and being easily diverted directly to the poor community more cheaply and quickly. The West Arsi Zone residents remain surface water dependent due to traditional exploration of groundwater, which is a tedious approach in terms of resources and time. This study uses remote sensing data and geographic information system techniques to evaluate the groundwater potential of the study area. This technique is a fast, accurate, and feasible technique. Groundwater potential and recharge zone influencing parameters were derived from Operational Land Imager 8, digital elevation models, soil data, lithological data, and rainfall data. Borehole data were used for results validation. With spatial analysis tools, the parameters affecting groundwater potential (LULC, soil, lithology, rainfall, drainage density, lineament density, slope, and elevation) were mapped and organized. The weight of the parameters according to percent of influence on groundwater potential and recharge was determined by Analytical Hierarchy Process according to their relative influence. For weights allocated to each parameter, the consistency ratio obtained was 0.033, which is less than 0.1, showing the weight allocated to each parameter is acceptable. In the weighted overlay analysis, from a percent influence point of view, slope, land use/cover, and lithology are equally important and account for 24% each, while the soil group has the lowest percent of influence, which accounts only 2% according to this study. The generated groundwater potential map has four ranks, 2, 3, 4, and 5, in which its classes are Low, Moderate, High, and Very High, respectively, based on its groundwater potential availability rank and class. The area coverage is 9825.84 ha (0.79%), 440,726.49 ha (35.46%), 761,438.61 ha (61.27%), and 30,748.68 ha (2.47%) of the study area, respectively. Accordingly, the western part of district is expected to have very high groundwater potential. High groundwater potential is concentrated in the central and western parts whereas moderate groundwater potential distribution is dominant in the eastern part of the area. The validation result of 87.61% confirms the very good agreement among the groundwater record data and groundwater potential classes delineated.

TI  - Cohort profile: the Western Cape Pregnancy Exposure Registry (WCPER)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The Western Cape Pregnancy Exposure Registry (PER) was established at two public sector healthcare sentinel sites in the Western Cape province, South Africa, to provide ongoing surveillance of drug exposures in pregnancy and associations with pregnancy outcomes. Participants Established in 2016, all women attending their first antenatal visit at primary care obstetric facilities were enrolled and followed to pregnancy outcome regardless of the site (ie, primary, secondary, tertiary facility). Routine operational obstetric and medical data are digitised from the clinical stationery at the healthcare facilities. Data collection has been integrated into existing services and information platforms and supports routine operations. The PER is situated within the Provincial Health Data Centre, an information exchange that harmonises and consolidates all health-related electronic data in the province. Data are contributed via linkage across a unique identifier. This relationship limits the missing data in the PER, allows validation and avoids misclassification in the population-level data set. Findings to date Approximately 5000 and 3500 pregnant women enter the data set annually at the urban and rural sites, respectively. As of August 2021, >30 000 pregnancies have been recorded and outcomes have been determined for 93%. Analysis of key obstetric and neonatal health indicators derived from the PER are consistent with the aggregate data in the District Health Information System. Future plans This represents significant infrastructure, able to address clinical and epidemiological concerns in a low/middle-income setting.

TI  - Comparative Study Between Radioisotope Uptake and Fluorescence Intensity of Indocyanine Green for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, several breast surgeons have reported a new method for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) by using indocyanine green (ICG) with infrared camera. This study aimed to determine whether the lymph nodes (LNs) with ICG uptake are true SLNs and to assess the reliability of using only ICG for SLNB. Data were prospectively collected between April and September 2021. All palpable LNs were fat-trimmed and ordered from high to low signal of the gamma detector. The degree of radioisotope uptake and brightness of ICG staining of the axillary LNs detected with a fluorescent camera were compared and associated factors were analyzed. Discordance was defined as sentinel LNs (SLNs) showing a single uptake of radioisotope or fluorescence of ICG only, or when the orders of uptake and intensity degree were different between the 2 materials. A total of 79 SLNBs were performed on 78 patients with breast cancer. The breast cancer was classified as cTis-2N0-1. The discordance rate was 14/79 (17.7%) overall and 45/270 (16.7%) of the total retrieved axillary LNs. The first SLNs showed the lowest discordance rate of 6.3%, whereas the second and third SLNs showed higher discordance rates of 27.6% and 60.0%, respectively. There were no associated clinicopathologic factors that affected the discordance between uptake of radioisotope and fluorescence intensity of ICG. The use of ICG alone for SLNB may be insufficient because of the high discordance rates between radioisotopes and ICG uptake. However, the first SLN could be cautiously regarded as a true SLN.

TI  - Estimating Grass Sward Quality and Quantity Parameters Using Drone Remote Sensing with Deep Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of novel neural network architectures for measuring the quality and quantity parameters of silage grass swards, using drone RGB and hyperspectral images (HSI), and compare the results with the random forest (RF) method and handcrafted features. The parameters included fresh and dry biomass (FY, DMY), the digestibility of organic matter in dry matter (D-value), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF), water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), nitrogen concentration (Ncont) and nitrogen uptake (NU); datasets from spring and summer growth were used. Deep pre-trained neural network architectures, the VGG16 and the Vision Transformer (ViT), and simple 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) were studied. In most cases, the neural networks outperformed RF. The normalized root-mean-square errors (NRMSE) of the best models were for FY 19% (2104 kg/ha), DMY 21% (512 kg DM/ha), D-value 1.2% (8.6 g/kg DM), iNDF 12% (5.1 g/kg DM), NDF 1.1% (6.2 g/kg DM), WSC 10% (10.5 g/kg DM), Ncont 9% (2 g N/kg DM), and NU 22% (11.9 N kg/ha) using independent test dataset. The RGB data provided good results, particularly for the FY, DMY, WSC and NU. The HSI datasets provided advantages for some parameters. The ViT and VGG provided the best results with the RGB data, whereas the simple 3D-CNN was the most consistent with the HSI data.

TI  - LAND USE SCENARIO MODELLING FOR FLOODS MITIGATION IN BEDADUNG WATERSHED, EAST JAVA INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019 dry season in Bedadung watershed caused a catastrophic forest fire. The fires caused a significant reduction in forest area in a short period. As a result, there was an increase in downstream discharge when entering the rainy season. This study aims to determine the impact of land use change towards floods and the boundary of optimal land use in the flood management framework, and then it can be used as a basis for designing flood disaster mitigation strategies due to changes in land cover. The land cover map used as input flood model was obtained from the processing of Landsat-8 satellite imagery, meanwhile modeling of flood response to land cover changes was carried out using the SWAT model. After knowing the flood discharge response to land cover, the simulation process was carried out by making several land cover scenarios to find the appropriate and optimal land cover area. The results showed that the calculation of flood discharge after the calibration process resulted in the NSE and R-2 values of 70.7% and 0.709, meanwhile the validation values of NSE and R-2 were 82.1% and 0.88, respectively. The simulation of land-use scenarios shows that the optimal land cover condition of the Bedadung watershed is to use a scenario of 30% forest area of the total watershed area.

TI  - Estimating fodder crops area using multi-date high resolution satellite data- a case study in Madhya Pradesh, India
T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, the adequate availability of green fodder is crucial for better milk production. However, the supply and demand gaps are huge for green fodder. To address this issue, an assessment of rabi fodder crops was conducted in Madhya Pradesh state of India. Satellite based assessment technique was used for fodder crops acreage estimation using a hybrid approach of classification method for rabi season crops (2019-20). Hierarchical decision rule method followed by, ISODATA (Iterative self-organizing data analysis technique) clustering approach were used for estimating fodder crops. Multi-date NDVI was derived from the imagery to generate temporal spectral profile for different crops using ground truth (GT) data. Total 510 GT points were collected and used for validation purposes by calculating the accuracy assessment of the classified image and overall, 81% accuracy of classification was obtained. Among the study areas, Rajgarh had the highest area under fodder cultivation, whereas lowest area was in Agar-Malwa district.

TI  - Estimating Suspended Sediment Fluxes from the Largest Glacial Lake in Svalbard to Fjord System Using Sentinel-2 Data: Trebrevatnet Case Study
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier-fed hydrological systems in high latitude regions experience high seasonal variation in meltwater runoff. The peak in runoff usually coincides with the highest air temperatures which drive meltwater production. This process is often accompanied by the release of sediments from within the glacier system that are transported and suspended in high concentrations as they reach the proglacial realm. Sediment-laden meltwater is later transported to the marine environment and is expressed on the surface of fjords and coastal waters as sediment plumes. Direct monitoring of these processes requires complex and time-intensive fieldwork, meaning studies of these processes are rare. This paper demonstrates the seasonal dynamics of the Trebrevatnet lake complex and evolution of suspended sediment in the lake and sediment plumes in the adjacent Ekmanfjorden. We use the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for the period between 2016-2021. We propose a new SSL index combining the areal extent of the sediment plume with the NDSSI for quantification of the sediment influx to the marine environment. The largest observed sediment plume was recorded on 30 July 2018 and extended to more than 40 km(2) and a SSL index of 10.4. We identified the greatest sediment concentrations in the lake in the beginning of August, whereas the highest activity of the sediment plumes is concentrated at the end of July. The temporal pattern of these processes stays relatively stable throughout all ablation seasons studied. Sediment plumes observed with the use of optical satellite remote sensing data may be used as a proxy for meltwater runoff from the glacier-fed Trebrevatnet system. We have shown that remote-sensing-derived suspended sediment indexes can (after proper in situ calibration) serve for large scale quantification of sediment flux to fjord and coastal environments.

TI  - Ground and Satellite-Based Methods of Measuring Deformation at a UK Landslide Observatory: Comparison and Integration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advances of ESA's Sentinel-1 InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) mission, there are freely available remote sensing ground deformation observations all over the globe that allow continuous monitoring of natural hazards and structural instabilities. The Digital Environment initiative in the UK aims to include these remote sensing data in the effort at forecasting and mitigating hazards across the UK. In this paper, we present a case study of the Hollin Hill landslide in North Yorkshire where a variety of ground-based geophysical measurements are available for comparison with InSAR data. To include Sentinel-1 data in the UK's Digital Environment, it is important to understand the advantages and limitations of these observations and interpret them appropriately. The Hollin Hill landslide observatory (HHLO) is used by the British Geological Survey to understand landslide processes, and to trial new technologies and methodologies for slope stability characterisation and monitoring. In July 2019, six corner reflectors were installed to improve the coherence of the InSAR measurements. We use Sentinel-1 InSAR data acquired between October 2015 and January 2019 to study the behaviour of this landslide, and find that the line-of-sight component of the down-slope movement is 2.7 mm/year in the descending track, and 7.5-7.7 mm/year in the ascending track. The InSAR measurements also highlight the seasonal behaviour of this landslide. Using InSAR data after the installation of the six corner reflectors, we are able to track the most recent movement on the landslide that occurred in January 2021. This result is in agreement with other ground-based measurements such as tracking of pegs, and soil moisture data derived from electrical resistivity tomography.

TI  - A NASA-Air Force Precipitation Analysis for Near-Real-Time Operations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes a new precipitation analysis algorithm developed by NASA for time-sensitive operations at the United States Air Force. Implemented as part of the Land Information System-a land modeling and data assimilation software framework-this NASA-Air Force Precipitation Analysis (NAFPA) combines numerical weather prediction model outputs with rain gauge measurements and satellite estimates to produce global, gridded 3-h accumulated precipitation fields at approximately 10-km resolution. Input observations are subjected to quality control checks before being used by the Bratseth analysis algorithm that converges to optimal interpolation. NAFPA assimilates up to 3.5 million observations without artificial data thinning or selection. To evaluate this new approach, a multiyear reanalysis is generated and intercompared with eight alternative precipitation products across the contiguous United States, Africa, and the mon-soon region of eastern Asia. NAFPA yields superior accuracy and correlation over low-latency (up to 14 h) alternatives (numerical weather prediction and satellite retrievals), and often outperforms high-latency (up to 3.5 months) products, although the details for the latter vary by region and product. The development of NAFPA offers a high-quality, near-real-time product for use in meteorological, land surface, and hydrological research and applications.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Precipitation is a key input to land modeling systems due to effects on soil moisture and other parts of the hydrologic cycle. It is also of interest to government decision-makers due to impacts on human activities. Here we present a new precipitation analysis based on available near-real-time data. By running the program for prior years and comparing with alternative products, we demonstrate that our analysis provides better accuracy and usually less bias than near-real-time satellite data alone, and better accuracy and correlation than data provided by numerical weather models. Our analysis is also competitive with other products created months after the fact, justifying confidence in using our analysis in near-real-time operations.

TI  - Monitoring land use land cover changes and its impacts on land surface temperature over Mardan and Charsadda Districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes due to urban growth on the regional scale affect land surface temperature (LST). The present study aims to assess the LULC changes and their impact on LST over Mardan and Charsadda districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan, in the period from 1990 to 2019. Landsat satellite (TM& ETM +) datasets in the period from 1990 to 2010 and Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2019 were used in this study. All the datasets were pre-processed and the LULC types were classified by maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The vegetation degradation was computed from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the LST was derived based on the LULC changes. The results showed that the overall accuracy of LULC classification was 87.84%. Dramatic LULC changes were observed during the last three decades, where the vegetation degradation area was decreased from 1307.8 (59.27%) to 1147.6 km(2) (52.1%) and the barren land area increased from 816.6 (37.07%) to 961.4 km(2) (42.64%). Similarly, the built-up area has also increased from 57.2 (2.5%) to 104.3 km(2) (4.73%) in the years 1990 and 2019, respectively. These variations in LULC types have significantly influenced the LST from 1990 to 2019; specifically, the LST of built-up area, barren land, and vegetation cover increased from 20.1 to 32.1 degrees C, 21.5 to 35.5 degrees C, and 17.1 to 28.2 degrees C, respectively. The regression line plotted defines that the LST has a negative correlation with NDVI and a positive correlation with normalized difference of built-up index (NDBI). In particular, the vegetation and land covers dramatically transformed to barren land and/or to urban development over the study area in the period from 1990 to2019, which has severely affected the LST and the natural resources of the study area. Therefore, our study will be very helpful for managing the rapid environmental changes and urban planning.

TI  - Discovery and Biology of <i>Spathius verustus</i> Chao (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a Potential Biological Agent on Two <i>Monochamus</i> Vectors of the Pinewood Nematode
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine wilt disease in Korea can be managed by reducing vector density through chemical application. To reduce the side effects from pesticides, effective natural enemies must be identified and used to reduce the vectors' natural density. Sentinel logs were used to investigate a parasitoid wasp parasitic to Monochamus alternatus and Monochamus saltuarius, the vectors of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which causes this disease. During 2016-2017, the parasitoid wasps distributed in the Pinus densiflora and Pinus koraiensis forests were surveyed using sentinel logs at six different areas. An ectoparasitoid wasp Spathius verustus Chao of M. alternatus and M. saltuarius was identified. We showed for the first time that S. verustus was parasitic to M. alternatus in South Korea and to M. saltuarius worldwide. The parasitism rates were affected by region and session but not by the sentinel log height in the tree and the distances between the trap and forest edge locations. Studies also showed that S. verustus appeared to prefer M. alternatus to M. saltuarius as a host. This study unveiled the ecological details of S. verustus. Further research on various environmental factors such as regional differences, host density differences, and the degree of damage from the pine wilt disease is required to understand the effects of environmental or ecological factors on parasitism rates.

TI  - Drivers of Turbidity and Its Seasonal Variability at Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk (Western Canadian Arctic)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is greatly affected by climate change. Increasing air temperatures drive permafrost thaw and an increase in coastal erosion and river discharge. This results in a greater input of sediment and organic matter into nearshore waters, impacting ecosystems by reducing light transmission through the water column and altering biogeochemistry. This potentially results in impacts on the subsistence economy of local people as well as the climate due to the transformation of suspended organic matter into greenhouse gases. Even though the impacts of increased suspended sediment concentrations and turbidity in the Arctic nearshore zone are well-studied, the mechanisms underpinning this increase are largely unknown. Wave energy and tides drive the level of turbidity in the temperate and tropical parts of the world, and this is generally assumed to also be the case in the Arctic. However, the tidal range is considerably lower in the Arctic, and processes related to the occurrence of permafrost have the potential to greatly contribute to nearshore turbidity. In this study, we use high-resolution satellite imagery alongside in situ and ERA5 reanalysis data of ocean and climate variables in order to identify the drivers of nearshore turbidity, along with its seasonality in the nearshore waters of Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk, in the western Canadian Arctic. Nearshore turbidity correlates well to wind direction, wind speed, significant wave height, and wave period. Nearshore turbidity is superiorly correlated to wind speed at the Beaufort Shelf compared to in situ measurements at Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk, showing that nearshore turbidity, albeit being of limited spatial extent, is influenced by large-scale weather and ocean phenomenons. We show that, in contrast to the temperate and tropical ocean, freshly eroded material is the predominant driver of nearshore turbidity in the Arctic, rather than resuspension, which is caused by the vulnerability of permafrost coasts to thermo-erosion.

TI  - Using Multi-Platform Satellite Observations to Study the Atmospheric Evolution of Brown Carbon in Siberian Biomass Burning Plumes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A bulk of evidence from in situ observations and lab experiments suggests that brown carbon (light-absorbing organic compounds in particles) can provide a significant yet highly variable contribution to the overall light absorption by aerosol particles from biomass burning (BB). Partly stemming from the complexity of the atmospheric evolution of organic aerosol (OA), the variability in brown carbon (BrC) absorption makes it difficult to partition the radiative effects of BrC and black carbon (BC) in atmospheric and climate models; as such, there are calls for satellite-based methods that could provide a statistical characterization of BrC absorption and its evolution in different regions of the world, especially in remote BB regions, such as Siberia. This study examined the feasibility of the statistical characterization of the evolution of BrC absorption and related parameters of BB aerosol in smoke plumes from intense wildfires in Siberia through the analysis of a combination of data from three satellite instruments: OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), MISR (Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer), and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Using a Monte Carlo method, which related the satellite retrievals of the absorption and extinction aerosol optical depths to Mie theory calculations of the optical properties of BB aerosol, we found that the BrC absorption, as well as the imaginary refractive index for the OA, decreased significantly in Siberian BB smoke plumes during about 30 h of the daylight evolution, nevertheless remaining considerable until at least 70 h of the daylight evolution. Overall, the study indicated that the analysis of multi-platform satellite observations of BB plumes can provide useful insights into the atmospheric evolution of BrC absorption and the partitioning of BrC and BC contributions to the total light absorption by BB aerosol.

TI  - IMPACT OF THE TENGIZ OIL FIELD ON THE STATE OF LAND COVER
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the transformation of natural complexes in areas with a developed infrastructure for oil subsurface use is a prerequisite condition for solving the environmental problems of oil-producing regions. Located in the territory of the Atyrau Region in Western Kazakhstan, the Tengiz oil field is one of the largest oil fields in the world. The field has been under intensive development for more than 40 years and is characterised by a large volume of anthropogenic lcyad, which contributes to a significant transformation of the landscape complex. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dynamics of landscape changes in the territory of the Tengiz field and to assess its ecological condition. Based on the materials from many years of research, the features of the Tengiz field and the main tm:hnogenic sources affecting the landscape complex were identified. Several quantitative indicators characterising the anthropogenic load were calculated based on satellite images. On the basis of Landsat - 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A (S2A) data, the vegetation index of land cover was calculated using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), demonstrating the dynamics of landscape changes in the period from 1990 to 2020. The obtained results show that the areas of some landscape components continue to deteriorate. For example, the area of open soil in 2020 decreased due to the withdrawal of these areas for industrial facilities, which increased by 2.2 times by 2020 due to intensive field development. This study demonstrates the importance of monitoring and studying desert landscape complexes under active anthropogenic impact to ensure the sustainable development of territories.

TI  - Accuracy of Cirrus Detection by Surface-Based Human Observers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The longest cirrus time series are ground-based, visual observations captured by human observers [synoptic observations (SYNOP)]. However, their reliability is impacted by an unfavorable viewing geometry (cloud overlap) and misclassification due to low cloud optical thickness, especially at night. For the very first time, this study assigns a quantitative value to uncertainty. We validate 15 years of SYNOP observations (2006-20) against data from the cloud lidar flown on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder (CALIPSO) spacecraft. We develop a dedicated method to match SYNOP reports (with a hemispherical field of view) with lidar samples (along-track profiles). Our evaluation of the human eye's sensitivity to cirrus revealed that it is moderate, at best. In perfect conditions (daytime with no mid/low-level clouds) the probability of correct detection was 44%-83% (Cohen's kappa coefficient < 0.6), and this fell to 24%-42% (kappa < 0.3) at night. Lunar illumination improved detection, but only when the moon's phase exceeded 50%. Cirrus optical depth had a clear impact on detection. When clouds at all levels were considered (i.e., real-life conditions), the reliability of the visual method was moderate to poor: it detected 47%-71% of cirrus (kappa < 0.45) during the day and 28%-43% (kappa < 0.2) at night and decreased with an increasing low/midlevel cloud fraction. These kappa coefficients suggest that agreement with CALIPSO data was close to random. Our findings can be directly applied to estimations of cirrus frequency/trends. Our reported probabilities of detection can serve as a benchmark for other ground-based cirrus detection methods.

AB  - The relevance of the study is associated with the active spread of photography in modern culture. Photography becomes a tool for social construction of reality and a form of communication. Any user of the social network has a set of tools that allow you to create author profiles with photos, each has the opportunity to share impressions with others. There is a blurring of the boundaries between traditional photography, the hallmarks of which have developed throughout the century, and that which is now forming and becoming part of the everyday culture available to everyone. The purpose of this study is to analyze the forms of modern photography on the example of the social network Instagram and propose the principles of their systematization.The study was carried out in line with the constructivist methodology using the principles of comparative and aesthetic analysis, as well as the theory of mediality.The study highlighted three main forms of modern digital photography.1) Art photography. It is characterized by the paramount artistic image, the position of the author can be considered as creative, creating art. 2) Commercial photography. This form is common in the field of blogging. Here it is important to trace the connection with art photography, since many rules and principles of shooting are adopted from it. The main difference is the desire for profit and the broadcast of copyright interests. 3) Everyday photography broadcasting people's daily lives. The authors do not pursue a specific goal when creating posts on social networks. This form contributes to the creation of a database of modern culture based on photographs of modern life.Photography contributes to the formation of a worldview in accordance with the interests and needs of people. Photography is part of the media culture, it broadcasts and transmits information thanks to modern methods of communication.

TI  - Cross-Slope Buoyancy Fluxes Cause Intense Asymmetric Generation of Submesoscale Eddies on the Periphery of the Black Sea Mesoscale Anticyclones
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Submesoscale dynamics significantly affect the turbulence regime and is characterized by pronounced time variability, the reasons of which are still poorly known. In our study, we use high-resolution (1 km) numerical model NEMO and satellite data in the Black Sea to demonstrate that one of the main processes impacting on the intensity of submesoscale dynamics in the marginal seas is the cross-slope advection by mesoscale anticyclones. Such large eddies entrain the brackish shelf waters into their orbital motion and cause the strong rise of vertical and horizontal gradients of buoyancy. The emergence of baroclinic instability causes the generation of periodic submesoscale structures, among which cyclonic eddies have the largest vorticity. Our analysis shows that the presented mechanism is one of the main reasons for the intraannual variability of submesoscale dynamics over the continental slope of the Black Sea. This process also causes a strong asymmetry in the vertical structure of the mesoscale anticyclones. The generation of the submesoscale eddies and related vertical and horizontal exchange are significantly more intense on that side of the anticyclone, where current is directed offshore. Intensification of submesoscale motions in the zone of the brackish water entrainment is one of the probable reasons for the rapid and effective mixing of the shelf and open sea waters, often observed in satellite data.

TI  - Exploring the relationship of climate change and land-use dynamics with satellite-derived surface indices and temperature in greater Dhaka, Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the assessment of the relation of land-use dynamics and climate change based on the relationship of land surface temperature (LST), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalised difference built up index (NDBI) using Landsat 4, 5 TM and 8 OLI/TIRS between 1989 and 2019. In situ condition was assessed using ground observations for validating satellite-derived temperature. LST was derived using NDVI-based emissivity method which uses non-linear split-window algorithm. To establish relationship among LST, NDBI and NDVI pixel-based approach was adopted. Increase in LST was observed with an increase of impervious surface and decrease of greenery. A strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.573 (P value = 0.01) was observed between LST and NDBI for the period 1989-2019 along with a strong negative correlation between LST and NDVI (r = -0.431, P value = 0.01). The correlation of NDBI-NDVI was also moderately negative (correlation coefficient = -0.284, P value = 0.01). A section of Greater Dhaka has been identified because it showed the highest rise in LST, air temperature and impervious surface and highest decrease in vegetation and rainfall. The trend of urban increase shows that in future, areas which share their boundary with Dhaka city will experience rapid urbanisation. Those areas are also expected to experience high air and surface temperature as well.

TI  - Fodder crop estimation using Sentinel-2A/B satellite data for West Bengal, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping, monitoring and estimation of fodder crop area can support farmers, policy makers to make right decisions in various conditions to improve the livestock productivity. The freely available high-resolution Sentinel-2 MSI data has increased the application of precision agriculture for a broader range. This study investigated the capabilities of Sentinel-2A/B MSI satellite data to identify and discriminate the fodder crops from other crops and estimate the area utilized for fodder cultivation in five districts of West Bengal during 2019-20 in rabi season (October to March). Multi-date NDVI based spectral profiles were generated from satellite imagery to ascertain the time of sowing which plays an important role to differentiate fodder crops from other crops. Image classification has been done through the ISODATA clustering technique. A field survey has been carried out in the study area and a total of 610 GT points were collected from different locations of fodder crops using handheld GPS and smartphone-based applications to validate the classification of crops. Accuracy assessment has also been performed between four classes (Fodder crops, Other crops, Forest and Waterbody) which is 81.61% for fodder crops, and 88.97% overall accuracy was observed in classification. The area under fodder cultivation was 0.68% of the total agricultural area, which has been estimated to the tune of 6.78 per thousand hectares. This study can be implemented for fodder crop identification and cultivation management plan to improve the livestock productivity by supply of fodder throughout the year.

TI  - Monitoring of Coastal Aquaculture Sites in the Philippines through Automated Time Series Analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the unprecedented expansion of aquaculture around the world, there is a critical need to monitor its progress. In Palawan, Philippines, coastal aquaculture is gaining momentum towards increasing fish production, a pressure that presents a challenge to the sustainability of these areas. In this paper, we explore the application of Earth observation methods to map coastal aquaculture development in Palawan and evaluate the extent of its change. The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument sensor data were applied in fully automatic mode to build maps of Palawan coastal aquaculture. The maps were validated using Google Earth high-resolution optical images and in situ observations in Malampaya Sound, and demonstrated a successful detection rate of 72%, while the false alarm rate was less than 7.5%. Objects only 5 m across, four times smaller than the spatial resolution of the Sentinel-1 sensors, were successfully detected using the developed methodology, thus exceeding the capabilities of other published methods that are limited to detecting large groups of aquaculture structures. The maps revealed aquaculture structures in high quantities in Malampaya Sound, Taytay Bay, and other locations in the coastal waters of Palawan, Philippines. A significant change of aquaculture spatial distribution was identified by comparing aquaculture maps generated with an interval of three years. This new automated methodology was validated as robust for mapping aquaculture objects in Palawan, Philippines, and can be applied to aquaculture studies in other regions worldwide.

TI  - Nucleic Acid Preservation Card Surveillance Is Effective for Monitoring Arbovirus Transmission on Crocodile Farms and Provides a One Health Benefit to Northern Australia
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kunjin strain of West Nile virus (WNVKUN) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that can infect farmed saltwater crocodiles in Australia and cause skin lesions that devalue the hides of harvested animals. We implemented a surveillance system using honey-baited nucleic acid preservation cards to monitor WNVKUN and another endemic flavivirus pathogen, Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), on crocodile farms in northern Australia. The traps were set between February 2018 and July 2020 on three crocodile farms in Darwin (Northern Territory) and one in Cairns (North Queensland) at fortnightly intervals with reduced trapping during the winter months. WNVKUN RNA was detected on all three crocodile farms near Darwin, predominantly between March and May of each year. Two of the NT crocodile farms also yielded the detection of MVE viral RNA sporadically spread between April and November in 2018 and 2020. In contrast, no viral RNA was detected on crocodile farms in Cairns during the entire trapping period. The detection of WNVKUN and MVEV transmission by FTA (TM) cards on farms in the Northern Territory generally correlated with the detection of their transmission to sentinel chicken flocks in nearby localities around Darwin as part of a separate public health surveillance program. While no isolates of WNVKUN or MVEV were obtained from mosquitoes collected on Darwin crocodile farms immediately following the FTA (TM) card detections, we did isolate another flavivirus, Kokobera virus (KOKV), from Culex annulirostris mosquitoes. Our studies support the use of the FTA (TM) card system as a sensitive and accurate method to monitor the transmission of WNVKUN and other arboviruses on crocodile farms to enable the timely implementation of mosquito control measures. Our detection of MVEV transmission and isolation of KOKV from mosquitoes also warrants further investigation of their potential role in causing diseases in crocodiles and highlights a "One Health" issue concerning arbovirus transmission to crocodile farm workers. In this context, the introduction of FTA (TM) cards onto crocodile farms appears to provide an additional surveillance tool to detect arbovirus transmission in the Darwin region, allowing for a more timely intervention of vector control by relevant authorities.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Development of Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves at Ungauged Locations of Yangon, Myanmar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for Yangon, the economic center of Myanmar, using four satellite precipitation datasets, namely GPM IMERG, TRMM, GSMaP_NRT, and GSMaP_GC. Different probability distribution functions were used to fit the annual rainfall maximum series to determine the best-fit distribution. The estimated parameters of the best-fit distribution were used to fit the rainfall intensities of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year return periods for generating IDF curves using the Sherman equation. The IDF curves were bias-corrected based on the daily rainfall data available only at a location in Yangon. The bias correction factors were then used to estimate IDF curves from satellite rainfall at ungauged locations of Yangon. The results showed that the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution best fit the hourly rainfall distribution of satellite data. Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) is the most suitable for constructing Yangon's IDF curves. The bias-corrected IDF curve generated at four locations of greater Yangon indicates higher rainfall intensity at the coastal stations than the inland stations. The methodology presented in this study can be used to derive IDF curves for any location in Myanmar.

TI  - Exposomic determinants of immune-mediated diseases Special focus on type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, asthma, and allergies: The HEDIMED project approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The incidence of immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) is increasing rapidly in the developed countries constituting a huge medical, economic, and societal challenge. The exposome plays an important role since genetic factors cannot explain such a rapid change. In the Human Exposomic Determinants of Immune Mediated Diseases (HEDIMED) project, altogether 22 academic and industrial partners join their multidisciplinary forces to identify exposomic determinants that are driving the IMD epidemic. The project is based on a combination of data and biological samples from large clinical cohorts constituting about 350,000 pregnant women, 30,000 children prospectively followed from birth, and 7,000 children from cross-sectional studies. HEDIMED focuses on common chronic IMDs that cause a significant disease burden, including type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, allergy, and asthma. Exposomic disease determinants and the underlying biological pathways will be identified by an exploratory approach using advanced omics and multiplex technologies combined with cutting-edge data mining technologies. Emphasis is put on fetal and childhood exposome since the IMD disease processes start early. Inclusion of several IMDs makes it possible to identify common exposomic determinants for the diseases, thus facilitating the development of widely operating preventive and curative treatments. HEDIMED includes data and samples from birth cohorts and clinical trials that have used exposomic interventions and cell and organ culture models to identify mechanisms of the observed associations. Importantly, HEDIMED generates a toolbox that offers science-based functional tools for key stakeholders to control the IMD epidemic. Altogether, HEDIMED aims at innovations, which become widely exploited in diagnostic, therapeutic, preventive, and health economic approaches.

TI  - Combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data for Tree Species Classification in a Central European Biosphere Reserve
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave and optical imaging methods react differently to different land surface parameters and, thus, provide highly complementary information. However, the contribution of individual features from these two domains of the electromagnetic spectrum for tree species classification is still unclear. For large-scale forest assessments, it is moreover important to better understand the domain-specific limitations of the two sensor families, such as the impact of cloudiness and low signal-to-noise-ratio, respectively. In this study, seven deciduous and five coniferous tree species of the Austrian Biosphere Reserve Wienerwald (105,000 ha) were classified using Breiman's random forest classifier, labeled with help of forest enterprise data. In nine test cases, variations of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery were passed to the classifier to evaluate their respective contributions. By solely using a high number of Sentinel-2 scenes well spread over the growing season, an overall accuracy of 83.2% was achieved. With ample Sentinel-2 scenes available, the additional use of Sentinel-1 data improved the results by 0.5 percentage points. This changed when only a single Sentinel-2 scene was supposedly available. In this case, the full set of Sentinel-1-derived features increased the overall accuracy on average by 4.7 percentage points. The same level of accuracy could be obtained using three Sentinel-2 scenes spread over the vegetation period. On the other hand, the sole use of Sentinel-1 including phenological indicators and additional features derived from the time series did not yield satisfactory overall classification accuracies (55.7%), as only coniferous species were well separated.

TI  - Analysis of the Surface Urban Heat Island Changes according to Urbanization in Sejong City Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization due to population growth and regional development can cause various environmental problems, such as the urban heat island phenomenon. A planned city is considered an appropriate study site to analyze changes in urban climate caused by rapid urbanization in a short-term period. In this study, changes in land cover and surface heat island phenomenon were analyzed according to the development plan in Sejong City from 2013 to 2020 using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager/ Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) satellite imagery. The surface temperature was calculated in consideration of the thermal infrared band value provided by the satellite image and the emissivity, and based on this the surface heat island effect intensity and Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) change analysis were performed. The level-2 land cover map provided by the Ministry of Environment was used to confirm the change in land cover as the development progressed and the difference in the surface heat island intensity by each land cover. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that the urbanized area increased by 15% and the vegetation decreased by more than 28%. Expansion and intensification of the heat island phenomenon due to urban development were observed, and it was confirmed that the ecological level of the area where the heat island phenomenon occurred was very low. Therefore, It can suggest the need for a policy to improve the residential environment according to the quantitative change of the thermal environment due to rapid urbanization.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Distribution of Biomass Burning Aerosols from Australian Wildfires Observed by TROPOMI Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel passive satellite remote sensing approach for observing the three-dimensional distribution of aerosols emitted from wildfires. This method, called AEROS5P, retrieves vertical profiles of aerosol extinction from cloud-free measurements of the TROPOMI satellite sensor onboard the Sentinel 5 Precursor mission. It uses a Tikhonov-Phillips regularization, which iteratively fits near-infrared and visible selected reflectances to simultaneously adjust the vertical distribution and abundance of aerosols. The information on the altitude of the aerosol layers is provided by TROPOMI measurements of the reflectance spectra at the oxygen A-band near 760 nm. In the present paper, we use this new approach for observing the daily evolution of the three-dimensional distribution of biomass burning aerosols emitted by Australian wildfires on 20-24 December 2019. Aerosol optical depths (AOD) derived by vertical integration of the aerosol extinction profiles retrieved by AEROS5P are compared with MODIS, VIIRS and AERONET coincident observations. They show a good agreement in the horizontal distribution of biomass burning aerosols, with a correlation coefficient of 0.87 and a mean absolute error of 0.2 with respect to VIIRS. Moderately lower correlations (0.63) were found between AODs from AEROS5P and MODIS, while the range of values for this comparison was less than half of that with respect to VIIRS. A fair agreement was found between coincident transects of vertical profiles of biomass burning aerosols derived from AEROS5P and from the CALIOP spaceborne lidar. The mean altitudes of these aerosols derived from these two measurements showed a good agreement, with a small mean bias (185 m) and a correlation coefficient of 0.83. Moreover, AEROS5P observations reveal the height of injection of the biomass burning aerosols in 3D. The highest injection heights during the period of analysis were coincident with the largest fire radiative power derived from MODIS. Consistency was also found with respect to the vertical stability of the atmosphere. The AEROS5P approach provides retrievals for cloud-free scenes over several regions, although currently limited to situations with a dominating presence of smoke particles. Future developments will also aim at observing other aerosol species.

TI  - Online sex-seeking among Chinese heterosexual men who seek care in sexually transmitted infections clinics: a cross-sectional study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Internet has become an important virtual venue for men who have sex with men to seek sexual partners, with a high potential threat to spread sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the online sex-seeking use and its risk causing STIs spread remain unclear among heterosexual men. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the use of online sex-seeking venues and the related risky sex activities (e.g. condomless sex, quick sex) in STIs clinics in Guangdong, China. Methods These STIs clinics were involved in the Guangdong governmental sentinel network and we recruited heterosexual men (age > = 18) between March and August 2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with online sex-seeking use and risky sex activities with online sex partners. Results 191 of 2,154 participants (8.9%) ever sought sex online. Among users,16.8% met their partners in-person within 24 h, 31.4% engaged in condomless sex with their last online partner. Online sex-seeking was positively associated with a) Ever been diagnosed with STIs (aOR = 3.0, 95%CI:2.0-4.6), and b) Had casual sex in the last three months (aOR = 3.3, 95%CI 2.4-4.6). Condomless sex with the last online partner was negatively associated with the correct answer of "Having only one partner can reduce the risk to infect HIV" (aOR = 0.3, 95%CI:0.1-0.8). Conclusion In China, online sex-seeking and its related risky sexual activities are not rare among heterosexual men. Future prevention strategies to reduce STIs incidence should especially target heterosexual men engaging in online sex-seeking.

TI  - Assessing Land Subsidence-Inducing Factors in the Shandong Province, China, by Using PS-InSAR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shandong Province (SDP) experienced serious land subsidence from March 2017 to December 2020. Exploring the response relationships between land subsidence and its inducing factors plays an important role in ensuring the development of the economy and residential safety. Firstly, we applied Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technology to 558 Sentinel-1 images to determine the land subsidence in SDP from March 2017 to December 2020. Secondly, we mosaicked the land subsidence monitoring results of five tracks to obtain a land subsidence map covering the whole SDP and validated the land subsidence monitoring results using Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring results and leveling benchmark monitoring results observed in the same period. Finally, the response relationships between the land subsidence and its inducing factors in SDP were analyzed. The findings are as follows: (1) the PS-InSAR outcomes showed that the land subsidence was widely distributed in SDP and that the maximum land subsidence rate was -298.9 mm/year during the study period. (2) The PS-InSAR monitoring results coincide well with the GPS monitoring results and leveling benchmark monitoring results; the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) values between the PS-InSAR monitoring results and the GPS measurement results and leveling benchmark monitoring results were 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. We found that Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) values between any two adjacent tracks of the mosaic PS-InSAR monitoring results were greater than 0.95, indicating good consistency. (3) The long-term overexploitation of groundwater in middle and deep aquifers and mining of underground mineral resources are the main inducing factors of land subsidence in SDP when considering this problem on a large geographical scale. Moreover, the type of bridge material is an important inducing factor causing the large variation in the land subsidence of the bridge body within a small geographical range. These findings may provide scientific support for land subsidence control measures in SDP.

TI  - Land Subsidence Monitoring and Dynamic Prediction of Reclaimed Islands with Multi-Temporal InSAR Techniques in Xiamen and Zhangzhou Cities, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial islands and land reclamation are one of the most important ways to expand urban space in coastal cities. Long-term consolidation of reclaimed material and compaction of marine sediments can cause ground subsidence, which may threaten the buildings and infrastructure on the reclaimed lands. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the land subsidence and predict the future deformation trend to mitigate the damage and take measures for the land reclamation and any infrastructure. In this paper, a total of 125 SAR images acquired by the C-band Sentinel-1A satellite between June 2017 and September 2021 are collected. The small baseline subsets (SBAS) SAR interferometry (InSAR) method is first conducted to detect the land deformation in Xiamen and Zhangzhou cities of Fujian Province, China, and the distributed scatterers (DS)-InSAR method is used to recover the complete deformation history of some typical areas including Xiamen Airport in Dadeng Island and Shuangyu Island. Then, the sequential estimation and the geotechnical model are jointly applied to demonstrate the current and future evolution of land subsidence of the constructed roads on Shuangyu Island. The results show that the maximum cumulative deformation reaches 425 mm of Xiamen Xiang'an Airport and 626 mm of Shuangyu Island, and the maximum deformation is predicted to be as large as 1.1 m by 2026 of Shuangyu Island. This research will provide important guidelines for the design and construction of Xiamen Xiang'an Airport and Shuangyu Island to prevent and control land subsidence.

TI  - Network for Very-High-Resolution Urban Imagery Classification
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of manual image interpretation, the use of a combination of spectral and spatial features can aid in more accurately classifying urban land coverage. In this study, to simulate this procedure, we use two concurrent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with two scales of input to represent fields of view corresponding to object detail and the related information among objects. In our approach, the results derived from every convolution process are retained and stacked together at the end of the convolution process. Thus, not only are the spectral and spatial features combined, but all the scales of spatial features are also considered. When applied to very-highresolution remote sensing images, our proposed model with its feature-based CNN achieves a noticeable improvement over other state-of-the-art methods, which helps to assess the urban environment to some extent. In addition, we show that the digital surface model features, either in image form or in numerical characteristic form, can improve the overall accuracy rate of current structures.

TI  - Climatic Niche of Vegetation Greenness Is Likely to Be Conservative in Degraded Land
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data have been widely used to study changes in vegetation greenness in geographical space; however, this change is rarely considered in climatic space. Here, the climatic niche dynamics of vegetation greenness, represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was quantified in the climate space of the Loess Plateau, a piece of degraded land greening significantly from 2000 to 2018. The niche similarity test was used to examine the niche conservatism of vegetation greenness during the 19 years of restoration. The results show that the climate niche of vegetation greenness is always more similar than expected. The stability niche occupied most parts (83-98%) of their climatic niche, and niche overlap reached 0.52-0.69. Climate niche conservatism suggests that potential greenness constructed by statistical methods could be used as a criterion or baseline for ecosystem function restoration on the Loess Plateau. The study also suggests that the integrated niche similarity test in decision-making for restoration of degraded land will clarify our understanding of the climatic niche dynamics of vegetation greenness and the making of forecasts.

TI  - Multi-Scenario Simulation of Production-Living-Ecological Space in the Poyang Lake Area Based on Remote Sensing and RF-Markov-FLUS Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With industrialization and urbanization, the competition among land production, living, and ecological (PLE) spaces has intensified. Particularly in ecological reserves, competition among various types of land use restricts the coordinated development of PLE space. To explore spatial sustainable development, this study starts from a PLE spatial perspective, based on Landsat long time series images. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and landscape index analysis were selected to monitor the spatial and temporal land use and landscape pattern changes in the Poyang Lake region (PYL region) from 1989 to 2020. The RF-Markov-FLUS coupled model was used to simulate spatial changes in 2030 under four scenarios: production space priority (PSP), living space priority (LSP), ecological space priority (ESP), and an integrated development (ID). Finally, the goal-problem-principle was used to enhance PLE space. The results showed that: (1) production space and ecological spaces decreased in general from 1989 to 2020 by 3% and 7%, respectively; living space increased by 11%. (2) From 1989 to 2020, the overall landscape spread in the Poyang Lake (PYL) area decreased, connectivity decreased, fragmentation increased, landscape heterogeneity increased, and landscape geometry became more irregular. (3) Compared with the other three scenarios, the ID scenario maintained steady production space growth in 2030, the expansion rate of living space slowed, and the area of ecological space decreased the least. (4) Spatial pattern optimization should start with three aspects: the transformation of the agricultural industry, improving the efficiency of urban land use, and establishing communities of "mountains, water, forests, fields, lakes and grasses". The results provide scientific planning and suggestions for the future ecological protection of Poyang Lake area with multiple scenarios and perspectives.

TI  - Vegetation Responses to Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activity in China, 1982 to 2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities significantly affect vegetation growth in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, data reconstruction was performed to obtain a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for China (1982-2018) based on Savitzky-Golay filtered GIMMS NDVI3g and MOD13A2 datasets. Combining surface temperature and precipitation observations from more than 2000 meteorological stations in China, Theil-Sen trend analysis, Mann-Kendall significance tests, Pearson correlation analysis, and residual trend analysis were used to quantitatively analyze the long-term trends of vegetation changes and their sources of uncertainty. Significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity was observed in vegetation changes in the study area. From 1982 to 2018, the vegetation showed a gradually increasing trend, at a rate of 0.5%center dot 10 a(-1), significantly improving (37.15%, p < 0.05) more than the significant degradation (7.46%, p < 0.05). Broadleaf (0.66) and coniferous forests (0.62) had higher NDVI, and farmland had the fastest rate of increase (1.02%/10 a(-1)). Temperature significantly affected the vegetation growth in spring (R > 0; p < 0.05); however, the increase in summer temperatures significantly inhibited (R < 0; p < 0.05) the growth in North China (RNDVI-tem = -0.379) and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (RNDVI-tem = -0.051). Climate change has highly promoted the growth of vegetation in the plain region of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River (3.24%), Northwest China (1.07%). Affected by human activities only, 49.89% of the vegetation showed an increasing trend, of which 22.91% increased significantly (p < 0.05) and 9.97% decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Emergency mitigation actions are required in Northeast China, Xinjiang, Northwest China, and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, monitoring vegetation changes is important for ecological environment construction and promoting regional ecological protection.

TI  - Cooperative Resource Scheduling for Time-Sensitive Services in an Integrated XGS-PON and Wi-Fi 6 Network
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - 10-Gbps symmetrical passive optical network (XGS-PON) and Wi-Fi 6 are two key technologies to provide gigabit access for the fifth-generation fixed network (F5G). However, how to integrate XGS-PON and Wi-Fi 6 to meet F5G's stringent quality of service requirements is still a challenge. In this letter, we propose a cooperative resource scheduling scheme, in which a communication tunnel is established to achieve a low end-to-end (E2E) delay by sharing medium access control information between XGS-PON and Wi-Fi 6. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the E2E delay for time-sentinel services by up to 50% without sacrificing the performance of non-time-sensitive services.

TI  - Symbiotic Graph Neural Networks for 3D Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition and Motion Prediction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - 3D skeleton-based action recognition and motion prediction are two essential problems of human activity understanding. In many previous works: 1) they studied two tasks separately, neglecting internal correlations; and 2) they did not capture sufficient relations inside the body. To address these issues, we propose a symbiotic model to handle two tasks jointly; and we propose two scales of graphs to explicitly capture relations among body-joints and body-parts. Together, we propose symbiotic graph neural networks, which contain a backbone, an action-recognition head, and a motion-prediction head. Two heads are trained jointly and enhance each other. For the backbone, we propose multi-branch multiscale graph convolution networks to extract spatial and temporal features. The multiscale graph convolution networks are based on joint-scale and part-scale graphs. The joint-scale graphs contain actional graphs, capturing action-based relations, and structural graphs, capturing physical constraints. The part-scale graphs integrate body-joints to form specific parts, representing high-level relations. Moreover, dual bone-based graphs and networks are proposed to learn complementary features. We conduct extensive experiments for skeleton-based action recognition and motion prediction with four datasets, NTU-RGB+D, Kinetics, Human3.6M, and CMU Mocap. Experiments show that our symbiotic graph neural networks achieve better performances on both tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Efficient Superpixel Generation for Polarimetric SAR Images with Cross-Iteration and Hexagonal Initialization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clustering-based methods of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image superpixel generation are popular due to their feasibility and parameter controllability. However, these methods pay more attention to improving boundary adherence and are usually time-consuming to generate satisfactory superpixels. To address this issue, a novel cross-iteration strategy is proposed to integrate various advantages of different distances with higher computational efficiency for the first time. Therefore, the revised Wishart distance (RWD), which has better boundary adherence but is time-consuming, is first integrated with the geodesic distance (GD), which has higher efficiency and more regular shape, to form a comprehensive similarity measure via the cross-iteration strategy. This similarity measure is then utilized alternately in the local clustering process according to the difference between two consecutive ratios of the current number of unstable pixels to the total number of unstable pixels, to achieve a lower computational burden and competitive accuracy for superpixel generation. Furthermore, hexagonal initialization is adopted to further reduce the complexity of searching pixels for relabelling in the local regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the AIRSAR, RADARSAT-2 and simulated data sets demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits higher computational efficiency and a more regular shape, resulting in a smooth representation of land cover in homogeneous regions and better-preserved details in heterogeneous regions.

TI  - Phenology-Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) Method for Crop Information Extraction in Areas Sensitive to Non-Point Source Pollution and Its Influence on Pollution Intensity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers during agricultural production causes water pollution, which is an important type of non-point source pollution (NSP). Large amounts of harmful substances, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, flow into surface water along with farmland runoff, leading to eutrophication and other problems. However, the pollutant discharge capacity of different types of cultivated land varies greatly. Areas sensitive to NSP are areas with rich crop types, large spatial differences in crop growth, and complex planting patterns. These factors can cause different amounts of fertilizer used in and absorbed by the crops to influence the emission intensity of pollutants. NSP intensity mapping can reflect the spatial distribution of lands' pollutant discharge capacity and it can provide a basis for pollution control. However, when estimating NSP intensity, existing methods generally treat cultivated land as a category and ignore how complex crop conditions impact pollution intensity. Remote sensing technology enables the classification and monitoring of ground objects, which can provide rich geographical data for NSP intensity mapping. In this study, we used a phenology-GPP (gross primary productivity) method to extract the spatial distribution of crops in the Yuecheng reservoir catchment area from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images and the overall accuracy reached 85%. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP data were used to simulate the spatial distribution of crop growth. Finally, a new model that is more suitable for farmland was obtained by combining this large amount of remote sensing data with existing mapping models. The findings from this study highlight the differences in spatial distributions between total nitrogen and total phosphorous; they also provide the means to improve NSP intensity estimations.

TI  - Combining Convolutional Attention Module and Convolutional Auto-encoder for Detail Injection Remote Sensing Image Fusion
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Panchromatic and multispectral images can be captured by Earth observation satellites. Usually, panchromatic images have high spatial resolution and low spectral resolution, while multispectral images have low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution. For combining the spatial and spectral information of panchromatic and multispectral images, remote sensing image fusion techniques are applied and born. Although significant progress has been made in fusion algorithms, there are still problems of spectral distortion and insufficient details. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes to design a new remote sensing image fusion algorithm with convolutional auto-encoders, attention mechanism and filter as the detail processing module and additive injection fusion rule as the fusion module. Convolutional auto-encoders learns the nonlinear mapping relationship between the low-resolution image and the high-resolution image, and the high-resolution image corresponding to the low-resolution image can be obtained after the training is completed. The introduction of attention Mechanism in the convolutional auto-encoders can improve the sensitivity of the network to information and increase the channel importance of image information. The filter plays two roles in this paper, one is to obtain the high or low frequency information of the image through the filter, and the other is to obtain the low-resolution image corresponding to the high-resolution image. The specific steps are described below. First, high -frequency images of low-resolution images and high-frequency images of high-resolution images for model training are acquired separately using Gaussian filters, while high-frequency images of low-resolution multispectral image for model prediction are acquired; then, the non-linear mapping relationship between the high-frequency image of low-resolution image and the high-frequency image of high-resolution image is learned by using convolutional auto-encoders; finally, the missing detail information of the multispectral image, i.e., the high-frequency image of high-resolution multispectral, is obtained using the convolutional auto-encoders completed by training, and fused with the original image to generate the high-resolution multispectral image. For the filter selection, experiments are conducted based on the mean filter, Laplace filter, Gaussian filter and morphological filter in this paper, and the results show that using the Gaussian filter has a better fusion effect. At the same time, experiments were conducted on the selection of the number of iterations of the network model. In this paper, the objective metrics of fused images with the different number of iterations are recorded. Since the objective indicators are floating in nature, a fitting function is used to fit the data to the objective indicators. The influence of the number of iterations on the fusion results is found by observing the trend of the fitting curve. The fitting curves show that the fusion algorithm proposed in this paper obtains the best fused image at about 1 600 iterations.This paper combines the respective advantages of Convolutional Auto-Encoders, attention mechanism and filter to perform experiments on two datasets, which are images taken by QuickBird and SPOT satellites, respectively. The resolution of the datasets is 512x512 for multispectral and 512x512 for panchromatic images. To expand the training dataset, the datasets are cropped to 8 x 8 size images by using a sliding window. In training the model training batch size is 256, the number of training iterations is 1 600, and the optimizer Adadelta is used for network model parameter optimization and learning rate adaptive optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper, it is compared with the classical fusion algorithm. Since this paper uses the additive injection of fusion rules, IHS and BDSD additive fusion algorithms are selected for comparison. PNN and GAN are typical deep learning fusion algorithms and are compared with classical deep learning fusion algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion algorithm. The comparison with the CAE fusion algorithm can effectively prove the effectiveness of the attention mechanism and filter introduced in this paper, which can significantly improve the fused image effect. Di-PNN fusion algorithm and SR-D fusion algorithm are both detail injection fusion algorithms based on deep learning networks, and the comparison with Di-PNN and SR-D fusion can illustrate the effectiveness of the network structure in this paper. In this paper, the results of different fusion algorithms are compared in terms of subjective visual and objective metrics. The objective metrics are CC, UIQI, ERGAS, RASE, AG and SAM, where the UIQI and AG metrics describe the detail information of the image, and the ERGAS, RASE, SAM and CC metrics describe the spectral information of the image. the larger the CC, UIQI and AG metrics, the better the image quality; the smaller the ERGAS, RASE and SAM metrics, the better the image quality. By comparing with the classical fusion algorithm and using subjective visual and objective metrics, the experimental results show that the fused images in this paper retain more spectral information and detail information and show good performance both subjectively and objectively.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring of Desertification in Ningdong Based on Landsat Images and Machine Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological stability of mining areas in Northwest China has been threatened by desertification for a long time. Remote sensing information combined with machine learning algorithms can effectively monitor and evaluate desertification. However, due to the fact that the geological environment of a mining area is easily affected by factors such as resource exploitation, it is challenging to accurately grasp the development process of desertification in a mining area. In order to better play the role of remote sensing technology and machine learning algorithms in the monitoring of desertification in mining areas, based on Landsat images, we used a variety of machine learning algorithms and feature combinations to monitor desertification in Ningdong coal base. The performance of each monitoring model was evaluated by various performance indexes. Then, the optimal monitoring model was selected to extract the long-time desertification information of the base, and the spatial-temporal characteristics of desertification were discussed in many aspects. Finally, the factors driving desertification change were quantitatively studied. The results showed that random forest with the best feature combination had better recognition performance than other monitoring models. Its accuracy was 87.2%, kappa was 0.825, Macro-F1 was 0.851, and AUC was 0.961. In 2003-2017, desertification land in Ningdong increased first and then slowly improved. In 2021, the desertification situation deteriorated. The driving force analysis showed that human economic activities such as coal mining have become the dominant factor in controlling the change of desert in Ningdong coal base, and the change of rainfall plays an auxiliary role. The study comprehensively analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics and driving factors of desertification in Ningdong coal base. It can provide a scientific basis for combating desertification and for the construction of green mines.

TI  - Dynamic Variation of Ecosystem Services Value under Land Use/Cover Change in the Black Soil Region of Northeastern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of the dynamic variation in the ecosystem service value (ESV) under land use/cover change (LUCC) is conductive to improving ecosystem services and environmental protection. The present study took Landsat TM/ETM remote sensing images and socio-economic statistic data as data sources and extracted land-use data using RS and GIS technology at 5-year intervals from 1990 to 2020. Then, we interpreted the spatio-temporal characteristics of LUCC and analyzed ESV changes using the value equivalence method in the black soil region of northeastern China (BSRNC). The main results showed that land use changed significantly during the study period. Cultivated land continued to expand, especially paddy areas, which increased by 1.72 x 10(6) ha, with a relative change of 60.9% over 30 years. However, grassland decreased by 2.47 x 10(6) ha, with a relative change of -60.6% over 30 years. The ESV showed a declining trend, which decreased by CNY 607.96 million during 1990-2020. The decline in forest and grassland caused a significant decline in the ESV. Furthermore, the ESV sensitivity coefficients were less than one for all of the different categories of ecosystem services. LUCC has a considerable impact on ESV in the BSRNC, resulting in ecosystem function degradation. As a result, future policies must emphasize the relationship between food security and environmental protection in situations of significant land-use change.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Crop Planting Structure in the Black Soil Region of Northeast China: A Case Study in Hailun County
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed characteristics of crop planting structure (CPS) evolution can inform the optimization of the crop yield proportion in the black soil region of Northeast China (BSRNC). Choosing Hailun County as an example, this study sought to analyze the geographic characteristics of CPS evolution from 2000 to 2020. Our analysis produced new spatiotemporal information based on the remote-sensing interpretation data, namely, Landsat4-5 TM, Landsat7 ETM+, and Landsat8 OLI images. The study characterized the temporal and spatial dynamics of CPS. Our results showed the following: (1) Soybean and maize were the main crops, with a total land area of 70%; they alternated as the most dominant crop. (2) The distribution breadth and aggregation intensity of soybean and maize were spatially complementary; rice had the smallest distribution range but strong water aggregation. (3) The evolution pattern of CPS was the interconversion between a single type of soybean and maize. Our results indicate that the future CPS adjustment of BSRNC needs to consider the county-level optimization of crop area proportion and crop spatial distribution. This context has excellent implications in geographically informing policymaking to adjust county-level CPS of BSRNC, thus safeguarding food security.

TI  - Estimation and Spatio-Temporal Change Analysis of NPP in Subtropical Forests: A Case Study of Shaoguan, Guangdong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics of regional forest net primary productivity (NPP) in the context of global climate change can not only provide a theoretical basis for terrestrial carbon cycle studies, but also provide data support for medium- and long-term sustainable management planning of regional forests. In this study, we took Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, China as the study area, and used Landsat images and National Forest Continuous Inventory (NFCI) data in the corresponding years as the main data sources. Random forest (RF), multiple linear regression (MLR), and BP neural network were the three models applied to estimate forest NPP in the study area. Theil-Sen estimation, Mann-Kendall trend analysis and the standard deviation ellipse (SDE) were chosen to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics of NPP, whereas structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the driving factors of NPP changes. The results show that the performance of the RF model is better than the MLR and BP neural network models. The NPP in the study area showed an increasing trend, as the NPP was 5.66 t center dot hm(-2)center dot a(-1), 7.68 t center dot hm(-2)center dot a(-1), 8.17 t center dot hm(-2)center dot a(-1), 8.25 t center dot hm(-2)center dot a(-1), and 10.52 t center dot hm(-2)center dot a(-1) in 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017, respectively. Spatial aggregation of NPP was increased in the period of 1997-2017, and the center shifted from the mid-west to the southwest. In addition, the forest stand factors had the greatest effect on NPP in the study area. The forest stand factors and environmental factors had a positive effect on NPP, and understory factors had a negative effect. Overall, although forest NPP has fluctuated due to the changes of forestry policies and human activities, forest NPP in Shaoguan has been increasing. In the future, the growth potential of NPP in Shaoguan City can be further increased by continuously expanding the area proportion of mixed forests and rationalizing the forest age group structure.

TI  - Comprehensive Validation and Comparison of Three VIIRS Aerosol Products over the Ocean on a Global Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three parallel Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol products (SOAR, NOAA, and AERDT) provided data since 2012. It is necessary to study the performances and advantages of different products. This study aims to analyze the accuracy and error of these products over the ocean and compare them with each other. The results show that the three VIIRS ocean aerosol retrievals (including total aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine mode fraction, angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), and fine AOD (AODF)) correlate well with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) retrievals (e.g., correlation >0.895 for AOD and >0.825 for AE), which are comparable to the newest moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) retrievals. Overall, the SOAR retrievals with quality filtering have the best validation accuracy of all parameters. Therefore, it is more recommended to use. The differences in the annual AOD spatial patterns of different products are small (bias < 0.016), but their AE spatial patterns are evidently different (bias > 0.315), indicating the large uncertainty of VIIRS AE. Error analysis shows that the scattering angle and wind speed affect aerosol retrieval. Application of the non-spherical dust model may reduce the dependence of retrieval bias on the scattering angle. Overall, this study provides validation support for VIIRS products usage and possible algorithm improvements.

TI  - Relationship Between Spectral Response Non-Uniformity of Pixels and Stripe Noise
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - On orbit radiometric calibration based on blackbody is one of the radiometric calibration schemes used in the infrared channel of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI). Some of the images from long wave infrared channels of AGRI still have some band noise after blackbody calibration, which will affect the image quality. In this paper, the radiometric calibration model of AGRI based on spaceborne blackbody is analyzed, and the concept of spectral response non-uniformity between pixels in the channel is proposed; then, the relationship between the non-uniformity of the spectral response between pixels and the band noise is simulated and analyzed. Finally, based on the analysis results, a method of relative radiometric calibration using a uniform scene is proposed, and the imaging data of AGRI are used to verify the effectiveness of this method to suppress the stripe noise caused by the non-uniformity of spectral response between pixels.

TI  - A Comparison of Land Surface Phenology in the Northern Hemisphere Derived from Satellite Remote Sensing and the Community Land Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale changes in the state of the land surface affect the circulation of the atmosphere and the structure and function of ecosystems alike. As global temperatures increase and regional climates change, the timing of key plant phenophase changes are likely to shift as well. Here we evaluate a suite of phenometrics designed to facilitate an "apples to apples" comparison between remote sensing products and climate model output. Specifically, we derive day-of-year (DOY) thresholds of leaf area index (LAI) from both remote sensing and the Community Land Model (CLM) over the Northern Hemisphere. This systematic approach to comparing phenologically relevant variables reveals appreciable differences in both LAI seasonal cycle and spring onset timing between model simulated phenology and satellite records. For example, phenological spring onset in the model occurs on average 30 days later than observed, especially for evergreen plant functional types. The disagreement in phenology can result in a mean bias of approximately 5% of the total estimated Northern Hemisphere NPP. Further, while the more recent version of CLM (v5.0) exhibits seasonal mean LAI values that are in closer agreement with satellite data than its predecessor (CLM4.5), LAI seasonal cycles in CLM5.0 exhibit poorer agreement. Therefore, despite broad improvements for a range of states and fluxes from CLM4.5 to CLM5.0, degradation of plant phenology occurs in CLM5.0. Therefore, any coupling between the land surface and the atmosphere that depends on vegetation state might not be fully captured by the existing generation of the model. We also discuss several avenues for improving the fidelity between observations and model simulations.

TI  - Integrating MODIS and Landsat imagery to monitor the small water area variations of reservoirs
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamic changes of reservoir surface water area (RSWA) values is crucial when investigating global water resource reserves. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed imagery has been extensively used for this purpose, but the coarse spatial resolution limits the accuracy when monitoring the small water area variations of reservoirs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the monitoring of RSWA variation by integrating MODIS and Landsat imagery to overcome this problem. In the proposed method, the sub-pixel water fraction information in the MODIS images is explored based on the C/M ratio model, where C/M represents the ratio between the reflectance of a land pixel and that of a water pixel. By using the series of RSWA values extracted from Landsat images as the reference, the C/M values extracted from MODIS images are used to construct regression functions with the overall RSWA for each MODIS pixel. An RSWA time series is then predicted from the extracted daily C/M values with the use of the regression functions constructed in the study. In a case study of Dale Hollow Reservoir in the United States, the performance of the proposed method was assessed, and the resulting Pearson's correlation coefficient between the predicted RSWA and water level (WL) reached 0.88, which was higher than that of the conventional pixel analysis based method and the spectral unmixing based sub-pixel analysis method, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Inversion of Coniferous Forest Stock Volume Based on Backscatter and InSAR Coherence Factors of Sentinel-1 Hyper-Temporal Images and Spectral Variables of Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stock volume (FSV) is a basic data source for estimating forest carbon sink. It is also a crucial parameter that reflects the quality of forest resources and forest management level. The use of remote sensing data combined with a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm has been widely used in FSV estimation. However, due to the complexity and spatial heterogeneity of the forest biological community, in the FSV high-value area with dense vegetation, the optical re-mote sensing variables tend to be saturated, and the sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering features to the FSV is significantly reduced. These factors seriously affect the ac-curacy of the FSV estimation. In this study, Landsat 8 (L8) Operational Land Imager multispectral images and C-band Sentinel-1 (S1) hyper-temporal SAR images were used to extract three re-mote sensing feature datasets: spectral variables (L8), backscattering coefficients (S1), and inter-ferometric SAR factors (S1-InSAR). We proposed a feature selection method based on SVR (FS-SVR) and compared the FSV estimation performance of FS-SVR and stepwise regression analysis (SRA) on the aforementioned three remote sensing feature datasets. Finally, an estima-tion model of coniferous FSV was constructed using the SVR algorithm in Wangyedian Forest Farm, Inner Mongolia, China, and the spatial distribution map of coniferous FSV was predicted. The experimental results show the following: (1) The coherence amplitude and DSM data ob-tained based on S1 images contain information relat-ed to forest canopy height, and the hy-per-temporal S1 image data significantly enrich the diversity of S1-InSAR feature factors. There-fore, the S1-InSAR dataset has a better FSV response than remote sensing factors such as the S1 backscattering coefficient and L8 vegetation index, and the corresponding root mean square er-ror (RMSE) and relative RMSE (rRMSE) values reached 47.6 m(3)/ha and 20.9%, respectively. (2) The integrated dataset can provide full play to the synergy of the L8, S1, and S1-InSAR remote sensing data. Its RMSE and rRMSE values are 44.3 m(3)/ha and 19.4% respectively. (3) The proposed FS-SVR method can better select remote sensing variables suitable for FSV estimation than SRA. The average value of the rRMSE (23.17%) based on the three datasets was 13.8% lower than that of the SRA method (26.87%). This study provides new insights into forest FSV retrieval based on active and passive multisource remote sensing joint data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager(AGRI)is one of the main payloads of Fengyun-4A(FY-4A). In order to satisfy requirements of high-accuracy quantitative application of AGRI long-wave infrared(LWIR)remote sensing data,a function model of scan mirror thermal radiation changing with mechanical rotation angle is constructed,and a correction algorithm for remote sensing data of on-board blackbody and earth scene observation is presented. Based on the on-orbit data of FY-4AAGRI,the dependence of the model parameters on the scan mirror temperature is analyzed,and the improvement effect of the correction algorithm on the calibration accuracy of LWIR is studied and evaluated. After thermal radiation correction of scan mirror in the stationary period of mirror temperature field,the calibration deviation of B11(8. 0 similar to 9. 0 mu m),B12(10. 3 similar to 11. 3 mu m),B13(11. 5 similar to 12. 5 mu m)can be improved significantly by -2. 81 K similar to+ 1. 06 K,-0. 60 K similar to+0. 19 K,-0. 68 K similar to+0. 24 K respectively. The result of inter-calibration validation with IASI shows that the improved on-orbit calibration brightness temperature bias is better than 0. 5 K@290 K.

TI  - Autonomous Mission Planning Method for Optical Imaging Satellites Based on Real-Time Cloud Cover Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover is an important factor limiting the earth observation efficiency of optical imaging satellites. Existing solutions include avoiding cloudy observation time windows by onboard cloud detectors and ground monitors, which are difficult to improve satellite observation efficiency in time. In order to solve the problem, firstly, a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites cooperation scheme by using cloud cover information provided by GEO meteorological satellite to guide the imaging of LEO optical satellites is proposed, and the operation flow and key elements in this scheme are analyzed. Secondly, Fengyun-4 GEO meteorological satellite and its cloud mask (CLM) products are analyzed. Thirdly, an autonomous mission planning algorithm based on real-time cloud cover information is proposed. Computational results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed GEO-LEO satellites cooperation scheme by taking the actual orbit and payload data of Fengyun-4 and Gaofen-1/2 satellites as examples.

TI  - Mouthwash as a non-invasive method of indocyanine green delivery for near-infrared fluorescence dental imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance: X-ray imaging serves as the mainstream imaging in dentistry, but it involves risk of ionizing radiation.Aim: This study presents the feasibility of indocyanine green-assisted near-infrared fluorescence (ICG-NIRF) dental imaging with 785-nm NIR laser in the first (ICG-NIRF-I: 700 to 1000 nm) and second (ICG-NIRF-II: 1000 to 1700 nm) NIR wavelengths.Approach: Sprague Dawley rats with different postnatal days were used as animal models. ICG, as a fluorescence agent, was delivered to dental structures by subcutaneous injection (SC) and oral administration (OA).Results: For SC method, erupted and unerupted molars could be observed from ICG-NIRF images at a short imaging time (<1 min). ICG-NIRF-II could achieve a better image contrast in unerupted molars at 24 h after ICG injection. The OA could serve as a non-invasive method for ICG delivery; it could also cause the glow-in-dark effect in unerupted molars. For erupted molars, OA can be considered as mouthwash and exhibits outstanding performance for delivery of ICG dye; erupted molar structures could be observed at a short imaging time (<1 min) and low ICG dose (0.05 mg / kg).Conclusions: Overall, ICG-NIRF with mouthwash could perform in-vivo dental imaging in two NIR wavelengths at a short time and low ICG dose.

TI  - Late Quaternary Slip Behavior of the Jinqianghe Fault in the Middle Qilian-Haiyuan Fault Zone, Northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qilian-Haiyuan fault zone in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau has been the source of strong earthquakes in the region. In its middle segment, the Jinqianghe fault is an important active fault within the Tianzhu seismic gap; however, little is known about its slip behavior. To present a new horizontal displacement distribution along this fault, we used WorldView-2 stereo pairs and unmanned aerial vehicle-based photogrammetry to construct digital elevation models to obtain a detailed tectono-geomorphic interpretation and geomorphic offsets. The offset marker measurements yielded 135 geomorphic displacements and 8 offset clusters. Radiocarbon dating was used to establish the regional age sequence of the geomorphic units in offset fluvial terraces at four study sites. The displacements and ages linked the offset clusters with the geomorphic unit sequence; the Holocene strike-slip rate of the Jinqianghe fault was estimated to 4.8-5.6 mm/a at similar to 4-12 ka and 2.9-4.7 mm/a from similar to 4 ka. Three recent earthquakes (with a recurrence interval of similar to 1000 years) represent an active seismic period, revealing the potential seismic hazard along this fault because it has not ruptured in the last 1500 years.

TI  - Design of Calibration and Validation Area for Forestry Vegetation Index from CAS500-4
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Compact Advanced Satellite 500-4 (CAS500-4) is under development to efficiently manage and monitor forests in Korea and is scheduled to launch in 2025. The National Institute of Forest Science is developing 36 types of forestry applications to utilize the CAS500-4 efficiently. The products derived using the remote sensing method require validation with ground reference data, and the quality monitoring results for the products must be continuously reported. Due to it being the first time developing the national forestry satellite, there is no official calibration and validation site for forestry products in Korea. Accordingly, the author designed a calibration and validation site for the forestry products following international standards. In addition, to install calibration and validation sites nationwide, the authors selected appropriate sensors and evaluated the applicability of the sensors. As a result, the difference between the ground observation data and the Sentinel-2 image was observed to be within +/- 5%, confirming that the sensor could be used for nationwide expansion.

TI  - Improved Surface Soil Moisture Estimation Model in Semi-Arid Regions Using the Vegetation Red-Edge Band Sensitive to Plant Growth
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate description of surface soil moisture (SSM) in vegetation-covered areas is of great significance to water resource management and drought monitoring. To remove the effect of vegetation on SSM estimation, the vegetation index obtained from Sentinel-2 (S2) was applied for vegetation water content (VWC) estimation. The VWC model was substituted into the water cloud model (WCM), and thus, the SSM estimation model was developed based on the WCM. The methodology was tested at Daxing, Beijing, and Gu'an, Hebei, in which training and validation data of SSM were acquired by in situ measurements. The results can be described as follows: (1) For the vegetation-covered areas, the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI) obtained from the B3, B4, and B5 bands of S2 was the most suitable for removing the influence of vegetation on SSM estimation; (2) Compared to Sentinel-1 (S1) vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization, vertical-vertical (VV) polarization was more suitable for SSM estimation and achieved higher accuracy; (3) The developed model could be used to estimate SSM under crop cover with high accuracy, which indicated the correlation coefficients (R-2) between in situ measured and estimated SSM were 0.867, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.028 cm(3)/cm(3), and the MAE was 0.023 cm(3)/cm(3). Thus, this methodology has the potential for SSM estimation in vegetated areas.

TI  - An Open Data Approach for Estimating Vegetation Gross Primary Production at Fine Spatial Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate simulations of the spatial and temporal changes in vegetation gross primary production (GPP) play an important role in ecological studies. Previous studies highlighted large uncertainties in GPP datasets based on satellite data with coarse spatial resolutions (>500 m), and implied the need to produce high-spatial-resolution datasets. However, estimating fine spatial resolution GPP is time-consuming and requires an enormous amount of computing storage space. In this study, based on the Eddy Covariance-Light Use Efficiency (EC-LUE) model, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to develop a web application (EC-LUE APP) to generate 30-m-spatial-resolution GPP estimates within a region of interest. We examined the accuracy of the GPP estimates produced by the APP and compared them with observed GPP at 193 global eddy covariance sites. The results showed the good performance of the EC-LUE APP in reproducing the spatial and temporal variations in the GPP. The fine-spatial-resolution GPP product (GPP(L)) explained 64% of the GPP variations and had fewer uncertainties (root mean square error = 2.34 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and bias (-0.09 g C m(-2) d(-1)) than the coarse-spatial-resolution GPP products. In particular, the GPP(L) significantly improved the GPP estimations for cropland and dryland ecosystems. With this APP, users can easily obtain 30-m-spatial-resolution GPP at any given location and for any given year since 1984.

TI  - Identification of Smoke from Straw Burning in Remote Sensing Images with the Improved YOLOv5s Algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Controlling straw burning is important for ensuring the ambient air quality and for sustainable agriculture. Detecting burning straw is vital for managing and controlling straw burning. Existing methods for detecting straw combustion mainly look for combustion products, especially smoke. In this study, the improved You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5s) algorithm was used to detect smoke in Sentinel-2 images captured by remote sensing. Although the original YOLOv5s model had a faster detection speed, its detection accuracy was poor. Thus, a convolutional block attention module was added to the original model. In addition, in order to speed up the convergence of the model, this study replaced the leaky Rectified Linear Unit (leaky ReLU) activation function with the Mish activation function. The accuracy of the improved model was approximately 4% higher for the same detection speed. The improved YOLOv5s had a higher detection accuracy and speed compared to common target detection algorithms, such as RetinaNet, mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), Single-Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), and faster R-CNN. The improved YOLOv5s analyzed an image in 2 ms. In addition, mAP(50) exceeded 94%, demonstrating that with this study's improved method, smoke can be quickly and accurately identified. This work may serve as a reference for improving smoke detection, and for the effective management and control of straw burning.

TI  - Tracking the Early Movements of Northeast China Cold Vortices Using FY-3D MWTS-2 Observations of Brightness Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northeast China cold vortex (NCCV) often occurs in spring and summer, causing extreme weather such as rainstorm and hail in Northeast China. The brightness temperature (TB) observations of Microwave Temperature Sounder-2 (MWTS-2) on board Fengyun-3D (FY-3D), which can provide atmospheric temperature in various vertical layers, are firstly limb-corrected and then applied to track the origin and movement of four NCCV cases in June and July 2019. Results show that a cold core is observed at the location of NCCVs in TB observations of channels 4 and 5, whose peak weighting function (WF) altitudes are 700 and 400 hPa, respectively, indicating the cold structure of NCCVs in the middle and lower troposphere. The TB observations of channels 6 and 7, which measure the atmospheric temperature around 250 and 200 hPa, respectively, capture a warm core structure of NCCVs in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Being less affected by the low-level cloud and rain, TB observations of channels 6 and 7 are applied to identify and track the warm cores of NCCVs. The NCCV tracks of movement identified by MWTS-2 observations compare well with those determined by the 500 hPa geopotential height and the 300 hPa potential vorticity (PV) anomaly from the ERA5 reanalysis. Both clearly show that the NCCVs were originated from high latitudes, then moved southeastward, and finally entered Northeast China. The entire process took several days. Therefore, TB observations of MWTS-2 can be used to identify the precursors of NCCVs and monitor their appearances, developments, and movements in time. With the flourishing development of Fengyun satellite series in China as well as the already existing 40 years of microwave sounder observations worldwide, this research provides a new way to investigate the synoptic and climatological features of NCCVs.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Flow Velocity Estimation of Mountain Glacier Based on SAR Interferometry and Offset-Tracking Technology: A Case of the Urumqi Glacier No.1
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing estimations of glacier flow velocity could provide effective methods for the long-term monitoring of glacier flow velocity. This paper calculated the velocity in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction by combining DInSAR and offset-tracking technology with ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images of the Urumqi Glacier No.1 from 2016 to 2017. Meanwhile, the velocity in the azimuthal direction was obtained by combining MAI and offset-tracking technology. Then, the eastward, northward, and upward flow velocities were retrieved using the Helmert variance component estimation method. Finally, the standard error of the mean and mean errors of surface velocity in non-glaciated areas of the Urumqi Glacier No.1 were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the results generated by the proposed method. The results showed: (1) The ascending LOS velocity and the descending LOS velocity were 1.812 m/a and -1.558 m/a from 2016 to 2017. The ascending azimuthal and descending azimuthal velocities were 0.978 m/a and -2.542 m/a, respectively. (2) The glacier flow velocities were 2.571 m/a and 1.801 m/a, respectively, for the eastward and northward directions. In the vertical direction, the velocity was -0.554 m/a. (3) The accuracy of the results generated by the proposed method were 0.028 m/a, 0.085 m/a, and 0.063 m/a in the east, north, and vertical directions. Therefore, it is suitable to use ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images and the study method proposed in this paper to estimate the surface flow velocity of mountain glaciers.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change Detection of Coastal Wetlands Using Multi-Band SAR Coherence and Synergetic Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal can penetrate clouds and some vegetation canopies in all weather, and therefore, provides an important measurement tool for change detection and sustainable development of coastal wetland environments and ecosystems. However, there are a few quantitative estimations about the spatiotemporal coherence change with multi-band SAR images in complex coastal wetland ecosystems of the Yellow River Delta (YRD). In this study, C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR data were used to detect the spatiotemporal distribution and change pattern of interferometric coherence in the coastal wetlands of the YRD. The results show that the temporal baseline has a greater impact on the interferometric coherence than the perpendicular baseline, especially for short wavelength C-band SAR. Furthermore, the OTSU algorithm was proven to be able to distinguish the changing regions. The coherence mean and standard deviation values of different land cover types varied significantly in different seasons, while the minimum and maximum coherence changes occurred in February and August, respectively. In addition, considering three classical machine learning algorithms, namely naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), we proposed a method of synergetic classification with SAR coherence, backscatter intensity, and optical images for coastal wetland classification. The multilayer perceptron algorithm performs the best in synergetic classification with an overall accuracy of 98.3%, which is superior to a single data source or the other two algorithms. In this article, we provide an alternative cost-effective method for coastal wetland change detection, which contributes to more accurate dynamic land cover classification and to an understanding of the response mechanism of land features to climate change and human activities.

TI  - Dynamic PSF-based jitter compensation and quality improvement for push-broom optical images considering terrain relief and the TDI effect
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Platform attitude jitter is inevitable during a satellite flight. The jitter reduces the quality of push-broom optical images, resulting in geometric deformation and image blur. This paper proposes an approach that offers jitter effect compensation and quality improvement for push-broom optical images based on dynamic point spread function (PSF) estimation and iterative image restoration considering the effect of terrain relief and time delay integration (TDI). First, the attitude jitter is precisely detected and estimated by considering the terrain relief. The jitter information is then used to establish the dynamic PSF of each image line considering the changing jitter values and TDI effect. Finally, based on the constructed PSF, the image is improved by iterative restoration using the optimal-window Richardson-Lucy algorithm. The method is validated by both simulation and real data experiments. In the simulation experiment, we apply jitter with different amplitudes and frequencies to generate the degraded images and then restore the image using the proposed restoration method. The results show that the proposed method can effectively restore images affected by jitter. In addition, real data experiments are carried out with multispectral remote sensing images from the ZY-3 satellite. The results show that in addition to the improvement of the radiometric quality, the geometric quality is also significantly improved in both the across-track and the along-track directions. The experimental results validated that the proposed method outperformed other methods without considering the terrain and TDI effect. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration within a dryland watershed: Comparison of eddy-covariance observations, water budget estimates, and satellite-based products
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and continuous estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are crucial for comprehending associated hydrological processes, especially in dryland watersheds. However, there remains a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of multi-source ET estimates' performance and uncertainties. To further assist ET estimation improvement and water resources management, we incorporated diffuse radiation partitioning and water-carbon coupling processes into the satellite-driven Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP) model for estimating ET in the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China, and compared it with eddy covariance (EC) observations, water budget estimates, and five global satellite-based products from Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML), Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS). Sobol' sensitivity analysis was applied to the VIP model. Uncertainties in ET estimates were identified by the three-cornered hat method. Results indicate that stomatal conductance coefficient, quantum efficiency, and clear sky index were dominant influencing parameters for VIP ET. Moreover, VIP and GLASS ET were in strong agreement with the EC-based ET, although SSEBop ET was not, and MODIS ET could not capture seasonal variations. VIP could best represent ET dynamics from water budgets on the basin scale, followed by PML. During the period 2003-2015, GLASS, PML, and VIP provided reasonable ET estimates in this region, with an annual ET of 159.3, 153.2, and 173.5 mm, respectively, across the basin. Furthermore, ET algorithm benefits were presented: BESS and VIP, including diffuse radiation partitioning, performed better in cropland; PML and VIP that address water-carbon coupling were stable and independent of the aridity index, and GLASS could considerably reduce uncertainty. The findings contribute to the collective knowledge of ET estimates in similar dryland areas and are relevant worldwide.

TI  - Estimation of Terrestrial Net Primary Productivity in China from <i>Fengyun-3D</i> Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the satellite data used to estimate terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) in China are predominantly from foreign satellites, and very few studies have based their estimates on data from China's Fengyun satellites. Moreover, despite their importance, the influence of land cover types and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on NPP estimation has not been clarified. This study employs the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model to compute the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and the maximum light use efficiency suitable for the main vegetation types in China in accordance with the finer resolution observation and monitoring-global land cover (FROM-GLC) classification product. Then, the NPP is estimated from the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) data and compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NPP product. The FY-3D NPP is also validated with existing research results and historical field-measured NPP data. In addition, the effects of land cover types and the NDVI on NPP estimation are analyzed. The results show that the CASA model and the FY-3D satellite data estimate an average NPP of 441.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2019 for China's terrestrial vegetation, while the total NPP is 3.19 Pg C yr(-1). Compared with the MODIS NPP, the FY-3D NPP is overestimated in areas of low vegetation productivity and is underestimated in high-productivity areas. These discrepancies are largely due to the differences between the FY-3D NDVI and MODIS NDVI. Compared with historical field-measured data, the FY-3D NPP estimation results outperformed the MODIS NPP results, although the deviation between the FY-3D NPP estimate and the in-situ measurement was large and may exceed 20% at the pixel scale. The land cover types and the NDVI significantly affected the spatial distribution of NPP and accounted for NPP deviations of 17.0% and 18.1%, respectively. Additionally, the total deviation resulting from the two factors reached 29.5%. These results show that accurate NDVI products and land cover types are important prerequisites for NPP estimation.

TI  - Ten Years of VIIRS Land Surface Temperature Product Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) has been operationally produced for a decade since the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) launched in October 2011. A comprehensive evaluation of its accuracy and precision will be helpful for product users in climate studies and atmospheric models. In this study, the VIIRS LST is validated with ground observations from multiple high-quality radiation networks, including six stations from the Surface Radiation budget (SURFRAD) network, two stations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), and 13 stations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) network, to evaluate its performance over various land-cover types. The VNP21A1 LST was validated against the same ground observations as a reference. The results yield a close agreement between the SNPP VIIRS LST and ground LSTs with a bias of -0.4 K and a RMSE of 1.96 K over six SURFRAD sites; a bias of -0.2 K and a RMSE of 1.93 K over two BSRN sites; and a bias of -0.1 K and a RMSE of 1.7 K over the 13 ARM sites. The time series of the LST errors over individual sites indicate seasonal cycles. The data anomaly over the BSRN site in Cabauw and the SURFRAD site in Desert Rock is revealed and discussed in this study. In addition, a method using Landsat-8 data is applied to quantify the heterogeneity level of each ground station and the results provide promising insights. The validation results demonstrate the maturity of the JPSS VIIRS LST products and their readiness for various application studies.

TI  - A New Parameterization of Coastal Drag to Simulate Landfast Ice in Deep Marginal Seas in the Arctic
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice is nearly immobile sea ice attached to the coast. Landfast ice inhibits atmosphere-ocean fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum, leads to offshore flaw polynyas, and stores fresh river water in wintertime. Despite these important roles in coastal environments, landfast ice is not well simulated in current sea ice models, because landfast ice dynamics differ from the pack ice in the interior Arctic and require explicit parameterization. The dynamical mechanisms for landfast ice formation are linked to the local geography. Grounded ice ridges act as anchor points in shallow water. Coastlines and offshore island chains may also be pinning points between which arches of landfast ice can form in deep water. The grounding mechanism for landfast ice in shallow marginal seas has been successfully parameterized using bathymetry information, but this grounding scheme fails in deep regions. We describe a new landfast ice parameterization that uses lateral drag as a function of sea ice thickness, drift velocity, and local coastline length. The simulated landfast ice in a 36 km pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean simulation is compared to observations from satellite data and the effect of the new lateral drag parameterization is evaluated. The combination of the established grounding scheme for shallow water and the new lateral drag parameterization for deep water leads to an improved and realistic landfast ice distribution in most marginal seas in the Arctic. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms are at work to create and maintain landfast ice in marginal seas.

TI  - A Flood Mapping Method for Land Use Management in Small-Size Water Bodies: Validation of Spectral Indexes and a Machine Learning Technique
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of flood disasters is considered an essential factor in land use management, being necessary to understand and define the magnitude of past events. In this regard, several flood diagnoses have been developed using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, especially in large water bodies. However, one of the main challenges is still related to floods, where water surfaces have sizes similar to the spatial resolution of the analyzed satellite images, being difficult to detect and map. Therefore, the present study developed a combined methodology for flood mapping in small-sized water bodies using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery. The method consisted of evaluating the effectiveness of the application and combination of (a) a super-resolution algorithm to improve image resolution, (b) a set of seven spectral indices for highlighting water-covered areas, such as AWE indices, and (c) two methods for flood mapping, including a machine learning method based on unsupervised classification (EM cluster) and 14 thresholding methods for automatic determination. The processes were evaluated in the Carrion River, Palencia, Spain. It was determined that the approach with the best results in flood mapping was the one that combined AWE spectral indices with methods such as Huang and Wang, Li and Tam, Otsu, moment preservation, and EM cluster classification, showing global accuracy and Kappa coefficient values higher than 0.88 and 0.75, respectively, when applying the quantitative accuracy index.

TI  - XCO<sub>2</sub> and XCH<sub>4</sub> Reconstruction Using GOSAT Satellite Data Based on EOF-Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) can help to ascertain the global distribution of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), and how the sources and sinks of these gases vary by season, year, and location. However, the data provided by the GOSAT level 2 and 3 products have certain limitations due to their lack of spatial and temporal information; even with the application of the kriging geostatistical method on the level 2 products, the processing algorithms still need further upgrades. In this study, we apply an empirical orthogonal function (EOF)-based method on the GOSAT L3 products (137 images, from January 2010 to May 2021) to estimate the column average of carbon dioxide and methane (XCO2-XCH4) within the entire Earth. The reconstructed results are validated against the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (i.e., TCCON), with 31 in situ stations, and GOSAT L4B column-averaged data, using 107 layers. The results show an excellent agreement with the TCCON data and exhibit an R-squared coefficient of 0.95 regarding the CO2 measurements and 0.86 regarding the CH4 measurements. Therefore, this methodology can be incorporated into the processing steps used to map global greenhouse gases.

TI  - The Applicability of LandTrendr to Surface Water Dynamics: A Case Study of Minnesota from 1984 to 2019 Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The means to accurately monitor wetland change over time are crucial to wetland management. This paper explores the applicability of LandTrendr, a temporal segmentation algorithm designed to identify significant interannual trends, to monitor wetlands by modeling surface water presence in Minnesota from 1984 to 2019. A time series of harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data in the spring is developed in Google Earth Engine, and calculated to sub-pixel water fraction. The optimal parameters for modeling this time series with LandTrendr are identified by minimizing omission of known surface water locations, and the result of this optimal model of sub-pixel water fraction is evaluated against reference images and qualitatively. Accuracy of this method is high: overall accuracy is 98% and producer's and user's accuracies for inundation are 82% and 88% respectively. Maps summarizing the trendlines of multiple pixels, such as frequency of inundation over the past 35 years, also show LandTrendr as applied here can accurately model long-term trends in surface water presence across wetland types. However, the tendency of omission for more variable prairie pothole wetlands and the under-prediction of inundation for small or emergent wetlands suggests the algorithm will require careful development of the segmented time series to capture inundated conditions more accurately.

TI  - Evolution Analysis of Ecological Networks Based on Spatial Distribution Data of Land Use Types Monitored by Remote Sensing in Wuhan Urban Agglomeration, China, from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Construction and protection of ecological networks (ENs) is considered to be an effective means to curb habitat fragmentation and strengthen landscape connectivity. In this study, a complete evaluation framework of ENs based on "quality-function-structure" was proposed to support the formulation of protection strategies for ENs. First, we built the ENs of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) from 2000 to 2020 based on the advantages of circuit theory and remote sensing data of land use monitoring. The results showed that land development activities are an important driving force for the temporal and spatial evolution of global ENs. Forest fragmentation, transitional urban expansion, and agricultural reclamation were important inducements for the shrinkage of ecological sources. They may also increase the resistance of species migration, which will lead to qualitative change and even fracture of ecological corridors. Second, circuit theory, centrality index, and complex network theory were applied to evaluate the quality defects, functional connectivity, and topology characteristics of ENs in WUA, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that the antagonism between ecological corridors and land development activities led to ecological quality defects (ecological barriers and pinchpoints). Different land development models had differential effects on centrality indexes. Moreover, the main trunk in the northern Dabie Mountains and the southern Mufu mountains was developed, while the secondary trunks were abundant in the middle of WUA. Finally, we proposed protection strategies for ENs based on the coupling of the "quality-function-structure" of WUA in 2020. It is suggested that all ecological sources must be included in nature reserves to prevent natural or manmade erosion. The key areas to be repaired were determined through the quality evaluation of ecological corridors. The priority of construction and protection of ecological corridors was determined by coupling two topological structures and functions. We argue that specific protection strategies and directions can be determined according to the construction objectives of local ENs.

TI  - Similar distribution of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes and nodal metastases in cervical and endometrial cancer. A prospective study based on lymphatic anatomy
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Comparing the anatomical distribution of metastatic and non-metastatic pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in cervical and endometrial cancer.Methods. Detailed SIN mapping results were prospectively retrieved in cervical (n - 145) or high-risk endometrial cancer (n = 201) patients undergoing a robotic staging procedure. Cervically injected Indocyanine Green (ICG), allowing for reinjection in case of inadequate mapping, was used as tracer. An anatomically based definition of SINS was adhered to evaluating the upper (UPP) and lower (LPP) paracervical lymphatic pathways. The positions of SLNs were intraoperatively depicted on an anatomical chart. A completory pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. Mapping rates and anatomical distribution of SINS and the location of pelvic nodal metastases were compared between groups.Results. The bilateral mapping rate was 97.9% and 95.0% for cervical and endometrial cancer respectively (p = .16). The proportion of typically positioned (interiliac and proximal obturator fossa) SLNs along the UPP was similar between groups (78.1% vs 82.1%, p = .09), and the rate of metastatic SLNs in the obturator fossa was 54.1% and 48.6% respectively (p = .45). All pelvic node positive women (cervical cancer n = 19, endometrial cancer n = 37) had at least one metastatic SLN. Anatomically typical positions could not be defined along the LPP.Conclusion. The anatomical location of SLNs and SIN metastases are similar in cervical and endometrial cancer suggesting that sensitivity results for an SLN concept in endometrial cancer and cervical cancer can be accumulated.

TI  - New Insights into Ice Avalanche-Induced Debris Flows in Southeastern Tibet Using SAR Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drastic climate change has led to glacier retreat in southeastern Tibet, and the increased frequency and magnitude of heavy rainfall and intense snow melting have intensified the risk of ice avalanche-induced debris flows in this region. To prevent and mitigate such hazards, it is important to derive the pre-disaster evolutionary characteristics of glacial debris flows and understand their triggering mechanisms. However, ice avalanche-induced debris flows mostly occur in remote alpine mountainous areas that are hard for humans to reach, which makes it extremely difficult to conduct continuous ground surveys and optical remote sensing monitoring. To this end, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were used in this study to detect and analyze the pre-disaster deformation characteristics and spatial evolution in the Sedongpu Basin and to detect changes in the snowmelt in the basin in order to improve our understanding of the triggering mechanism of the ice avalanche-induced debris flows in this region. The results revealed that the maximum average deformation rate in the basin reached 57.3 mm/year during the monitoring period from January 2016 to October 2018. The deformation displacement in the gully where the ice avalanche source area was located was intimately correlated with the summer snowmelt and rainfall and was characterized by seasonal accumulation. Clear acceleration of the deformation was detected after both the most recent earthquake and the strong rainfall and snowmelt processes in the summer of 2018. This suggests that earthquakes, snowmelt, and rainfall were significant triggers of the Sedongpu ice avalanche-induced debris flows. The results of this study provide new insights into the genesis of the Sedongpu ice avalanche-induced debris flows, which could assist in disaster warning and prevention in alpine mountain regions.

TI  - Different Vegetation Information Inputs Significantly Affect the Evapotranspiration Simulations of the PT-JPL Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential part of the global water cycle, and accurate quantification of ET is of great significance for hydrological research and practice. The Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model is a commonly used remotely sensed (RS) ET model. The original PT-JPL model includes multiple vegetation variables but only requires the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the vegetation input. Other vegetation inputs (e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR)) are estimated by the NDVI-based empirical methods. Here we investigate whether introducing more RS vegetation variables beyond NDVI can improve the PT-JPL model's performance. We combine the vegetation variables derived from RS and empirical methods into four vegetation input schemes for the PT-JPL model. The model performance under four schemes is evaluated at the site scale with the eddy covariance (EC)-based ET measurements and at the basin scale with the water balance-based ET estimates. The results show that the vegetation variables derived by RS and empirical methods are quite different. The ecophysiological constraints of the PT-JPL model constructed by the former are more reasonable in spatial distribution than those constructed by the latter. However, as vegetation input of the PT-JPL model, the scheme derived from empirical methods performs best among the four schemes. In other words, introducing more remotely sensed vegetation variables beyond NDVI into the PT-JPL model degrades the model performance to varying degrees. One possible reason for this is the unrealistic ET partitioning. It is necessary to re-parameterize the biophysical constraints of the PT-JPL model to ensure that the model obtains reasonable internal process simulations, that is, "getting the right results for right reasons."

TI  - Measuring pain care quality in the Veterans Health Administration primary care setting
T2  - PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of a reliable approach to assess quality of pain care hinders quality improvement initiatives. Rule-based natural language processing algorithms were used to extract pain care quality (PCQ) indicators from documents of Veterans Health Administration primary care providers for veterans diagnosed within the past year with musculoskeletal disorders with moderate-to-severe pain intensity across 2 time periods 2013 to 2014 (fiscal year [FY] 2013) and 2017 to 2018 (FY 2017). Patterns of documentation of PCQ indicators for 64,444 veterans and 124,408 unique visits (FY 2013) and 63,427 veterans and 146,507 visits (FY 2017) are described. The most commonly documented PCQ indicators in each cohort were presence of pain, etiology or source, and site of pain (greater than 90% of progress notes), while least commonly documented were sensation, what makes pain better or worse, and pain's impact on function (documented in fewer than 50%). A PCQ indicator score (maximum = 12) was calculated for each visit in FY 2013 (mean = 7.8, SD = 1.9) and FY 2017 (mean = 8.3, SD = 2.3) by adding one point for every indicator documented. Standardized Cronbach alpha for total PCQ scores was 0.74 in the most recent data (FY 2017). The mean PCQ indicator scores across patient characteristics and types of healthcare facilities were highly stable. Estimates of the frequency of documentation of PCQ indicators have face validity and encourage further evaluation of the reliability, validity, and utility of the measure. A reliable measure of PCQ fills an important scientific knowledge and practice gap.

TI  - The Impact of Inflammatory Stimuli on Xylosyltransferase-I Regulation in Primary Human Dermal Fibroblasts
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Inflammation plays a vital role in regulating fibrotic processes. Beside their classical role in extracellular matrix synthesis and remodeling, fibroblasts act as immune sentinel cells participating in regulating immune responses. The human xylosyltransferase-I (XT-I) catalyzes the initial step in proteoglycan biosynthesis and was shown to be upregulated in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) under fibrotic conditions. Regarding inflammation, the regulation of XT-I remains elusive. This study aims to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototypical pathogen-associated molecular pattern, and the damage-associated molecular pattern adenosine triphosphate (ATP) on the expression of XYLT1 and XT-I activity of NHDF. We used an in vitro cell culture model and mimicked the inflammatory tissue environment by exogenous LPS and ATP supplementation. Combining gene expression analyses, enzyme activity assays, and targeted gene silencing, we found a hitherto unknown mechanism involving the inflammasome pathway components cathepsin B (CTSB) and caspase-1 in XT-I regulation. The suppressive role of CTSB on the expression of XYLT1 was further validated by the quantification of CTSB expression in fibroblasts from patients with the inflammation-associated disease Pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Altogether, this study further improves the mechanistic understanding of inflammatory XT-I regulation and provides evidence for fibroblast-targeted therapies in inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Characterizing Spatial Patterns of Amazon Rainforest Wildfires and Driving Factors by Using Remote Sensing and GIS Geospatial Technologies
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Known as the "lung of the planet", the Amazon rainforest produces more than 20% of the Earth's oxygen. Once a carbon pool for mitigating climate change, the Brazilian Amazonia Biome recently has become a significant carbon emitter due to increasingly frequent wildfires. Therefore, it is of crucial importance for authorities to understand wildfire dynamics to manage them safely and effectively. This study incorporated remote sensing and spatial statistics to study both the spatial distribution of wildfires during 2019 and their relationships to 15 environmental and anthropogenic factors. First, broad-scale spatial patterns of wildfire occurrence were explored using kernel density estimation, Moran's I, Getis-Ord Gi*, and optimized hot spot analysis (OHSA). Second, the relationships between wildfire occurrence and the environmental and anthropogenic factors were explored using several regression models, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), global (quasi) Poisson, Geographically-weighted Gaussian Regression (GWGR), and Geographically-weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR). The spatial analysis results indicate that wildfires exhibited pronounced regional differences in spatial patterns in the vast and heterogeneous territory of the Amazonia Biome. The GWPR model outperformed the other regression models and explained the distribution and frequency of wildfires in the Amazonia Biome as a function of topographic, meteorologic, and environmental variables. Environmental factors like elevation, slope, relative humidity, and temperature were significant factors in explaining fire frequency in localized hotspots, while factors related to deforestation (forest loss, forest fragmentation measures, agriculture) explained wildfire activity over much of the region. Therefore, this study could improve a comprehensive study on, and understanding of, wildfire patterns and spatial variation in the target areas to support agencies as they prepare and plan for wildfire and land management activities in the Amazonia Biome.

TI  - Determining the accuracy of the landsat-based land continuous Variable Estimator
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inversion framework Land continuous Variable Estimator for Landsat data (LoVE)-Landsat has been recently developed, but the estimation accuracy has not been well determined. LoVE-Landsat is a data-assimilation-based inversion framework capable of estimating a series of daily 30-m spatiotemporal continuous land surface variables from Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data. This paper presents the comprehensive validation results of a land surface variables estimation conducted through LoVE-Landsat, including the leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), surface broadband albedo, incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and incident shortwave radiation (ISR). This validation involved a direct validation using extensive ground measurements and an inter-comparison with existing satellite products. In situ measurements came from a total of 196 sites covering different biome types from seven networks distributed around the world. Among these sites, more than 2000 LAI and FAPAR plot measurements representing the Landsat pixel size were collected from 40 sites of the Bigfoot, VALERI, and ImagineS networks, about 100 LAI and FAPAR reference values at 3-km scale were provided by 52 sites of DIRECT datasets, and nearly 70,000 albedo and ISR and 40,000 PAR tower-based measurements were gathered from 143 sites of Ameriflux, Euroflux, Ozflux, and SURFRAD networks. Results showed that the LoVE-Landsat 30 m LAI estimates were accurate, with R2 = 0.76 and rootmean-square-error (RMSE) = 0.89, and were slightly more accurate than the coarse resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product at the kilometer scale (RMSE = 0.75 vs. 0.79). Validation at the 143 flux network sites showed that the daily snow-free LoVE-Landsat 30 m shortwave albedo had an accuracy comparable to the MODIS daily albedo product (RMSE around 0.037) and higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.031) when Landsat had clear-sky observations. Direct validation of ISR and PAR estimation showed high accuracy, with RMSE values of 102.8 and 48.7 W/m2, respectively. Spatial and temporal evaluation at six typical sites also showed that LoVELandsat could produce consistent spatially and temporally continuous estimation. Although a more comprehensive validation of all retrievals still needs to be conducted, both the direct validation and product comparison results of the key variables indicate that LoVE-Landsat can estimate a group of spatially and temporally continuous variables from Landsat observations accurately, which demonstrates the strong potential of LoVELandsat to generate global 30-m continuous land products.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Energy Changes over Different Underlying Surfaces Based on MODIS Land-Use Data and Green Vegetation Fraction over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To better predict and understand land-atmospheric interactions in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land-use data and the MODIS-derived green vegetation fraction (GVF) to analyze the variation trend over the TP. The in situ observations from six flux stations ("BJ" (the BJ site of Nagqu Station of Plateau Climate and Environment), "MAWORS" (the Muztagh Ata Westerly Observation and Research Station), "NADORS" (the Ngari Desert Observation and Research Station), "NAMORS" (the Nam Co Monitoring and Research Station for Multisphere Interactions), "QOMS" (the Qomolangma Atmospheric and Environmental Observation and Research Station), and "SETORS" (the Southeast Tibet Observation and Research Station for the Alpine Environment)) at the Chinese TP Scientific Data Center were used to study the surface energy variation characteristics and energy distribution over different underlying surfaces. Finally, we used observation data to verify the applicability of the ERA-5 land reanalysis data to the TP. The results showed that the annual GVF steadily declined from the southeast parts to the northwest parts of the TP, and the vegetation coverage rate was highest from June to September. The sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), net surface radiation (Rn), and four-component radiation (solar downward shortwave radiation (Rsd), surface upward shortwave radiation (Rsu), atmospheric downward longwave radiation (Rld), and surface upward longwave radiation (Rlu)) reached their maxima in summer at each station. Rld did not change significantly with time; all other variables increased during the day and decreased at night. The interannual variation in H and LE shows that latent heat exchange was the dominant form of energy transfer in BJ, MAWORS, NAMORS, and SETORS. By contrast, sensible heat exchange was the main form of energy transfer in NADORS and QOMS. The Bowen ratio was generally low in summer, and some sites had a maximum in spring. The surface albedo exhibited a "U" shape, decreasing in spring and summer, and increasing in autumn and winter, and reaching the lowest value at noon. Except for SETORS, ERA-5 Land data and other flux stations had high simulation accuracy and correlation. Regional surface energy changes were mainly observed in the eastern and western parts of the TP, except for the maximum of H in spring; the maximum values of other heat fluxes were concentrated in summer.

TI  - Towards big SAR data era: An efficient Sentinel-1 Near-Real-Time InSAR processing workflow with an emphasis on co-registration and phase unwrapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 Near-Real-Time (NRT) processing embraces great potential in its applications to a wide range of research topics. Towards higher quality NRT products, it is crucial to avoid data reprocessing and to dynamically update InSAR time series. Although state-of-the-art techniques, enabled by high-performance computers and high-capacity storage platforms, make the highly multi-looked data available online quickly, the technique and procedure for efficiently obtaining relatively high resolution NRT data for a specified region are still lacking. Here we propose a workflow in a review way towards efficient and high-resolution Sentinel-1 NRT InSAR processing. In addition, we are committed to addressing issues that are often overlooked but indispensable in NRT data processing: co-registration and phase unwrapping. Through this workflow, not only NRT results in the radar Line-of-Sight (LOS) direction can be obtained, but also along-track NRT observations in overlap regions of images can be achieved. Unlike deriving LOS time series displacements which requires additional operations after co-registration, along-track displacements, a by-product of co-registration, can be directly obtained without further processing. We test and validate the proposed workflow in three regions with representative geomorphological processes including volcanic activity, city subsidence, and landslides. Experimental results demonstrate that our workflow can perform NRT monitoring at a relatively high resolution and a relatively low computational and storage "burden". The time efficiency is increased by similar to 65% and the storage space is saved by similar to 21.8%.

TI  - Remote geochemical alteration proxy for mineral exploration: A case study from Lawa gold mines, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES-X
M3  - Article
AB  - Geochemical alteration indexes viz. carbonate chlorite pyrite index, ishikawa alteration index, hashiguchi alteration index, chemical alteration index and silicification index are conventionally used to study the degree and type of alteration. Thin section microscopic and X-ray Fluorescence analysis got similar roles for alteration study. Due to sparse and expensive sampling, the regional depiction of alteration patterns and their quantitative analysis are usually unavailable for exploration geologists. Here, we provided an alternative remote proxy-based approach to map the degree and type of alteration on a large scale, using visible-near infrared and shortwave infrared bundles of WorldView-3 imagery. The chosen study area is sparsely vegetated Lawa gold deposit in the North Singhbhum Mobile Belt, India. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) modelling of geochemical alteration indexes with reflectance spectra was used to understand the spatial variation in the degree of alterations. The remotely derived alteration indexes can be linked with field and microscopic studies of Cu-Au mineralization. We found dominance of alteration processes in the following order: ferruginisation, silicification, sericitization and chloritization. Demarcated intensely hydrothermally altered zones are present near the exposed mineralized outcrop. In addition, we identified new alteration zones with ore phases as a plausible mineralized zone.

With the abundance of spatial data and access to improved technologies, it is critical to provide an effective method of analysis to evaluate changes in land use in the face of the global need to understand the dynamics of vegetation in regeneration processes. In this context, we evaluated the dynamics of natural regeneration through phenological patterns by measuring the maximal and minimal spectral thresholds at four fire-impacted sites in Chiquitania in 2019 and 2020, and compared them with unburned areas using harmonic fitted values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). We used two-way ANOVA test to evaluate the significant differences in the values of the profiles of NDVI and NBR indices. We quantified severity at the four study sites using the dNBR obtained from the difference between pre- and postfire NBR. Additionally, we selected 66 sampling sites to apply the Composite Burn Index (CBI) methodology. Our results indicate that NBR is the most reliable index for interannual comparisons and determining changes in the phenological pattern, which allow for the detection of postfire regeneration. Fire severity levels based on dNBR and CBI indices are reliable methodologies that allow for determining the severity and dynamics of changes in postfire regeneration levels in forested and nonforested areas.

TI  - Coupling and Coordination Relationships between Urban Expansion and Ecosystem Service Value in Kashgar City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing urbanization of oasis cities in arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China has an adverse influence on the fragile local ecological system. Therefore, improved understanding of the coupling and coordination between urban expansion (UE) and ecosystem services value (ESv) is critical to long term sustainable development. Here, we study the urbanization trend of a typical oasis city of Northwest China (Kashgar) using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery from 1990 to 2015. Land use types are classified and the spatio-temporal features of UE are analyzed; ESv of each land use types and the ecosystem services function (ESf) are determined; the driving factors of UE and the spato-temporal change of ESv are analyzed; and the coupling and coordination relationship between UE and ESv is quantitatively determined. Results show that: (1) The land use structure has changed significantly between 1990 and 2015, with construction land (40.51 km(2)) showing the highest growth and farmland (28.42 km(2)). (2) UE values during 2000-2005 (16.65 km(2)) and 2010-2015 (21.09 km(2)) are relatively large, and during 1990-2015, the city extended from the center to the outskirts at a dynamic growth rate of 13.17% and a comprehensive expansion index of 1.54 parts per thousand. (3) The total ESv was reduced by CNY 35.76 million (USD similar to 5.26 million), ranked from high to low as: waste treatment (CNY 9.94 million, USD similar to 1.46 million), water source conservation (CNY 7.95 million, USD similar to 1.17 million), soil formation (CNY 4.60 million, USD similar to 0.68 million), biodiversity protection (CNY 3.37 million, USD similar to 0.5 million), climate regulation (CNY 3.15 million, USD similar to 0.46 million), food production (CNY 2.83 million, USD similar to 0.42 million), gas regulation (CNY 1.96 million, USD similar to 0.29 million), entertainment and leisure (CNY 1.26 million, USD similar to 0.19 million), and raw materials (CNY 0.68 million, USD similar to 0.1 million). (4) The coupling degree between UE and ESv is relatively small (<0.5), though this value has increased yearly. The coordination degree between UE and ESv is relatively low, indicating that UE already poses a serious danger to the ecological environment. (5) The rapid growth of the population and economy and government policies are the main driving factors of intensive UE. Increasing climatic factors such as precipitation, temperature, and runoff impact ESv in some positive ways whereas UE leads to a reduction of ESv. Our results here can help to guide long-term sustainable development of arid regions, reasonable urban planning of oasis cities, and protection of the local ecological environment.

T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW B
M3  - Article
AB  - An unusual temperature-induced spin reorientation transition from ???2(Fx, Cy, Gz)-???23-???3(Cx, Fy, Az) in orthoferrite Sm0.5Y0.5FeO3 is observed in the range 282???312 K through magnetic susceptibility measured on oriented single crystals. The ???2-???23-???3 transition is distinctly different from the spin configurations commonly observed in RFeO3 orthoferrites, and we corroborate the finding with results from Raman spectroscopic investigations. Observation of magnon spectra and the vivid correlation between spin reorientation and changes in B2g and B3g phonon modes unveil strong spin-phonon coupling prevalent in Sm0.5Y0.5FeO3 crystal.

TI  - Variability in the Spatiotemporal Distribution Patterns of Greater Amberjack in Response to Environmental Factors in the Taiwan Strait Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental characteristics of the Taiwan Strait (TS) have been linked to variations in the abundance and distribution of greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) populations. Greater amberjack is a commercially and ecologically valuable species in ecosystems, and its spatial distribution patterns are pivotal to fisheries management and conservation. However, the relationship between the catch rates of S. dumerili and the environmental changes and their impact on fish communities remains undetermined in the TS. The goal of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of S. dumerili with environmental characteristics in the TS from south to north (20 degrees N-29 degrees N and 115 degrees E-127 degrees E), applying generalized additive models (GAMs) and spatiotemporal fisheries data from logbooks and voyage data recorders from Taiwanese fishing vessels (2014-2017) as well as satellite-derived remote sensing environmental data. We used the generalized linear model (GLM) and GAM to analyze the effect of environmental factors and catch rates. The predictive performance of the two statistical models was quantitatively assessed by using the root mean square difference. Results reveal that the GAM outperforms the GLM model in terms of the functional relationship of the GAM for generating a reliable predictive tool. The model selection process was based on the significance of model terms, increase in deviance explained, decrease in residual factor, and reduction in Akaike's information criterion. We then developed a species distribution model based on the best GAMs. The deviance explained indicated that sea surface temperature, linked to high catch rates, was the key factor influencing S. dumerili distributions, whereas mixed layer depth was the least relevant factor. The model predicted a relatively high S. dumerili catch rate in the northwestern region of the TS in summer, with the area extending to the East China Sea. The target species is strongly influenced by biophysical environmental conditions, and potential fishing areas are located throughout the waters of the TS. The findings of this study showed how S. dumerili populations respond to environmental variables and predict species distributions. Data on the habitat preferences and distribution patterns of S. dumerili are essential for understanding the environmental conditions of the TS, which can inform future priorities for conservation planning and management.

TI  - Acral lentiginous melanoma histotype predicts outcome in clinical stage I-II melanoma patients: an International multicenter study
T2  - ESMO OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification, acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) histotype ALM is not included as an independent prognostic factor; in small series its negative prognostic impact on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) has been linked to the greater Breslow thickness (BT).Patients and methods: The study was carried out at four referral melanoma centers (three Italian and one Polish). Clinical consecutive patients with stage I-II melanoma, who were diagnosed, treated, and followed up between January 1998 and March 2018 in annotated specific databases were included.Results: Overall, 6734 were evaluable, 4349 with superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), 2132 with nodular melanoma (NM), and 253 with ALM. At univariable analysis, a statistically significant worse DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 2.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24-3.30; P < 0.001] and OS (HR 2.67, 95% CI 2.15-3.32; P < 0.001) were found in patients with ALM compared with SSM. Similarly, the NM histotype was associated with a worse prognosis compared with the SSM histotype (DFS: HR 2.29, 95% CI 2.08-2.52; P < 0.001 and OS: HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.99-2.46; P < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, BT, ulceration, and the sentinel lymph node status, a statistically significant worse DFS [adjusted HR (aHR; ALM versus SSM) 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.52; P = 0.028] was confirmed for patients with ALM. For patients with NM, instead, no impact of histology was found in terms of DFS [aHR (NM versus SSM) 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.15; P = 0.513] and OS [aHR (NM versus SSM) 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-1.08; P = 0.548].Conclusions: ALM is associated with a worse long-term DFS. Our results could have important clinical implications for patients' stratification in future clinical trials and the incorporation of ALM histotype in the new AJCC classification as an independent prognostic factor.

TI  - Using Range Split-Spectrum Interferometry to Reduce Phase Unwrapping Errors for InSAR-Derived DEM in Large Gradient Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of the conventional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) always encounters phase unwrapping (PU) errors in areas with a sizeable topographic gradient. Range split-spectrum interferometry (RSSI) can overcome this issue; however, it loses the spatial resolution of the SAR image. We propose the use of the RSSI-assisted In-SAR-derived DEM (RID) method to address this challenge. The proposed approach first applies the RSSI method to generate a prior DEM, used for simulating terrain phases. Then, the simulated terrain phases are subtracted from the wrapped InSAR phases to obtain wrapped residual phases. Finally, the residual phases are unwrapped by the minimum cost flow (MCF) method, and the unwrapped residual phases are added to the simulated phases. Both the simulated and TerraSAR-X data sets are used to verify the proposed method. Compared with the InSAR and RSSI methods, the proposed approach can effectively decrease the PU errors of large gradients, ensure data resolution, and guarantee the DEM's accuracy. The root mean square error between the topographic phase simulated from the real DEM and the topographic phase generated from the proposed method is 2.22 rad, which is significantly lower than 6.60 rad for InSAR, and the improvement rate is about 66.36%.

TI  - Delineating Groundwater Recharge Potential through Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the extensive global dependency on groundwater and associated increasing water demand, the global groundwater level is declining rapidly. In the case of Islamabad, Pakistan, the groundwater level has lowered five times over the past five years due to extensive pumping by various departments and residents to meet the local water requirements. To address this, water reservoirs and sources need to be delineated, and potential recharge zones are highlighted to assess the recharge potential. Therefore, the current study utilizes an integrated approach based on remote sensing (RS) and GIS using the influence factor (IF) technique to delineate potential groundwater recharge zones in Islamabad, Pakistan. Soil map of Pakistan, Landsat 8TM satellite data, digital elevation model (ASTER DEM), and local geological map were used in the study for the preparation of thematic maps of 15 key contributing factors considered in this study. To generate a combined groundwater recharge map, rate and weightage values were assigned to each factor representing their mutual influence and recharge capabilities. To analyze the final combined recharge map, five different assessment analogies were used in the study: poor, low, medium, high, and best. The final recharge potential map for Islamabad classifies 15% (136.8 km(2)) of the region as the "best" zone for extracting groundwater. Furthermore, high, medium, low, and poor ranks were assigned to 21%, 24%, 27%, and 13% of the region with respective areas of 191.52 km(2), 218.88 km(2), 246.24 km(2), and 118.56 km(2). Overall, this research outlines the best to least favorable zones in Islamabad regarding groundwater recharge potentials. This can help the authorities devise mitigation strategies and preserve the natural terrain in the regions with the best groundwater recharge potential. This is aligned with the aims of the interior ministry of Pakistan for constructing small reservoirs and ponds in the existing natural streams and installing recharging wells to maintain the groundwater level in cities. Other countries can expand upon and adapt this study to delineate local groundwater recharge potentials.

TI  - Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) diversity and medical importance in Koh Kong mangrove forests, Cambodia
T2  - ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mangroves are an ecosystem interface between land and sea, forming distinctive shallow-water marine communities in tropical and subtropical waters. The mangrove forest surface in Cambodia is being reduced due to deforestation. Because the mangrove type of ecosystem generally hosts a great diversity of mosquitoes, the urbanization of these ecosystems will increase interactions between humans and wild mosquitoes, and might thus serve as a potential source of new infectious diseases. Understanding mosquito diversity and analyzing their virome is critical to estimate the risk of emergence or future outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Objective To understand the mosquito diversity of mangrove forests of Koh Kong province (Cambodia). Methods In 2019, the mosquito fauna was sampled for 3 consecutive days using BG-Sentinel and light traps, in 3 locations in the mangrove forests of Koh Kong province (Cambodia) during both dry and rainy seasons. Results A total of 3107 samples were collected, belonging to 10 genera for 34 species. The Culex genus was the most diverse, accounting for 10 species. One species, Culex sitiens, represented over 60% of all collected mosquitoes. A total of 12 medically important species were recorded, 2 species, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus and Culex vishnui, were collected in all sites and during both the dry and rainy seasons, highlighting a potential risk of these species acting as bridge vectors. Conclusions If new arboviruses were to be recorded in this peculiar area, it would indicate that the mosquito species found have the potential to act as a bridge between sylvatic and anthropogenic arboviruses.

TI  - The Artistic Modelling of History in the Aesthetic Consciousness of a Time Period as a Methodological Problem of Postmodernism
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Created during a certain time period of the world's art development, fictional history embodies not only a set of individual authorial creative acts, but it is the only "artistic-historical model" conditioned by a number of objective aesthetic and non-aesthetic factors. As such, fictional history represents an integral part of the national worldview. Its exploration requires a combinatorial unity of methods. The article proposes a set of modern methodological principles for studying the processes of artistic modelling of history in the aesthetic consciousness on the synchronous level (a certain time period) and their representation in literary works. The methods of academic literary criticism are combined with the advanced methods of modern interdisciplinary humanities that are based on postmodern philosophy. Thus, in the chosen combination of the scientific approaches, the heuristic potential of the structural-semiotic and structural-typological methods, mythopoetics and myth-restoration, imagology, hermeneutics, and receptive aesthetics, correlates with the methods of systematic and descriptive analysis. Such diverse theoretical combinations, the existence of a kind of "methodological sinusoid" within the study, do not contradict but complement each other.

TI  - Worldwide Statistical Correlation of Eight Years of <i>Swarm</i> Satellite Data with M5.5+Earthquakes: New Hints about the Preseismic Phenomena from Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the possibility that medium-large earthquakes could produce some electromagnetic ionospheric disturbances during their preparatory phase is controversial in the scientific community. Some previous works using satellite data from DEMETER, Swarm and, recently, CSES provided several pieces of evidence supporting the existence of such precursory phenomena in terms of single case studies and statical analyses. In this work, we applied a Worldwide Statistical Correlation approach to M5.5+ shallow earthquakes using the first 8 years of Swarm (i.e., from November 2013 to November 2021) magnetic field and electron density signals in order to improve the significance of previous statistical studies and provide some new results on how earthquake features could influence ionospheric electromagnetic disturbances. We implemented new methodologies based on the hypothesis that the anticipation time of anomalies of larger earthquakes is usually longer than that of anomalies of smaller magnitude. We also considered the signal's frequency to introduce a new identification criterion for the anomalies. We find that taking into account the frequency can improve the statistical significance (up to 25% for magnetic data and up to 100% for electron density). Furthermore, we noted that the frequency of the Swarm magnetic field signal of possible precursor anomalies seems to slightly increase as the earthquake is approaching. Finally, we checked a possible relationship between the frequency of the detected anomalies and earthquake features. The earthquake focal mechanism seems to have a low or null influence on the frequency of the detected anomalies, while the epicenter location appears to play an important role. In fact, land earthquakes are more likely to be preceded by slower (lower frequency) magnetic field signals, whereas sea seismic events show a higher probability of being preceded by faster (higher frequency) magnetic field signals.

TI  - Incorporation of sentinel lymph node biopsy in cervical cancer surgery: Recent US trends
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine the trends, characteristics, and outcomes related to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for cervical cancer surgery.Methods: This retrospective cohort study queried the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Study population included patients with invasive cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma) who underwent both hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy for T1 classification from 2003 to 2018. Exposure allocation was per surgical nodal evaluation type (SLN biopsy or lymphadenectomy). Main outcome measures were (i) trend of utilization and patient characteristics related to SLN biopsy assessed with multivariable analysis and (ii) overall survival associated with SLN biopsy assessed with propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting. Sensitivity cohorts included uterine-preserving conservative surgeries.Results: A total of 12,966 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 430 (3.3%) patients underwent SLN biopsy. The utilization of SLN biopsy increased significantly from 0.8% to 15.2% during the study period (P < 0.001). This association remained independent in multivariable analysis: 2011-2014 versus 2003-2010 adjusted-odds ratio 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.29-7.23, and 2015-2018 versus 2003-2010 adjusted-odds ratio 20.6, 95%CI 14.6-29.2. In a propensity score weighted model, patients who had SLN biopsy had similar overall survival compared to those without SLN biopsy (3-year rates, 94.8% versus 94.2%, hazard ratio 0.95, 95%CI 0.64-1.41, P = 0.799). In sensitivity analysis, the increase in SLN biopsy was also observed in uterine-preserving surgeries (3.5% to 9.6% for trachelectomy, P = 0.043; and 2.5% to 19.5% in cervical excision, P < 0.001).Conclusion: Landscape of surgical nodal evaluation is gradually shifting from lymphadenectomy to SLN biopsy in cervical cancer surgery.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moon calibrated radiometrically stable and relatively accurate Earth reflected solar measurements from the Moon and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (MERBE) are compared here to primary channels of coaligned Terra/Aqua MODIS instruments. A space-based climate observing system immune to untracked drifts due to varying instrument calibration is a key priority for climate science. Measuring these changes in radiometers such as MODIS and compensating for them is critical to such a system. The independent MERBE project using monthly lunar scans has made a proven factor of ten improvement in calibration stability and relative accuracy of measurements by all devices originally built for another project called 'CERES', also on the Terra and Aqua satellites. The MERBE comparison shown here uses spectrally invariant Deep Convective Cloud or DCC targets as a transfer, with the objective of detecting possible unknown MODIS calibration trends or errors. Most MODIS channel 1-3 collection 5 calibrations are shown to be correct and stable within stated accuracies of 3% relative to the Moon, much in line with changes made for MODIS collection 6. Stable lunar radiance standards are then separately compared to the sometimes used calibration metric of the coldest DCCs as standalone calibration targets, when also located by MODIS. The analysis overall for the first time finds such clouds can serve as an absolute solar target on the order of 1% accuracy and are stable to +/- 0.3% decade(-1) with two sigma confidences, based on the Moon from 2000-2015. Finally, time series analysis is applied to potential DCC albedo corrected Terra data. This shows it is capable of beginning the narrowing of cloud climate forcing uncertainty before 2015; some twenty five years sooner than previously calculated elsewhere, for missions yet to launch.

TI  - Rainfall Runoff Balance Enhanced Model Applied to Tropical Hydrology
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The integrative and comprehensive analysis considering the spatial and temporal representation of the hydrological process, such as the distribution of rainfall, land cover and land use, is a challenge for the water resources management. In tropical areas, energy availability throughout the year defines the rainfall distribution and evapotranspiration rate according to vegetation heterogeneity. To quantify water balance in tropical areas including these heterogeneities in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationship, we developed a fully distributed hydrological model called the Rainfall Runoff Balance Enhanced Model (RUBEM). The model was developed under a physics-based process structure, using remote sensing data to represent soil-water balance patterns, such as evapotranspiration, interception, baseflow, lateral flow, recharge, and runoff. The calibration procedure was based on nine global parameters. RUBEM could represent the spatio-temporal heterogeneities (soil, land use and land cover (LULC), topography, vegetation, and climate) in three basins in a tropical area. The results showed good adherence between the processes governing the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationship according to the humidity indicator and the runoff coefficient. Overall, RUBEM can be used to help improve the management and planning of integrated water resources under climate, land use, and land cover changes in tropical regions.

TI  - Estimating the Baseline Error of Wide-Swath Altimeters Using Nadir Altimeters <i>via</i> Numerical Simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The baseline roll and length errors for wide-swath altimeters are major error sources in sea surface measurements that exhibit strong spatial characteristics in the cross-track direction. These errors can be identified and estimated in accordance with height differences at crossover points generated with nadir altimeters after excluding the interference from other error sources. Most of the wide-swath altimeter baseline estimation methods considered only the roll error in previous studies. A numerical simulation was conducted in this study using nadir altimeters to estimate the roll and length errors simultaneously to provide a selectable scheme for baseline error estimation and correction for future wide-swath altimeters. Results based on the parameters of the surface water and ocean topography mission and Sentinel-3A show that the correlation coefficient of the roll error between the estimated and simulated values is 0.89, while the correlation coefficient of the length error is 0.85. The sea surface height root mean square error (RMSE) can be reduced from 12.18 cm to 6.45 cm based on the two estimated results. The estimation effect can be increased by using multiple nadir altimeters to form an observation constellation. The numerical simulation of the five nadir altimeter constellation shows that the correlation coefficients of the roll and length errors would increase to 0.97, which reduces the sea surface height RMSE to 2.88 cm. In addition, the stability of this method is indicated in simulation experiments, which introduce different degrees of sea state errors.

TI  - Improving WRF-Fire Wildfire Simulation Accuracy Using SAR and Time Series of Satellite-Based Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire simulations depend on fuel representation. Present fuel models are mainly based on the density and properties of different vegetation types. This study aims to improve the accuracy of WRF-Fire wildfire simulations, by using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data to estimate the fuel load and the trend of vegetation index to estimate the dryness of woody vegetation. We updated the chaparral and timber standard woody fuel classes in the WRF-Fire fuel settings. We used the ESA global above-ground biomass (AGB) based on SAR data to estimate the fuel load, and the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trends of woody vegetation to estimate the fuel moisture content. These fuel sub-parameters represent the dynamic changes and spatial variability of woody fuel. We simulated two wildfires in Israel while using three different fuel models: the original 13 Anderson Fire Behavior fuel model, and two modified fuel models introducing AGB alone, and AGB and dryness. The updated fuel model (the basic fuel model plus the AGB and dryness) improved the simulation results significantly, i.e., the Jaccard similarity coefficient increased by 283% on average. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining satellite SAR data and Landsat NDVI trends to improve WRF-Fire wildfire simulations.

TI  - Aerosol Distributions and Transport over Southern Morocco from Ground-Based and Satellite Observations (2004-2020)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the optical properties of aerosols on daily and seasonal scales with the use of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) data retrieved from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and collected at four stations in Southern Morocco-Saada (31.63 degrees N; 8.16 degrees W), Ouarzazate (30.93 degrees N; 6.91 degrees W), Oukaimeden (31.21 degrees N; 7.86 degrees W) and Ras-El-Ain (31.67 degrees N; 7.60 degrees W). An evaluation of the aerosol volumetric size distribution (AVSD) is also obtained for Saada and Ouarzazate. An AOD inter-comparison is performed between AERONET data and satellite sensors (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-MODIS), as well as assimilation products (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)), by the means of a linear regression. Regardless of site location and elevation, the results show the prevalence of the annual cycle of AOD, with a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. In association with this seasonal variation, the variations in AE and AVSD showed an increase in coarse mode over Ouarzazate and Saada during summer (July to August), underlining that Southern Morocco is prone to the regular transport of desert dust on a seasonal basis. The inter-comparison reveals that the MERRA-2 dataset is slightly more appropriate for the study region, since it shows correlation coefficients (r) ranging from 0.758 to 0.844 and intercepts ranging from 0.021 to 0.070, depending on the study site. The statistical analysis of the back-trajectories simulated by the HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model were consistent with the observations and confirmed the dominance of desert dust aerosols during the summer over the study region. On the other hand, the winter season reveals a predominance of anthropogenic and oceanic aerosols originating from the north and the west of the study site.

TI  - Relative Strengths Recognition of Nine Mainstream Satellite-Based Soil Moisture Products at the Global Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a crucial driving variable for the global land surface-atmosphere water and energy cycle. There are now many satellite-based SM products available internationally and it is necessary to consider all available SM products under the same context for comprehensive assessment and inter-comparisons at the global scale. Moreover, product performances varying with dynamic environmental factors, especially those closely related to retrieval algorithms, were less investigated. Therefore, this study evaluated and identified the relative strengths of nine mainstream satellite-based SM products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Chinese Fengyun-3B (FY3B), the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) by using the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), R of SM seasonal anomalies (Ranom), unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE), and bias metrics against ground observations from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), as well as the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah model simulations, overall and under three dynamic (Land Surface Temperature (LST), SM, and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD)) conditions. Results showed that the SMOS-INRA-CESBIO (IC) product outperformed the SMOSL3 product in most cases, especially in Australia, but it exhibited greater variability and higher random errors in Asia. ESA CCI products outperformed other products in capturing the spatial dynamics of SM seasonal anomalies and produced significantly high accuracy in croplands. Although the Chinese FY3B presented poor skills in most cases, it had a good ability to capture the temporal dynamics of the original SM and SM seasonal anomalies in most regions of central Africa. Under various land cover types, with the changes in LST, SM, and VOD, different products exhibited distinctly dynamic error characteristics. Generally, all products tended to overestimate the low in-situ SM content but underestimate the high in-situ SM content. It is expected that these findings can provide guidance and references for product improvement and application promotions in water exchange and land surface energy cycle.

TI  - Building Footprint Extraction in Dense Area from LiDAR Data using Mask R-CNN
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Building footprint extraction is an essential process for various geospatial applications. The city management is entrusted with eliminating slums, which are increasing in rural areas. Compared with more traditional methods, several recent research investigations have revealed that creating footprints in dense areas is challenging and has a limited supply. Deep learning algorithms provide a significant improvement in the accuracy of the automated building footprint extraction using remote sensing data. The mask R-CNN object detection framework used to effectively extract building in dense areas sometimes fails to provide an adequate building boundary result due to urban edge intersections and unstructured buildings. Thus, we introduced a modified workflow to train ensemble of the mask R-CNN using two backbones ResNet (34, 101). Furthermore, the results were stacked to fine-grain the structure of building boundaries. The proposed workflow includes data preprocessing and deep learning, for instance, segmentation was introduced and applied to a light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud in a dense rural area. The outperformance of the proposed method produced better-regularized polygons that obtained results with an overall accuracy of 94.63%.

TI  - Land use/land cover change analysis using geospatial techniques: a case of Geba watershed, western Ethiopia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change is a global environmental problem that significantly affects sustainable development and environmental quality. Anthropogenic activities are one of the main driving forces of land use/land cover change in developing countries like Ethiopia. This study is conducted in the Geba watershed in southwestern parts of Ethiopia. This study aimed to analyze the land use/land cover change over the past thirty years using geospatial technologies. The present study uses Landsat TM 1990, Landsat ETM + 2003, and OLI/TIRS 2020 to examine the land use/land cover change between 1990 and 2020. Land use/land cover classes are classified using a supervised classification method with the maximum likelihood technique. Results show that the agricultural land increased significantly, from 1786.6 km(2) (37.2%) in 1990 to 3163.2 km(2) (65.8%) in 2020, representing an increased rate of 45.9 km(2)/year. On the other hand, dense forest has declined from 2129.2 km(2) (44.3%) in 1990 to 1127.8 km(2) (23.5%) in 2020, which declines by the rate of 33.4 km(2)/year. Our findings suggest that sustainable land use planning and management are critically important in the study area.

TI  - Continuous Land Cover Change Detection in a Critically Endangered Shrubland Ecosystem Using Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing efforts to continuously monitor land cover change using satellite image time series have mostly focused on forested ecosystems in the tropics and the Northern Hemisphere. The notable difference in spectral reflectance that occurs following deforestation allows land cover change to be detected with relative accuracy. Less progress has been made in detecting change in low productivity or disturbance-prone vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands where natural dynamics can be difficult to distinguish from habitat loss. Renosterveld is a hyperdiverse, critically endangered shrubland ecosystem in South Africa with less than 5-10% of its original extent remaining in small, highly fragmented patches. I demonstrate that classification of satellite image time series using neural networks can accurately detect the transformation of Renosterveld within a few days of its occurrence and that trained models are suitable for operational continuous monitoring. A dataset of precisely dated vegetation change events between 2016 and 2021 was obtained from daily, high resolution Planet Labs satellite data. This dataset was then used to train 1D convolutional neural networks and Transformers to continuously detect land cover change events in time series of vegetation activity from Sentinel 2 satellite data. The best model correctly identified 89% of land cover change events at the pixel-level, achieving a f-score of 0.93, a 79% improvement over the f-score of 0.52 achieved using a method designed for forested ecosystems based on trend analysis. Models have been deployed to operational use and are producing updated detections of habitat loss every 10 days. There is great potential for continuous monitoring of habitat loss in non-forest ecosystems with complex natural dynamics. A key limiting step is the development of accurately dated datasets of land cover change events with which to train machine-learning classifiers.

T2  - SIBIRICA-INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF SIBERIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a na-tive intelligentsia took shape among Siberia???s Buryat Mongols that, combining indigenous and Russian influences, pursued cultural sur-vival alongside social, political, and economic modernization. One of its significant, yet relatively unsung, members was Bato-Dalai Ochirov (1874 or 1875???1913). He is best known as the only Buryat ever to serve in the Russian State Duma (in the short-lived Second Duma in 1907). Yet over the course of his short life, Ochirov also was an ad-ministrator, political activist, author, philanthropist, and supporter of culture and science. This article provides an overview of Ochirov???s life and seeks to elucidate his worldview, which stressed the defense of Buryat interests using the possibilities available within the exist-ing autocratic order.

TI  - Delineation of groundwater potential zones in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa using remote sensing, GIS and AHP
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to spatially identify groundwater potential (GWP) zones in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa (SA) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing-based multi-criteria analysis. This study is the first to utilise these tools in delineating groundwater in KZN, which is a process dominated by outdated, expensive, and time-consuming in-situ methods. Remote sensing images were used instead of traditional data sampling, which provided a cheaper, faster, and sufficient way of acquiring specific information in data-scarce KZN. Remotely sensed spatial thematic layers viz. geology, lineament density, slope, drainage density, rainfall, land use/land cover, and evapotranspiration were processed and developed using GIS and weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The thematic layers were subsequently aggregated using the GIS Weighted Overlay Method to develop a groundwater potential index map. Indices from the map were correlated with 113 borehole logs using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) to validate the results. The resultant GWP map computed that approximately 47.3 Km(2) (2%) of the total area falls under Excellent GWP, 24405.4 Km(2 )(27.45%) under good GWP, 50950.5 Km(2) (57.3%) under moderate GWP, and the poor and very poor GWP zones constitute around 13380.8 Km(2) (15.1%) and 135.6 Km(2) (1%) of KZN. The spatial mapping revealed that the AHP-based GWP map exhibited a very good correlation with borehole data (AUC = 72.6%, n = 113), indicating the accuracy of the AHP as a rating method. The use of freely available remote sensing data and modeling techniques provided a relatively inexpensive groundwater identi-fication method that can successfully replace the rudimentary methods.

TI  - Segmentation of waterbodies in remote sensing images using deep stacked ensemble model
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying surface water resources is considered as one of the principal applications of remote sensing image analysis that plays a crucial role in controlling optimal use of these resources, and preventing floods and crises such as drought. Traditional machine learning methods for extracting waterbodies require complex spectral analysis and selection of features based on previous knowledge. Although applying deep learning-based approaches, which has been considered in recent years, has eliminated the necessity of extracting manual features, they require too many training data and computational resources to achieve high performance. Consequently, each presented deep architecture can detect some of the existing patterns in the predefined conditions. This paper trains and optimizes three robust deep architectures, presented in various fields, using surface water data, and combines their results to achieve a robust model for detecting surface water. To this end, a deep hybrid architecture called "deep stacked ensemble model " is employed on the outputs of three independent deep sub-models and extracts the final segmentation mask of the water areas more accurately. We evaluated our proposed model on a water body detection dataset provided by artificial intelligence crowd landsat (AIcrowd(1) LNDST) challenge. The proposed technique improves the semantic segmentation performance and surpasses state-of-the-art results. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of primary vulvar adenocarcinoma of mammary gland type: report of two distinct cases
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adenocarcinoma of mammary gland type (AMGT) of the vulva is extremely rare and its aetiopathogenesis is not fully understood. Low incidence is partly responsible for the lack of guidelines for patient management. Here, two cases of postmenopausal patients diagnosed with AMGT with different therapeutical approaches are reported. Histopathological patterns are considered essential for diagnosis. The triple-negative immunohistochemical (IHC) profile of one of the cases represented a diagnostic challenge. Interestingly, it presented an immunophenotypical profile similar to triple-negative breast cancers, supporting the molecular similarities between vulvar AMGT and breast carcinomas. Surgical procedures include radical vulvectomy or radical local excision. Lymphatic involvement may be assessed by sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymphadenectomy. Adjuvant treatment was dependent on the IHC profile and disease staging. Although both cases had similar features on clinical examination, pathological and molecular characteristics and treatment approach were distinct. That illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutical challenge of this rare entity.

TI  - Estimating the Impact of Air Pollution on Healthcare-Seeking Behaviour by Applying a Difference-in-Differences Method to Syndromic Surveillance Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Syndromic surveillance data were used to estimate the direct impact of air pollution on healthcare-seeking behaviour, between 1 April 2012 and 31 December 2017. A difference-in-differences approach was used to control for spatial and temporal variations that were not due to air pollution and a meta-analysis was conducted to combine estimates from different pollution periods. Significant increases were found in general practitioner (GP) out-of-hours consultations, including a 98% increase (2-386, 95% confidence interval) in acute bronchitis and a 16% (3-30) increase in National Health Service (NHS) 111 calls for eye problems. However, the numbers involved are small; for instance, roughly one extra acute bronchitis consultation in a local authority on a day when air quality is poor. These results provide additional information for healthcare planners on the impacts of localised poor air quality. However, further work is required to identify the separate impact of different pollutants.

TI  - Diabolical Duos: Witch Spouses in Early New England
T2  - EARLY AMERICAN STUDIES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant proportion of witchcraft prosecutions in early New England targeted married couples. Although these cases have not received much attention, they open up a window onto witch-hunting in the region and how it compares to that in other parts of the English-speaking world. An examination of New England's witch spouses reveals how witchcraft intersected with demographic change as well as the social and religious outlook of its Puritan inhabitants. During the opening decades of settlement when colonists were few in number and couples' childbearing capabilities were essential to the survival of the New England colonies, spouses who fell short in this regard sometimes fell victim to suspicions of witchcraft. However, as the century advanced and the population expanded, the pressure on couples to produce children shrank while anxieties over family governance grew. Thus, New Englanders increasingly envisioned witch couples as bad parents rather than failed child-bearers. Moreover, the high frequency of accusations against spouses in New England was a product of the important place marriage held in the Puritans' worldview. They viewed it as the foundation of a godly society and, as a result, commonly envisioned witchcraft as a dark alter ego of nuptial relations.

TI  - The orientation on absolute infinity and the openness of worldviews as the necessary foundation for models of developmental psychology
T2  - META-RESEARCH IN HERMENEUTICS PHENOMENOLOGY AND PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In many contemporary models of adult development an end state of self-development is assumed, which is related to a specific worldview and concept of the absolute. In the present text these development models and their worldview are analyzed and contrasted with Karl Jaspers' psychology of worldviews and, what he described, the process of differentiation during development. In addition, findings from contemporary philosophy, mathematics and the natural sciences are given as examples to show how our world knowledge is constantly expanding and developing. Comparing these findings suggests that any unification or ultimate structure generates a limitation to the development of the self and new world knowledge and therefore can not be ultimate. Thus, it is shown that only an orientation towards absolute infinity as the horizon of unfinished and fluid worldviews, as described by Jaspers, can include newly acquired knowledge of the world, the self and its interdependence, which is not satisfied by any closed worldview with corresponding end state of development.

TI  - Using a Clinicopathologic and Gene Expression (CP-GEP) Model to Identify Stage I-II Melanoma Patients at Risk of Disease Relapse
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary More than 40% of patients initially diagnosed with 'low risk' (stage I-II) melanoma eventually develop melanoma recurrence or die as a result of melanoma. While the current standard of care at diagnosis for these patients is watchful waiting, they may benefit from adjuvant systemic treatment. The primary aim of this retrospective study was to assess the performance of a clinicopathologic and gene expression (CP-GEP) model, a model originally developed to predict sentinel node metastasis, to identify patients with stage I-II melanoma at risk of disease relapse. This study included Swedish and Dutch patients (18 years of age or older) with a melanoma of the skin without sentinel node metastasis. Using the non-invasive CP-GEP model, the patients could be divided into two groups: high (413 patients) or low risk (122 patients) of recurrence. While these results are promising, optimization of the CP-GEP model is recommended before implementing the model in clinical practice. Background: The current standard of care for patients without sentinel node (SN) metastasis (i.e., stage I-II melanoma) is watchful waiting, while >40% of patients with stage IB-IIC will eventually present with disease recurrence or die as a result of melanoma. With the prospect of adjuvant therapeutic options for patients with a negative SN, we assessed the performance of a clinicopathologic and gene expression (CP-GEP) model, a model originally developed to predict SN metastasis, to identify patients with stage I-II melanoma at risk of disease relapse. Methods: This study included patients with cutaneous melanoma >= 18 years of age with a negative SN between October 2006 and December 2017 at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Sweden) and Erasmus MC Cancer Institute (The Netherlands). According to the CP-GEP model, which can be applied to the primary melanoma tissue, the patients were stratified into high or low risk of recurrence. The primary aim was to assess the 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of low- and high-risk CP-GEP. A secondary aim was to compare the CP-GEP model with the EORTC nomogram, a model based on clinicopathological variables only. Results: In total, 535 patients (stage I-II) were included. CP-GEP stratification among these patients resulted in a 5-year RFS of 92.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 86.4-96.4) in CP-GEP low-risk patients (n = 122) versus 80.7% (95%CI: 76.3-84.3) in CP-GEP high-risk patients (n = 413; hazard ratio 2.93 (95%CI: 1.41-6.09), p < 0.004). According to the EORTC nomogram, 25% of the patients were classified as having a 'low risk' of recurrence (96.8% 5-year RFS (95%CI 91.6-98.8), n = 130), 49% as 'intermediate risk' (88.4% 5-year RFS (95%CI 83.6-91.8), n = 261), and 26% as 'high risk' (61.1% 5-year RFS (95%CI 51.9-69.1), n = 137). Conclusion: In these two independent European cohorts, the CP-GEP model was able to stratify patients with stage I-II melanoma into two groups differentiated by RFS.

TI  - SOTERIOLOGICAL IDEAS OF OLD BELIEVERS REFLECTED IN SPIRITUAL VERSES
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soteriological ideas of soul salvation dominate in the Old Believers' worldview and spread through spiritual verses. The are several motifs with soteriological meaning depending on initial goals of salvation search: staying in a true (pre-schism) orthodoxy, manifestation of spiritual resilience as well as resistance to the "servants of Antichrist" and personalized government and church representatives, and desire to keep the soul in purity escaping human sins. To reach the goal they should live a righteous life in keeping with ethical values represented in spiritual verses (love, good, humility, meekness, patience, obedience, mercy, honor, honesty, diligence etc.) and follow the rules of the living by faith (attend a church, pray, fast, honor the Christian holidays). Among the main salvation`s conditions the Old Believers` texts cite maintaining the purity of the Old Belief and unity as a method to save oneself as well as the faith in the latter times, observance, and flight from the sinful world into the place of retreat. Thus, the salvation can be achieved by the way of life (how a person acts) as well as the way of thinking. The main didactic purpose of spiritual verses developing the theme of salvation is to remind of these verities.

TI  - Coupled forest zoning and agricultural intervention yields conflicting outcomes for tropical forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification and forest conservation are often seen as incompatible. Agricultural interventions can help boost food security for poor rural communities but in certain cases can exacerbate deforestation, known as the rebound effect. We tested whether coupling agricultural interventions with participatory forest zoning could improve food security and promote forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Simple agricultural interventions led to a >60% increase in cassava yields and a spill-over effect of improved cassava variety uptake in non-intervention zones. Household surveys conducted at the end of the 8 year project implementation period revealed that households that received agricultural interventions had more favorable attitudes toward forest zoning and conservation. The surveys also showed that farmers in the intervention domain practiced less land-intensive field and fallow management strategies compared to those practiced in the non-intervention domain. However, an 18 year time series analysis of Landsat satellite data revealed that agricultural expansion persisted in areas both with and without intervention assistance, and there is risk of a rebound effect. Approximately 70% of the tree cover loss that occurred outside of the agricultural areas was located within a 3 km buffer zone surrounding the outermost edges of the agricultural areas, which suggested that the majority of tree cover loss was caused by agricultural expansion. Within that 3 km buffer, average annual tree cover loss during the post-intervention period was higher in the intervention domain compared to the non-intervention domain (0.17% yr(-1) compared to 0.11% yr(-1) respectively, p < 0.001), suggesting risk of a rebound effect. The disconnection between household perceptions of zoning adherence and actual behavior indicates the importance of strengthening governance structures for community-based monitoring and enforcement.

TI  - Impacts of large-scale refugee resettlement on LCLUC: Bidi Bidi refugee settlement, Uganda case study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uganda is the third-largest refugee-hosting country partly due to its open-door policy-deemed one of the most progressive. When new refugees arrive, refugee settlements are established rapidly, and irreversible changes to the landscape are inevitable. We utilize satellite data to map land cover (LC), land use, and burned area (BA) to assess their relationship in the context of large-scale refugee resettlement in Bidi Bidi-Uganda's largest refugee settlement. We show inevitable dramatic changes in LC, e.g. built-up residential zones increased from 1.8% to 30%, while cropland increased from less than 0.7%-25.6% during our study period (2015-2019). In contrast, BA that affected more than 80% of the area was drastically reduced during the establishment phase (August-December 2017). Substantial reduction in BA was observed predominantly within the residential zones, but outside of the zones, BA was hardly affected by the arrival of refugees. Our study shows that these changes in LC and BA are mainly missing in the readily accessible satellite-derived data products, which impede assessment, planning, and implementation of humanitarian response programs. We discuss the importance of mapping at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales and the importance of context, sector, and geographic domain knowledge expertise in developing critical information products for informing programs to support vulnerable populations.

AB  - Nakamura, FY, Torres, VBC, da Silva, LS, Gantois, P, Andrade, AD, Ribeiro, ALB, Brasileiro-Santos, MdS, and Batista, GR. Monitoring heart rate variability and perceived well-being in Brazilian elite beach volleyball players: A single-tournament pilot study. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1708-1714, 2022-The aim of this study was to monitor the changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and perceptual well-being status after a beach volleyball (BV) tournament day in high-level U17 and senior players. Seventeen BV players (U17 [15-16 years]: n = 08; and senior [19-41 years]: n = 09) competing at national and/or international BV level participated in this study. Resting HRV and perceptual well-being measures were recorded across 4 moments: night 1 (prematches night), morning 1 (prematches morning), night 2 (postmatches night), and morning 2 (postmatches morning). Session rating of perceived exertion was assessed 10 minutes after each match, and accumulated match loads were used for analysis. Senior players presented higher values of natural logarithm of square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (lnRMSSD) at the 4 observation moments than U17 players (p = 0.006). Within-subjects analysis showed a larger mean difference regarding both lnRMSSD and natural logarithm SD of normal R-R intervals (lnSDNN) between night 1 vs. night 2 in U17 players (effect size = 1.11 and, 0.96, respectively) compared with senior (effect size = 0.40 and 0.32, respectively). Accumulated match loads were negatively correlated with percentage change in lnRMSSD (r = -0.54; p = 0.037). U17 players showed higher well-being variation than senior (group x time; p = 0.02). In conclusion, the lnRMSSD index was able to discriminate the U17 and senior BV players, and maintaining high vagally related HRV indices is an important response to BV training and competition.

TI  - Advances in evapotranspiration prediction using gross primary productivity based on eco-physiological constraints
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate evapotranspiration (ET) estimation plays a central role in better understanding the allocation of water resources in a time of increasing scarcity; however, ET estimation remains many challenges. To enhance the accuracy of ET prediction, this study proposes an enhanced gross primary productivity (GPP)-based Priestley-Taylor algorithm (GPP-PT) that uses GPP to compute fractional vegetation cover (f(V)). In terms of soil moisture fraction (f(SM)), it is described by using either diurnal temperature (DT) or soil moisture index (SWI), conducting two variations of the proposed model (i.e., hereafter called GPP-DT and GPP-SWI, respectively). These two improved algorithms were compared with their previous models, the GPP-DT with a modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor model (MS-PT), and the GPP-SWI with a soil water index (SWI)-based Priestley-Taylor model (SWI-PT). Datasets from 42 flux towers covering different land cover types were used to investigate the performance of these algorithms. The GPP-DT algorithm was found to be superior to the MS-PT model, with 12.60% and 10.42% reductions in the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, and with 9.05% and 2.19% increases in the determination coefficient (R-2) and index of agreement (IOA), respectively. Similarly, the GPP-SWI model yielded RMSE and MAE reductions of 10.95% and 10.67%, respectively, and R-2 and IOA increases of 8.88% and 3.72%, respectively, compared to the SWI-PT model. In the direct comparison between the two newly proposed models, the GPP-DT model performed better in shrubland and forest, whereas the GPP-SWI model performed more efficiently in grassland. Sensitivity analysis found that soil moisture was more sensitive to both evaporation and transpiration than DT in most land cover types, and the GPP had a stable relationship with transpiration in different biomes. The newly improved GPP-PT models were robust and effective for estimating ET and might thus be used as a reliable input for hydrological models.

TI  - Application of Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network to Improve DEM Data in Urban Cities
T2  - TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A digital elevation model (DEM) represents the topographic surface of the Earth and is an indispensable source of data in many applications, such as flood modeling, infrastructure design and land management. DEM data at high spatial resolution and high accuracy of elevation data are not only costly and time-consuming to acquire but also often confidential. In this paper, we explore a cost-effective approach to derive good quality DEM data by applying a multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance free resources of available DEM data. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, multi-spectral imaging Sentinel-2, as well as Google satellite imagery were used as inputs to the CNN model. The CNN model was first trained using high-quality reference DEM data in a dense urban city-Nice, France-then validated on another site in Nice and finally tested in the Orchard Road area (Singapore), which is also an equally dense urban area in Singapore. The CNN model not only shows an impressive reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) of 50% at validation site in Nice and 30% at the test site in Singapore, but also results in much clearer profiles of the land surface than input SRTM data. A comparison between CNN performance and that of an earlier conducted study using artificial neural networks (ANN) was conducted as well. The comparison within this limited study shows that CNN yields a more accurate DEM.

TI  - Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network Driven by Sparse Second-order Attention Mechanism for Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image scene classification is one of the important research contents of remote sensing image interpretation. Nowadays, with the rapid development of satellite imaging techniques, remote sensing scene classification which uses High Spatial Resolution (HSR) remote sensing images has received, considerable attention recently, as can be used in natural hazards detection, traffic control, and object detection etc. Based on the feature representation used for remote sensing scene classification, the existing scene classification approaches can be categorized into three classes: handcrafted feature based methods, unsupervised feature learning-based methods, and deep feature learning-based methods. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) , one of the deep feature learning-based methods, have achieved great success in the computer vision community. Especially, the powerful feature representations learned through CNNs have been widely used in remote sensing scene classification, but due to the different scale information of ground targets and the complex spatial distribution and texture information of the scene images, the classification effect of the scene classification algorithm based on CNN is insufficient good. For addressing the above problems, the paper proposes a multi-scale convolutional neural network driven by a sparse second-order attention mechanism (MCNN-SSAM) while comprehensively considering the accuracy of scene classification and feature dimensions. The proposed MCNN-SSAM network includes the following parts: backbone network, pyramid convolution module, sparse second-order attention module and softmax classification layer. The network firstly inserts a multi-scale convolution layer after the backbone network to acquire the characteristic expressions of different scale information targets of the ground target, and embeds the group convolution into the multi-scale convolution layer to reduce the computational complexity; Secondly, after discuss the advantage of the attention mechanism of first and second-order statistics, a sparse second order attention mechanism is proposed to enhance the discriminability of channel information of different scale convolution features. The sparsity of the attention mechanism is able to effectively reduce the feature dimension of the second-order statistics while ensuring the performance of scene classification; Finally, the multi-scale convolutional layer and the sparse second-order attention mechanism are embedded into the proposed network for end-to-end training. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging high-resolution remote sensing data sets, i. e., AID (Aerial Image Dataset) and NWPU45 (NWPU-RESISC45) datasets. The AID dataset contains 10 000 images in RGB space, which has 30 different scene classes and of size 600 x 600 in each class; There are 31 500 optical RS images for 45 scene classes, and each image measures 256 x 256 pixels on the NWPU45 dataset. In this paper, the VGG-16 network is selected as the backbone of MCNN-SSAM, and the Adam optimizer is used for end-to-end training. The training parameters of the proposed network are set as follows: initial learning rate 0.001, weight attenuation coefficient 0.001, batch size 32, momentum 0.9.All experiments are implemented in PyTorch, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8G 1070 Ti GPU, and 32.00 GB RAM. we make the experimental result on AID dataset to analyze the influence of some important parameters on the MCNN-SSAM, then we can conclude that the number of the atoms in the dictionary and low-rank matrix parameters have a greater impact on the remote sensing scene classification performance of the proposed MCNN-SSAM. Afterwards, we compare MCNN-SSAM with some related networks, i.e., AlexNet, VGG-16, SAFF, MSCP, and CapsNet. The experimental results show that: compared with the benchmark network (VGG-16) , the overall accuracy (OA) of MCNN-SSAM is improved by 5.27%similar to 5.34% and 10.20%similar to 10.82%; While compared with the SAFF, MSCP, and CapsNet networks, the remote sensing scene classification accuracy is improved by 0.23%similar to 1.61% and 1.34%similar to 2.75%. Additionally, based on the confusion matrix, we can observe that most of the remote sensing scene classes can be classified easily and correctly, some even achieving high classification accuracies, i.e., mountains and viaducts in the AID dataset, jungles and sea ice in the NWPU45 dataset. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the Sparse Second-order Attention Mechanism (SSAM) is verified by comparing with other related attention mechanisms and heat map results. Finally, we make the ablation generalization experiments to verify the effectiveness of MCNN-SSAM, such as SENet (Squeeze-andExcitation Networks) , CovNet which is based on covariance statistics, and SSAM. We can conclude that, whether the CNN features or multi-scale MCNN features, compared with the attention mechanism based on first-order feature statistics (CNN+SENet and MCNN+SENet) , The scene classification accuracy obtained by CNN+CovNet, CNN+SSAM, MCNN+CovNet, and MCNN+SSAM which are based on the attention mechanism of second-order feature statistics has been further improved. In addition, MCNN module, SSAM module, and the fusion of these two modules can improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing image scene images. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network driven by sparse second-order attention mechanism for remote sensing scene classification. The experiment results illustrate that the proposed MCNN-SSAM improves the accuracy of remote sensing image scene classification while taking into the feature dimensions of the second order feature statistics.

TI  - Mapping the dynamics of urban land creation from hilltop removing and gully filling Projects in the river-valley city of Lanzhou, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lanzhou is located in the long, narrow valley of the Yellow River Basin, China. With the development of urbanization, the contradiction between its economic development and limited spatial expansion was very acute. To expand urban space, improve the efficiency of land use and protect farmland effectively, Hilltop Removing and Gully Filling Projects (HRGFP) around Lanzhou have been carried out over the last decades by local government. To better manage and evaluate the effectiveness of HRGFP implementation, it is necessary to map the urban newly land creation, monitor its dynamics change and access the environmental impact, which is of great significance to understand and master the past, present and future development trend of HRGFP. Based on multi-source remote sensing data and field investigation, here we use multiple monitoring indicators and spatial statistical analysis to analyze the change dynamic characteristics of newly plots from HRGFP and its impact on the local ecological environment. The main conclusions are as follows: From 1989 to 2016, the total area of the newly land creation around Lanzhou was about 203.18 km(2). The center of newly land plots generally showed a trend of continuous transfer from south to north, from the main urban region to the low hills, gentle slopes, and gullies and shifted 15.5 km northwest. And the maximum annual average expansion rate was about 36.003 km(2)/a, which occurred in the third stage (i.e., 2012-2016). During the study period, it was found from land use and land cover change (LULCC) statistics that more new land plots from HRGFP were converted to forest land and grassland, except for construction land, which was consistent with the results of remote sensing environmental index (RSEI). Statistics showed that the area of environmental quality improvement in the study region is about 3984 km(2), accounting for 55.73% of the total area. Our results indicated that HRGFP in Lanzhou have enlarged the urban space and increased economic development and improved ecological environment under the guidance of the local government.

TI  - Multi-Temporal LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data Fusion for Classification of Semi-Arid Woody Cover Species
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of woody vegetation is important for monitoring, managing, and studying woody encroachment in grasslands. However, in semi-arid regions, remotely sensed discrimination of tree species is difficult primarily due to the tree similarities, small and sparse canopy cover, but may also be due to overlapping woody canopies as well as seasonal leaf retention (deciduous versus evergreen) characteristics. Similar studies in different biomes have achieved low accuracies using coarse spatial resolution image data. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of multi-temporal, airborne hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived data for tree species classification in a semi-arid desert region. This study produces highly accurate classifications by combining multi-temporal fine spatial resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data (similar to 1 m) through a reproducible scripting and machine learning approach that can be applied to larger areas and similar datasets. Combining multi-temporal vegetation indices and canopy height models led to an overall accuracy of 95.28% and kappa of 94.17%. Five woody species were discriminated resulting in producer accuracies ranging from 86.12% to 98.38%. The influence of fusing spectral and structural information in a random forest classifier for tree identification is evident. Additionally, a multi-temporal dataset slightly increases classification accuracies over a single data collection. Our results show a promising methodology for tree species classification in a semi-arid region using multi-temporal hyperspectral and LiDAR remote sensing data.

TI  - Uncovering the influence of hydrological and climate variables in chlorophyll-A concentration in tropical reservoirs with machine learning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability and change, associated with increasing water demands, can have significant implications for water availability. In the Brazilian semi-arid, eutrophication in reservoirs raises the risk of water scarcity. The reservoirs have also a high seasonal and annual variability of water level and volume, which can have important effects on chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla). Assessing the influence of climate and hydrological variability on phytoplankton growth can be important to find strategies to achieve water security in tropical regions with similar problems. This study explores the potential of machine learning models to predict Chla in reservoirs and to understand their relationship with hydrological and climate variables. The model is based mainly on satellite data, which makes the methodology useful for data-scarce regions. Tree-based ensemble methods had the best performances among six machine learning methods and one parametric model. This performance can be considered satisfactory as classical empirical relationships between Chla and phosphorus may not hold for tropical reservoirs. Water volume and the mix-layer depth are inversely related to Chla, while mean surface temperature, water level, and surface solar radiation have direct relationships with Chla. These findings provide insights on how seasonal climate prediction and reservoir operation might influence water quality in regions supplied by superficial reservoirs.

M3  - Article
AB  - Of the individuals most commonly associated with the so-called "Jerusalem School" of historiography-the first- and second-generation of scholars of Jewish history that coalesced around the Hebrew University in the first years of its existence-Yitzhak (Fritz) Baer (1888-1980) was probably the least overtly political. Yet, a careful reading of his writings reveals a mind that was heavily engaged with the social and political affairs of the day. Like most members of the Jerusalem School, Baer saw his scholarship as a contribution to the Zionist project-an attempt to influence the character of the renascent Jewish society. Although he did not proclaim or publicize his views as loudly as others, he nonetheless weaved his political views into the fabric of his historical research. By reading his historical works against their immediate political context, we can therefore begin to piece together what amounts to an original and comprehensive worldview.

TI  - Forest Habitat Fragmentation in Mountain Protected Areas Using Historical Corona KH-9 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest habitat fragmentation is one of the global environmental issues of concern as a result of forest management practices and socioeconomic drivers. In this context, a constant evaluation of natural habitat conditions still remains a challenge in order to achieve a general image of the environmental state of a protected area for proper sustainable management. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the evolution of forest habitat in the last 40 years, focusing on Bucegi Natural Park, one of the most frequented protected areas in Romania, as relevant for highly human-impacted areas. Our approach integrates a historical panchromatic Corona KH-9 image from 1977 and present-day Sentinel-2 multispectral data from 2020 in order to calculate a series of spatial metrics that reveal changes in the pattern of the forest habitat and illustrate forest habitat fragmentation density. Object-based oriented analysis with supervised maximum likelihood classification was employed for the production of forest cover fragmentation maps. Ten landscape metrics were adapted to the analysis context, from patch statistics to proximity index. The results show a general growth of the forest surface but also an increase in habitat fragmentation in areas where tourism was developed. Fragmentation indices explain that larger and compact patches feature natural park protected forests after the spruce-fir secondary canopies were grown during the last 4-5 decades. The number of patches decreased to half, and their average size is double that of before. The method can be of extensive use for environmental monitoring in protected areas management and for understanding the environmental history connected to present-day problems that are to be fixed under rising human pressure.

TI  - Landform mapping, elevation modelling, and thaw subsidence estimation for permafrost terrain using a consumer-grade remotely-piloted aircraft
T2  - DRONE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We assess performance of a small consumer-grade remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) for landform mapping, elevation modelling, and thaw subsidence estimation in continuous permafrost terrain. We acquired RPA imagery near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut to construct orthomosaics and digital elevation models (DEMs) that we use to interpret geomorphology and surficial geology. We estimate seasonal thaw subsidence using DEM differences. To quantify accuracy, RPA DEMs are compared to a satellite-based reference elevation. Subsidence estimates are compared to measurements from differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR). We find that RPA images are very effective for mapping periglacial landforms and surficial geology with the chosen flight specifications. The DEMs exhibit vertical mean absolute error of approximately 1 cm at ground control points. Away from control points, relative vertical accuracy is approximately 3 cm. Comparison to the reference elevation results in survey-wide vertical mean absolute errors of 33-66 cm with high variability and spatial autocorrelation of elevation discrepancy. There is local agreement between DEM differences, DInSAR, and on-the-ground measurements of seasonal subsidence. Results suggest that small RPA may be applicable for mapping thaw subsidence on the order of a few centimetres near control points. However, DEM differences are influenced by vegetation and are contaminated by spatially-variable artefacts, preventing reliable survey-wide RPA estimation of seasonal thaw subsidence.

TI  - The Burden of Borders: Reassessing the Impacts of Nigeria's Border Closure on the National Security
T2  - AFRICAN SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pan-African worldview of Nigeria's political leaders and Abuja's putative hegemonic leadership in Africa had entailed Nigeria operated an idealistic border policy. However, convinced that border closure remained a solution to the perennial insecurity and economic 'sabotage' in Nigeria, President Buhari imposed border closure in 2019. While the government declared the controversial policy a 'success' in the fight against crimes, this paper disagrees with this assertion, contending that the closure failed to achieve its purposes. The study interrogates the factors accountable for this failure. It identifies poor governance of national borders despite closure as a potent factor exacerbating the crisis.

TI  - PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECTS OF TEACHING THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IN A RELIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the fact, that the scientific justification of Evolution has more than 150 years of history, and the theory of Evolution is taught in secondary schools, colleges and universities, the percentage of its acceptance in society is far from absolute. This can be due to certain cultural traditions in the religious worldview, insufficient awareness about the principles of scientific thinking, including the Biology field. On the other hand, the extremely atheistic orientation of biological science, which excludes the role of God in the life development, can cause difficulties in perceiving Evolution ideas among students. The religious-cultural competence of secular teachers in evolutionary education can improve learning outcomes and the Evolution theory acceptance degree in religious students. The aim of the article is to define the opportunities for dialog between Biology teachers who provide training in the discipline `Theory of Evolution', and undergraduate students who adhere to the creationism ideas. The article explores the ways of establishing a constructive dialog between evolutionists and creationists, as well as discusses the advantages of agnosticism over atheism and holistic evolution concept over the synthetic one. Agnosticism in the scientific worldview avoids a sharp confrontation between the scientific worldview and the religious one. Agnosticism makes it possible to avoid conflicts between scientific and religious worldviews, as religious people tend to perceive atheism as a threat to Revelation. Meanwhile, the holistic approach leaves the place for the transcendent and helps ease the tension between evolutionists and creationists.

TI  - Multi-Output Sequential Deep Learning Model for Athlete Force Prediction on a Treadmill Using 3D Markers
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and innovative methods for estimating forces are critical aspects of biomechanical sports research. Using them, athletes can improve their performance and technique and reduce the possibility of fractures and other injuries. For this purpose, throughout this project, we proceeded to research the use of video in biomechanics. To refine this method, we propose an RNN trained on a biomechanical dataset of regular runners that measures both kinematics and kinetics. The model will allow analyzing, extracting, and drawing conclusions about continuous variable predictions through the body. It marks different anatomical and reflective points (96 in total, 32 per dimension) that will allow the prediction of forces (N) in three dimensions (F-x, F-y, F-z), measured on a treadmill with a force plate at different velocities (2.5 m/s, 3.5 m/s, 4.5 m/s). In order to obtain the best model, a grid search of different parameters that combined various types of layers (Simple, GRU, LSTM), loss functions (MAE, MSE, MSLE), and sampling techniques (down-sampling, up-sampling) helped obtain the best performing model (LSTM, MSE, down-sampling) achieved an average coefficient of determination of 0.68, although when excluding F-z it reached 0.92.

TI  - Large-Scale Interseismic Strain Mapping of the NE Tibetan Plateau From Sentinel-1 Interferometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The launches of the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar satellites in 2014 and 2016 started a new era of high-resolution velocity and strain rate mapping for the continents. However, multiple challenges exist in tying independently processed velocity data sets to a common reference frame and producing high-resolution strain rate fields. We analyze Sentinel-1 data acquired between 2014 and 2019 over the northeast Tibetan Plateau, and develop new methods to derive east and vertical velocities with similar to 100 m resolution and similar to 1 mm/yr accuracy across an area of 440,000 km(2). By implementing a new method of combining horizontal gradients of filtered east and interpolated north velocities, we derive the first similar to 1 km resolution strain rate field for this tectonically active region. The strain rate fields show concentrated shear strain along the Haiyuan and East Kunlun Faults, and local contractional strain on fault junctions, within the Qilianshan thrusts, and around the Longyangxia Reservoir. The Laohushan-Jingtai creeping section of the Haiyuan Fault is highlighted in our data set by extremely rapid strain rates. Strain across unknown portions of the Haiyuan Fault system, including shear on the eastern extension of the Dabanshan Fault and contraction at the western flank of the Quwushan, highlight unmapped tectonic structures. In addition to the uplift across most of the lowlands, the vertical velocities also contain climatic, hydrological or anthropogenic-related deformation signals. We demonstrate the enhanced view of large-scale active tectonic processes provided by high-resolution velocities and strain rates derived from Sentinel-1 data and highlight associated wide-ranging research applications.

TI  - High Spatiotemporal Rugged Land Surface Temperature Downscaling over Saihanba Forest Park, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived rugged land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter indicating the status of the Earth's surface energy budget and its seasonal/temporal dynamic change. However, existing LST products from rugged areas are more prone to error when supporting applications in mountainous areas and Earth surface processes that occur at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This research aimed to develop a method for generating rugged LST with a high temporal and spatial resolution by using an improved ensemble LST model combining three regressors, including a random forest, a ridge, and a support vector machine. Different combinations of high-resolution input parameters were also considered in this study. The input datasets included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST datasets (MxD11A1) for nighttime, temporal Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) datasets, and digital elevation model (DEM) datasets. The 30 m rugged LST datasets derived were compared against an in situ LST dataset obtained at Saihanba Forest Park (SFP) sites and an ASTER-derived 90 m LST, respectively. The results with in situ measurements demonstrated significant LST details, with an R-2 higher than 0.95 and RMSE around 3.00 K for both Terra/MOD- and Aqua/MYD-based LST datasets, and with slightly better results being obtained from the Aqua/MYD-based LST than that from Terra/MOD. The inter-comparison results with ASTER LST showed that over 80% of the pixels of the difference image for the two datasets were within 2 K. In light of the complex topography and distinct atmospheric conditions, these comparison results are encouraging. The 30 m LST from the method proposed in this study also depicts the seasonality of rugged surfaces.

TI  - A Practical Technique to Improve Visualization of Sentinel Nodes in the Axillary Region on Breast Lymphoscintigraphy: Medial Breast Traction by Patient
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods: A standard method of performing breast lymphoscintigraphy is to obtain anterior and lateral views after periareolar intradermal injection of a radiotracer. However, a sentinel lymph node may be obscured by the activity at the injection site, especially on anterior views. Also, breast tissue may cause attenuation to prevent sentinel node visualization. In cases in which a sentinel lymph node is visualized on one view but not the other view or a sentinel lymph node is either not visualized or inadequately visualized, we repeat anterior and lateral views during medial traction of the breast performed by the patient. Results: We have found the medial breast traction technique performed by the patient to be especially useful for identification of axillary sentinel nodes. Conclusion: Repeat images during medial traction of the breast by the patient is an effective technique to improve visualization of sentinel lymph nodes in the axillary region.

AB  - The installation of hydroelectric plants has generated multiple environmental impacts on the world's river systems. In central Chile, the impacts of hydroelectric reservoir operation have been documented in ecological and hydrologic regime terms. This investigation assesses the changes in channel morphology, vegetation distribution, and flows in the middle section of the Maule River during the period following the start-up of a hydroelectric plant. Changes in fluvial morphology (active area) and land cover are quantified using LANDSAT images, contrasted with a vegetation sampling and flow analysis. The results show a 12% decrease in active areas of the river, indicating a loss of geomorphological diversity. Within the active channel, there was a gradual increase in plant-covered surface area, which reached 159% between 1989 and 2018, mainly due to reductions in water (-61%), active bar (-35%), and bare soil surface areas (-29%). The changes were evident ten years after plant operations began and intensified during the period known as the megadrought in central Chile (2008-2018). The flow magnitudes present a decrease for exceedance probabilities (P) below 85% in the period after 1985, with a slight increase recorded for low flows (P > 85%). In the segments with superior stabilization, invasive species such as Acacia dealbata (silver wattle) predominated, which are specialists at taking advantage of disturbances to settle and stabilize active areas, narrowing the possibilities for morphological change.

TI  - Low incidence of lymph node metastasis in patients with microinvasive breast cancer: a Korean nationwide study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Microinvasive breast cancer (MIBC) is an invasive carcinoma with a tumor dimension not exceeding 1 mm. Owing to its low incidence, the rate of axillary node metastasis and its management are not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) and identify variables associated with LNM, as well as to evaluate the need for axillary staging in MIBC patients by analyzing nationwide data. Methods: The Korean Breast Cancer Society registry was searched to identify MIBC patients diagnosed between January 1996 and April 2020. Patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy experiences, systemic metastasis, and missing or discordant data were eligible for the analysis. The incidence rate of LNM was determined, and variables associated with LNM were identified by multivariable regression analysis. Results: Of 2,427 MIBC patients identified, 98 (4.0%) had LNM and 12 (0.5%) had N2/3 disease. Type of breast operation (odds ratio [OR], 2.093; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.332-3.290; P = 0.001), age (OR, 2.091; 95% CI, 1.326-3.298; P = 0.002), hormone receptor status (OR, 2.220; 95% CI, 1.372-3.594; P = 0.001), and lymphovascular invasion (OR, 11.143; 95% CI, 6.354-19.540; P < 0.001) were significantly related to LNM. Conclusion: The incidence of LNM in MIBC patients was only 4.0% in our study, suggesting that de-escalation of axillary surgical interventions could be carefully considered. The indications for axillary staging should be individualized considering tumor volume, age, hormone receptor status, and lymphovascular invasion to improve the quality of life of MIBC survivors.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods in urban areas result in a detrimental impact on the natural environment and human health and pose major risks to assets and communication systems. In cities with high population density, the magnitude of flood damage largely depends upon flood inundation as well as floodwater depths. The present study compared recent flood inundation extent, damages caused, and possible floodwater depth in two highly developed metropolises of China and Japan, i.e., Wuhan and Kumamoto cities, for the year 2020. Sentinel-1 satellite data-driven change detection algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) was applied to identify potentially flooded regions. Major land use land cover classes such as urban areas and croplands affected by the flood were mapped in conjunction with the exposed population. ALOS PALSAR digital elevation model (DEM) was used to study the inundation depth. The study revealed that 322 km(2) of the area has been inundated by floodwater in Wuhan city with 230 km(2) and 140 km(2) areas under damaged croplands and urban regions. Around 817,095 people were exposed to this natural catastrophe in Wuhan. The city Kumamoto has witnessed an inundation area of about 505 km(2) with damaged cropland of 350 km(2) and an urban area of 83 km(2)

TI  - Using Radar Data for Grain Crops Yield Forecasting in the Novosibirsk Region
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibility is considered of using data of the Sentinel-1B radar satellite in agriculture, in particular, for the crop monitoring and grain crop yield forecasting. For this purpose, based on satellite data, the Radar Vegetation Index RVI was calculated. The values of RVI obviously indicate the dynamics of the development of such crops as spring wheat, oat, and barley. The correlation and regression analysis of the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index NDVI and RVI revealed the presence of a significant dependence between the indices. The normalized radar vegetation index NRVI was calculated to use radar data in predicting the expected yield. As a part of the experiment, yield forecasts at the farm in the Kochenevo district (the Novosibirsk region) for the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons were calculated. The calculation results showed the yield forecast accuracy above 90%, which allowed the use of NRVI in the 2020 operational activities.

TI  - Position Accuracy Assessment of a UAV-Mounted Sequoia+ Multispectral Camera Using a Robotic Total Station
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data in agriculture that are originating from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-mounted multispectral cameras offer substantial information in assessing crop status, as well as in developing prescription maps for site-specific variable rate applications. The position accuracy of the multispectral imagery plays an important role in the quality of the final prescription maps and how well the latter correspond to the specific spatial characteristics. Although software products and developed algorithms are important in offering position corrections, they are time- and cost-intensive. The paper presents a methodology to assess the accuracy of the imagery obtained by using a mounted target prism on the UAV, which is tracked by a ground-based total station. A Parrot Sequoia+ multispectral camera was used that is widely utilized in agriculture-related remote sensing applications. Two sets of experiments were performed following routes that go along the north-south and east-west axes, while the cross-track error was calculated for all three planes, but also three-dimensional (3D) space. From the results, it was indicated that the camera's D-GNSS receiver can offer imagery with a 3D position accuracy of up to 3.79 m, while the accuracy in the horizontal plane is higher compared to the vertical ones.

TI  - Comparison of SWAT and MODIS Evapotranspiration Data for Multiple Timescales
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) provides important information for hydrological studies, including estimating plant water requirements which can be derived from remote sensing data or simulated using hydrological models. In this study, ET derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) was compared with ET simulated by the calibrated and validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the Big Sunflower River watershed (BSRW) in Mississippi. The comparisons were made based on 8-day, 1-month, seasonal, and annual timescales. The coefficients of variation (COVs) for the 8-day, 1-month, seasonal, and annual ET simulated by SWAT were 0.42, 0.40, 0.32, and 0.04, respectively, whereas the COVs for the ET derived from MODIS were 0.06, 0.12, 0.08, and 0.01 for the respective time scales. Lower COVs for the ET derived from MODIS indicated lower sensitivity to crop growth in the field. SWAT-simulated ET was the highest during crop growing season and lowest during dormant season, but MODIS-derived ET did not vary considerably according to crop growing or harvesting seasons. As MODIS-derived ET accounts for only climatic conditions and vegetation cover, SWAT-simulated ET is recommended for the short-term estimation of crop water requirements because it accounts for climatic, land use, soil, and slope conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: We conducted a comparative analysis of the differences in the incidence of 8 acute respiratory viruses and the changes in their patterns before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Methods: Three sentinel surveillance systems of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service were analyzed. The average numbers of reported cases and the related hospital admissions and outpatient data were compared between April 2018-2019 and 2020-2021. Changes in the disease burden and medical expenditures between these 2 time periods were evaluated.Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported cases of all acute respiratory viral infections, except for human bocavirus, decreased significantly. Data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service also showed decreases in the actual amount of medical service usage and a marked reduction in medical expenditures.Conclusion: Non-pharmacological interventions in response to COVID-19 showed preventive effects on the transmission of other respiratory viruses, as well as COVID-19. Although COVID-19 had a tremendous impact on society as a whole, with high social costs, there were also positive effects, such as a reduction in the incidence of acute respiratory viral infections.

TI  - Modification of Fraser's Method for the Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Mass Estimation by Using Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most critical greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is carbon dioxide (CO2) due to its long-lasting and negative impact on climate change. The global atmospheric monthly mean CO2 concentration is currently greater than 410 ppm which has changed dramatically since the industrial era. To choose suitable climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies it is necessary to define carbon dioxide mass distribution and global atmospheric carbon dioxide mass. The available method to estimate the global atmospheric CO2 mass was proposed in 1980. In this study, to increase the accuracy of the available method, various observation platforms such as ground-based stations, ground-based tall towers, aircrafts, balloons, ships, and satellites are compared to define the best available observations, considering the temporal and spatial resolution. In the method proposed in this study, satellite observations (OCO2 data), from January 2019 to December 2021, are used to estimate atmospheric CO2 mass. The global atmospheric CO2 mass is estimated around 3.24 x 10(15) kg in 2021. For the sake of comparison, global atmospheric CO2 mass was estimated by Fraser's method using NOAA data for the mentioned study period. The proposed methodology in this study estimated slightly greater amounts of CO2 in comparison to Fraser's method. This comparison resulted in 1.23% and 0.15% maximum and average difference, respectively, between the proposed method and Fraser's method. The proposed method can be used to estimate the required capacity of systems for carbon capturing and can be applied to smaller districts to find the most critical locations in the world to plan for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

TI  - Sentinel-1 to NDVI for Agricultural Fields Using Hyperlocal Dynamic Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a key parameter in precision agriculture. It has been used globally since the 1970s as a proxy to monitor crop growth and correlates to the crop coefficient (Kc), leaf area index (LAI), crop cover, and more. Yet, it is susceptible to clouds and other atmospheric conditions that might alter the crop's real NDVI value. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), on the other hand, can penetrate clouds and is hardly affected by atmospheric conditions, but it is sensitive to the physical structure of the crop and therefore does not give a direct indication of the NDVI. Several SAR indices and methods have been suggested to estimate NDVIs via SAR; however, they tend to work for local spatial and temporal conditions and do not work well globally. This is because they are not flexible enough to capture the changing NDVI-SAR relationship throughout the crop-growing season. This study suggests a new method for converting Sentinel-1 to NDVIs for Agricultural Fields (SNAF) by utilizing a hyperlocal machine learning approach. This method generates multiple on-the-fly disposal field- and time-specific models for every available Sentinel-1 image across 2021. Each model learns the field-specific NDVI (from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) -SAR (Sentinel-1) relationship based on recent NDVI and SAR time series and consequently estimates the optimal NDVI value from the current SAR image. The SNAF was tested on 548 commercial fields from 18 countries with 28 crop types and, based on 6880 paired NDVI-SAR images, achieved an RMSE, bias, and R-2 of 0.06, 0.00, and 0.92, respectively. The outcome of this study aspires to a persistent seamless stream of NDVI values, regardless of the atmospheric conditions, illumination, or local conditions, which can assist in agricultural decision making.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Water Trends for the Conterminous United States Using MODIS Satellite Data, 2003-2019
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery is commonly used to map surface water extents over time, but many approaches yield discontinuous records resulting from cloud obstruction or image archive gaps. We applied the Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) model to downscaled (250-m) daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in Google Earth Engine to generate monthly surface water maps for the conterminous United States (US) from 2003 through 2019. The aggregation of daily observations to monthly maps of maximum water extent produced records with diminished cloud and cloud shadow effects across most of the country. We used the continuous monthly record to analyze spatiotemporal surface water trends stratified within Environmental Protection Agency Ecoregions. Although not all ecoregion trends were significant (p < 0.05), results indicate that much of the western and eastern US underwent a decline in surface water over the 17-year period, while many ecoregions in the Great Plains had positive trends. Trends were also generated from monthly streamgage discharge records and compared to surface water trends from the same ecoregion. These approaches agreed on the directionality of trend detected for 54 of 85 ecoregions, particularly across the Great Plains and portions of the western US, whereas trends were not congruent in select western deserts, the Great Lakes region, and the southeastern US. By describing the geographic distribution of surface water over time and comparing these records to instrumented discharge data across the conterminous US, our findings demonstrate the efficacy of using satellite imagery to monitor surface water dynamics and supplement traditional instrumented monitoring.

TI  - Comparison of Cloud Amounts Retrieved with Three Automatic Methods and Visual Observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Four methods have been used for the estimation of the total cloud amount and cloud amount for low clouds: visual observations, the Long method applied on pyranometer measurements, the Automatic Partial Cloud Amount Detection Algorithm (APCADA) method applied on pyrgeometers measurements, and ceilometer measurements of the cloud base height. Records from meteorological observers indicate that clear days (0-1 octa) represent the most frequent cloud amount for low clouds. In contrast, the total cloud amount is more aleatory. Results obtained from the Long method show maximum frequency in the extreme cloud amount values. The APCADA method also indicates the predominance of cloudless skies. The ceilometer method shows a predominance of completely clear skies, but the completely cloudy (8 octas) is the second most frequent case. Automatic methods report more cloudless and overcast skies than the observer. Automatic methods agree with the visual method or differ in +/- 1 octa for 60-76% cases for low cloud amount and for 56-63% cases for total cloud amount. In general, low cloud amount agrees more with observer measurements than total cloud amount and the automatic methods underestimated total cloud amount observer values possibly due to the difficulty in monitoring high clouds.

T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a procedure based on remote sensing Sentinel-1 InSAR data aiming at evaluating the variability of the moment tensor solutions provided by different agencies in case of light-to-moderate earthquake. We model the expected coseismic ground deformations from the available moment tensor solutions and compare them with the real ones retrieved with the InSAR data. Any differences between location and intensity of simulated and estimated seismic-induced deformation fields allow indirectly evaluating the variability of the solutions in terms of epicenter locations and kinematics of the causative faults.We applied this investigation method to several light (44.9) to moderate (55.9) earthquakes occurred along the Mediterranean area since the launch of the Sentinel-1A mission in 2014. The selected seismic events cover all the faulting mechanisms and are characterized by different estimated magnitudes and depths thus offering a synoptic view of the performance of the procedure in several cases. Thanks to the global coverage and the unprecedented revisit time of Sentinel-1 acquisitions, the proposed procedure can be easily extended to any seismic event occurred inland worldwide.

T2  - TECNOLOGIA EN MARCHA
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of wood volume or biomass in forest plantations is one of the key variables for forest management decision making, to improve productivity and profitability of the products and environmental services they offer. Traditional techniques have been based on field inventories, through sampling with plots and human intervention in the acquisition of variables at tree and stand level. Current technology allows estimates to be made using sensors in autonomous vehicles and satellites. In Costa Rica, studies with Landsat and RapidEye satellite images have made it possible to generate updated maps on land cover and land use, including forest types. However, there are few studies on the relationship between volume and biomass values, calculated from data measured in the field and those calculated with remote sensing. This article presents the proposed methodology to estimate the productivity of Tectona grandis L. (Teak) forest plantations using Sentinel-2 satellite images. Taking into account the recommendations of other authors and the experience of the researchers. It is proposed to compare the information generated with Sentinel-2 and that acquired with a UAV with a multispectral camera. It is expected to provide a methodology that uses representative sampling sites, with an adequate sample size, with a control of environmental conditions, considering age, phenological stage and silvicultural treatments.

T2  - HISTORIA-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ALTE GESCHICHTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the Achaian League's imposition of a grain export embargo c. 191-188 BC. This was a response to a reduction in the availability of grain in its territory due to Roman campaigning in Greece, restricted agricultural exports from the eastern and central Mediterranean, and perhaps extreme weather. The embargo was aimed primarily at ensuring the Eleans, Messenians, and Spartans exported their grain within rather than beyond its borders. This demonstrates how ancient federations could engender resilience in the face of hardship, although by altering the food entitlement of different groups they unevenly distributed the social burden of that resilience.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors propose a novel methodological approach to up-to-date integrated satellite monitoring for studying origination of source zones of natural and induced catastrophes at large-scale subsoil use facilities in Siberia. This approach uses multimodal experimental geomechanical and geodynamic data of Earth remote sensing and digital technologies. This allows orientation at various applied aspects of mining technologies with regard to transition to processing and analysis of Big Data on slow deformation wave processes from the standpoint of nonlinear 'geomechanical thermodynamics'. The article describes the estimation method for the Earth's crust surface in Kuzbass Coal Basin using the lineament field analysis and the two-dimensional radar-base satellite data of Earth remote sensing. The use of the geoinformation technology software and testing results are presented as a case-study of a disastrous landslide at a large open pit coal mine in linkage with thermodynamic periods in the geomechanical behavior of the object of monitoring.

TI  - Deforestation as a Cause of Increased Surface Runoff in the Catchment: Remote Sensing and SWAT Approach-A Case Study of Southern Serbia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past two decades, the South part of Serbia has been affected by exploitive and illegal logging. As this trend is not decreasing to this day, there is a need to determine the area where this logging occurred precisely. The consequences of these actions are tremendous, causing the forest owners' financial loss (regardless of whether it is private or state property) and a negative impact on the environment. Significant environmental and forest management problems deriving from these actions are erosion increase and more frequent torrential floods occurrence in the catchment. Since it is difficult to update the national forest inventories in remote areas, remote sensing techniques using different satellite imagery types can provide up-to-date data. The initial analysis that employed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (created using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery) indicates massive deforestation in the research area between 1999 and 2021. Headwaters of the Stavska river catchment is selected as the research area to determine the amount of erosion in two periods-before and after deforestation occurred. Change in land cover (LC) is presented with two LC maps created applying supervised classification to Landsat 7 imagery from 1999 as a pre-deforestation LC state and Landsat 8 imagery acquired in 2021 as the current LC state. The erosion in the catchment for both periods is determined using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis results show the erosion change incurred as a deforestation effect in the river catchment. With the data obtained by remote sensing and SWAT analysis, it is possible to track changes in the area and acquire essential data, making the right and fast decisions to protect the natural resources economy and make sustainable development possible in this impoverished region.

TI  - Deep Learning Dataset for Estimating Burned Areas: Case Study, Indonesia
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Wildland fire is one of the most causes of deforestation, and it has an important impact on atmospheric emissions, notably CO2. It occurs almost every year in Indonesia, especially during the dry season. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the burned areas from remote sensing images to establish the zoning map of areas prone to wildland fires. Many methods have been developed for mapping burned areas from low-resolution to medium-resolution satellite images. One of the popular approaches for mapping tasks is a deep learning approach using U-Net architecture. However, it needs a large amount of representative training data to develop the model. In this paper, we present a new dataset of burned areas in Indonesia for training or evaluating the U-Net model. We delineate burned areas manually by visual interpretation on Landsat-8 satellite images. The dataset is collected from some regions in Indonesia, and it consists of 227 images with a size of 512 x 512 pixels. It contains one or more burned scars or only the background and its labeled masks. The dataset can be used to train and evaluate the deep learning model for image detection, segmentation, and classification tasks related to burned area mapping.

TI  - Assessing Sumatran Peat Vulnerability to Fire under Various Condition of ENSO Phases Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau's peatland as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change.

TI  - Synergy of remotely sensed data in spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of the crop and cover management factor
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a threat to the water quality constituents of sediments and nutrients and can cause long-term environmental damages. One important parameter to quantify the risk of soil loss from erosion is the crop and cover management factor (C-factor), which represents how cropping and management practices affect the rates and potential risk of soil erosion. We developed remotely sensed data-driven models for dynamic predictions of C-factor by implementing dynamic land cover modeling using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model on a watershed scale. The remotely sensed processed variables included the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (FPAR), leaf area index (LAI), soil available water content (AWC), slope gradient (SG), and ratio of area (AR) of every hydrologic response unit (HRU) to that of the total watershed, comprising unique land cover, soil type, and slope gradient characteristics within the Fish River catchment in Alabama, USA between 2001 and 2014. Linear regressions, spatial trend analysis, correlation matrices, forward stepwise multivariable regression (FSMR), and 2-fold cross-validation were conducted to evaluate whether there were possible associations between the C-factor and EVI with the successive addition of remotely sensed environmental factors. Based on the data analysis and modeling, we found a significant association between the C-factor and EVI with the synergy of the environmental factors FPAR, LAI, AWC, AR, and SG (predicted R2 (R2pred) = 0.51; R2 = 0.68, n = 3 220, P < 0.15). The results showed that the developed FSMR model constituting the non-conventional factors AWC (R2pred = 0.32; R2 = 0.48, n = 3 220, P < 0.05) and FPAR (R2pred = 0.13; R2 = 0.28, n = 3 220, P = 0.31) was an improved fit for the watershed C-factor. In conclusion, the union of dynamic variables related to vegetation (EVI, FPAR, and LAI), soil (AWC), and topography (AR and SG) can be utilized for spatiotemporal C-factor estimation and to monitor watershed erosion.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution and Driving Forces of NDVI in China's Giant Panda National Park
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the ecological evolution trends and vegetation driving mechanisms of giant panda national parks can help to improve the protection of giant panda habitats. Based on the research background of different geomorphological zoning, we selected the MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2020 to analyze the NDVI trends using a univariate linear model. A partial correlation analysis and multiple correlation analysis were used to reveal the influence of temperature and precipitation on NDVI trends. Fourteen factors related to meteorological factors, topographic factors, geological activities, and human activities were selected, and the Geographically Weighted Regression model was used to study the mechanisms driving NDVI change. The results were as follows: (1) The NDVI value of Giant Panda National Park has fluctuated and increased in the past 21 years, with an annual growth rate of 4.7%/yr. Affected by the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the NDVI value fluctuated greatly from 2008 to 2012, and reached its peak in 2018. (2) The NDVI in 94% of the study area improved, and the most significant improvement areas were mainly distributed in the northern and southern regions of Southwest Subalpine and Middle Mountain and the Xiaoxiangling area. Affected by the distribution of fault zones and their local activities, vegetation degradation was concentrated in the Dujiangyan-Anzhou area of Hengduan Mountain Alpine Canyon. (3) The Geographically Weighted Regression analysis showed that natural factors were dominant, with climate and elevation having a double-factor enhancement effect, the peak acceleration of ground motion and fault zone having a superimposed effect, and river density and slope having a double effect, all of which had a significant impact on the NDVI value of the surrounding area. To optimize the ecological security pattern of the Giant Panda National Park, we recommended strengthening the construction of ecological security projects through monitoring meteorological changes, preventing, and controlling geo-hazards, and optimizing the layout and intensity of human activities.

TI  - Caregiver Reports of Infant Distress and Injury in Abused Infants
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To determine whether in infants evaluated for physical abuse, medical encounters for infant distress are correlated with physical abuse or a history of sentinel injuries.Study design This retrospective, case-control analysis of infants aged <12 months evaluated for physical abuse identified demographic characteristics, prior injuries, and medical encounters for infant distress. Variables were compared between abused infants and nonabused infants with and without sentinel injuries. A nonparametric recursive classification tree analysis assessed interactions between variables.Results Infant distress was associated with abuse (67.9% vs 44.7%; P = .008; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.2). Infants with sentinel injuries had higher rates of infant distress (74.1% vs 42.4%; P .001) and crying (81.5% vs 62.7%; P = .012). Previous falls (32.6% vs 18.1%; P = .03) and nonsentinel injuries (18.2% vs 5.4%; P = .002) also were associated with abuse, although sentinel injuries were the most important predictor of abuse, followed by infant distress.Conclusions Infants with medical encounters for distress and injury may be at higher risk for abuse and may benefit from intensive educational and support services for their caregivers. Additional research evaluating the most effective interventions for caregivers of fussy infants is needed.

TI  - Dynamics of tropical forest regeneration in the Mexican Mesoamerican Biological Corridor from 2000 to 2020: does forest regeneration maintain continuous forest cover?
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest dynamics in the Mexican Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MxMBC) have been part of a land sharing system, helping maintain forest cover following semi-subsistence land-use through regeneration. Recently, mechanized cash-crop cultivation is occurring, translated in larger, permanent tracts of agriculture in place of core forest. This emerging land-use marks a potential shift in regeneration patterns, with implications for the maintenance of forest cover. We characterize MxMBC forest regeneration patterns from 2000 to 2020 to assess their relationship with the maintenance and expansion of forest cover. Classification of multi-temporal remotely sensed Landsat data reveals a decrease of 2.2% (296 km(2)) of forest area from 2000 to 2020, with regrowth making back 0.93% of forest (121 km(2)) by 2020. A spatial model identifies that 75.1% of forest regeneration in the study site occurs in four patterns ranging from permanent (89.2 km(2), 41.7%) to ephemeral (71.5 km(2), 33.4%). Analyzing the relation between landscape configuration and forest regeneration shows that regrowth occurs in small, widely dispersed forest patches. Spatial patterns of ephemeral regeneration mark two distinct land sharing contexts - ephemeral regeneration buffering core forest loss alongside semi-subsistence agriculture and agroforestry, and ephemeral regeneration masking core forest loss alongside cash crop agriculture. These cases suggest that maintaining forest cover through regeneration is impacted by land-use context, as the regeneration to core forest ratio decreases when permanent cash crop cultivation emerges.

TI  - Early-detection surveillance for stem rust of wheat: insights from a global epidemic network based on airborne connectivity and host phenology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stem rust of wheat, caused by the airborne pathogen Puccinia graminis, is a re-emerging crop disease representing a major concern to global food security. Potential long-distance transport by wind over a worldwide distributed host represents a challenge to effective surveillance and control of this disease. To monitor this disease, we have created a global epidemic network for stem rust of wheat combining (a) Lagrangian simulations of air-mass trajectories computed with the NOAA's HYSPLIT model; (b) land use from the Map Spatial Production Allocation Model and (c) meteorological and environmental conditions that are known to affect bio-physical processes involved in the biology of P. graminis spores. Our findings are in agreement with the well known north-American 'Puccinia pathway' and suggest the existence of other sub-continental pathways at the global scale. We used network theory to conceive surveillance strategies aimed at early detection of outbreaks while minimizing the number of nodes to be surveilled (also referred to as sentinels). We found that the set cover algorithm, due the high average connectivity of the network (density = 0.4%), performs better than a number of other network metrics and permits us to identify an optimal sentinel set (1% of the network nodes) to surveil 50% of the network. Our results also show that effective surveillance plans for stem rust of wheat can be designed, but that they need to account for the actual geographical scale of the underlying epidemiological process and call for an international and trans-boundary approach.

AB  - Over the last decades, north of Iran underwent remarkable land use/cover changes due to socio-economic and environmental factors.This study, focused on agricultural land changes for the period of 1990-2020 at Shanderman, Iran, employed Landsat 5 TM, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images. A supervised maximum likelihood classification technique was utilized for the purposes of satellite data classification to four classes: agricultural land, forest, grassland, and built-up area. Results of land change modeller showed that, during the last three decades, agricultural land, grassland and forest decreased by 42.81%, 35.50%, and 4.05%, respectively, while built-up area increased by 361.23%. Most of the losses in agriculture areas occurred in 1990-2011 (44.64%).The predominant losses in 2011-2020 belonged to the forestland (12.47%), making them approx. 3.44 times higher than in 1990-2011. The results highlight the need for serious attention to the deforestation phenomenon, which leads to the conversion of forest into agricultural and built-up areas.

TI  - Complications and risk factors in vulvar cancer surgery - A population-based study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Primary surgery for vulvar cancer has become less radical in past decades. This study investigates risk factors and prevalence of short-and long-term complications after up-to-date vulvar cancer surgery.Methods: Population-based cohort study of surgically treated primary vulvar cancer at a national center of vulvar cancer, assessing surgical outcome. The Swedish Quality Registry for Gynecological Cancer was used for identification, journals reviewed and surgical outcome including complications within 30 days and one year registered. Multivariable logistic regression analysis comprising risk factors of short-term complications; age>80 years, BMI, smoking, diabetes, lichen sclerosus and FIGO stage was performed.Results: 182 patients were identified, whereas 55 had vulvar surgery only, 53 surgery including sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and 72 surgery including inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL), with shortterm complication rates of 21.8%, 39.6% and 54.2% respectively. Vulvar wound dehiscence was reported in 6.0% and infection in 13.7%. Complication rates were lower after SLNB than IFL (wound dehiscence 0% vs 8.3%; p = 0.04, infection 15.1% vs 36.1%; p = 0.01 and lymphocele 5.7% vs 9.7%; p = 0.52). Severe complications were rare. Persisting lymphedema evolved in 3.8% after SLNB and in 38.6% after IFL (p = 0.001), ubiquitous after adjuvant radiotherapy. In multivariable regression analysis, no associations between included risk factors and complications were found.Conclusion: Surgical complications are still common in vulvar cancer surgery and increase with the extent of groin surgery. To thrive for early diagnosis and to avoid IFL seem to be the most important factors in minimizing short-and long-term complications. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Investigating the Relationship between Air Pollutants and Meteorological Parameters Using Satellite Data over Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of the relationship between air pollutants and meteorological parameters on the regional scale is a prerequisite for setting up air pollution prevention and control strategies; however, there is a lack of methodical investigations, particularly in the context of Bangladesh's deficiency of information on air pollution. This study represents the first attempt to investigate the relationship between air pollutants (NO2, O-3, SO2, and CO) and meteorological parameters over Bangladesh using satellite data (OMI and MOPITT) during the period from 2015 to 2020. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) modelling was utilized to assess the relationship between air pollutants and weather variables. The spatial representation and average values of geographically varying coefficients showed that the column densities of air pollutants were affected by the meteorological parameters. For example, NO2 was positively associated with temperature in most of the studied regions, with an average geographically varying coefficient value of 0.12 Dobson units (DU, 1 DU = 2.687 x 10(16) molecules/cm(2)), indicating that NO2 concentrations increase by 0.12 DU/year with every unit increase in temperature. The sources of NO2 and SO2 in Dhaka were identified through emission inventory analysis, and transportation and industry emissions were the most significant influencing factors for NO2 and SO2, respectively. Temperature and pressure showed a higher degree of relationship with all four air pollutants compared with other parameters. The results and discussion presented in this study can be of benefit for policy makers in developing air pollution control strategies in Bangladesh.

TI  - GIS and Remote Sensing-Based Multi-Criteria Analysis for Delineation of Groundwater Potential Zones: A Case Study for Industrial Zones in Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a crucial natural resource that varies in quality and quantity across Bangladesh. Increased population and urbanization place enormous demands on groundwater supplies, reducing both their quality and quantity. This research aimed to delineate the groundwater potential zone in the Gazipur district, Bangladesh, by integrating eleven thematic layers. Data and information were gathered from Landsat 8, the digital elevation model, the google earth engine, and several ancillary sources. A multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used in a GIS platform to estimate the groundwater potential index. The potential index values were finally classified into five sub-groups: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high to generate a groundwater water potential zone (GWPZ) map. The results show that groundwater potential in about 0.002% (0.026 km(2)) of the area is very low, 3.83% (63.18 km(2)) of the area is low, 56.2% (927.05 km(2)) of the area is medium, 39.25% (647.46 km(2)) of the area is high, and the rest 0.72% (11.82 km(2)) of the area is very high. The validation of GWPZ maps based on the groundwater level data at 20 observation wells showed an overall accuracy of 80%. In addition, the ROC curve showed 84% accuracy of GWPZ maps when validated with water inventory points across the study region. Overall, this study presents an easy and practical approach for identifying groundwater potential zones, which may help improve planning and sustainable groundwater resource management.

TI  - Evaluating bank erosion and identifying possible anthropogenic causative factors of Kirtankhola River in Barishal, Bangladesh: an integrated GIS and Remote Sensing approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bangladesh, riverbank erosion has turned into one of the most frequently occurring natural disasters, and it affects the socio-economic and livelihood status as well as the environment of the adjoining areas. Kirtankhola River in Barishal, is this kind of river. This study assesses the amount of erosion-accretion, examines river profile, detecting key anthropogenic factors behind it, and signifying channel shifting of the river within 10 years (from 2009 to 2019). The study used Landsat Satellite imageries, geospatial techniques, and a semi-structured questionnaire survey throughout the study area. The study showed that erosion dominants at the left bank of river (17.1 ha/year), whereas the accretion rate is higher at the right ( 19.72 ha/year). Besides, cross-section at selected points of the river providing an evident indication of the river widening thus river course shifting. According to 61% of the participants in the questionnaire, high waves generated through water vehicles are the main culprit for this extensive erosion. The number of launches has increased significantly within the studied timeperiod, and most of the launches run over 30 km/h velocity, where it should be less than 20km/h. The study explored a mechanism of how centrifugal force produced by water vehicles increases the intensity of riverbank erosion in the meandering area.

TI  - Pathogenesis of West Nile Virus Lineage 2 in Domestic Geese after Experimental Infection
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging infectious pathogen circulating between mosquitoes and birds but also infecting mammals. WNV has become autochthonous in Germany, causing striking mortality rates in avifauna and occasional diseases in humans and horses. We therefore wanted to assess the possible role of free-ranging poultry in the WNV transmission cycle and infected 15 goslings with WNV lineage 2 (German isolate). The geese were monitored daily and sampled regularly to determine viremia, viral shedding, and antibody development by molecular and serological methods. Geese were euthanized at various time points post-infection (pi). All infected geese developed variable degrees of viremia from day 1 to day 10 (maximum) and actively shed virus from days 2 to 7 post-infection. Depending on the time of death, the WN viral genome was detected in all examined tissue samples in at least one individual by RT-qPCR and viable virus was even re-isolated, except for in the liver. Pathomorphological lesions as well as immunohistochemically detectable viral antigens were found mainly in the brain. Furthermore, all of the geese seroconverted 6 days pi at the latest. In conclusion, geese are presumably not functioning as important amplifying hosts but are suitable sentinel animals for WNV surveillance.

TI  - Evaluation of Intraoperative Frozen Section Analysis with Final Histopathology Results for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Z0011 Criteria Eligible Versus Ineligible Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Intraoperative frozen section analysis (FSA) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) declined in the post American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) trial era. However, for those patients who do not meet the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, FSA continues to be a valuable tool in intraoperative decision-making for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The aim of this study was therefore to retrospectively evaluate the benefit and accuracy of FSA of Z0011 criteria eligible versus ineligible patients and identify possible predictive factors for false negative results.Methods Intraoperative FSA was performed on SLNs of 522 cT1-T3 breast cancer patients between 2008 and 2013. Clinicopathologic characteristics were retrospectively assessed by chart review.Results Overall FSA sensitivity and specificity was 67.8% and 100%. Sensitivity was generally higher for macrometastasis than for micrometastasis. The Z0011 eligible group showed a sensitivity and specificity of 72.7% and 100% versus 62.1% and 100% in the Z0011 ineligible group. Importantly, subgroup analysis of <= 2 versus >2 positive SLNs of the Z0011 eligible group demonstrated both a 100% specificity and sensitivity. Several clinicopathologic factors were associated with a higher rate of false negative results in the Z0011 ineligible patient group. FSA was beneficial for 22.2% of Z0011 ineligible patients and for only 0.6% of Z0011 eligible patients regarding intraoperative decision-making for ALND.Conclusions FSA continues to be especially beneficial in the intraoperative assessment of SLNs in the Z0011 ineligible group to prevent second stage ALND. Despite an overall lower FSA sensitivity in the Z0011 eligible patient group, FSA offers in both groups a comparable high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy for macrometastasis.

TI  - Comparison of Different Near-Infrared Technologies to Detect Sentinel Lymph Node in Uterine Cancer: A Prospective Comparative Cohort Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered a crucial step in endometrial cancer staging. Cervical injection has become the most favored technique and indocyanine green has been demonstrated to be more accurate than other tracers. Different near-infrared camera systems are currently being used to detect indocyanine green in sentinel lymph nodes and have been compared in different patients. The present study aimed to determine the number and site of sentinel lymph nodes detected in the same patients with two different near-infrared technologies. Methods: This is a prospective, single-center, observational, non-sponsored study. Patients with presumed uterine-confined endometrial cancer were prospectively enrolled. After cervical injection, two different near-infrared cameras were used to detect sentinel lymph nodes at the same time: Olympus, Tokyo, Japan-considered the standard (SNIR); and Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA with VISION SENSE (R) which is a new laser near-infrared (LNIR) fluorescence laparoscope. The two cameras were alternatively switched on to detect sentinel lymph nodes in the same patients. Results: Seventy-four consecutive patients were included in the study. Most of the patients were diagnosed with endometrioid histology (62, 83.8%), FIGO stage IA (48, 64.9%), grade 2 (43, 58.1%), and underwent surgery with laparoscopic approach (70, 94.0%). The bilateral detection rate was 56/74 (75.7%) with SNIR and 63/74 (85.1%) with LNIR (p = 0.214). The total number of sentinel lymph nodes identified in the left hemipelvis was 65 and 70 with SNIR and LNIR, respectively; while in the right hemipelvis, there were 74 and 76, respectively. The median number of sentinel lymph nodes identified with SNIR and LNIR was 2 (range, 0-4) and 2 (range, 0-4), respectively (p = 0.370). No difference in site of sentinel lymph node detection was evident between the two technologies (p = 0.994). Twelve patients (16.2%) had sentinel lymph node metastasis: in all cases metastatic sentinel lymph nodes were detected both with Olympus and LNIR. Conclusions: No difference in bilateral detection rate and number or site of sentinel lymph node detection was evident comparing two different technologies of near-infrared camera for ICG detection in endometrial cancer patients. No difference in sentinel lymph node metastases identification was detected between the two technologies.

TI  - Coastal high-frequency radars in the Mediterranean - Part 2: Applications in support of science priorities and societal needs
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is a prominent climate-change hot spot, with many socioeconomically vital coastal areas being the most vulnerable targets for maritime safety, diverse met-ocean hazards and marine pollution. Providing an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution at wide coastal areas, high-frequency radars (HFRs) have been steadily gaining recognition as an effective land-based remote sensing technology for continuous monitoring of the surface circulation, increasingly waves and occasionally winds. HFR measurements have boosted the thorough scientific knowledge of coastal processes, also fostering a broad range of applications, which has promoted their integration in coastal ocean observing systems worldwide, with more than half of the European sites located in the Mediterranean coastal areas. In this work, we present a review of existing HFR data multidisciplinary science-based applications in the Mediterranean Sea, primarily focused on meeting end-user and science-driven requirements, addressing regional challenges in three main topics: (i) maritime safety, (ii) extreme hazards and (iii) environmental transport process. Additionally, the HFR observing and monitoring regional capabilities in the Mediterranean coastal areas required to underpin the underlying science and the further development of applications are also analyzed. The outcome of this assessment has allowed us to provide a set of recommendations for future improvement prospects to maximize the contribution to extending science-based HFR products into societally relevant downstream services to support blue growth in the Mediterranean coastal areas, helping to meet the UN's Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the EU's Green Deal goals.

TI  - Cutaneous Melanomas: A Single Center Experience on the Usage of Immunohistochemistry Applied for the Diagnosis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma (cM) is the deadliest of all primary skin cancers. Its prognosis is strongly influenced by the stage at diagnosis, with early stages having a good prognosis and being potentially treatable with surgery alone; advanced stages display a much worse prognosis, with a high rate of recurrence and metastasis. For this reason, the accurate and early diagnosis of cM is crucial-misdiagnosis may have extremely dangerous consequences for the patient and drastically reduce their chances of survival. Although the histological exam remains the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of cM, a continuously increasing number of immunohistochemical markers that could help in diagnosis, prognostic characterization, and appropriate therapeutical choices are identified every day, with some of them becoming part of routine practice. This review aims to discuss and summarize all the data related to the immunohistochemical analyses that are potentially useful for the diagnosis of cM, thus rendering it easier to appropriately applicate to routine practice. We will discuss these topics, as well as the role of these molecules in the biology of cM and potential impact on diagnosis and treatment, integrating the literature data with the experience of our surgical pathology department.

TI  - Assessment of Saildrone Extreme Wind Measurements in Hurricane Sam Using MW Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2021, a novel NOAA-Saildrone project deployed five uncrewed surface vehicle Saildrones (SDs) to monitor regions of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea frequented by tropical cyclones. One of the SDs, SD-1045, crossed Hurricane Sam (Category 4) on September 30, providing the firstever surface-ocean videos of conditions in the core of a major hurricane and reporting near-surface winds as high as 40 m/s. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the Saildrone ocean surface wind measurements in Hurricane Sam, using the following datasets for direct and indirect comparisons: an NDBC buoy in the path of the storm, radiometer tropical cyclone (TC) winds from SMAP and AMSR2, wind retrievals from the ASCAT scatterometers and SAR (RadarSat2), and HWRF model winds. The SD winds show excellent consistency with the satellite observations and a remarkable ability to detect the strength of the winds at the SD location. We use the HWRF model and satellite data to perform cross-comparisons of the SD with the buoy, which sampled different relative locations within the storm. Finally, we review the collective consistency among these measurements by describing the uncertainty of each wind dataset and discussing potential sources of systematic errors, such as the impact of extreme conditions on the SD measurements and uncertainties in the methodology.

TI  - Enhanced monitoring of atmospheric methane from space over the Permian basin with hierarchical Bayesian inference
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane is a strong greenhouse gas, with a higher radiative forcing per unit mass and shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide. The remote sensing of methane in regions of industrial activity is a key step toward the accurate monitoring of emissions that drive climate change. Whilst the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinal-5P satellite is capable of providing daily global measurement of methane columns, data are often compromised by cloud cover. Here, we develop a statistical model which uses nitrogen dioxide concentration data from TROPOMI to efficiently predict values of methane columns, expanding the average daily spatial coverage of observations of the Permian basin from 16% to 88% in the year 2019. The addition of predicted methane abundances at locations where direct observations are not available will support inversion methods for estimating methane emission rates at shorter timescales than is currently possible.

TI  - Geotechnology Applied to Analysis of Vegetation Dynamics and Occurrence of Forest Fires on Indigenous Lands in Cerrado-Amazonia Ecotone
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado-Amazonia Ecotone is one of the largest ecosystems in Brazil and is internationally considered a biodiversity hotspot. The occurrence of fires is common in these areas, directly affecting biomass losses and the reduction of vegetative vigor of forest typologies. Information obtained through remote sensing and geoprocessing can assist in the evaluation of vegetation behavior and its relation to the occurrence of forest fires. In this context, the objective of the present study was to analyze temporal vegetation dynamics, as well as their relationship with rainfall and fire occurrence on Indigenous lands, located in the Cerrado-Amazonia Ecotone of Mato Grosso state, Brazil. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images of the MOD13Q1 MODIS product and burnt area of the MCD45A1 MODIS product, and rainfall images from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) sensor were used. The period analyzed was from 2007 to 2016. After pre-processing the NDVI, TRMM and burnt area images, correlation analyses were performed between the rainfall, vegetation index and burnt area images, considering different lags (-3 to 3), to obtain the best response time for the variables. The analyses of inter-annual vegetation index trends were carried out following Mann-Kendall monotonic trend and seasonal trend analysis methodologies. Significant correlations were observed between NDVI and rainfall (R = 0.84), in grass regions and between NDVI and burnt area (R = -0.74). The Mann-Kendall monotonic trend indicates vegetation index stability with positive variations in grass regions. The analysis of seasonal trends identified different vegetation responses, with this biome presenting a diverse phytophysiognomy and seasonal vegetation with different phases for amplitudes. This variation is evidenced by the various phytophysiognomies and their responses in relation to biomass gains and losses. The correlation and regression of the NDVI and rainfall in the vegetation type of grass areas show that the burnt area tends to increase with the reduction of NDVI. Finally, no defined pattern of vegetation cycles or phases was observed in terms of seasonality and the proposed methodology can be adapted to other world biomes.

TI  - Cultural context in New Zealand: incorporating kaupapa Maori values in clinical research and practice
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the importance of understanding and incorporating cultural context within Aotearoa/New Zealand when engaging in clinical research and practice. This paper reports on the qualitative findings of a mixed methods study aimed at determining what effect a cardiac risk reduction exercise and lifestyle management programme, embedded within a kaupapa Maori methodological approach, had on Maori participants. This methodology saw participants able to redevelop a western model cardiac risk reduction programme by introducing a Maori worldview. Our study revealed how the kaupapa Maori approach empowered participants to examine and evaluate not only their own health and lifestyle choices, but those of family and the wider community. Combining biomedical and kaupapa Maori components into the programme was found to benefit participants' mental, physical, spiritual and family well-being.

TI  - Global Evapotranspiration Datasets Assessment Using Water Balance in South America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) connects the land to the atmosphere, linking water, energy, and carbon cycles. ET is an essential climate variable with a fundamental importance, and accurate assessments of the spatiotemporal trends and variability in ET are needed from regional to continental scales. This study compared eight global actual ET datasets (ETgl) and the average actual ET ensemble (ETens) based on remote sensing, climate reanalysis, land-surface, and biophysical models to ET computed from basin-scale water balance (ETwb) in South America on monthly time scale. The 50 small-to-large basins covered major rivers and different biomes and climate types. We also examined the magnitude, seasonality, and interannual variability of ET, comparing ETgl and ETens with ETwb. Global ET datasets were evaluated between 2003 and 2014 from the fol- lowing datasets: Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), MOD16, Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML), Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) and Terra Climate. By using ETwb as a basis for comparison, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.45 (SSEBop) to 0.60 (ETens), and RMSE ranged from 35.6 (ETens) to 40.5 mm.month(-1) (MOD16). Overall, ETsi estimates ranged from 0 to 150 mm.month(-1) in most basins in South America, while ETwb estimates showed maximum rates up to 250 mm.month(-1). ETgl varied by hydroclimatic regions: (i) basins located in humid climates with low seasonality in precipitation, including the Amazon, Uruguay, and South Atlantic basins, yielded weak correlation coefficients between monthly ETgl and ETwb, and (ii) tropical and semiarid basins (areas where precipitation demonstrates a strong seasonality, as in the Sdo Francisco, Northeast Atlantic, Parand/Paraguay, and Tocantins basins) yielded moderate-to-strong correlation coefficients. An assessment of the interannual variability demonstrated a disagreement between ETgl and ETwb in the humid tropics (in the Amazon), with ETgl showing a wide range of interannual variability. However, in tropical, subtropical, and semiarid climates, including the Tocantins, Sdo Francisco, Parand, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Atlantic basins (Northeast, East, and South), we found a stronger agreement between ETgl and ETwb for interannual variability. Assessing ET datasets enables the understanding of land-atmosphere exchanges in South America, to improvement of ET estimation and monitoring for water management.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Riparian Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Riparian zones are dynamic ecosystems that form at the interface between the aquatic and terrestrial components of a landscape. They are shaped by complex interactions between the biophysical components of river systems, including hydrology, geomorphology, and vegetation. Remote sensing technology is a powerful tool useful for understanding riparian form, function, and change over time, as it allows for the continuous collection of geospatial data over large areas. This paper provides an overview of studies published from 1991 to 2021 that have used remote sensing techniques to map and understand the processes that shape riparian habitats and their ecological functions. In total, 257 articles were reviewed and organised into six main categories (physical channel properties; morphology and vegetation or field survey; canopy detection; application of vegetation and water indices; riparian vegetation; and fauna habitat assessment). The majority of studies used aerial RGB imagery for river reaches up to 100 km in length and Landsat satellite imagery for river reaches from 100 to 1000 km in length. During the recent decade, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have been widely used for low-cost monitoring and mapping of riverine and riparian environments. However, the transfer of RS data to managers and stakeholders for systematic monitoring as a source of decision making for and successful management of riparian zones remains one of the main challenges.

AB  - Ruzmetrov R, Abdullaev I, Gandjaeva L, Matyakubov Z, Iskandarov A, Otaev O, Ibragimov S. 2022. Fundamentals of using Geographical Information Systems in predicting the distribution of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Biodiversitas 23: 3251-3256. This study aims to explore new ways to identify agroecological conditions that help in the occurrence of Helicoverpa armigera in cotton fields. Geographical data on soil salinity, mechanical composition, groundwater level, salinity, density of canals and drains, field Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) coefficient of the field Helicoverpa armigera with the number of eggs regression was analyzed. The data were collected from the database of the GIS laboratory of the KRASS (Khorezm Rural Advisory Support Service) agro-consulting center, which was established with support from ZEF (The Center for Development Research) University of Bonn, Germany, and lancet satellite data in the calculation of NDVI. Data were analyzed with ArcGIS and R program. Occurrence of Helicoverpa armigera in cotton fields was found to be associated with high relative humidity and high stem length. Using the relative humidity of the air in the field and other agro ecological factors, it was found that the probability of remote distribution of cotton bollworm is more than 50%.

TI  - The Influence of the Quality of Digital Elevation Data on the Modelling of Terrain Vehicle Movement
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated digital terrain models and options for their evaluation and effective usage. The most important result of this study was the introduction of the slope reduction method for low-detail elevation models. It enabled accurate results of passability analyses by performing adjustments of slopes. In addition, the goal was to determine the strengths and weaknesses of selected data for use in cross-country mobility analyses, followed by recommendations on how to use these databases efficiently to obtain accurate results. The selection of elevation databases (1 m, 5 m, 10 m, 30 m) was determined by the focus of data development projects of NATO and current scientific research projects of the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic. Key findings showed potential for use in practise for all tested elevation models. Efficient usage of low-detail models in CCM analyses is limited; nevertheless, they can be augmented with additional vector data or automated remote-sensing technologies.

TI  - SPACE AND TIME IN THE MYTHICAL-HISTORICAL MEMORY OF THE MANSIS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to the reconstruction in historical retrospection of the images of the space-time continuum, expressed through the material world of the Mansis ethnic culture and concentrated in the folklore sphere. The methodology is set by the postulates about the specificity of mythological thinking, refracted in relation to time and space. The source base was made up of the Mansis folklore texts collected from the beginning of the 20th century.Following his predecessors, the author distinguishes three periods in the mythological and poetic history of the Mansis. The classification is based on the principle of generational affiliation of the main characters. The first period is associated with the era of primordial creation and the "old couple" or the supreme deity Num-Torum. Time and space in it are substantial and are expressed through the images of water and earth. Infinity, as the initial state of space, is replaced by a measurement through time, which emphasizes its finiteness and limitation. The principle of trinity dominates in the reckoning of time.The second period is set by the acts of the sons of the supreme deity - Taryg-peshch-nimal'sova and the bear. The space is desribed multidimensional: the earth and near-earth spheres the sky, the underground, the water and the southern land of Mortim-maa, as well as the underworld or the dead world. Particular attention is paid to the "bark soil", which is characterized by landscape: first of all, rivers, but also swamps, thickets, mountains, manes. The idea of " one's own land" as a personal form of connection with space is fixed. The culture of the space is emphasized, the signs of which are villages, fortresses, barns, plague, and the sacred part - "sacred place" - stands out. The perception of time is also distinguished by multidimensionality. On the one hand, relativity is attributed to it due to the opposition "far close", correlated with movement, on the other hand, there is time reckoning with the help of the light and dark parts of the day, accentuation of morning and evening as the prologue and epilogue of the day.The third period becomes the arena of human action, and in various folklore forms of manifestation of human nature - Ekva-pyris, people-heroes, the progenitors of the phratries Por and Mos. The main thing here is activities and actions through which the feeling of timespace is transmitted. Space is thought of locally, although the degree of local concretization is different: on the one hand, an indefinitely distant territory, and on the other, a topographically verified reference to real settlements and geographical objects. The interpretation of time, and above all in the heroic epic, is as close as possible to the linear historical. During this period, there is the most developed system of calculating time, in which astronomical units dominate - the year as the sum of winter and summer, day and night. At the same time, the day is interpreted both as the time of human life and life itself.The presence of spatio-temporal portals intersperses the specifics of the expression of space and time, inherent in periods, in the general picture of the Mansis world.

TI  - Impact of Plantation Induced Forest Degradation on the Outbreak of Emerging Infectious Diseases-Wayanad District, Kerala, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have increased recently due to forest degradation. This research is an attempt to understand the direct and indirect impact of forest degradation on infectious disease outbreaks in a specific context of the Wayanad district in Kerala, India. The study was done in two parts. In the first part, land use and land cover change of the Wayanad district was analyzed for the period of 1950 to 2018. The result of the analysis shows that a significant amount of forest has been converted into agricultural and forest plantations over the time. The second part involves understanding the impact of plantations on the outbreak of EIDs. We have employed GIS tools, remote sensing data, extensive field work and disease data to discover the relationship between the LULCC and disease outbreak. It was found that cases of EIDs were high in those gram panchayats where forests were encroached by plantations. The world has been facing a pandemic owing to COVID-19. We have also seen the geographic expansion and outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases (EID) in recent years. This paper investigates the direct and indirect effects of land use land cover change (LULCC) on EID outbreaks in the context of Wayanad District of Kerala, India. Wayanad is in the vulnerable tropical forested region, and it is named as one of the four environmental change hotspots. The focus of this project is mainly three EIDs prevalent in this region: Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Dengue and Leptospirosis. Our results, based on topographical map, remote sensing and extensive field work, show that the natural forest in Wayanad was replaced with agriculture and forest plantation during 1950-2018. This paper further suggests that encroachment of forest by forest plantation causes the human-animal conflict resulting in the outbreak of KFD cases. Our analysis reveals that a high number of Dengue cases is found in the forested regions of the district and over the adjacent human-made agriculture plantation areas. High and medium number of Leptospirosis cases contain a high portion of land area devoted to paddy cultivation and agricultural plantation. In summary, the results clearly show the linkage between the outbreak of above mentioned EIDs and LULCC in the context of Wayanad district, Kerala. We also discuss in detail the causal pathway involving human-environmental dynamics through which plantation leads to the outbreak of KFD. Replacing forests with plantations poses an alarming threat of disease outbreak in the community.

TI  - ESTIMATES ON MEDICATION COST OF DRUG DOSE SPECIFIC TREATMENT PROTOCOL FOR HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HEALTHCARE SECTORS IN INDIA.
T2  - Journal of hypertension
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a major public health challenge in most low- and middle-income countries and calls for prioritization of large-scale hypertension control programs. Adoption of drug and dose specific treatment protocols as recommended by the WHO-HEARTS is crucial for scaling up effective hypertension treatment in resource-limited settings. This study estimated the annual cost of medication per patient using three such protocols in India.DESIGN AND METHOD: The medication requirement was simulated with a range of hypertension control assumptions for the selected protocols based on preliminary observations from sentinel sites of a large-scale hypertension control program in the public sector. Two five-step single molecule and a single pill combination (SPC) based antihypertensive treatment protocols were selected for this study and the approximate medication costs was calculated based on Indian prices in the public and private sectors.RESULT: The approximate annual cost of antihypertensive medication per patient ranged from $33.88-58.44 in the private sector when using a single molecule drug protocol and from $51.57-68.83 when using a SPC drugs protocol. The cost of medication was lower in the generic stores ranging between $5.78-9.57 for single molecule protocols and $7.35-9.89 for protocol with SPC. The cost of medication for patients covered by the public sector was the lowest at $2.05-3.89 for single molecule protocols and $2.94-3.98 for SPC.CONCLUSION: At less than $4 per patient per annum, scaling up hypertension control program with drug and dose specific treatment protocols is a potentially cost-effective public health intervention to save lives and reduce expenses associated with cardiovascular complications in India. Generic drug prescription enforcement and the development of low-cost generic retail networks would increase affordability in the private sector. The cost of treatment with SPCs is comparable to the single molecule protocol, and therefore SPC based treatment protocol can be adopted in a public health program considering the advantage of simplified logistics, reduced pill burden, improved treatment adherence and blood pressure control.

TI  - Variability and Source Characterization of Regional PM of Two Urban Areas Dominated by Biomass Burning and Anthropogenic Emission
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the sources and formation pathways of particulate matter (PM) and its components is important to determine the impact of atmospheric aerosols on human health and the warming of the global atmosphere. Here, we characterized the variability of the eleven-year concentration and the origin of PM2.5 in two urban regions (Metro Manila and Boracay) in the Philippines, a country in South East Asia (SEA) with high local anthropogenic emissions and frequently impacted by transboundary pollution. The surface concentration of PM2.5 was analyzed using simulated and reanalyzed satellite data (MERRAero), complemented, and validated with filter measurements for PM2.5 and black carbon (BC). The PM2.5 masses in Metro Manila (12.3 +/- 2.4 mu g m(-3)) and Boracay (12.9 +/- 3.6 mu g m(-3)) were comparable yet with varying concentrations of aerosol components Anthropogenic related components of PM (organic carbon, sulfate, and BC) were more enhanced in the metropolis region (4.9 mu g m(-3)) than in the prime tourist spot (2.72 mu g m(-3)). Sulfate formation impacted the aerosol mass in Metro Manila, with the photochemical oxidation of SO2 as the predominant production pathway of sulfates. Analysis of regional organic matter (OM) and BC in Boracay revealed extensive transboundary transport of biomass burning (BB) plumes from equatorial SEA countries. Also, the ratio of OM and SO4 was utilized as a quick proxy for source characterization. Metro Manila and Boracay reported 0.77 +/- 0.20 and 1.06 +/- 0.55, highlighting the evident impact of traffic emissions in the PM mass in the metropolis region. For Boracay, the mixed contributions of BB and vehicular activities influenced the formation of PM. Overall, the reanalysis of satellite data captured the long-term variability and origins of surface PM in two vital urban regions in the Philippines. The utilization of MERRAero will be an important procedure in making regulatory decisions on regional pollution control.

TI  - Operational Processing of Big Satellite Data for Monitoring Glacier Dynamics: Case Study of Muldrow Glacier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent acquisition of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data by the European Sentinel-1 satellites provides an opportunity for monitoring the dynamics of worldwide glaciers. We present a fully-automated processing system for producing multi-dimensional time series of glacier flow. We then use this fully-automated processing system to investigate the dynamics of Muldrow Glacier, located in the Denali National Park and Preserve (Alaska, AK, USA) during the October 2014-November 2021 period. We compute north, east, and vertical Surface-Parallel-Flow (SPF) and non-Surface-Parallel-Flow (nSPF) components of flow velocity and displacement with an average temporal resolution of 9 days and grid spacing of 100 m. During this period, we observe a glacier surge, a manifold increase in glacier flow velocity, that started as early as 2017 and continues until the present; however, the near completion of this surge is apparent. This glacier previously surged in 1906-1912 (the exact date is unknown) and in 1956-1957. We present our results in different ways to emphasize various aspects of the observed surge and demonstrate the full capability of our processing system. As the availability of SAR data improves, we expect that the fully-automated processing systems, similar to the one presented here, will play an increasingly dominant role and soon entirely replace manual processing.

TI  - Calibration of Co-Located Identical PAR Sensors Using Wireless Sensor Networks and Characterization of the In Situ fPAR Variability in a Tropical Dry Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of photosynthetic active radiation (fPAR) attempts to quantify the amount of enery that is absorbed by vegetation for use in photosynthesis. Despite the importance of fPAR, there has been little research into how fPAR may change with biome and latitude, or the extent and number of ground networks required to validate satellite products. This study provides the first attempt to quantify the variability and uncertainties related to in-situ 2-flux fPAR estimation within a tropical dry forest (TDF) via co-located sensors. Using the wireless sensor network (WSN) at the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site (Guanacaste, Costa Rica), this study analyzes the 2-flux fPAR response to seasonal, environmental, and meteorological influences over a period of five years (2013-2017). Using statistical tests on the distribution of fPAR measurements throughout the days and seasons based on the sky condition, solar zenith angle, and wind-speed, we determine which conditions reduce variability, and their relative impact on in-situ fPAR estimation. Additionally, using a generalized linear mixed effects model, we determine the relative impact of the factors above, as well as soil moisture on the prediction of fPAR. Our findings suggest that broadleaf deciduous forests, diffuse light conditions, and low wind patterns reduce variability in fPAR, whereas higher winds and direct sunlight increase variability between co-located sensors. The co-located sensors used in this study were found to agree within uncertanties; however, this uncertainty is dominated by the sensor drift term, requiring routine recalibration of the sensor to remain within a defined criteria. We found that for the Apogee SQ-110 sensor using the manufacturer calibration, recalibration around every 4 years is needed to ensure that it remains within the 10% global climate observation system (GCOS) requirement. We finally also find that soil moisture is a significant predictor of the distribution and magnitude of fPAR, and particularly impacts the onset of senescence for TDFs.

TI  - Downscaling Microwave Soil Moisture Products with SM-RDNet for Semiarid Mining Areas
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SM), as a crucial ecological element, is significant to monitor in semiarid mining areas characterized by aridity and little rainfall. The passive microwave remote sensing, which is not affected by weather, provides more accurate SM information, but the resolution is too coarse for mining areas. The existing downscaling method is usually pointed to natural scenarios like agricultural fields rather than mining areas with high-intensity mining. In this paper, combined with geoinformation related to SM, we designed a convolutional neural network (SM-Residual Dense Net, SM-RDNet) to downscale SMAP/Sentinel-1 Level-2 radiometer/radar soil moisture data (SPL2SMAP_S SM) into 10 m spatial resolution. Based on the in-site measured data, the root mean square error (RMSE) was utilized to verify the downscaling accuracy of SM-RDNet. In addition, we analyzed its performance for different data combinations, vegetation cover types and the advantages compared with random forest (RF). Experimental results show that: (1) The downscaling from the 3 km product with the combination of auxiliary data NDVI + DEM + slope performs best (RMSE 0.0366 m(3)/m(3)); (2) Effective data combinations can improve the downscaling accuracy at the range of 0.0477-0.1176 m(3)/m(3) (RMSE); (3) The SM-RDNet shows better spatial completeness, details and accuracy than RF (RMSE improved by 0.0905 m(3)/m(3)). The proposed SM-RDNet can effectively obtain the fine-grained SM in semiarid mining areas. Our method bridges the gap between coarse-resolution microwave SM products and ecological applications of small-scale mining areas, and provides data and technical support for future research to explore how the mining effect SM in semiarid mining areas.

TI  - Grey Relational Modelling of Land Surface Temperature (LST) for Ranking Indian Urban Cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat data (L8, L7 and L5) of ten Indian cities were selected for spatial estimation of land surface temperature (LST) to understand the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. LST was estimated using two methods (a) the spectral radiance model; and (b) an automatic mapping algorithm developed in the ERDAS Imagine platform. LST values were normalized between 0 and 1 using an UHIindex for understanding the UHI scenario of cities during 1995-2017. The estimated average UHIindex values of nine cities were > 0.5, with the highest being 0.89, which forced in identifying the parameter influencing the tremendous rise in LST. To study this behavior, the role of different land cover changes (built-up, water bodies, or barren land) was considered and satellite-derived indices were adopted for classification instead of supervised classification looking at medium/low resolution freely available spatial data. The decision of which index mostly affected LST was solved by assigning a grade to each index generated from using the grey relational approach. With a highest grade of 5.8 and other two being 4.8 and 4.7, the built-up satellite index suggested that human activities severely altered the surface temperature in the cities. A realistic and practical "Living index (LI)" approach was implemented for ranking the cities in the study area based on the numeric of built-up index and UHIindex values encountered in day-to-day life.

TI  - Estimating dry biomass and plant nitrogen concentration in pre-Alpine grasslands with low-cost UAS-borne multispectral data - a comparison of sensors, algorithms, and predictor sets
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are an important part of pre-Alpine and Alpine landscapes. Despite the economic value and the significant role of grasslands in carbon and nitrogen (N) cycling, spatially explicit information on grassland biomass and quality is rarely available. Remotely sensed data from unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and satellites might be an option to overcome this gap. Our study aims to investigate the potential of low-cost UAS-based multispectral sensors for estimating above-ground biomass (dry matter, DM) and plant N concentration. In our analysis, we compared two different sensors (Parrot Sequoia, SEQ; MicaSense RedEdge-M, REM), three statistical models (linear model; random forests, RFs; gradient-boosting machines, GBMs), and six predictor sets (i.e. different combinations of raw reflectance, vegetation indices, and canopy height). Canopy height information can be derived from UAS sensors but was not available in our study. Therefore, we tested the added value of this structural information with in situ measured bulk canopy height data. A combined field sampling and flight campaign was conducted in April 2018 at different grassland sites in southern Germany to obtain in situ and the corresponding spectral data. The hyper-parameters of the two machine learning (ML) approaches (RF, GBM) were optimized, and all model setups were run with a 6-fold cross-validation. Linear models were characterized by very low statistical performance measures, thus were not suitable to estimate DM and plantN concentration using UAS data. The non-linear ML algorithms showed an acceptable regression performance for all sensor-predictor set combinations with average (avg; crossvalidated, cv) R-cv(2) of 0.48, RMSEcv, avg of 53.0 gm(2), and rRMSE(cv, avg) (relative) of 15.9% for DM and with R-cv,avg(2) of 0.40, RMSEcv, avg of 0.48 wt %, and rRMSEcv, avg of 15.2% for plant N concentration estimation. The optimal combination of sensors, ML algorithms, and predictor sets notably improved the model performance. The best model performance for the estimation of DM (R-cv(2) = 0.67, RMSEcv = 41.9 gm(2), rRMSE(cv) = 12.6 %) was achieved with an RF model that utilizes all possible predictors and REM sensor data. The best model for plant N concentration was a combination of an RF model with all predictors and SEQ sensor data (R-cv(2) = 0.47, RMSEcv = 0.45 wt %, rRMSE(cv) = 14.2 %). DM models with the spectral input of REM performed significantly better than those with SEQ data, while for N concentration models, it was the other way round. The choice of predictors was most influential on model performance, while the effect of the chosen ML algorithm was generally lower. The addition of canopy height to the spectral data in the predictor set significantly improved the DM models. In our study, calibrating the ML algorithm improved the model performance substantially, which shows the importance of this step.

TI  - Implementation of a Preoperative Huddle at a Level 1 Trauma Center
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Medical errors resulting in patient harm still occur at an alarmingly high rate. Surgery is a high-risk area that can frequently result in patient harm if errors occur. There is a need for standardization of communication and processes to decrease errors. We sought to determine whether the implementation of a preoperative huddle at our hospital could standardize communication and decrease medical errors. Methods A unique preoperative huddle was developed and implemented at a level 1 trauma center. We reviewed data before and after the implementation of the preoperative huddle including patient surveys and comments, the percentage of on-time operating room (OR) starts, OR turnover times, and the number of sentinel events. Results After huddle implementation, we observed a trend of improvement in our patient survey results on patient's perception that the doctors/nurses explained the procedure understandably after huddle implementation. There was a statistically yet limited clinically significant increase in OR turnover time from 37 to 40 minutes (P < 0.001). There was also an increase in on-time OR starts from 37% to 45% (P < 0.001). We observed a decrease in the number of sentinel events, with only 1 occurring each year since implementation. Conclusions A preoperative huddle was successfully implemented at a level 1 trauma hospital and helped standardize communication without significantly disrupting workflow. To our knowledge, this method of preoperative huddling has not been previously described in the literature.

TI  - Lessons learned in developing reference data sets with the contribution of citizens: the Geo-Wiki experience
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of remotely sensed products such as land cover requires large amounts of high-quality reference data, needed to train remote sensing classification algorithms and for validation. However, due to the lack of sharing and the high costs associated with data collection, particularly ground-based information, the amount of reference data available has not kept up with the vast increase in the availability of satellite imagery, e.g. from Landsat, Sentinel and Planet satellites. To fill this gap, the Geo-Wiki platform for the crowdsourcing of reference data was developed, involving visual interpretation of satellite and aerial imagery. Here we provide an overview of the crowdsourcing campaigns that have been run using Geo-Wiki over the last decade, including the amount of data collected, the research questions driving the campaigns and the outputs produced such as new data layers (e.g. a global map of forest management), new global estimates of areas or percentages of land cover/land use (e.g. the amount of extra land available for biofuels) and reference data sets, all openly shared. We demonstrate that the amount of data collected and the scientific advances in the field of land cover and land use would not have been possible without the participation of citizens. A relatively conservative estimate reveals that citizens have contributed more than 5.3 years of the data collection efforts of one person over short, intensive campaigns run over the last decade. We also provide key observations and lessons learned from these campaigns including the need for quality assurance mechanisms linked to incentives to participate, good communication, training and feedback, and appreciating the ingenuity of the participants.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Model Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Approach in Langat River Basin, Selangor, Malaysia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a natural hazard that can endanger human life and cause severe environmental damage. A landslide susceptibility map is essential for planning, managing, and preventing landslides occurrences to minimize losses. A variety of techniques are employed to map landslide susceptibility; however, their capability differs depending on the studies. The aim of the research is to produce a landslide susceptibility map for the Langat River Basin in Selangor, Malaysia, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A landslide inventory map contained a total of 140 landslide locations which were randomly separated into training and testing with ratio 70:30. Nine landslide conditioning factors were selected as model input, including: elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), distance to road, distance to river, lithology, and rainfall. The area under the curve (AUC) and several statistical measures of analyses (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value) were used to validate the landslide predictive model. The ANN predictive model was considered and achieved very good results on validation assessment, with an AUC value of 0.940 for both training and testing datasets. This study found rainfall to be the most crucial factor affecting landslide occurrence in the Langat River Basin, with a 0.248 weight index, followed by distance to road (0.200) and elevation (0.136). The results showed that the most susceptible area is located in the north-east of the Langat River Basin. This map might be useful for development planning and management to prevent landslide occurrences in Langat River Basin.

TI  - Structure and health status of the sand crab, Emerita taiwanesis Hsueh, 2015 from Sangchan Beach, Thailand: The histopathological approach
T2  - International Journal of Aquatic Biology-IJAB
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the impacts of environmental problems on aquatic organisms have been broadly reported in Thailand, the literature has not covered the sand crab, Emerita taiwanesis Hsueh, 2015. In this study, we focused on the structure and health status of E. taiwanesis, an economically important crab species, living close to human activity areas in Sangchan Beach, Rayong Province, Thailand. A total of 60 individuals were collected from the conservation and restoration of coastal resource project in Ban Rue Leg Kao Yod-based participatory during December 2016 - January 2017. We identified histopathological changes in the gill structure, but not in other vital organs, including ganglion, stomach, intestine, hepatopancreas and muscular bundles. The histological s alterations in the gill include hematocyte infiltration, pyknotic nuclei and degeneration of pillar cells in the gill (50% prevalence), suggesting that the gill is a sensitive organ to environmental changes. Our observation provided a better understanding of E. taiwanesis morphology and its overall healthy state on Sangchan Beach. Additionally, we suggest that the sand crab would be a suitable sentinel species for monitoring the environment of coastal areas in Thailand.

TI  - SlideSim: 3D Landslide Displacement Monitoring through a Physics-Based Simulation Approach to Self-Supervised Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Displacement monitoring is a critical step to understand, manage, and mitigate potential landside hazard and risk. Remote sensing technology is increasingly used in landslide monitoring. While significant advances in data collection and processing have occurred, much of the analysis of remotely-sensed data applied to landslides is still relatively simplistic, particularly for landslides that are slow moving and have not yet "failed". To this end, this work presents a novel approach, SlideSim, which trains an optical flow predictor for the purpose of mapping 3D landslide displacement using sequential DEM rasters. SlideSim is capable of automated, self-supervised learning by building a synthetic dataset of displacement landslide DEM rasters and accompanying label data in the form of u/v pixel offset flow grids. The effectiveness, applicability, and reliability of SlideSim for landslide displacement monitoring is demonstrated with real-world data collected at a landslide on the Southern Oregon Coast, U.S.A. Results are compared with a detailed ground truth dataset with an End Point Error RMSE = 0.026 m. The sensitivity of SlideSim to the input DEM cell size, representation (hillshade, slope map, etc.), and data sources (e.g., TLS vs. UAS SfM) are rigorously evaluated. SlideSim is also compared to diverse methodologies from the literature to highlight the gap that SlideSim fills amongst current state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Monitoring drought pattern for pre- and post-monsoon seasons in a semi-arid region of western part of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has become a regular phenomenon in the western semi-arid regions of India, where severe drought occurs once in 8-9 years. Therefore, two drought indices, namely temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation condition index (VCI), were prepared from using Landsat datasets to appraise and monitor of drought pattern for the pre- and post-monsoon seasons between 1996 and 2016 in the Latur district, the north-western part of India. Additionally, the average frequency layers (AFL) of all drought and land use indices were prepared to analyse the correlation between them. The results show a substantial increase in the area under high, very high and severe drought classes both pre- and post-monsoon seasons during the study period. The highest increase was noticed from the high drought class from 2532.45 to 4792.49 sq. km and 1559.84 to 3342.32 sq. km for pre- and post-monsoon season, respectively, based on the TCI and 1269.81 to 1787.77 sq. km in very high drought class for the post-monsoon season using the VCI. The correlation analysis showed that there exists a significant relationship between the land use indices and drought indices. However, the spatial pattern of correlation was heterogeneous for both pre- and post-monsoon seasons. The results of this research can help in the drought management and mitigation planning in the study area. In addition, a similar approach may be applied to analyse drought patterns in other places with similar geographic characteristics as both VCI and TCI are cost-effective and less time-consuming methods and produce reliable outcomes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Modes Characteristics and SARIMA Prediction of Total Column Water Vapor over China during 2002-2022 Based on AIRS Dataset
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The total column water vapor (TCWV) is a relatively active component in the atmosphere and an important detection object of climate change. Exploring the spatiotemporal modes characteristics of TCWV and predicting its changing trends can provide a reference for human beings to deal with climate change and formulate corresponding countermeasures. The TCWV data over China region by using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) dataset from 2002 to 2022 were obtained. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, linear regression, Mann-Kendall (M-K) mutation test, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model and other methods were used to discuss the spatiotemporal modes characteristics of TCWV in the China region on the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales and verify the rationality of the forecast of the monthly average trend of TCWV in the next year. The obtained results show that: (1) The annual and seasonal scales spatial distributions of TCWV in China are roughly consistent, with obvious latitudinal distribution characteristics. That is, the TCWV in the low latitude region, especially in the tropical region, is larger, and it gradually decreases with the increase of the latitude. Furthermore, the TCWV in the eastern region is higher than that in the western region at the same latitude; (2) The EOF analysis results show that its first mode can better reflect the typical distribution characteristics of the southeast-northwest positive distribution in China; (3) From 2002 to 2022, the TCWV in China shows an upward trend and the TCWV increases at a rate of 0.0413 kg/m(2) per year, which may be related to the long-term increase of air temperature in recent years; (4) The inter-monthly variation of TCWV shows a slightly positive skewed 'bell-shaped' curve, with the maximum in summer, the minimum in winter and the similar distribution in spring and autumn. As can be seen from the M-K curves of the four seasons, each season has different mutation points; (5) Forecasting the TCWV was done using time series monthly average values from September 2002 to February 2022. SARIMA (3, 1, 3) x (0, 1, 1, 12) was identified as the best model. This model passed the residual normality test and the forecasting evaluation statistics show that MAPE = 2.65%, MSE = 0.3229 and the R2-score = 0.9949. As demonstrated by the results, the SARIMA model is a good model for forecasting TCWV in the China region.

TI  - Can Indirect Evaluation Methods and Their Fusion Products Reduce Uncertainty in Actual Evapotranspiration Estimates?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating actual evapotranspiration (ET) across global land surface is one of the key challenges in terrestrial hydrological cycles and energy flux balance studies. Gridded ET products have the potential for application in ungauged basins, but their uncertainties are possibly large and it remains unclear which one is best for a given basin. The water balance (WB) method provides a direct estimate of basin scale ET, but it cannot be used in ungauged basins where streamflow data are unavailable. Here, we first assess the performance of ET from 10 global ET products against WB ET estimates in 43 large river basins. The paper then uses three indirect evaluation methods [Three Cornered Hat (TCH), Arithmetic Average (AA), and Bayesian Three Cornered Hat] to identify the optimal ET products without the need of prior information, and to generate fusion products combining the ET from multiple products. Using the evaluation results derived from the WB method as the reference, the results show that the three methods have great success in identifying poorer products, suggesting that they are useful in filtering poor ET products in applications. However, the ability of such methods in identifying better ET products degrades slightly. The AA fusion product, which combines ET outputs from multiple products, is marginally better than the best single ET product in many of the 43 basins. Because of its simplicity, it could be used to reduce the uncertainty in ET estimates from multiple products for ungauged basins and regions.

AB  - "Justify, do not punish, but call evil evil", F.M. Dostoevsky urged. Novels and journalism of Dostoevsky are a kind of a genealogy of evil. In the Bible, the ability to distinguish between Good and evil and, as a consequence, the ability to feel shame, mark the birth of consciousness and the beginning of human history. With the recognition of evil, according to Dostoevsky, the movement towards Good begins, the path of salvation of the soul.As the Christian Dostoevsky recognized the metaphysical origins of evil in human being. As a psychologist and thinker, Dostoevsky is focused on the study of what is available for observation and analysis. He discovers biological and social "mechanisms of evil" - the impulse to power inherent in man; contradictions between consciousness and unconscious movements of the soul; pathological fantasizing instead of real activity; dysfunctional family and others.Human being is between the ideal and the "beast". The ideal is absolute goodness embodied in the person of Jesus Christ. "The Beast" is the worst degree of human fall (failure), in which a person is worse than an animal, since he retains the ability to be conscious, does evil consciously. Between the two poles (poles of Good and evil) are the norm ("a decent person") and various forms of moral anomies. Dostoevsky uses folk and his own, original, definitions for various forms and degrees of immorality. These are "unfortunates", "criminals", "bezobrazniki" (literally "without-an-image-people"; in Russian word usage, in the worldview of Dostoevsky the words "bezobrazie", "bezobraznik(-i)" express a negative ethical assessment ("bad") through a negative aesthetic assessment ("ugly")).Dostoevsky applies the concept of "bezobrazniki" to the characteristic Russian types of falling away from the image of Christ: a man of passions, a drunkard, a reveller, a narcissist, an envious person, a fool, a liar, a buffoon/a holy fool, a philosopher/a God-fighter, a femme fatale/homme fatale (a seducer, a molester, a rapist), etc. All criminals are "bezobrazniki", but not all "bezobrazniki" ones are criminals. "Bezobrazniki" enjoy their own fall, while parading it in a false confession that replaces a genuine confession and active repentance.At the turn of cultural eras, Dostoevsky recognized the dramatic phenomenon of "the trying man" ("the yourself-and-others-testing-man"), determined to realize his desires and ideas, while sacrificing others, not himself. Dostoevsky contrasts such "the trying man" with the Christian image of a saint or a righteous person who transforms society through the transformation of himself. Both have consciousness and self-consciousness, both act in this world at their own peril and risk. Holiness is an exceptional phenomenon; egocentrism is a widespread phenomenon and thus affirms itself as a norm that threatens humanity and humanism.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Surface and Subsurface Soil Organic Carbon in Tidal Wetlands: A Review and Ideas for Future Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Tidal wetlands, widely considered the most extensive reservoir of soil organic carbon (SOC), can benefit from remote sensing studies enabling spatiotemporal estimation and mapping of SOC stock. We found that a majority of the remote-sensing-based SOC mapping efforts have been focused on upland ecosystems, not on tidal wetlands. We present a comprehensive review detailing the types of remote sensing models and methods used, standard input variables, results, and limitations for the handful of studies on tidal wetland SOC. Based on that synthesis, we pose several unexplored research questions and methods that are critical for moving tidal wetland SOC science forward. Among these, the applicability of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting surface SOC and the modeling requirements for SOC in subsurface soils (soils without a remote sensing signal, i.e., a soil depth greater than 5 cm) are the most important. We did not find any remote sensing study aimed at modeling subsurface SOC in tidal wetlands. Since tidal wetlands store a significant amount of SOC at greater depths, we hypothesized that surface SOC could be an important covariable along with other biophysical and climate variables for predicting subsurface SOC. Preliminary results using field data from tidal wetlands in the southeastern United States and machine learning model output from mangrove ecosystems in India revealed a strong nonlinear but significant relationship (r(2) = 0.68 and 0.20, respectively, p < 2.2 x 10(-16) for both) between surface and subsurface SOC at different depths. We investigated the applicability of the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) for tidal wetlands by comparing the data with SOC data from the Smithsonian's Coastal Blue Carbon Network collected during the same decade and found that the SSURGO data consistently over-reported SOC stock in tidal wetlands. We concluded that a novel machine learning framework that utilizes remote sensing data and derived products, the standard covariables reported in the limited literature, and more importantly, other new and potentially informative covariables specific to tidal wetlands such as tidal inundation frequency and height, vegetation species, and soil algal biomass could improve remote-sensing-based tidal wetland SOC studies.

T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Martian caves have revived interest in the field of subsurface exploration because they are the potential destinations for future human habitats and astrobiological research. There are many pits on Mars, but some of them look like collapsed cave roofs. These special pits are formed by the collapse of surface materials into the subsurface void spaces. The signature of life is probable in a subsurface cave on Mars as the subsurface environment can protect life from the harsh and dangerous radiation environment of the surface. In a cave, there may be an abundance of minerals, fluids, and other key resources. Therefore, locating the access point of the subsurface cave is essential and crucial for formulating plans for robotic/human explorations of the Red Planet, Mars. We have used remote sensing data from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO; NASA), Mars Global Surveyor (MGS; NASA), and Mars Odyssey (NASA) for identifying, mapping, and classifying selected special pit candidates on the flank of Elysium Mons, Mars. A total of 32 special pit candidates has been identified and classified based upon morphology and geological context. Out of these, 26 are newly discovered ones. The thermal behavior of 23 special pit candidates confirms that the special pits are radiating heat energy at nighttime, similar to potential caves. Also, cave entrances have been detected in nine candidates using data from the HiRISE camera onboard MRO. These sites could be important destinations for future robotic/human exploration and the search for life on Mars.

TI  - Large Methane Emission Fluxes Observed From Tropical Wetlands in Zambia
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 84 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 20-year period. Atmospheric CH4 concentrations have been rising since the nineteenth century but the cause of large increases post-2007 is disputed. Tropical wetlands are thought to account for similar to 20% of global CH4 emissions, but African tropical wetlands are understudied and their contribution is uncertain. In this work, we use the first airborne measurements of CH4 sampled over three wetland areas in Zambia to derive emission fluxes. Three independent approaches to flux quantification from airborne measurements were used: Airborne mass balance, airborne eddy-covariance, and an atmospheric inversion. Measured emissions (ranging from 5 to 28 mg m(-2) hr(-1)) were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those simulated by land surface models (ranging from 0.6 to 3.9 mg m(-2) hr(-1)), suggesting much greater emissions from tropical wetlands than currently accounted for. The prevalence of such underestimated CH4 sources may necessitate additional reductions in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to keep global warming below a threshold of 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels.

TI  - An Evaluation of Two Decades of Aerosol Optical Depth Retrievals from MODIS over Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over Australia covering the period 2001-2020. We focus on retrievals from the Deep Blue (DB) and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithms, showing how these compare to one another in time and space. We further employ speciated AOD estimates from Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalyses to help diagnose aerosol types and hence sources. Considering Australia as a whole, monthly mean AODs show similar temporal behaviour, with a well-defined seasonal peak in the Austral summer. However, excepting periods of intense biomass burning activity, MAIAC values are systematically higher than their DB counterparts by, on average, 50%. Decomposing into seasonal maps, the patterns of behaviour show distinct differences, with DB showing a larger dynamic range in AOD, with markedly higher AODs (Delta AOD similar to 0.1) in northern and southeastern regions during Austral winter and summer. This is counter-balanced by typically smaller DB values across the Australian interior. Site level comparisons with all available level 2 AOD data from Australian Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites operational during the study period show that MAIAC tends to marginally outperform DB in terms of correlation (R-MAIAC = 0.71, RDB = 0.65) and root-mean-square error (RMSEMAIAC = 0.065, RMSEDB = 0.072). To probe this behaviour further, we classify the sites according to the predominant surface type within a 25 km radius. This analysis shows that MAIAC's advantage is retained across all surface types for R and all but one for RMSE. For this surface type (Bare, comprising just 1.2% of Australia) the performance of both algorithms is relatively poor, (R-MAIAC = 0.403, R-DB = 0.332).

TI  - Detection of Aquatic Alligator Weed (<i>Alternanthera philoxeroides</i>) from Aerial Imagery Using Random Forest Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb) forms dense infestations in aquatic environments and is the focus of intensive management programs in many jurisdictions within Australia, including Victoria. A critical component of weed biosecurity programs is surveillance to find the location and extent of the target weed so that control strategies can be implemented. Current approaches within Victoria rely heavily on ground surveys and community reporting. However, these methods do not provide a systematic approach to surveillance across landscapes, resulting in undiscovered infestations. The aim of this study was to detect alligator weed from aerial photography and demonstrate the potential use of remote sensing data to support existing ground surveys and monitoring programs. Two random forest algorithms were trained based on data from 2010 and 2016. Both classifiers had high levels of accuracy, with an overall pixel-based classification accuracy of 96.8% in 2010 and 98.2% in 2016. The trained classifiers were then applied to imagery acquired annually between 2010 and 2016. The classification outputs were combined with class probability and water proximity data to produce a weighted, normalised alligator weed likelihood data layer. These datasets were evaluated by assessing alligator weed patch detection rates, using manually delineated areas of weed for each year. The patch detection rates for each year ranged from 76.5% to 100%. The results also demonstrate the use of this approach for monitoring alligator weed infestations at a site over time. The key outcome of the study is an approach to support existing biosecurity monitoring and surveillance efforts at a landscape scale and at known infested localised sites.

TI  - Water Body Mapping Using Long Time Series Sentinel-1 SAR Data in Poyang Lake
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping water bodies with a high accuracy is necessary for water resource assessment, and mapping them rapidly is necessary for flood monitoring. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, and its wetland is one of the most important in the world. Poyang Lake is affected by floods from the Yangtze River basin every year, and the fluctuation of the water area and water level directly or indirectly affects the ecological environment of Poyang Lake. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is particularly suitable for large-scale water body mapping, as SAR allows data acquisition regardless of illumination and weather conditions. The two-satellite Sentinel-1 constellation, providing C-Band SAR data, passes over the Poyang Lake about five times a month. With its high temporal-spatial resolution, the Sentinel-1 SAR data can be used to accurately monitor the water body. After acquiring all the Sentinel-1 (1A and 1B) SAR data, to ensure the consistency of data processing, we propose the use of a Python and SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP)-based engine (SARProcMod) to process the data and construct a Poyang Lake Sentinel-1 SAR dataset with a 10 m resolution. To extract water body information from Sentinel-1 SAR data, we propose an automatic classification engine based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network (WaterUNet), which classifies all data using artificial sample datasets with a high validation accuracy. The results show that the maximum and minimum water areas in our study area were 2714.08 km(2) on 20 July 2020, and 634.44 km(2) on 4 January 2020. Compared to the water level data from the Poyang gauging station, the water area was highly correlated with the water level, with the correlation coefficient being up to 0.92 and the R-2 from quadratic polynomial fitting up to 0.88; thus, the resulting relationship results can be used to estimate the water area or water level of Poyang Lake. According to the results, we can conclude that Sentinel-1 SAR and WaterUNet are very suitable for water body monitoring as well as emergency flood mapping.

TI  - Pseudo-Random Spread Spectrum Technique Based Single-Pixel Imaging Method
T2  - IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing interest in autonomous transport, machine vision and remote sensing, several three-dimensional time-of-flight (ToF) imaging technologies that can recover object's fine details have been presented. Single-pixel imaging provides an alternative to ToF photon-counting imaging with a scanned laser spot. In this work, we present a pseudo-random spread spectrum technique based single-pixel ToF imaging method, which can avoid the range ambiguity, broaden the range of signal frequencies. In addition, the Quadratic Correlation Reconstruction algorithm is applied to further increase the accuracy. With environmental light and system noise, compared to the conventional ToF single-pixel lidar we demonstrate that this approach enhances scene reconstruction quality with depth accuracy improvements of 10.5. This method may open a new gate for improved non-scanning lidar systems.

TI  - Improving Wheat Yield Prediction Accuracy Using LSTM-RF Framework Based on UAV Thermal Infrared and Multispectral Imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield prediction is of great significance in agricultural production. Remote sensing technology based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers the capacity of non-intrusive crop yield prediction with low cost and high throughput. In this study, a winter wheat field experiment with three levels of irrigation (T1 = 240 mm, T2 = 190 mm, T3 = 145 mm) was conducted in Henan province. Multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy water stress indices (CWSI) were obtained using an UAV equipped with multispectral and thermal infrared cameras. A framework combining a long short-term memory neural network and random forest (LSTM-RF) was proposed for predicting wheat yield using VIs and CWSI from multi-growth stages as predictors. Validation results showed that the R-2 of 0.61 and the RMSE value of 878.98 kg/ha was achieved in predicting grain yield using LSTM. LSTM-RF model obtained better prediction results compared to the LSTM with R-2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 684.1 kg/ha, which is equivalent to a 22% reduction in RMSE. The results showed that LSTM-RF considered both the time-series characteristics of the winter wheat growth process and the non-linear characteristics between remote sensing data and crop yield data, providing an alternative for accurate yield prediction in modern agricultural management.

TI  - A bi-directional strategy to detect land use function change using time-series Landsat imagery on Google Earth Engine: A case study of Huangshui River Basin in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Constructed land, cropland, and ecological land are undergoing intense competition in many rapidly-developing regions. One of the major reasons to cause frequent land use (LU) conversions is the policy dynamics. The detection of such conversions is thus a prerequisite to understanding urban dynamics and how policies shape landscapes. This paper presents a bi-directional strategy to detect the LU change of the Huangshui River Basin of China from 1987 to 2018 using time-series Landsat imagery. We first initialized classification and optimization of remote sensing images using the Random Forest algorithm; We then detected bi-directional spatio-temporal changes based on the distribution probability of land-cover types. Our results reveal complicated dynamics underlying the net increase in urban and built-up land (UB) and the net decrease in cropland. In this area, due to the implementation of ecological compensation projects such as ecological migration and mine restoration, we found that on average 5.52 km2 of UB was converted into ecological land (forest, grassland and shrubland) every year, even though UB has expanded 3.6 times in the last 30 years with multiple conversions for cropland and ecological land. Meanwhile, 60% of lost cropland was converted to shrubland and grassland, and 40% was converted to UB. The accuracy of LU classification increases by 6.03% from 88.17%, and kappa coefficient increases by 2.41% from 85.16, compared to the existing initial results and uni-directional detection method. This study highlights the importance of the use of an effective remote sensing-based strategy for monitoring high frequency LU changes in watershed areas with complicated human-nature interactions.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper suggests new interpretations of the final "Trefoils" from the poetic book of I. F. Annensky "Cypress Chest". The author emphasizes that the issue of selfawareness of a contemporary and, accordingly, the task of comprehending the origins of the tragic worldview of human culture of the late 19 - early 20 century is a structureforming in the final work of Annensky. This work does not touch upon the contents and composition of the book published after the death of the poet, but proposes a general concept of the interpretation of "Trefoils" and - in general terms - the entire "Cypress Chest", in lyrical form generalizing the cultural, sociological and philosophical reflections of the author, appearing as a deep intellectual and sensitive symbolist lyricist. To capture the multifaceted and rationally verified accuracy of Annensky's lyrical works, combined on the principle of including them in large cycles ("Trefoils", "Folders", "Marked Sheets") and mini-cycles (three and two poems each), is possible involving the artist's entire heritage. Interpreting motifs and individual images that gain additional meaning at each new level of the book's structure, and within the framework of a separate poem sound self-sufficient and full-fledged, is necessary primarily in the context of literary criticism of Annensky and his works in terms of the study of antiquity. The confessionality of the poet's tragic lyrics lies in. complex representation of the inner world of a man of culture at the turn of the century, who conquered the spiritual peaks of the world of "ideas", but lost direct perception of the world of "ideas", without which love, beauty and virtue born in torment become conditional categories.

TI  - An Improved Sea-Ice Velocity Retrieval Algorithm Based on 89 GHz Brightness Temperature Satellite Data in the Fram Strait
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fram Strait is the passageway where most drifting sea ice exits the Arctic Ocean into the North Atlantic, and the sea-ice velocity (SW) is the most critical parameter for the variability of the sea ice area flux through Fram Strait. Sea ice flux estimates through the Fram Strait based on satellite remote sensing exist. However, they show discrepancies, which mainly result from the sparse valid satellite observations and the increased uncertainty of sea ice motion in the Fram Strait. In order to improve the sea ice flux estimates, we develop an improved sea-ice velocity retrieval algorithm from 89 GHz brightness temperature fields of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS and AMSR2. The improved retrieval algorithm employs an adjusted size of the template window and performs bilinear interpolation on candidate windows before the matching procedure. Instead of depending on external data sources, we construct the SIV uncertainty fields depending only on the maximum correlation coefficients of the image itself. Compared with two similar Passive Microwave (PM) sea ice velocity datasets, the new sea-ice velocity has lower bias and root-meansquare error with respect to buoy observations. In addition, the data density of the new SIV is 14% and 36% higher than the two reference datasets, respectively. Monthly sea ice area flux estimates through the Fram Strait are acquired with the new daily sea-ice velocity data and the existed sea-ice concentration. And it indicates that the improved sea ice area flux estimated by PM sea ice velocity agrees well with the Synthetic-aperture radar-derived sea ice area flux.Plain Language Summary The sea ice outflux through the Fram Strait is critical for the mass balance of Arctic sea ice cover. However, previous studies tend to underestimate ice flux based on satellite data sets due to the weaker southward ice velocity with respect to buoy measurements. In order to acquire the accurate ice velocity in the Fram Strait to improve the ice flux estimates, we improve a pattern-tracking sea ice retrieval algorithm derived from 89 GHz brightness temperature in the Fram Strait. Besides, we acquire the uncertainties with spatiotemporal variability of ice velocity based on the pattern features rather than any external data sources. This improved sea ice velocity data set will be helpful to future studies on data assimilation and model improvements.

TI  - Evaluation of Food Security Based on Remote Sensing Data-Taking Egypt as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Egypt, a country with a harsh natural environment and rapid population growth, is facing difficulty in ensuring its national food security. A novel model developed for assessing food security in Egypt, which applies remote sensing techniques, is presented. By extracting the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) mean texture features from Sentinel-1 and Landsat-7 images, the arable land used to grow grain crops was first classified and extracted using a support vector machine. In terms of the classified results, meteorological data, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model was adopted to compute the annual net primary production (NPP). Then, the NPP yield conversion formula was used to forecast the annual grain yield. Finally, a method for evaluating food security, which involves four dimensions, i.e., quantity security, economic security, quality security, and resource security, was established to evaluate food security in Egypt in 2010, 2015, and 2020. Based on the proposed model, a classification accuracy of the crop distribution map, which is above 82%, can be achieved. Moreover, the reliability of yield estimation is verified compared to the result estimated using statistics data provided by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our evaluation results show that food security in Egypt is declining, the quantity and quality security show large fluctuations, and economic and resource security are relatively stable. This model can satisfy the requirements for estimating grain yield at a wide scale and evaluating food security on a national level. It can be used to provide useful suggestions for governments regarding improving food security.

TI  - Fusing or filling: Which strategy can better reconstruct high-quality fine-resolution satellite time series?
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality fine-resolution satellite time series data are important for monitoring land surface dynamics in heterogeneous areas. However, the quality of raw satellite time series is affected by clouds and the revisit frequency. Currently, there are two major strategies to reconstruct high-quality fine-resolution time series: the interpolation of the missing pixels using auxiliary data from the same satellite (known as filling) and the fusion of fine-resolution and coarse-resolution images (known as fusing). These two strategies use different principles and input data to reach the same goal, but which one is superior in different scenarios is not known. Therefore, this study fills this research gap by comparing two representative methods from filling and fusing: the Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI) for filling and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) for fusing. The potential factors affecting the accuracy of the two methods were investigated using two simulated experiments. The results show that (1) the accuracy of both methods decreases with the time interval between the image to be reconstructed and the auxiliary image; (2) NSPI is generally better than FSDAF for reconstructing images with small cloud patches but this superiority is insignificant in homogeneous areas; (3) the accuracy of NSPI significantly decreases with cloud size, and NSPI is worse than FSDAF for reconstructing images with large clouds; and (4) the performance of FSDAF is significantly affected by the scale difference between the fine- and coarseresolution images, especially for heterogeneous areas. The findings of this study can help users select the appropriate method to reconstruct satellite time series for their specific applications.

TI  - Effects of Aerosols on Gross Primary Production from Ecosystems to the Globe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols affect the gross primary productivity (GPP) of plants by absorbing and scattering solar radiation. However, it is still an open question whether and to what extent the effects of aerosol on the diffuse fraction (D-f) can enhance GPP globally. We quantified the aerosol diffuse fertilization effect (DFE) and incorporated it into a light use efficiency (LUE) model, EC-LUE. The new model is driven by aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and is referred to as AOD-LUE. The eddy correlation variance (EC) of the FLUXNET2015 dataset was used to calibrate and validate the model. The results showed that the newly developed AOD-LUE model improved the performance in simulating GPP across all ecosystem types (R-2 from 0.6 to 0.68), with the highest performance for mixed forest (average R-2 from 0.71 to 0.77) and evergreen broadleaf forest (average R-2 from 0.34 to 0.45). The maximum LUE of diffuse photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) (3.61 g C m(-2) MJ(-1)) was larger than that of direct PAR (1.68 g C m(-2) MJ(-1)) through parameter optimization, indicating that the aerosol DFE seriously affects the estimation of GPP, and the separation of diffuse PAR and direct PAR in the GPP model is necessary. In addition, we used AOD-LUE to quantify the impact of aerosol on GPP. Specifically, aerosols impaired GPP in closed shrub (CSH) by 6.45% but enhanced the GPP of grassland (GRA) and deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) by 3.19% and 2.63%, respectively. Our study stresses the importance of understanding aerosol-radiation interactions and incorporating aerosol effects into regional and global GPP models.

TI  - Potential Variation of Evapotranspiration Induced by Typical Vegetation Changes in Northwest China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), as a key eco-hydrological parameter, plays an important role in understanding sustainable ecosystem development. Each plant category has a unique functional trait on transpiration and photosynthesis, with ET implying that water cycle and energy transformation is linked with vegetation type. Changes in surface vegetation directly alter biophysical land surface properties, hence affecting energy and ET transfer. With the rapid increase in land surface changes, there is a need to further understand and quantify the effects of vegetation change on ET, especially over the vulnerable water-cycle region in the arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China. We adopted the GlobalLand30 land cover and MOD16A2 in 2010 and 2020 to investigate, discuss the spatio-temporal characteristics of annual and seasonal ET of cultivated land, grassland, and forests in Northwest China, and quantify the impact on vegetation changes with absolute and relative changes from different climatic subecoregions on ET. Our results show the following: (1) Forest ET was generally the highest at 688 mm, followed by cultivated land and grassland with 200-400 mm in arid climatic subecoregions. (2) Returning cultivated land to forests and cultivated land expansion potentially enhances ET by 90-110 mm/10a, with the relative rate of change increasing by 22.1% and 45.8%, respectively, away from unchanged vegetation within identical subecoregions. (3) The ET of most investigated areas gains the highest value in summer, followed by spring, autumn, and winter. This study provides reference for sustainable ecosystem development and the reasonable utilization of limited water resources in Northwest China.

T2  - Radiology case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - This is a case of locally recurrent invasive secretory carcinoma of the breast during pregnancy, detected as a palpable mass in the reconstructed right breast of a 32-year-old female at 24 weeks gestation. The patient was initially diagnosed with secretory carcinoma 8 years prior, for which she underwent nipple sparing mastectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Due to pregnancy, the recurrence was treated initially with conservative excision alone, followed by definitive management postpartum which included wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant chest wall radiation. Secretory carcinoma of the breast is a rare cancer with a predilection for young age and indolent course. This case report describes an unusual case of recurrent secretory carcinoma, of interest due to both its diagnosis during pregnancy, and its recurrence after nipple sparing mastectomy.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although global climate change is receiving considerable attention, the loss of biodiversity worldwide continues. In this study, dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) change in the Paraguai/Jauquara Basin, Mato Grosso, Brazil, were investigated. Two analyses were performed using R software. The first was a comparative study of LULC among the LULC classes at the polygon scale, and the second was a spatio-temporal analysis of moving polygons restricted to the agricultural regions in terms of topology, size, distance, and direction of change. The data consisted of Landsat images captured in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2016 and processed using ArcGIS software. The proposed analytical approach handled complex data structures and allowed for a deeper understanding of LULC change over time. The results showed that there was a statistically significant change from regions of natural vegetation to pastures, agricultural regions, and land for other uses, accompanied by a significant trend of expansion of agricultural regions, appearing to stabilize from 2005. Furthermore, different patterns of LULC change were found according to soil type and elevation. In particular, the purple latosol soil type presented the highest expansion indexes since 2001, and the elevated agricultural areas have been expanding and/or stabilizing since 1997.

TI  - Shifts in Salt Marsh Vegetation Landcover after Debris Flow Deposition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 9 January 2018, Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve received a large quantity of sediment following debris flows in Montecito, California. Because disturbances potentially impact the ecosystem services and functions that wetlands provide, an understanding of how the ecosystem responded to the debris flows is important for the management of salt marsh systems. However, a lack of field data before and after this disturbance makes this task impossible to complete by field methods alone. To address this gap, we used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to calculate landcover fractions and spectral indices to produce maps of landcover before, during, and after the debris flow using a random forest classifier. Change detection showed that vegetation extent in November 2020 approached pre-debris flow conditions. While total vegetated area experienced little net change (0.15% decrease), there was a measurable change in the areal extent of vegetation type, with high marsh vegetation transitioning to mid marsh vegetation in regions that initially showed an increase in bare soil cover. These results are uniquely quantifiable using remote sensing techniques and show that disturbance due to debris flows may affect ecosystem function via plant community change. These impacts will need to be taken into consideration when managing wetlands prone to depositional events.

TI  - Curonian Spit Coastal Dunes Landscape: Climate Driven Change Calls for the Management Optimization
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - On the Curonian Spit, the leading conservation issue is an opposition between the two contrasting nature-management principles-anthropocentricity and biocentricity. Land managers still waver between the two options, and the worst-case scenario materializes as a rapid proliferation of vegetation to the accumulative sandplain (palve). It results in the decline of sand drift to the mobile dunes. This article aims to examine how climate change affects the coastal dune landscape and to identify current dune protection and management priorities. The analysis of hydroclimatic changes; succession patterns in forest, herbaceous, and open-sand ecosystems; and phenological-based evaluation (NDVI from MODIS, 2000-2020), influencing possible management directions, were carried out in this study. The results show the significant hydro-climatic changes (air temperature, precipitation, and sea level) occurring over the last thirty years. They influence the prevailing overgrowth trends in recent decades, especially in herbaceous ecosystems. Therefore, if the EU's priority habitat-open-sand ecosystems-is to be preserved, the main policy recommendation is to apply adequate management tools such as grazing, and to pay more attention to the aesthetic ecosystem services of the mobile dunes parallel to biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Detecting Water Hyacinth Infestation in Kuttanad, India, Using Dual-Pol Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes, also known as Eichhornia crassipes) is a highly invasive aquatic macrophyte species, indigenous to Amazonia, Brazil and tropical South America. It was introduced to India in 1896 and has now become an environmental and social challenge throughout the country in community ponds, freshwater lakes, irrigation channels, rivers and most other surface waterbodies. Considering its large speed of propagation on the water surface under conducive conditions and the adverse impact the infesting weed has, constant monitoring is needed to aid civic bodies, governments and policy makers involved in remedial measures. The synoptic coverage provided by satellite imaging and other remote sensing practices make it convenient to find a solution using this type of data. While there is an established background for the practice of remote sensing in the detection of aquatic plants, the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has yet to be fully exploited in the detection of water hyacinth. This research focusses on detecting water hyacinth within Vembanad Lake, Kuttanad, India. Here, results show that the monitoring of water hyacinth has proven to be possible using Sentinel-1 SAR data. A quantitative analysis of detection performance is presented using traditional and state-of-the-art change detectors. Analysis of these more powerful detectors showed true positive detection ratings of similar to 95% with 0.1% false alarm, showing significantly greater positive detection ratings when compared to the more traditional detectors. We are therefore confident that water hyacinth can be monitored using SAR data provided the extent of the infestation is significantly larger than the resolution cell (bigger than a quarter of a hectare).

TI  - Multi-Spot Tracking System for Free-Space Optical Communication
T2  - RADIOENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes a multi-spot tracking system for free space optic communications systems suitable for tracking optical terminals observed within the field-of-view of a wide angle telescope. The article explains the conversion of the terminal position to the position in the plane of the tracking sensor and the subsequent recognition and tracking of terminals. In the first part of the article camera image processing is described. Then, basic projection of optical terminal into the tracking sensor plane (into the active surface of a camera) is expressed by using geometry and matrix optics. Afterwards, the angle resolution of optical terminal in plane of the receiver is obtained by using the Airy disk approximation. The basic projection is then extended to the calculation of the Earth-satellite system followed by spot tracking, where method for determining the optical terminal and the state machine is explained.

TI  - Neuropsychological Approach in the Study of Linguistic Phenomena in the Context of the Study of the Conceptual Sphere of People's Morality
T2  - BRAIN-BROAD RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The research focuses on the study of speech phenomena developed in the context of the conceptual sphere as an effective approach to the use of neuropsychology. Neuropsychology considers the acquisition of new knowledge on human perception and processing of new information as a separate mental process. This paper studies the formation of linguistic phenomena in the context of the cultural development of man, which in the course of evolutionary-historical process has created distinctive linguistic-ethnic linguistic images. The linguistic identity of man is created in the representation of man and is represented by a set of concepts, i.e. it is a conceptual sphere. The current state of the humanities has led to the relevance of ethno linguistic studies, which present the results of studies of the reflection in the national consciousness of extra linguistic phenomena that form the basis for a holistic worldview and function as concepts. The latter are cultural, mental and linguistic phenomena that are integral mental-linguistic constructs, but can be studied for each of the components, including language. Cognitive experience, which can be identified and analyzed in language phenomena, is a verbalized (fixed to a bilateral linguistic unit) reflection of sensual and rational experiences of an individual (group, society, ethnicity) of a number of events, impressions, often located in speech - in dialect, literary language, the carrier of which he is). General scientific and special linguistic methods will ensure the complexity of the study of verbalizers of the concepts of folk morality.

TI  - PREDICTIVE ECOSYSTEM MAPPING AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS FOR THE MOUNTAIN FOREST-STEPPE OF WEST ALTAI
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Predictive ecosystem mapping is the basic tool for the conservation of biodiversity and its spatial structure analyses. This paper presents an ecosystem mapping approach that connected remote sensing data (SRTM, Landsat) and soil (at 92 points) and vegetation (at 64 points) description for the key site located at Tigirek nature reserve (West Altai). The linear discriminant analysis with stepwise selection of predictors (more than 60 morphometric parameters and spectral indices) is used to modeling of the vegetation and soil spatial structure. The topography classification is based on exposition and slope steepness. The ecosystem map is compiled through an overlay of soil, vegetation, and relief maps and contains 38 units. The altitude, slope, and reflection (Landsat 5, October 2011) are the main factors that determine the soil cover spatial structure; the user's accuracy of the model is 64 %. Greyzemic Chernozems (100 %), Gleyic Cambisols (92 %), and Rendzic Leptosols (89 %) have the best quality of discrimination. Altitude and 3 spectral parameters (wetness, brightness, EVI) determine the vegetation spatial structure; the user's accuracy of the model is 73 %. The dominance of mesophilic meadows and shrub communities, and also small-leaf and light coniferous forests reflects the regional features of Altai forest-steppe ecosystems. Shrub communities with Caragana arborescens in combination with Gleyic Chernozems and Gleyic Cambisols on different slopes are predominant ecosystems in the key area. The area of meadows with Dactylis glomerata and Bromus squarrosus, formed mainly on Chernic Phaeozems and Gleyic Chernozems, Cambisols, Rendzic Leptosols, and Novic Retisols on uplands and slopes of different exposure, are the second and third on the key site. The analysis of components of ecosystems characterizes the limited opportunities of indication of soils by vegetation due to only a few vegetation communities have strong confinement to soils (the area of such vegetation is about 10 % of the key site).

TI  - The failure of a sentinel node biopsy due to an absence of nodal uptake of nuclear isotope in consecutive melanomas in a single patient - a physiological aberration
T2  - JPRAS OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Nodal metastasis is an independent prognostic factor in patients with melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) is a recommended component of the management of patients with AJCC stage T1b or above. The dermal scar is injected with a Technetium99 m (99M Tc) Nanocolloid, a radiotracer that drains into sentinel nodes to be identified on a preoperative SPECT/CT scan. Intraoperatively the sentinel nodes are located using a gamma probe and patent blue dye. A 79-year-old male was referred to the Plastics Outpatient Department for management of a biopsy proven pT4b melanoma on the right flank and a suspicious lesion on the right shoulder. He was scheduled for a SNB and wide local excision of the flank melanoma and excisional biopsy of the shoulder lesion. He received injections of 99M Tc Nanocolloid around the flank biopsy scar, however, preoperative, and intraoperative attempts to locate a node using radiological and surgical techniques were unsuccessful. The biopsy of the shoulder lesion sent for histopathology revealed a pT1b melanoma. A subsequent second SNB on the shoulder melanoma was unsuccessful, as 99MTc Nanocolloid failed to drain into a sentinel node for a second time. The drainage function of lymphatic vessels declines with age however the complete failure of nodal uptake is exceptionally rare. Novel radiotracers such as 99MTc Tilmanocept have shown superior lymph node tracking in recent tracers.(c) 2022TheAuthors.

TI  - Estimating Canopy-Scale Evapotranspiration from Localized Sap Flow Measurements
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The results reported in this work are based in part on measurements of sap flow in a few select trees on a representative riparian forest plot coupled with a forest-wide randomized sampling of tree sapwood area in a watershed located along the Pacific coast in Santa Cruz County, California. These measurements were upscaled to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) across the forest and to quantify groundwater usage by dominant phreatophyte vegetation. Canopy cover in the study area is dominated by red alder (Alnus rubra) and arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), deciduous phreatophyte trees from which a small sample was selected for instrumentation with sap flow sensors on a single forest plot. These localized sap flow measurements were then upscaled to the entire riparian forest to estimate forest ET using data from a survey of sapwood area on six plots scattered randomly across the entire forest. The estimated canopy-scale ET was compared to reference ET and NDVI based estimates. The results show positive correlation between sap flow based estimates and those of the other two methods, though over the winter months, sap flow-based ET values were found to significantly underestimate ET as predicted by the other two methods. The results illustrate the importance of ground-based measurements of sap flow for calibrating satellite based methods and for providing site-specific estimates and to better characterize the ET forcing in groundwater flow models.

TI  - Introducing Two Fixed Platforms in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea Supporting Long-Term Satellite Ocean Color Validation: Preliminary Data and Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) network scheme and instrument deployment protocols, two fixed platforms (Muping and Dong'ou) in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea were implemented with the support of the China National Satellite Ocean Application Service. Optical radiometry instruments were established at the two sites to autonomously determine remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and aerosol optical depth (AOD). Details about location selection, platform design, instrument deployment, and the associated data processing procedure are reported in this study. R-rs and AOD measured by independent instruments at the Muping site were compared and results showed that they were consistent, with a median relative percentage difference (MRPD) < 0.6% for AOD and R-rs. The spectral feature and temporal pattern of R-rs and AOD at the two sites were examined and compared with data from 14 AERONET-OC sites. R-rs and AOD data measured at the two sites were used to evaluate ocean color operational products of MODIS/Aqua (MODISA), OLCI/Sentinel-3A (OLCI-3A), and OLCI/Sentinel-3B (OLCI-3B). Comparison showed that the three satellite sensor-derived R-rs agreed well with in situ measurements, with an MRPD < 25% for MODISA, <30% for OLCI-3A, and <40% for OLCI-3B, respectively. Large uncertainties were observed in the blue bands for the three satellite sensors, particularly for OLCI-3B at 400 nm. AOD at 865 nm derived from the three satellite sensors also agreed well with in situ measurements, with an MRPD of 28.1% for MODISA, 30.6% for OLCI-3A, and 39.9% for OLCI-3B. Two commonly used atmospheric correction (AC) processors, the ACOLITE and SeaDAS, were also evaluated using in situ measurements at two sites and 20 m-resolution MSI/Sentinel-2A data. Close agreements were achieved for both AC processors, while the SeaDAS performed slightly better than ACOLITE. The optimal band selection in the AC models embedded in two AC processors was a combination of one near-infrared and one short-wave infrared band such as 865 and 1609 nm, shedding light on MSI data applications in the aquatic environment.

TI  - Inversion of Ocean Subsurface Temperature and Salinity Fields Based on Spatio-Temporal Correlation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean observation is essential for studying ocean dynamics, climate change, and carbon cycles. Due to the difficulty and high cost of in situ observations, existing ocean observations are inadequate, and satellite observations are mostly surface observations. Previous work has not adequately considered the spatio-temporal correlation within the ocean itself. This paper proposes a new method-convolutional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM)-for the inversion of the ocean subsurface temperature and salinity fields with the sea surface satellite observations (sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, sea surface height, and sea surface wind) and subsurface Argo reanalyze data. Given the time dependence and spatial correlation of the ocean dynamic parameters, the ConvLSTM model can improve inversion models' robustness and generalizability by considering ocean variability's significant spatial and temporal correlation characteristics. Taking the 2018 results as an example, our average inversion results in an overall normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.0568 degrees C/0.0027 PSS and a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9819/0.9997 for subsurface temperature (ST)/subsurface salinity (SS). The results show that SSTA, SSSA SSHA, and SSWA together are valuable parameters for obtaining accurate ST/SS estimates, and the use of multiple channels in shallow seas is effective. This study demonstrates that ConvLSTM is superior in modeling the subsurface temperature and salinity fields, fully taking global ocean data's spatial and temporal correlation into account, and outperforms the classic random forest and LSTM approaches in predicting subsurface temperature and salinity fields.

TI  - Decrease in the Water Level of Lake Prespa (North Macedonia) Studied by Remote Sensing Methodology: Relation with Hydrology and Agriculture
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ohrid-Prespa lake system is the oldest and most diverse permanent lake system in Europe, dating from the Pliocene era and aged at over 4Ma. Its smaller component is Lake Macro Prespa (thereafter called Prespa), shared by North Macedonia, Albania, and Greece. Lake Prespa's depth was reported as 14 m mean and 48 m maximum before its major water level decline. The lake is highly sensitive to external impacts, including climate change, and has been suffering major water loss for decades. A lake-level decline of almost 10 m was documented between 1950 and 2009 due to restricted precipitation and increased water abstraction for irrigation. This study describes the changes in the surface size of Prespa Lake and the vegetation/land use in the surrounding area in the period 1984-2020 using satellite images (remote sensing, Landsat 5 & 8 images by United States Geological Survey). The lake lost 18.87 km(2) of surface in this period (6.9% of its size, dropping from 273.38 km 2 to 254.51 km(2)). Water loss was greater in the period 1987-1993 and 1998-2004. The Analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the area (app. 4950 km(2)) surrounding Lake Prespa revealed an increase in the mean NDVI values over the period studied (1984-2020), pointing to a general increase in vegetation. Areas with NDVI > 0.13 increased from 78% in 1984 to 86% in 2020, while those with the highest vegetation intensity (NDVI > 0.45) increased by 40%. These changes in vegetation may be related to the water loss of the lake.

TI  - Simultaneous streamwise and cross-stream oscillations of a diamond oscillator at low Reynolds numbers
T2  - PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A two-dimensional stabilized space-time finite-element-based in-house solver is used to explore flow around an elastically mounted rigid diamond oscillator undergoing undamped vortex-induced vibrations in transverse and stream-wise directions simultaneously. The computations are carried over a reduced velocity ( U*) range of 1-12 keeping the Reynolds number (Re) and the mass ratio (m*) fixed at 100 and 10, respectively. In the current investigation, a five-branch response behavior with the presence of an "upper branch " is identified, which is absent for transverse-only oscillations. A shift in normalized time-averaged phase difference (phi/ pi) from 0 to 1 is related to the transition from the upper to the lower branch. The non-dimensional oscillation frequencies in both streamwise and cross-stream directions (F-x and F-y, respectively) collapse on the upper branch, matching the oscillator's non-dimensional natural frequency (F-N). This leads to periodic single-looped "raindrop-shaped " cylinder trajectories. On this branch, the vortex-shedding mode is asymmetric, and the mean lift is non-zero (C-lavg &NOTEQUexpressionL; 0). For all other response branches, C-lavg asymptotic to 0 and the vortex-shedding modes are symmetric. The presence of multiple frequencies in the in-line oscillations makes the initial branch quasi-periodic, whereas all other response branches are periodic. The addition of in-line motion modifies the fluid loading on the oscillator significantly.

TI  - Development of a Dust Source Map for WRF-Chem Model Based on MODIS NDVI
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the development of a physically-based dust source map for the GOCART-AFWA dust module in WRF-Chem model. The new parameterization is based on MODIS-NDVI and an updated emission strength map is computed every 15 days from the latest satellite observations. Modeling simulations for the period April-May 2017 over the Mediterranean, north Africa, and the Middle East are compared with observations of AOD at 31 AERONET stations. The new module is capable of reproducing the dust sources at finer detail. The overall performance of the model is improved, especially for stronger dust episodes with AOD > 0.25. For this threshold the model BIAS decreases from -0.20 to -0.02, the RMSE from 0.38 to 0.30, the Correlation Coefficient improves from 0.21 to 0.47, the fractional gross error (FGE) from 0.62 to 0.40, and the mean fractional bias (MFB) from -0.49 to -0.08. Similar improvement is also found for the lower AOD thresholds (>0.0 and >0.1), especially for the stations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Sahel, the Middle East, and Arabian Peninsula, which are mostly affected by dust transport during the experimental period. An overprediction of AOD, compared to the original dust-source scheme, is found for some stations in the Sahara desert, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Iberian Peninsula. In total, 124 out of the 170 statistical scores that are calculated indicate improvement of model performance.

TI  - In Vivo Sentinel Lymph Node Detection with Indocyanine Green in Colorectal Cancer.
T2  - Maedica
M3  - Editorial
AB  - Introduction: The indocyanine green fluorescence imaging system allows the identification of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes and blood flow during surgery. Colorectal cancer is the second commonest cancer in women, the third in men, being the fourth commonest cause of cancer death. One of the most important factors for staging and prognosis in colorectal cancer is the involvement of the regional lymph nodes. In the literature, there are several methods for identifying sentinel lymph nodes, including methylene blue, technetium (99m Tc) and indocyanine green. The current article presents the use of indocyanate in the identification of sentinel node/nodes in malignant tumors of the colon, by a technique performed in vivo, before the primary ligation of the vascular pedicles. Material and methods:The study was prospectively conducted on a group of 23 patients who had undergone a standard surgical resection - 21 of them for a malignant tumor of the colon and two patients for a malignant rectal tumor - in the 1st General Surgery Department, Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania, between January 2020-March 2022. During surgery, sentinel lymph node detection was performed using indocyanine green and the Karl Storz Vitom ICG probe. Sentinel lymph nodes were separately excised and sent to the Department of Pathological Anatomy for analysis. Results:Sentinel nodes were successfully identified in 13 patients and the overall identification rate was 56.52% (13/23 cases). In seven cases, the number of invaded nodes was the same as that of identified and invaded sentinel nodes. Complete lymphadenectomy was performed in all cases regardless of the staining status of the sentinel lymph nodes. Conclusions:The use of fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green in colorectal cancer remains controversial. Since no specific receptor target is used, the fluorescent signal is not specific for lymph node metastases. The learning curve is particularly important for increasing the accuracy of the technique and is responsible for the negative results in some cases. Cases in which lymph nodes have not been invaded require further evaluation through immunohistochemistry and chain polymerization reaction (RT-PCR).

TI  - Analysis of Nitrogen Uptake in Winter Wheat Using Sensor and Satellite Data for Site-Specific Fertilization
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensor- and satellite-based determination of nitrogen uptake provides critical data in site-specific fertilization algorithms. Therefore, two basic noncontact measurement methods (sensor and satellite) were investigated in winter wheat, and their precision was evaluated in this study. Nitrogen uptake at four characteristic growth stages (BBCH 31, BBCH 39, BBCH 55, and BBCH 65) was determined using algorithms based on sensor and satellite data. As a reference, nitrogen uptake was determined using biomass samples in the laboratory (ground truth data). The precision of the tested methods was evaluated using statistical indicators (mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) and correlation analyses between the nitrogen uptake of the ground truth data and that of the respective method. The results showed moderate to strong correlations with the nitrogen uptake of the ground truth data for both methods (R-2 = 0.57-0.83). Both sensor and satellite data best represented nitrogen uptake in BBCH 39 and 55 (R-2 = 0.63-0.83). In sum, there were only slight deviations in the absolute amount of nitrogen uptake (<=+/- 15%). Clear deviations can be explained by external influences during measurement. Overall, the investigations showed that the nitrogen uptake could be appropriately determined as a data basis for site-specific fertilization systems using sensor and satellite data.

TI  - Ocean Wave Inversion Based on Hybrid Along- and Cross-Track Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hybrid interferometric synthetic aperture radar system is a combination of an along-track configuration and cross-track configuration. Based on linear ocean wave theory, an ocean wave inversion algorithm for a hybrid interferometric synthetic aperture radar system is proposed in this work. Using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar images acquired by the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites and the interferometric synthetic aperture radar images acquired by an airborne interferometric radar altimeter with a certain degree of squint, the profile of ocean waves and the corresponding orbital velocities were retrieved by combining the new inversion algorithm with the cross-spectra. Meanwhile, key parameters of ocean waves, such as the significant wave height, significant wave orbital velocity, propagation direction, and wavelength of the dominant waves, were also extracted from the ocean wave spectra retrieved in this study. In order to evaluate the reliability of the new inversion algorithm, the retrieved significant wave heights were compared with those provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and measured by a Global Navigation Satellite System buoy. The results showed that for the ocean waves retrieved from the spaceborne hybrid interferometric synthetic aperture radar images, the differences between the retrieved significant wave heights of the four subareas selected in this paper and those provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts were approximately 0.01, -0.17, -0.55, and -0.37 m, respectively, and for the ocean waves retrieved from the airborne interferometric radar altimeter images, the differences between the retrieved significant wave heights corresponding to the M920 and M3120 images used in this paper and those measured by the Global Navigation Satellite System buoy were approximately -0.05 and -0.09, respectively. Therefore, the method proposed in this work could retrieve the ocean wave spectra well when the velocity bunching had a small influence; however, as the nonlinear influence of the velocity bunching increased, the difference between the significant wave heights retrieved using this method and provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts also increased.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Salt Content and Organic Matter on Arable Land in the Yellow River Delta by Combining UAV Hyperspectral and Landsat-8 Multispectral Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and large-scale estimation of soil salt content (SSC) and organic matter (SOM) using multi-source remote sensing is of great significance for the real-time monitoring of arable land quality. In this study, we simultaneously predicted SSC and SOM on arable land in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), based on ground measurement data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imagery, and Landsat-8 multispectral imagery. The reflectance averaging method was used to resample UAV hyperspectra to simulate the Landsat-8 OLI data (referred to as fitted multispectra). Correlation analyses and the multiple regression method were used to construct SSC and SOM hyperspectral/fitted multispectral estimation models. Then, the best SSC and SOM fitted multispectral estimation models based on UAV images were applied to a reflectance-corrected Landsat-8 image, and SSC and SOM distributions were obtained for the YRD. The estimation results revealed that moderately salinized arable land accounted for the largest proportion of area in the YRD (48.44%), with the SOM of most arable land (60.31%) at medium or lower levels. A significant negative spatial correlation was detected between SSC and SOM in most regions. This study integrates the advantages of UAV hyperspectral and satellite multispectral data, thereby realizing rapid and accurate estimation of SSC and SOM for a large-scale area, which is of great significance for the targeted improvement of arable land in the YRD.

TI  - Analyzing the role of in situ coal fire in greenhouse gases emission in a coalfield using remote sensing data and their dispersion and source apportionment study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ coal fires significantly pollute the environment in many countries of the world. Monitoring these pollutants is challenging due to extensive area coverage and spatial variations. Thus, the present study demonstrates the method of deriving the spatial and temporal profiles of columnar density of three major greenhouse gases (carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) in an in situ coal fire region (Jharia coalfield (JCF), India) using high-resolution satellite data (TROPOMI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The study also demonstrates a new methodology for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from in situ coal burning. JCF is one of the significant polluted mining regions with multiple in situ coal fire pockets. The columnar density of the gaseous pollutants in the mining region was compared with the same in the rural, urban, and forest regions to identify the major emission inventories. The study results indicated that coal fire is the major source of CO emission in the region, as the CO was high in the fire regions compared to that of the non-fire regions. But, the major source of NO2 is the traffic, as the NO2 was high in the city area as compared to other regions. The spatial profile of SO2 does not reveal the specific emission sources. The study results indicated that TROPOMI onboard satellite sensors could be effectively used for deriving the spatial profiles of greenhouse gaseous in coal fire regions, which further assist in identifying the emission inventories. Furthermore, the satellite-based Earth observations offer information to understand and manage the greenhouse gas emissions over a large area.

TI  - NATURE-TRANSCENDENCE AND SELF-NATURE RELATIONS IN SANDOR WEORES'S POEMS
T2  - STUDIA UNIVERSITATIS BABES-BOLYAI PHILOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sandor Weores's poems flora and fauna are not only a decoration, serving as an allegorical/metaphorical background for the representation of the self s alienation and for the 20th century experience of a chaotic universe, but rather the reality of beings independent of subjective consciousness. This reality carries the already forgotten mysteries of the created world, and it definitely points towards a transcendent meaning, an ultimate goal. This paper examines how the specific relationship between self and nature can be associated with the peculiar worldview and the transcendental experiences of Weores's poetry.

TI  - Does the recent afforestation program in Ethiopia influenced vegetation cover and hydrology? A case study in the upper awash basin, Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ethiopian government planned afforestation programs in the past decades whereas more attention was given to tree plantation since the 2010 year. However, the effectiveness of the afforestation programs and its impacts on vegetation cover and hydrology has not been well studied. This study aims to assess the recent campaigned afforestation program and its impact on vegetation cover and hydrology in the upper Awash basin, Ethiopia. Landsat 8 images of 2013-2020 years were used to calculate the NDVI for the upper Awash basin to assess trends in vegetation greenness for the basin. Moreover, observed streamflow and precipitation datasets of the basin were collected and used for assessing the impact of the afforestation on hydrology. The study result showed decreasing NDVI values despite the afforestation programs in the upper Awash basin. This shows either afforestation rate was less than the deforestation rate or the tree plantation campaign was not effective in the basin. In addition, the campaign based tree plantation focused on the number of tree planted not on how many trees are grown. On the other hand, mean annual precipitation and streamflow were generally increased from 2013 to 2020 in the upper Awash basin. Declining NDVI values but increasing mean annual precipitation in the Awash basin indicated that the declining vegetation was attributed to anthropogenic effects. The increasing streamflow during the same time could be due to the increasing mean annual precipitation. Moreover, the decreasing vegetation cover might have contributed for the increasing streamflow through increasing surface runoff and decreasing transpiration. How-ever, further research is required to assess the precise impacts of afforestation on vegetation cover and hydrologic processes. Generally, the study result showed that the focus of afforestation should be on tree growing than on tree plantation alone.

TI  - Variations in Aerosol Optical Properties over East Asian Dust Storm Source Regions and Their Climatic Factors during 2000-2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Asian dust storms occur in western and northern China, and southern Mongolia every year, particularly in spring. In this study, we use satellite aerosol products to demonstrate the spatial and temporal variation in aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS, and the absorbing aerosol index (AAI) from TOMS and OMI, over the main dust storm source regions (MDSR), and to investigate their relationship to vegetation coverage (NDVI), soil properties (surface soil moisture content and soil temperature 0-10 cm underground), and climatic factors (surface wind speed, air temperature at 2 m above the ground, and precipitation) in spring for the period of 2000-2021. Compared with dust storm occurrence frequency (DSF) observed at surface stations, MODIS AOD, TOMS AAI, and OMI AAI showed consistent spatial distributions and seasonal variations with DSF in the MDSR, with correlation coefficients of 0.88, 0.55, and 0.88, respectively. The results showed that AOD and AAI over the MDSR decreased during 2000-2005, 2006-2017, and 2000-2021, but increased during 2017-2021.The improvements in vegetation coverage and soil moisture together with favorable climatic factors (the increase in temperature and precipitation and the decrease in surface wind speed) resulted in the decreasing trend of AOD and AAI during 2000-2005, 2006-2017, and the entire period of 2000-2021. Conversely, the increase in surface wind speed, the decrease in temperature and the low soil moisture in 2018 and 2020 were the reasons for the increases in AOD and AAI over the MDSR during 2017-2021. The combination effects of surface wind, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation coverage would determine DSF, AOD, and AAI, in the end, under global climate change.

TI  - An Optimal Transport Based Global Similarity Index for Remote Sensing Products Comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing products, such as land cover data products, are essential for a wide range of scientific studies and applications, and their quality evaluation and relative comparison have become a major issue that needs to be studied. Traditional methods, such as error matrices, are not effective in describing spatial distribution because they are based on a pixel-by-pixel comparison. In this paper, the relative quality comparison of two remote sensing products is turned into the difference measurement between the spatial distribution of pixels by proposing a max-sliced Wasserstein distance-based similarity index. According to optimal transport theory, the mathematical expression of the proposed similarity index is firstly clarified, and then its rationality is illustrated, and finally, experiments on three open land cover products (GLCFCS30, FROMGLC, CNLUCC) are conducted. Results show that based on this proposed similarity index-based relative quality comparison method, the spatial difference, including geometric shapes and spatial locations between two different remote sensing products in raster form, can be quantified. The method is particularly useful in cases where there exists misregistration between datasets, while pixel-based methods will lose their robustness.

TI  - Global relative ecosystem service budget mapping using the Google Earth Engine and land cover datasets
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem service mapping (ESM) studies are receiving increasing attention due to the imbalance between the supply of and demand for ecosystem services (ES). Global scale ESM is still scarce, but the high computing power of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform significantly increases the efficiency. Based on global-scale land cover datasets and the GEE, an ES matrix model based-expert is constructed in this paper to map the ES supply, demand, and relative budgets. The net primary productivity (NPP), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), nighttime light (NTL), and world population (Pop) were acquired, and the NPP and EVI and the NTL and Pop datasets were used to revise the supply of and demand for ESs, respectively. We discovered that the ES supply capacity exhibits a double-peaked distribution with latitude, and the peaks are located at the equator and 50 degrees N. The global ESs have a high spatial heterogeneity and the global supply of ESs is 2.405 times higher than the demand; however, the demand exhibits an increasing trend of about 3.36% per decade, and only southern Asia has more ES demand than supply. The imbalance between the ES supply and demand produced a push-pull effect, that is, it forced humans to move closer to the ES surplus regions (ESSRs) and farther away from the ES deficit regions (ESDRs), and the destruction of the ecological environment promoted this phenomenon. The global terrestrial area is divided into eight ES sub-regions, and targeted land management, urban planning, and environmental remediation policies are proposed.

TI  - Intelligent Recognition of Corn Residue Cover Area by Time-Series Sentinel-2A Images
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue covering is an important way to reduce soil erosion and increase soil organic carbon, which is very important for black soil protection. Therefore, the accurate and rapid identification of corn residue cover area plays an important role in local government monitoring and promoting conservation tillage. The study area is located in Siping City, Jilin Province. Moreover, the time-series Sentinel-2A images collected from GEE (Google Earth Engine) cloud platform are used to capture spectral index based on the characteristics of the corn growing season and after harvest. Index features include Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Residue Index (NDRI). The time series feature values are sorted by size, and the quantile method is used to select quartile (QT) features at 0% , 25% , 50% , 75% , and 100% to construct datasets. On this basis, the random forest method after parameter optimization is applied to train and verify the sample datasets divided according to 7 : 3, and then the datasets are classified, combined with the connected domain calibration method to remove the small connected domains generated in the classification process, and further optimize the global result. Through the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Kappa and Overall Accuracy (OA) the experimental results show that : (1) The quantitative evaluation results of the classification model (Ml/M2./M3/M4/M5) based on the dataset composed of the different feature are superior 90%. Among them, the classification model M5 of the dataset designed in this paper has the best performance, of which Kappa and OA are 97. 41% and 97. 91% , respectively. Compared with the classification model M2 without the QT feature, the Kappa and OA are increased by 4. 52% and 3. 64% , respectively. At the same time, the M5 recognition result can effectively retain edge detail information; (2) For QT feature of different time scales, using the QT feature classification model M5_6/M5 of time series remote sensing images from May to November can greatly restrain another crop residue. Compared with the Kappa and OA of the M5_1 model classification result using only the QT features of the time series images in November, the Kappa and OA increased by 3. 9% and 3. 12% , respectively; (3) Based on the M5 model, the Kappa and OA of the classification model M6 combined with the connected domain calibration method are 96. 76% and 97. 36% respectively, second only to the recognition results of the M5 model. The model M6 avoids fine-grained patches while ensuring high accuracy and optimizing the classification visualization effect. Therefore, the M6 model proposed in this paper is suitable for identifying areas covered by corn residue in the study area. This method can be quickly implemented in the GEE cloud platform environment and is suitable for popularization and application in a corn residue covered areas in Northeast China.

TI  - Mapping Onshore CH<sub>4</sub> Seeps in Western Siberian Floodplains Using Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Onshore seeps are recognized as strong sources of methane (CH4), the second most important greenhouse gas. Seeps actively emitting CH4 were recently found in floodplains of West Siberian rivers. Despite the origin of CH4 in these seeps is not fully understood, they can make substantial contribution in regional greenhouse gas emission. We used high-resolution satellite Sentinel-2 imagery to estimate seep areas at a regional scale. Convolutional neural network based on U-Net architecture was implemented to overcome difficulties with seep recognition. Ground-based field investigations and unmanned aerial vehicle footage were coupled to provide reliable training dataset. The seep areas were estimated at 2885 km(2) or 1.5% of the studied region; most seep areas were found within the Ob' river floodplain. The overall accuracy of the final map reached 86.1%. Our study demonstrates that seeps are widespread throughout the region and provides a basis to estimate seep CH4 flux in entire Western Siberia.

TI  - Identification of Initial and Subsequent Injury in Young Infants Opportunities for Quality Improvement in the Evaluation of Child Abuse
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to identify opportunities to improve identification and evaluation of child abuse by (1) describing rates of initial and recurrent injury in young infants, (2) describing the frequency of a history of prior injury in young children evaluated by a child abuse pediatrician, and (3) identifying practice variation, including use of skeletal surveys as an example, in the identification and evaluation of injury across a network of 6 children's hospitals. Methods Six children's hospitals identified infants with an initial injury and recurrent injury over a 1-year period using 2 methods: (1) diagnostic code method - infants 6 months or younger presenting with at least 1 diagnostic code for injury were tracked for 12 months to determine the frequency of recurrent injury, and (2) consult method - all available medical records of children 18 months or younger seen for an inpatient consultation for suspected child abuse were reviewed to identify history of a first injury at 6 months or younger. Results Using the diagnostic code method, 682 unique infants were identified with initial injuries, most commonly fractures (37.0%), bruising/ecchymosis (35.9%), and superficial injuries (28.3%). Forty-two infants (6.2%) returned with a second injury, and no demographic factors were significantly associated with the likelihood of a second injury. Using the consult method, 37 of 342 consults (10.8%) were identified as having a history of at least 1 initial injury. Of the initial injuries identified, the most common was bruising/ecchymosis (64.9%). The number of injuries identified with either method varied significantly across hospitals, as did completion of skeletal surveys for infants with bruising (range, 4.5%-71.1%; P < 0.001) and any injury (range, 4.4%-62.7%; P < 0.001). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that young infants who experience 1 injury often experience a second injury. There exists significant variability in the identification of injury and the completion of skeletal surveys across a network of 6 children's hospitals. A standardized quality improvement approach may improve identification of injury and reduce the variability in practice observed.

TI  - Overcoming Identity Threat: Using Persona Pedagogy in Intersectionality and Inclusion Training
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many efforts and strategies in place to increase the inclusivity of workplaces which is a positive approach, but little thought is provided to the personal cost of participants in undertaking some of these initiatives. Often due to the choice of pedagogy, participants may be placed in the situation to reveal hidden parts of their identity which leads to vulnerability and unpredicted exposure in the workplace and organisation. The paper examines the key issue of identity threat whilst undertaking inclusion and intersectional-type training. The paper highlights the continued need to challenge bias and other forms of exclusionary behavioural and cultural practices, however, this must be carried out in a cautious manner to uphold the safety of well-being of all individuals. A solution to minimize or overcome identity threat is offered via the use of persona pedagogy where personas are used expands one's own world views and limits vulnerability exposure. The persona approach initiates experiences different to an individual's lived experience which evokes critical reflection of one's own positionality by taking on another persona. The paper concludes that the use of persona pedagogy leads to true transformative learning in the workplace whilst protecting the identity of individuals.

TI  - Study on Spatial-Distribution Characteristics Based on Fire-Spot Data in Northern China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are an important disturbance in forest ecosystems and can affect the structure and function of forests. These must be mitigated, to eliminate the associated harmful impacts on forests and the environment as well as to have a healthy and sustainable environment for wildlife. The northern region of China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Hebei provinces) is one of the important deciduous broadleaf forests and boreal-forest ecosystems in China. Based on the monitoring of historical remote-sensing products, this study analyzes and explores the spatial- and temporal-distribution patterns of forest fires in Northern China in 2020 and 2021, providing a strong scientific basis for forest-fire prevention and management. The number of monthly forest fires in the northern region in 2020 and 2021 was counted, to obtain seasonal and interannual forest-fire variation. The results show that the number of forest fires occurring in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces in 2021 is smaller than that in 2020. The occurrence of forest fires is, mainly, concentrated in spring and autumn, especially in April and October. The number of forest fires that occurred in Hebei Province in 2020 and 2021 was almost the same, showing a slight increasing trend, especially with more growth in February. It is worth noting that Heilongjiang Province is the region with the highest number of forest fires, regardless of the comparison of the total number of forest fires in two years or the number of forest fires in a single year. Spatial-clustering analysis (Ripley's K) was used to analyze the spatial-distribution pattern of forest fires, in each province of northern China, and the results showed that forest fires were significantly aggregated in all four provinces. The experimental analysis conducted in this paper can provide local forest managers and firefighting agencies with the opportunity to better plan for fighting fires and improve forest-management effectiveness. Based on mastering the characteristics of the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires, fire-prevention publicity and education should be strengthened, and scientific forest-fire-prevention measures should be applied to plan reasonable forest-protection policies. This will contribute towards a healthy and sustainable environment.

TI  - DNA metabarcoding unveils the effects of habitat fragmentation on pollinator diversity, plant-pollinator interactions, and pollination efficiency in Maldive islands
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects biodiversity, but with unclear effects on pollinators and their interactions with plants in anthropized landscapes. Islands could serve as open air laboratories, suitable to disentangle how land-use alteration impacts pollination ecology. In Maldive islands we investigated how pollinator richness, plant-pollinator interactions and pollination efficiency are influenced by the green area fragmentation (i.e., gardens and semi-natural patches). Moreover, we considered the mediating role of pollinator body size and the plant trait of being invasive in shaping interactions. To do this, we surveyed pollinator insects from 11 islands representing a gradient of green area fragmentation. A DNA metabarcoding approach was adopted to identify the pollen transported by pollinators and characterize the plant-pollinator interactions. We found that intermediate levels of green area fragmentation characterized pollinator communities and increased their species richness, while decreasing interaction network complexity. Invasive plants were more frequently found on pollinator bodies than native or exotic noninvasive ones, indicating a concerningly higher potential for pollen dispersal and reproduction of the former ones. Intriguingly, pollinator body size mediated the effect of landscape alteration on interactions, as only the largest bees expanded the foraging diet in terms of plant richness in the transported pollen at increasing fragmentation. In parallel, the pollination efficiency increased with pollinator species richness in two sentinel plants. This study shows that moderate landscape fragmentation of green areas shapes many aspects of the pollination ecosystem service, where despite interactions being less complex and mediated by pollinator body size, pollinator insect biodiversity and potential plant reproduction are supported.

TI  - A Suitable Model for Spatiotemporal Particulate Matter Concentration Prediction in Rural and Urban Landscapes, Thailand
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal particulate matter (PM) concentration prediction using MODIS AOD with significant PM factors in rural and urban landscapes in Thailand is necessary for public health and has been complicated by the limitations of PM monitoring stations. The research objectives were (1) to identify significant factors affecting PM10 concentrations in rural landscapes and PM2.5 in urban landscapes; (2) to predict spatiotemporal PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and mixed-effect model (MEM), and (3) to evaluate a suitable spatiotemporal model for PM10 and PM2.5 concentration prediction and validation. The research methodology consisted of four stages: data collection and preparation, the identification of significant spatiotemporal factors affecting PM concentrations, the prediction of spatiotemporal PM concentrations, and a suitable spatiotemporal model for PM concentration prediction and validation. As a result, the predicted PM10 concentrations using the GWR model varied from 50.53 to 85.79 mu g/m(3) and from 36.92 to 51.32 mu g/m(3) in winter and summer, while the predicted PM10 concentrations using the MEM model varied from 50.68 to 84.59 mu g/m(3) and from 37.08 to 50.81 mu g/m(3) in both seasons. Likewise, the PM2.5 concentration prediction using the GWR model varied from 25.33 to 44.37 mu g/m(3) and from 16.69 to 24.04 mu g/m(3) in winter and summer, and the PM2.5 concentration prediction using the MEM model varied from 25.45 to 44.36 mu g/m(3) and from 16.68 and 23.75 mu g/m(3) during the two seasons. Meanwhile, according to Thailand and U.S. EPA standards, the monthly air quality index (AQI) classifications of the GWR and MEM were similar. Nevertheless, the derived average corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) values of the GWR model for PM10 and PM2.5 predictions during both seasons were lower than that of the MEM model. Therefore, the GWR model was chosen as a suitable model for spatiotemporal PM10 and PM2.5 concentration predictions. Furthermore, the result of spatial correlation analysis for GWR model validation based on a new dataset provided average correlation coefficient values for PM10 and PM2.5 concentration predictions with a higher than the expected value of 0.5. Subsequently, the GWR model with significant monthly and seasonal factors could predict spatiotemporal PM 10 and PM2.5 concentrations in rural and urban landscapes in Thailand.

TI  - Monitoring 23-year of shoreline changes of the Zengwun Estuary in Southern Taiwan using time-series Landsat data and edge detection techniques
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 80% of sandy beaches in Taiwan have been experiencing a severe recession, although the sediment discharge of rivers in Taiwan is significantly higher than the world average producing almost 2% of global fluvial sediment discharge. This contradiction is primarily due to the widespread constructions of reservoirs and intensive anthropogenic activities in coastal regions. In addition, coasts are particularly vulnerable to hazards due to climate change, such as sea-level rise, as they are located at the transition zone of terrestrial and marine environments. Along with the fact that Taiwan is an island and is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, coastal management and sustainability are nationally critical topics, especially considering the ongoing reformation and legislation of Taiwan's coastal conservation laws. As stated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goal 14, accurate and continuous shoreline positions information is essential for coastal conservation. However, by reviewing previous global studies and projects commissioned by the Taiwanese government aiming at monitoring shoreline changes, they usually exhibit several limitations, such as limited band selections or conservative band ratio-derived water indices, relying on either manual digitization or simple thresholding methods, focusing on either artificial or smoothly shaped coasts, and using images acquired at considerably different tidal height levels. Therefore, in the present study, a subpixel shoreline extraction approach based on a sustainable cross-generation dataset and a robust edge detection algorithm is proposed. This approach is exemplified by the Zengwun River Estuary located in southwestern Taiwan-Taiwan's most critical coastal preservation region. By quantitatively analyzing the resultant time-series shoreline positions from 1999 to 2021, several hotspots of shoreline recession have been identified: an extreme erosional rate up to -69.4 m year(-1) is revealed in the northern sand bank; while the offshore sand bar demonstrates an overall landward retreat rate of -35.4 +/- 1.24 m year(-1).

TI  - A First Approach to Determine If It Is Possible to Delineate In-Season N Fertilization Maps for Wheat Using NDVI Derived from Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Adjusting nitrogen fertilization to the nutritional requirements of crops is one of the major challenges of modern agriculture. The amount of N needed is mainly determined by crop yield, so yield maps can be used to optimize N fertilization. As the adoption of yield monitors is low among farmers, implementation of this approach is still low. However, as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is related to grain yield, the main objective of this work was to identify at which wheat growth stage a moderate agreement between NDVI and yield is obtained. For this, NDVI images obtained from Sentinel-2 were used, and the evolution of concordance was analyzed in 13 classified parcels of wheat employing the Kappa index (KI). In one-third of the plots, a moderate agreement (KI > 0.4) was reached before the stem elongation growth phase (when the last N application was made). In another one-third, moderate agreement was reached later, in more advanced development stages. For the cases in which this agreement did not exist, an attempt was made to find the causes. The MANOVA and subsequent descriptive discriminant analysis (DDA) showed that the NDVI dates that contribute the most to the differentiation between plots with and without agreement between grain yield maps and NDVI images were those corresponding to tillering. The sum of the NDVI values of the tillering phase was significantly lower in the group of plots that did not show concordance. Sentinel-2 imagery was successful on 66% of plots for delineation of management zones after GS 30, and thus is useful for producing fertilization maps for the upcoming season. However, to produce in-season fertilization maps, further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms that regulate the relation between yield and NDVI at early growth stages (<GS 30).

TI  - Multitemporal landslide inventory analysis of an intertropical mountain in west-central Mexico - Basis for hazard management
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides in intertropical mountainous areas of Mexico are a natural hazard that could potentially generate a disaster. Despite this, many areas lack landslide inventories, making it difficult to monitor and efficiently manage the associated risks for local populations. For this reason, the aim of this research was to undertake a multitemporal landslide inventory and analyze its conditioning factors in the Pico de Tancitaro stratovolcano, which, in recent decades, has presented several high-risk geomorphological events with disastrous consequences for nearby localities. The spatial distribution of landslides and its conditioning factors were mapped at a 1:50,000 scale for the 1995-2020 period, through visual interpretation of orthophotos and satellite images (Landsat, SPOT, and SENTINEL). The conditioning factors that link the most to landslides were Quaternary andesite and basaltic andesite rocks; volcanic cones, mountain river valleys, and very steep to steep slopes (30 degrees to >45 degrees), oriented to the South, North, and East; Andosols and Leptosols; and the oyamel fir and mixed forests. 505 landslide events classified into slides and flows that occurred in 1995, 2004, 2010, and 2015 were identified. New scars generated by the reactivation of landslide processes were also observed. The landslides in the study area were triggered by torrential rains caused by hurricanes and tropical storms; such as hurricanes Alex and Patricia. The inventory and analysis of conditioning factors highlighted the distribution and dynamics of slides and flows in the study area. In addition, the most important factors for studies of landslide susceptibility, hazards, and risks in the Pico de Tancitaro stratovolcano were identified, contributing to the management of geomorphological risks in intertropical mountain areas.

TI  - QUANTIFYING RIVER AVULSION ACTIVITY FROM SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING: IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW AVULSIONS CONTRIBUTE TO FLOODPLAIN STRATIGRAPHY IN FORELAND BASINS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rarely witnessed process of river avulsion repositions channels across floodplains, which influences floodplain geomorphology and stratigraphic architecture. The way avulsions redirect water and sediment is typically generalized into one of two styles. Avulsions proceeding through rapid channel switching and producing little to no floodplain disturbance are annexational, while those that involve sequential phases of crevassing, flooding, and eventual development of a new channel are progradational. We test the validity of these avulsion style categories by mapping and characterizing 14 avulsion events in Andean, Himalayan, and New Guinean foreland basins. We use Landsat data to identify how avulsions proceed and interpret the possible products of these processes in terms of geomorphic features and stratigraphy. We show that during annexation the avulsion channel widens, changes its meander wavelength and amplitude, or increases channel thread count. During progradation, avulsion channels are constructed from evolving distributary networks. Often beginning as crevasse splays, these networks migrate down the floodplain gradient and frequently create and fill ponds during the process. We also see evidence for a recently defined third avulsion style. Retrogradation involves overbank flow, like progradation, but is marked by an upstream-migrating abandonment and infilling of the parent channel. Avulsion belts in this study range from 5 to 60 km in length, and from 1 to 50 km in width. On average, these events demonstrate annexational style over 22.4% of their length. Eleven of 13 events either begin or end with annexation, and seven both begin and end with annexation. Only one event exhibited progradation over the entire avulsion-belt length. While there are many documented examples of purely annexational avulsions, we see little evidence for completely progradational or retrogradational avulsions, and instead suggest that a given avulsion is better envisioned as a series of spatiotemporal phases of annexation, progradation, and retrogradation. Such hybrid avulsions likely produce significantly greater stratigraphic variability than that predicted by the traditional end-member model. We suggest that a time-averaged, formation-scale consideration of avulsion products will yield more accurate characterizations of avulsion dynamics in ancient fluvial systems.

TI  - Medieval Scandinavian Studies-Whence, Whereto, Why
T2  - HUMANITIES-BASEL
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Medieval Scandinavian Studies started emerging as a discipline in the 19th century, at a time when Old Norse literature had become an important source both for the reconstruction of an alleged Germanic worldview, and the substantiation of national political claims. Scholars in the early 20th century consolidated this view, and thereby even coined public ideas of a Germanic past that became influential in the reception of the Middle Ages in general. To the present day, the popular fascination with these Middle Ages thus is strongly informed by Old Norse sources, and a wealth of recent adaptations seem to perpetuate this view. However, the same sources, as well as earlier scholarship, are used by extremist groups to substantiate populist and racist claims. Scholars in Medieval Scandinavian Studies find themselves at the intersection of these conflicting and yet connected spheres of appropriation. Their task to take a stance in this situation is all the more challenging as the international field struggles with cutbacks of budgets, study programs, and institutes. The present special issue seeks to bring together current opinions on this ambivalent state.

TI  - LSTM-Based Prediction of Mediterranean Vegetation Dynamics Using NDVI Time-Series Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation index time-series analysis of multitemporal satellite data is widely used to study vegetation dynamics in the present climate change era. This paper proposes a systematic methodology to predict the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using time-series data extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The key idea is to obtain accurate NDVI predictions by combining the merits of two effective computational intelligence techniques; namely, fuzzy clustering and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks under the framework of dynamic time warping (DTW) similarity measure. The study area is the Lesvos Island, located in the Aegean Sea, Greece, which is an insular environment in the Mediterranean coastal region. The algorithmic steps and the main contributions of the current work are described as follows. (1) A data reduction mechanism was applied to obtain a set of representative time series. (2) Since DTW is a similarity measure and not a distance, a multidimensional scaling approach was applied to transform the representative time series into points in a low-dimensional space, thus enabling the use of the Euclidean distance. (3) An efficient optimal fuzzy clustering scheme was implemented to obtain the optimal number of clusters that better described the underline distribution of the low-dimensional points. (4) The center of each cluster was mapped into time series, which were the mean of all representative time series that corresponded to the points belonging to that cluster. (5) Finally, the time series obtained in the last step were further processed in terms of LSTM neural networks. In particular, development and evaluation of the LSTM models was carried out considering a one-year period, i.e., 12 monthly time steps. The results indicate that the method identified unique time-series patterns of NDVI among different CORINE land-use/land-cover (LULC) types. The LSTM networks predicted the NDVI with root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.017 to 0.079. For the validation year of 2020, the difference between forecasted and actual NDVI was less than 0.1 in most of the study area. This study indicates that the synergy of the optimal fuzzy clustering based on DTW similarity of NDVI time-series data and the use of LSTM networks with clustered data can provide useful results for monitoring vegetation dynamics in fragmented Mediterranean ecosystems.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on instrumental observation data from meteporological stations located in the Southern Urals, an integrated index of the fire hazard and an index of forest fire hazard have been calculated for the warm season (May-September) from 1978 to 2020. The analysis was based on the daily values of surface air temperature, amount of precipitation, dew point deficit, average wind speed, moisture index, and number of days after the last rain. A correlation analysis between the critical values of the fire hazard indices and actual data on forest fires has been carried out; as a result, a close relationship has been revealed between the extreme values of the fire hazard indices and abnormally hot years. A general trend towards changes has been recorded for most of the meteorological stations with respect to the maximum values of the fire hazard indices. The fire hazard indices are compared with the results of space monitoring of wildfires from the Terra-MODIS satellite. An increase in the number of cases of dangerous meteorological conditions from 1995 to 2000 and a decrease in the number of days with the critical values of fire hazard indices from 2000 to 2005 have been revealed. Fire hazard indices differently reflect the set of meteorological conditions contributing to the occurrence of fires. Thus, unlike the integrated index of fire hazard, the index of forest fire hazard takes into account not only meteorological, but also environmental factors. The resulting values of the fire hazard indices have been structured in the form of a database that can be used in meteorological forecasts to assess and predict fire conditions based on weather conditions.

TI  - Two-Step Alignment of Mixed Reality Devices to Existing Building Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the emergence of XR technologies, the demand for new time- and cost-saving applications in the AEC industry based on these new technologies is rapidly increasing. Their real-time feedback and digital interaction in the field makes these systems very well suited for construction site monitoring, maintenance, project planning, and so on. However, the continuously changing environments of construction sites and facilities requires extraordinary robust and dynamic data acquisition technologies to capture and update the built environment. New XR devices already have the hardware to accomplish these tasks, but the framework to document and geolocate multi-temporal mappings of a changing environment is still very much the subject of ongoing research. The goal of this research is, therefore, to study whether Lidar and photogrammetric technologies can be adapted to process XR sensory data and align multiple time series in the same coordinate system. Given the sometimes drastic changes on sites, we do not only use the sensory data but also any preexisting remote sensing data and as-is or as-designed BIM to aid the registration. In this work, we specifically study the low-resolution geometry and image matching of the Hololens 2 during consecutive stages of a construction. During the experiments, multiple time series of constructions are captured and registered. The experiments show that XR-captured data can be reliably registered to preexisting datasets with an accuracy that matches or exceeds the resolution of the sensory data. These results indicate that this method is an excellent way to align generic XR devices to a wide variety of existing reference data.

TI  - CaneSat dataset to leverage convolutional neural networks for sugarcane classification from Sentinel-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ubiquitous deep learning (DL) in remote sensing (RS) motivates the most challenging problem of crop classification. To perpetrate such an exigent task, an attempt is made to prepare a novel dataset, the CaneSat dataset, in two formats: RGB color space and geo-tiff images, covering the region of four talukas in Karnataka, India. This research aims to build a model for sugarcane classification using two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) applying RS time series data. Further, the study intents to evaluate competency of four state-of-the-art deep CNNs namely AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet50 and DenseNet201 using fine tuning and deep CNNs as feature extractors to classify sugarcane and non-sugarcane areas from Sentinel-2 data. The results of the research are expressive on CaneSat dataset. It shows that the CNN model performs significantly good producing 88.46% accuracy, whereas all deep networks exhibit more than 73.00% overall accuracy. When used as feature extractors, ResNet50 and DenseNet201 outperform all other models with precision of 85.65% and 87.70%, respectively. Noticeably, the results indicate that 2D CNN model and features extracted using CNNs with SVM classifier are efficient methods for sugarcane classification from Sentinel-2 time series data in peninsular zone of India.

TI  - PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 Data Integration for Object-Based Land Cover Classification in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PlanetScope (PL) high-resolution composite base maps have recently become available within Google Earth Engine (GEE) for the tropical regions thanks to the partnership between Google and the Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI). Object-based (OB) image classification in the GEE environment has increased rapidly due to the broadly recognized advantages of applying these approaches to medium- and high-resolution images. This work aimed to assess the advantages for land cover classification of (a) adopting an OB approach with PL data; and (b) integrating the PL datasets with Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 1 data both in Pixel-based (PB) or OB approaches. For this purpose, in this research, we compared ten LULC classification approaches (PB and OB, all based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm), where the three satellite datasets were used according to different levels of integration and combination. The study area, which is 69,272 km(2) wide and located in central Brazil, was selected within the tropical region, considering a preliminary availability of sample points and its complex landscape mosaic composed of heterogeneous agri-natural spaces, including scattered settlements. Using only the PL dataset with a typical RF PB approach produced the worse overall accuracy (OA) results (67%), whereas adopting an OB approach for the same dataset yielded very good OA (82%). The integration of PL data with the S2 and S1 datasets improved both PB and OB overall accuracy outputs (82 vs. 67% and 91 vs. 82%, respectively). Moreover, this research demonstrated the OB approaches' applicability in GEE, even in vast study areas and using high-resolution imagery. Although additional applications are necessary, the proposed methodology appears to be very promising for properly exploiting the potential of PL data in GEE.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Delineation the Rice Growing Stages for Cropping Calendar Estimation in the Southern of Vietnam using Remote Sensing
T2  - Indian Journal of Agricultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) is the crucial instrument aboard. It provides global maps of several land surface characteristics.Methods: The study uses MODIS to delineate the rice sowing and progress of the rice cropping calendar in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The study used multi-time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images from 250 m spatial resolution MOD13Q1 images with 16-day combination to determine rice sowing/planting and harvesting schedules (from 01/01/2008 to 30/09/2009). Using 82 MODIS images, the study calculates the NDVI time series for rice sowing/transplanting stages in the Mekong Delta. Over time, the relationship between NDVI values and the rice cropping stages determines each cropping season starting and ending time.Result: As a result, we delineate three (3) major rice cropping systems and eight (8) cropping seasons. In which Main Winter-Spring and Early Summer-Autumn and Late Main Winter-Spring and Main Summer-Autumn cropping seasons dominated. MODIS satellite images are efficient and helpful for determining the current state of rice evolution. It is suitable for the regional or national level, which can provide quick and low-cost information for managers and decision-makers to select the proper strategies for crop management.

TI  - Landscape Structure as the Regulator of the Siberian Stone Pine Growth Dynamics in the Northern Taiga of Western Siberia
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of studies aimed at identifying statistical relationships between the landscape structure and variability in Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica) increments in the permafrost-hillocky northern-taiga landscapes of Western Siberia (Nadym River basin). Dendrochronologies of Siberian stone pine growing on frost mounds of different types are compiled. Principal component analysis is applied to obtain independent variables that describe the site and landscape structure of the territory. Cores from 512 trees growing on 23 frost mounds are analyzed. The following methods are used: crossdating, dendrochronological standardization, and the elimination of monotonic trends for each tree. Results of the classification of Sentinel satellite images were used to calculate the proportions of lakes, forests, sparse forests, floating bogs, and flat-hillocky peat bogs, with the radius of the vicinity of a frost mound of 100-2000 m. Correlation, dispersion, and regression analyses are used in the analysis of the dependence of the median increment on the characteristic of the mound site and landscape neighborhoods. It has been established that on high mounds the variability in increments is higher on tops than on slopes, whereas the situation is often reversed on low mounds. It is also found that the tops and slopes of the frost mounds respond differently to climatic fluctuations depending on the landscape structure and the height of the mound: the close proximity of lakes reduces the variability of phytoproductive functioning on the summit surfaces. It is revealed that the sensitivity of Siberian stone pine growth to temperature fluctuations increases with an increase in the diversity of the facies structure caused by the development of thermokarst subsidence and cryogenic cracks.

TI  - Dormant Season Vegetation Phenology and Eddy Fluxes in Native Tallgrass Prairies of the US Southern Plains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET) during the non-growing season can contribute significantly to the annual carbon and water budgets of agroecosystems. Comparative studies of vegetation phenology and the dynamics of CO2 fluxes and ET during the dormant season of native tallgrass prairies from different landscape positions under the same climatic regime are scarce. Thus, this study compared the dynamics of satellite-derived vegetation phenology (as captured by the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) and eddy covariance (EC)-measured CO2 fluxes and ET in six differently managed native tallgrass prairie pastures during dormant seasons (November through March). During December-February, vegetation phenology (EVI and NDVI) and the dynamics of eddy fluxes were comparable across all pastures in most years. Large discrepancies in fluxes were observed during March (the time of the initiation of growth of dominant warm-season grasses) across years and pastures due to the influence of weather conditions and management practices. The results illustrated the interactive effects between prescribed spring burns and rainfall on vegetation phenology (i.e., positive and negative impacts of prescribed spring burns under non-drought and drought conditions, respectively). The EVI better tracked the phenology of tallgrass prairie during the dormant season than did NDVI. Similar EVI and NDVI values for the periods when flux magnitudes were different among pastures and years, most likely due to the satellite sensors' inability to fully observe the presence of some cool-season C-3 species under residues, necessitated a multi-level validation approach of using ground-truth observations of species composition, EC measurements, PhenoCam (digital) images, and finer-resolution satellite data to further validate the vegetation phenology derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during dormant seasons. This study provides novel insights into the dynamics of vegetation phenology, CO2 fluxes, and ET of tallgrass prairie during the dormant season in the U.S. Southern Great Plains.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose and investigate a method for creating large scale forest height maps at 10 m resolution from Sentinel 2 data using deep neural networks. In addition, we demonstrate how clear-cutting events can be detected in a time series of the resulting forest height maps. The network architecture is a convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. The 13 Sentinel-2 spectral bands are resampled to 10 m spatial resolution and input to the U-Net, which outputs a map with per-pixel forest height estimates. The network is trained with ground truth data acquired from airborne lidar scanning surveys from three different geographical regions. They cover different types of forests: lowland tropical rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Miombo woodlands (dry forest) in Liwale, Tanzania, and submontane tropical rainforest in Amani, Tanzania. We demonstrate that the trained network generalizes to new geographical regions within the African continent with a mean average error of 4.6 m. This is on-par with a previously published method's ability to generalize to new geographical regions within the same country. Clear-cutting events are detected using a t-test. The null-hypothesis of the t-test is that the forest height has not changed after any given point in time in the forest height time-series.

TI  - AUTS: A Novel Approach to Mapping Winter Wheat by Automatically Updating Training Samples Based on NDVI Time Series
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and rapid access to crop distribution information is a significant requirement for the development of modern agriculture. Improving the efficiency of remote sensing monitoring of winter wheat planting area information, a new method of automatically updating training samples (AUTS), is proposed herein. Firstly, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, a Sentinel-2 image with a spatial resolution of 10 m was selected to extract the distribution map of winter wheat in the city of Shijiazhuang in 2017. Secondly, combined with the NDVI time series, the weighted correlation coefficients from 2017, 2018, and 2019 were calculated. Then, the 2017 winter wheat distribution map and its most significant relevant areas were used to extract sample points from 2018 and 2019 automatically. Finally, the distribution map of winter wheat in Shijiazhuang in 2018 and 2019 was generated. In addition, to test the applicability of the automatically updating training sample at different scales and regions, the proposed method was applied to Landsat 8 image data with a spatial resolution of 30 m, as well as to Handan and Baoding. The results showed that the calculated winter wheat planting area is comparable with the officially published statistics, based on Sentinel-2, extracting three years of winter wheat, the R-2 values for all three years were above 0.95. The R-2 values for 2018 and 2019, based on Landsat 8 extractions, were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. The R-2 values extracted from Handan and Baoding in 2018 were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method has high accuracy and can provide technical support and reference for winter wheat area monitoring and yield estimation.

TI  - Characterizing Spatial Patterns of the Response Rate of Vegetation Green-Up Dates to Land Surface Temperature in Beijing, China (2001-2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenology indicator of vegetation green-up dates (GUD) is prone to being affected by changes in temperature. However, the influencing degree of urbanization-induced temperature warming on vegetation GUDs among different vegetation species along the urban-rural gradient remains inadequately described. In this study, based on the long-term (2001-2019) satellite-derived vegetation GUDs and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) of forests, grasslands, and croplands along the urban-rural gradient with Beijing (China) as a case study area, the responses of vegetation GUDs to temperature changes were quantitatively analyzed, taking into account the vegetation types and distances away from the urban domain. The results show that (1) long-term GUDs and LST are significantly negatively correlated, characterized by a weaker significant correlation near the urban area when compared with its surrounding areas, with the greatest absolute linear correlation coefficients (r) happening at rings 32 km (r(max) = 0.93, forests), 20 km and 48 km (r(max) = 0.83, grasslands), and 34 km (r(max) = 0.82, croplands), respectively; (2) the magnitude of change in GUDs over the past 19 year (2001-2019) are significantly positively correlated with these in LST near the urban area, demonstrating a distance-decay trend, with the greatest advance in GUDs occurring at the ring nearest the urban area, by about 20 days (forests), 24.5 days (grasslands), and 15.6 days (croplands), respectively; (3) the spatial pattern of the response rate of GUDs change to LST change (days K-1) also showed a declining trend with distance, with GUD advanced by 6.8 days K-1 (forests), 7.5 days K-1 (grasslands), and 4.9 days K-1 (croplands) at the closest ring to the urban, decreasing to about 2.3 days K-1 (48 km), 4.1 days K-1 (18 km), and 1 day K-1 (18 km), respectively, indicating a notable influence of temperature warming on vegetation GUDs near the urban domains.

TI  - Design and Verification of Retracking Estimator for Synthetic Aperture Altimeter Based on Weighted Least Squares
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Retracking is an important step to extract accurate parameter estimation of the altimeter echo signals. The existing retracking estimators of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimeter are mainly based on the least square method, which does not consider the influence of the different statistical characteristics of each range bin of the altimeter on the parameter estimation accuracy. At the same time, the existing weighted least squares retracking estimator uses a semi-analytical model, which is inefficient and inconvenient be applied to practice. In this paper, a new kind of weighted method is designed by using the analytical SAR Altimetry MOde Studies and Applications (SAMOSA) echo model for data processing. The weighting process makes the statistical characteristics of each range bin of the altimeter consistent, thereby improving the estimation accuracy of the range and significant wave height of the retracking estimator. The method is verified by Sentinel-3A satellite data, and the verification results show that the estimation accuracy of the two parameters, range and significant wave height, are improved: at 2 m significant wave height, the range accuracy is improved by 9%, and the significant wave height accuracy is improved by 11% ; at 4 m significant wave height, the range accuracy is improved by 13%, and the significant wave height accuracy is improved by 20%.

TI  - Daily High-Resolution Land Surface Freeze/Thaw Detection Using Sentinel-1 and AMSR2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution surface freeze/thaw (F/T) information is valuable for hydrological, frost creep and gelifluction/solifluction, and climate prediction studies. Currently, large-scale, high-resolution F/T detection is restricted by low spatial resolution of passive microwave remote sensing sensors or low temporal resolution of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In this study, we propose a new method for detecting daily land surface F/T state at 1 km spatial resolution by combining the Sentinel-1 radar and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) with leaf area index (LAI) data. A non-linear relationship is established between the 1 km F/T index from Sentinel-1 with 1 km F/T index from AMSR2 (FTI) and 1 km LAI data. The 1 km FTI is a disaggregation of the 25 km FTI obtained from AMSR2. This non-linear relationship is then applied to daily 1 km FTI and LAI data to predict the 1 km daily F/T index, based on which the F/T status is detected with grid-cell-based F/T thresholds. The overall accuracy of this daily 1 km F/T is more than 88.1% when evaluated with the in situ 5 cm soil temperature over China and Canada. This study is valuable for detecting daily, high-resolution F/T status and is helpful for studies related to disaster and climate prediction.

TI  - Clinical Application of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Combined with Nanocarbon Tracing and Platinum Nanoparticles in Detection and Localization of Sentinel Lymph Node of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the clinical application value of indocyanine green fluorescence combined with carbon nanotracer combined with platinum nanoparticles in the localization of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods: A total of 90 PTC patients who received surgical treatment were selected for this research. Indocyanine green fluorescence combined with nano-carbon and platinum nanoparticles was used prior to biopsy. The surgically resected sentinel lymph nodes and other dissected lymph nodes were frozen for pathological examination, and the related indexes of the two groups were compared.

TI  - Carbon Emission Inversion Model from Provincial to Municipal Scale Based on Nighttime Light Remote Sensing and Improved STIRPAT
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions and consequent climate change directly affect the sustainable development of ecological environment systems and human society, which is a pertinent issue of concern for all countries globally. The construction of a carbon emission inversion model has significant theoretical importance and practical significance for carbon emission accounting and control. Established carbon emission models usually adopt socio-economic parameters or energy statistics to calculate carbon emissions. However, high-precision estimates of carbon emissions in administrative regions lacking energy statistics are difficult. This problem is especially prominent in small-scale regions. Methods to accurately estimate carbon emissions in small-scale regions are needed. Based on nighttime light remote-sensing data and the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model, combined with the environmental Kuznets curve, this paper proposes an ISTIRPAT (Improved Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model. Through the improved STIRPAT model (ISTIRPAT) and panel data regression, provincial carbon emission inventory data were downscaled to the municipal level, and municipal scale carbon emission inventories were obtained. This study took the 17 cities and prefectures of Hubei Province, China, as an example to verify the accuracy of the model. Carbon emissions for 17 cities and prefectures from 2012 to 2018 calculated from the original STIRPAT model and the ISTIRPAT model were compared with real values. The results show that using the ISTIRPAT model to downscale the provincial carbon emission inventory to the municipal level, the inversion accuracy reached 0.9, which was higher than that of the original model. Overall, carbon emissions in Hubei Province showed an upward trend. Regarding the spatial distribution, the main carbon emission area was formed in the central part of Hubei Province as a ring-shaped mountain peak. The lowest carbon emissions in the central area expanded outward, increased, and gradually decreased to the edge of the province. The overall composition of carbon emissions in eastern Hubei was higher than those in western Hubei.

TI  - Remote sensing image gap filling based on spatial-spectral random forests
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images play a significant role in global land cover monitoring. However, due to the influence of cloud contamination, optical remote sensing images inevitably contain a large number of missing data, which severely limits their applicability. Existing cloud removal methods generally use only the effective information from a single band of temporally close known images, which is insufficient to predict accurately the changes between the known and cloudy images. In this paper, we proposed a spatial-spectral random forest (SSRF) method for thick cloud removal by gap filling, which uses spatially adjacent and multispectral information of known images simultaneously based on random forests. With its capability to fit nonlinear relations and adap-tively assign variable contributions, SSRF can handle the potentially complex relationship between the known and cloudy images, thus, producing more accurate predictions. Based on the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data in 13 regions, the effectiveness of SSRF was demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real cloudy images. The results show that in urban areas with strong heterogeneity and agricultural areas with complex temporal changes, SSRF can yield satisfactory predictions both visually and quantitatively. Moreover, SSRF is more accurate than two popular benchmark methods. In addition, SSRF is less affected by cloud size and the time interval between the known and cloudy images, and can still produce reliable predictions when the used known images are also contaminated by clouds which reduce the amount of available neighborhood information. SSRF is also less affected by the omission error in cloud detection caused by thin clouds. SSRF is simple to implement and has great potential for widespread application.

TI  - Near real-time surface water extraction from GOES-16 geostationary satellite ABI images by constructing and sharpening the green-like band
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of water bodies is critical for a range of applications including water resource management, natural hazard assessment and climate change analysis. GOES-16 geostationary satellite Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) imagery has a very fine (per 10 min) temporal resolution, which is essential for frequent monitoring of water body changes. However, GOES-16 ABI imagery has not been applied for water body mapping, as it lacks a green waveband, essential for the construction of water index images used for surface water extraction. Moreover, the spatial resolution of GOES-16 ABI imagery varies from 0.5 km to 2 km, with only the red band having a spatial resolution of 0.5 km. To solve these problems, we constructed a green-like band and applied component substitution (CS), multiresolution analysis (MRA) and geostatistical-based pansharpening to increase the spatial resolution of the original GOES-16 ABI imagery. The results show that the addition of the constructed green-like band increased significantly the accuracy of water body mapping with water indices such as the NDWI and MNDWI. Sharpening the 1 km bands using the 0.5 km red band of GOES-16 ABI imagery further increased the accuracy of water body mapping with greater spatial detail. Notably, experiments performed in this research demonstrated that the order of the two steps (i.e. green-like band construction and multi-spectral image pansharpening), also influences the accuracy of water body mapping. Due to the different ability to preserve spectral information, the strategy of pansharpening-then-construction was more suitable for MRA-based pan sharpening, while the opposite was true for CS-based methods, with no significant difference for geostatisticalbased methods. An additive wavelet luminance proportion (AWLP) approach in the pansharpening-thenconstruction strategy was applied to produce 0.5 km time-series water body maps every 10 min within a day for the main part of the Amazon River, as it produced a water body map with the greatest accuracy. The downscaled GOES-16 ABI imagery, with its constructed and sharpened green-like band, has great potential for near real-time fine-scale mapping of surface water bodies.

TI  - Sparse Data-Extended Fusion Method for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction on the East China Sea
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate temperature background field plays a vital role in the numerical prediction of sea surface temperature (SST). At present, the SST background field is mainly derived from multi-source data fusion, including satellite SST data and in situ data from marine stations, buoys, and voluntary observing ships. The characteristics of satellite SST data are wide coverage but low accuracy, whereas the in situ data have high accuracy but sparse distribution. For obtaining a more accurate temperature background field and realizing the fusion of measured data with satellite data as much as possible, we propose a sparse data-extended fusion method to predict SST in this paper. By using this method, the actual observed sites and buoys data in the East China Sea area are fused with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder Version 5.0 SST data. Furthermore, the temperature field in the study area were predicted by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) deep learning methods, respectively. Finally, we obtained the results by traditional prediction methods to verify them. The experimental results show that the method we proposed in this paper can obtain more accurate prediction results, and effectively compensate for the uncertainty caused by the parameterization of ocean dynamic process, the discrete method, and the error of initial conditions.

TI  - Desertification in the Mu Us Sandy Land in China: Response to climate change and human activity from 2000 to 2020
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - China is a country largely affected by desertification. The main purpose of this article is to analyze interannual and seasonal changes in fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL). It uses fused remote sensing data to quantitatively analyze the response of FVC to climate change and human activities. The results showed that desertification in the MUSL had improved over the past 20 years. Grade V desertification decreased from more than 60% in 2000 to about 15% in 2020. In some years, degradation appeared to be affected by climate factors and human activity, especially in the northwestern portion of the study area. The FVC in summer was slightly higher than that in autumn and far higher than recorded in spring and winter. Spatially, the northwestern and central parts of the study area were unstable, with high coefficients of variation. FVC gradually increased from northwest to southeast, and areas with the fastest increase in FVC were concentrated along the eastern and southern edges of the study area. The correlations between FVC and precipitation and dryness were slightly positive, but the correlation between FVC and temperature showed regional differences. The increase of population density is not a key factor limiting the growth of vegetation; the policy of "grazing prohibition, grazing rest, and rotational grazing " has allowed the restoration of vegetation; and afforestation is an effective way to promote the increase in FVC.

TI  - Urban Expansion Monitoring Based on the Digital Surface Model-A Case Study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Plain
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although urban expansion statistics have been widely carried out, large-scale and rapid monitoring is still worth doing in order to improve the efficiency of statistics, as well as make up for the omissions and deficiencies of construction expansion statistics with multi-year intervals. This paper presents a study of urban expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain based on ALOS Global Digital Surface Model "ALOS World 3D-30 m" (AW3D30 DSM), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DSM, and Landsat 7 ETM+ images. Through the evaluation of errors and the elimination of non-building changes, a relatively objective result is derived. The neighborhood block statistics of the construction height expansion reveal that from 2000 to 2009, the largest centralized construction expansion mainly occurred between the Second Ring Road and the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing, followed by Yizhuang, Shunyi, Tianjin Central City, and Langfang. Zonal statistics also show a significant imbalance in the expansion of construction in the counties of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain. For example, Chaoyang, Dongcheng, Xicheng, Xuanwu, Chongwen, Nankai, Heping, and Hexi have a larger construction expansion; however, other counties present a relatively slow rate of building expansion. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the statistical average building height expansion per unit area (ABHE, by our method) and the actual average completed building floor space per unit area (ACBFS) derived from the Beijing Statistical Yearbook (BSY) is 0.9436, which proves that this method is feasible. With the continuous improvement of DSM data quality in the future, the method proposed in this paper can provide rapid and large-scale statistics to study more urban construction expansion in the world.

TI  - Artificial and Natural Water Bodies Change in China, 2000-2020
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial and natural water bodies, such as reservoirs, ponds, rivers and lakes, are important components of water-related ecosystems; they are also important indicators of the impact of human activities and climate change on surface water resources. However, due to the global and regional lack of artificial and natural water bodies data sets, understanding of the changes in water-related ecosystems under the dual impact of human activities and climate change is limited and scientific and effective protection and restoration actions are restricted. In this paper, artificial and natural water bodies data sets for China are developed for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 based on satellite remote sensing surface water and artificial water body location sample data sets. The characteristics and causes of the temporal and spatial distributions of the artificial and natural water bodies are also analyzed. The results revealed that the area of artificial and natural water bodies in China shows an overall increasing trend, with obvious differences in spatial distribution during the last 20 years, and that the fluctuation range of artificial water bodies is smaller than that of natural water bodies. This research is critical for understanding the composition and long-term changes in China's surface water system and for supporting and formulating scientific and rational strategies for water-related ecosystem protection and restoration.

TI  - The Impacts of Urban Form on PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations: A Regional Analysis of Cities in China from 2000 to 2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban form (e.g., city size, shape, scale, density, etc.) can impact the air quality and public health. However, few studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between the urban form and PM2.5 concentrations on a regional scale and long-term basis in China. In this study, we explored the impact of the urban form on the PM2.5 concentrations in four different regions (i.e., northeast, central, east, western) across China for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Five landscape metrics were classified into three characteristics of the urban form (compactness, shape complexity, and urban expansion) using high-resolution remote-sensing data. With considerations given to regional differences, panel-data models and city-level panel data were used to calculate the impact of the urban form on the PM2.5 concentrations. The results of the study indicate that urban expansion is positively correlated with the PM2.5 concentrations across China, with the only exception being the country's western region, which suggests that urban extension is conducive to increasing the PM2.5 levels in relatively developed regions. Meanwhile, the positive relationship between the irregularity of cities and the PM2.5 concentrations indicates that reducing the urban shape complexity will help to mitigate PM2.5 pollution. Moreover, urban compactness, which mainly refers to the landscape-division-index values, proved to have a negative effect on the PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting that the optimization of urban spatial compactness could reduce PM2.5 levels. The findings of this study are beneficial for a better understanding of the intensity and direction of the effect of the urban form on PM2.5 concentrations.

TI  - Review of Remote Sensing Applications in Grassland Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The application of remote sensing technology in grassland monitoring and management has been ongoing for decades. Compared with traditional ground measurements, remote sensing technology has the overall advantage of convenience, efficiency, and cost effectiveness, especially over large areas. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest remote sensing estimation methods for some critical grassland parameters, including above-ground biomass, primary productivity, fractional vegetation cover, and leaf area index. Then, the applications of remote sensing monitoring are also reviewed from the perspective of their use of these parameters and other remote sensing data. In detail, grassland degradation and grassland use monitoring are evaluated. In addition, disaster monitoring and carbon cycle monitoring are also included. Overall, most studies have used empirical models and statistical regression models, while the number of machine learning approaches has an increasing trend. In addition, some specialized methods, such as the light use efficiency approaches for primary productivity and the mixed pixel decomposition methods for vegetation coverage, have been widely used and improved. However, all the above methods have certain limitations. For future work, it is recommended that most applications should adopt the advanced estimation methods rather than simple statistical regression models. In particular, the potential of deep learning in processing high-dimensional data and fitting non-linear relationships should be further explored. Meanwhile, it is also important to explore the potential of some new vegetation indices based on the spectral characteristics of the specific grassland under study. Finally, the fusion of multi-source images should also be considered to address the deficiencies in information and resolution of remote sensing images acquired by a single sensor or satellite.

TI  - Landslide Inventory in the Downstream of the Niulanjiang River with ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1 Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide inventory and deformation monitoring is an essential task for human life and property security during the exploitation process of hydroelectric power resources. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is recognized as an effective tool for ground displacement monitoring with the advantages of wide coverage and high accuracy. In this study, we mapped the unstable slopes in the downstream of the Niulanjiang River with 22 ALOS PALSAR SAR images acquired from 2007 to 2011, and 90 Sentinel-1 SAR images from 2015 to 2019. A total of 94 active slopes are identified using a displacement map from the two datasets based on Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) InSAR analysis. By comparing the results from ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1 data stacks, we find that the number of active slopes increased dramatically. Several impact factors, e.g., earthquake, concentrated rainfall, and construction of hydropower stations, are discussed through time series analysis of typical landslides. Furthermore, nonlinear displacement of natural unstable slopes are found to be correlated with rainfall. A climate-driven model is used to qualify the relationship between rainfall and landslide displacement. Our results can provide valuable information for landslide detection and prevention.

TI  - Discovery of a Novel Coronavirus in Swedish Bank Voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>)
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented pandemic COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with bats as original reservoirs, has once again highlighted the importance of exploring the interface of wildlife diseases and human health. In this study, we identified a novel Betacoronavirus from bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in Grimso, Sweden, and this virus is designated as Grimso virus. Repeated detection over three years and an overall prevalence of 3.4% suggest that the virus commonly occurs in bank voles. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Grimso virus belongs to a highly divergent Embecovirus lineage predominantly associated with bank voles. Given that bank voles are one of the most common rodent species in Sweden and Europe, our findings indicate that Grimso virus might be circulating widely in bank voles and further point out the importance of sentinel surveillance of coronaviruses in wild small mammalian animals, especially in wild rodents.

TI  - A comparative study of the fecal microbiota of gray seal pups and yearlings - a marine mammal sentinel species
T2  - MICROBIOLOGYOPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) can act as sentinel species reflecting the condition of the environment they inhabit. Our previous research identified strains of pathogenic Campylobacter and Salmonella, originating from both human and agricultural animal hosts, on rectal swabs from live gray seal (H. grypus) pups and yearlings on the Isle of May, Scotland, UK. We examined rectal swabs from the same pup (n = 90) and yearling (n = 19) gray seals to gain further understanding into the effects of age-related changes (pup vs. yearling) and three different natal terrestrial habitats on seal pup fecal microbiota. DNA was extracted from a subset of rectal swabs (pups n = 23, yearlings n = 9) using an optimized procedure, and the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was sequenced to identify each individual's microbiota. Diversity in pup samples was lower (3.92 +/- 0.19) than yearlings (4.66 +/- 0.39) although not significant at the p = 0.05 level (p = 0.062) but differences in the composition of the microbiota were (p < 0.001). Similarly, differences between the composition of the microbiota from pups from three different terrestrial habitats (Pilgrim's Haven [PH], Rona Rocks [RR], and Tarbet Slope [TS]) were highly significant (p < 0.001). Pairwise tests showed significant differences between all three habitats: PH versus TS (p = 0.019), PH versus RR (p = 0.042) and TS versus RR (p = 0.020). This preliminary study suggests a general trend, that seal microbiomes are modified by both age and, in pups, different terrestrial habitats. Furthermore, knowledge of the microbiota species present has the potential to be used in determining the environmental quality index.

TI  - Bonded Discrete Element Simulations of Sea Ice With Non-Local Failure: Applications to Nares Strait
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The discrete element method (DEM) can provide detailed descriptions of sea ice dynamics that explicitly model floes and discontinuities in the ice, which can be challenging to represent accurately with current models. However, floe-scale stresses that inform lead formation in sea ice are difficult to calculate in current DEM implementations. In this paper, we use the ParticLS software library to develop a DEM that models the sea ice as a collection of discrete rigid particles that are initially bonded together using a cohesive beam model that approximates the response of an Euler-Bernoulli beam located between particle centroids. Ice fracture and lead formation are determined based on the value of a non-local Cauchy stress state around each particle and a Mohr-Coulomb fracture model. Therefore, large ice floes are modeled as continuous objects made up of many bonded particles that can interact with each other, deform, and fracture. We generate particle configurations by discretizing the ice in MODIS satellite imagery into polygonal floes that fill the observed ice shape and extent. The model is tested on ice advecting through an idealized channel and through Nares Strait. The results indicate that the bonded DEM model is capable of qualitatively capturing the dynamic sea ice patterns through constrictions such as ice bridges, arch kinematic features, and lead formation. In addition, we apply spatial and temporal scaling analyses to illustrate the model's ability to capture heterogeneity and intermittency in the simulated ice deformation.

AB  - Wetland ecosystems are important habitats for many waterbird species, including the IUCN near -threatened Sunda Teal Anas gibberifrons, a species that inhabit wetlands in Indonesia. Muara Angke is one of few remaining wetlands located in Jakarta and has potential as an important habitat for Sunda Teal. This study aims to assess and model suitable habitat for near-threatened Sunda Teal in remaining wetlands in Muara Angke in Jakarta, Indonesia. The study areas include an ecotourism park, the western and eastern parts of the Angke protected forest, and the wildlife reserve. Remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) analysis were employed to assess Sunda Teal's habitat suitability. Some environmental variables negatively influencing habitat suitability for the species include the presence of fishponds and settlements, and represent anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, variables that may positively influence the species include the occurrence of gastropod and Crustacea, both groups being known as food resources, and mangrove cover. The highly and moderately suitable habitats were estimated to form 32.36% and 23.48% of the total wetlands, respectively. In contrast, 12.17% was considered unsuitable for Sunda Teal. The ecotourism park had the most unsuitable habitats. In contrast to the ecotourism park, the protected forest, followed by the wildlife reserve, had more moderately and highly suitable habitats.

TI  - University Social Responsibility from the Transformative Ecofeminism Perspective
T2  - QUALITATIVE REPORT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to find conceptual innovations, with a focus on the scope of University Social Responsibility in the perspective of transformative ecofeminism. The basic belief that guides action in this research is the transformative worldview. The research approach is based on feminism with the data collection process carried out by observation, in-depth interviews, documentation, and FGDs. The two data research rigour strategies chosen were to maintain the credibility (internal validity) and reliability of the research data through triangulation of techniques and sources and to carefully review the documentation of research procedures/protocols and databases. The presentation of data and the results of the study used a "spiral data analysis." This process was carried out by data management, making memos, categorizing, and interpreting data to presenting the final research report. The sample is stated with ten key informants used as participants. The results of the study provide a framework for the scope of USR, which consists of eight dimensions in which there are 27 indicators that direct the university's actions in realizing its social responsibility. IPE (Integrity, Professionalism, Entrepreneurship) organizational culture becomes a reinforcing value in realizing the goals of each dimension.

TI  - Isolation by Distance and Proximity to Urban Areas Affect Genetic Differentiation among Collections of English Sole (<i>Parophrys</i> <i>vetulus</i>, Family Pleuronectidae) in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean and Salish Sea
T2  - NORTHWEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The English sole (Parophrys vetulus, family Pleuronectidae) is an abundant ground fish used as a sentinel of marine pollution in the inland marine waters of Washington and Oregon. We used 15 microsatellite loci to evaluate patterns of genetic variability within and among 17 collections of sole from coastal sites and within the southern Salish Sea. Over 470 alleles were identified in 15 loci, and high levels of genetic richness, as estimated by expected heterozygosity (HE) and allele richness (AR), were detected. Fish sampled from coastal areas at the northern end of our study area had the lowest values of genetic richness, in contrast to collections at the southern end. The level of differentiation among all collections was low: mean FST value was 0.0006. Nineteen comparisons had statistically significant FST values (mean FST of 0.0029) and involved comparisons involving three locations associated with urban areas (Port Gardner [Everett, WA], Sinclair Inlet [Bremerton, WA], and Commencement Bay [Tacoma, WA]). A statistically significant, but weak, isolation-by-distance pattern was seen in the five coastal collections over 1,100 km of coastline. In the Salish Sea collections, the pattern of differentiation was patchy and marked by several distinctive collections in close proximity to urban areas. The pattern of differentiation in the Salish Sea parallels differences seen in ecotoxicological characteristics of the English sole that inhabit separate urban embayments differing in pollution characteristics. Future work can focus on evaluating the stability and meaningfulness of this subtle variability in a time of local and global environmental changes.

TI  - Can Mangrove Silviculture Be Carbon Neutral?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in peninsular Malaysia has been managed for pole and charcoal production from Rhizophora stands with a 30-year rotation cycle since 1902. The aim of this study is to estimate the carbon budget of the MMFR by considering the carbon stock of the forest, evaluated from remote sensing data (Landsat TM and ETM+, JERS-1 SAR, ALOS PALSAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, SRTM, TANDEM-X, and WorldView-2) for aboveground carbon and field data for belowground carbon. This was investigated in combination with the emissions from the silvicultural activities in the production chain, plus the distribution and consumer-related activities covering the supply chain, estimated with appropriate emission factors. The aboveground biomass carbon stock of the productive forest was of 1.4 TgC, while for the protective forest (not used for silviculture) it was at least equal to 1.2 TgC. The total soil carbon of ca. 32 TgC shows the potential of the MMFR as a carbon sink. However, the commercial exploitation of mangroves also generates greenhouse gasses with an estimate of nearly 152.80 Mg C ha(-1) during charcoal production and up to 0.53 Mg C ha(-1) during pole production, for a total emission of 1.8 TgC. Consequently, if the productive forest alone is considered, then the carbon budget is negative, and the ongoing silvicultural management seems to be an unsustainable practice that needs a reduction in the exploited area of at least 20% to achieve carbon neutrality. However, even with the current management, and considering the protective forest together with the productive zones, the MMFR carbon budget is slightly positive, thus showing the importance of mangrove conservation as part of the management for the preservation of the carbon stock.

TI  - A Framework for Assessing the Dynamic Coastlines Induced by Urbanization Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Fujian, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline plays an important role in indicating the conditions of social-economic development in the coastal zone. In this study, an integrated assessment framework was proposed to address the provincial and county-level spatiotemporal dynamics of continental coastlines from the perspectives of length, position, composition, and anthropogenic utilization quantitatively, and to explore the exact impacts of urbanization on coastline changes in the Fujian Province over the period from 1985 to 2020. Results showed that the total length of coastlines decreased first and then increased due to the different patterns of economic development. The proportion of artificial coastlines and the index of coastal utilization degree increased rapidly during the same period. Moreover, the seaward movement of coastlines due to the coastal reclamation projects resulted in a considerable increment in land areas. The pressure brought by the continuous concentration of population, built-up areas, and industrial districts under the rapid urbanization was the primary factor that increased the degree of anthropogenic disturbances in the coastal zone. Furthermore, the policies issued by the local or central government can be critical tipping points for coastline changes in different periods.

TI  - Variation of Aerosol Optical Depth Measured by Sun Photometer at a Rural Site near Beijing during the 2017-2019 Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has become one of the worst areas for haze pollution in China. Sun photometers are widely used for aerosol optical property monitoring due to the advantages of fully automatic acquisition, simple maintenance, standardization of data processing, and low uncertainty. Research sites are mostly concentrated in cities, while the long-term analysis of aerosol optical depth (AOD) for the pollution transmission channel in rural Beijing is still lacking. Here, we obtained an AOD monitoring dataset from August 2017 to March 2019 using the ground-based CE-318 sun photometer at the Gucheng meteorological observation site in southwest Beijing. These sun photometer AOD data were used for the ground-based validation of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) AOD data. It was found that MODIS and AHI can reflect AOD variation trends by sun photometer on daily, monthly, and seasonal scales. The original AOD measurements of the sun photometer show good correlations with satellite observations by MODIS (R = 0.97), and AHI (R = 0.89), respectively, corresponding to their different optimal spatial and temporal windows for matching with collocated satellite ground pixels. However, MODIS is less stable for aerosols of different concentrations and particle sizes. Most of the linear regression intercepts between the satellite and the photometer are less than 0.1, indicating that the errors due to surface reflectance in the inversion are small, and the slope is least biased (AHI: slope = 0.91, MODIS: slope = 0.18) in the noon period (11 a.m.-2 p.m.) and most biased in summer (AHI: slope = 0.77, MODIS: slope = 1.31), probably due to errors in the aerosol model. The daily and seasonal variation trends between CE-318 AOD measurements in the Gucheng site and fine particulate observations from the national air quality site nearby were also compared and investigated. In addition, a typical haze-dust complex pollution event in North China was analyzed and the changes in AOD during the pollution event were quantified. In processing, we use sun photometer and satellite AOD data in combination with meteorological and PM data. Overall, this paper has implications for the study of AOD evolution patterns at different time scales, the association between PM2.5 concentrations and AOD changes, and pollution monitoring.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution and Coupling Pattern Analysis of Urbanization and Ecological Environmental Quality of the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the interactive coupling mechanism between urbanization and eco-environmental quality is crucial to achieve the goal of urban sustainable development. The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) was taken as the research object, and the city nighttime light index (CNLI) and remote sensing ecological index with local adaptability (LARSEI) were constructed based on the data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Then, trend analysis, standard deviation ellipse (SDE), coupling degree (C), and coupling coordination degree (CCD) models were used to determine the spatiotemporal variation of urbanization and eco-environmental quality and its coupling relationship. The results show that: (1) the urbanization level of the CLP showed a trend of continuous improvement from 2000 to 2019. A significant increasing trend was found from the CNLI (slope(CNLI) = 0.0030 yr(-1), p < 0.01), and its value rose from 0.07 in 2000 to 0.14 in 2019. In terms of spatial distribution, a multi-core distribution pattern with provincial capital cities as the core was presented in the CLP. The cities expanded at different degrees and presented a gradual concentrated expansion towards the southeast on the whole. (2) The eco-environmental quality in the CLP greatly increased during 2000 to 2019. An area with an increasing trend in the remote sensing ecological index with local adaptability (LARSEI) accounted for 58.82% and was mainly concentrated in the west and central part of the CLP. (3) The C and CCD between urbanization and eco-environmental quality in the CLP presented a trend of significant increase during 2000 to 2019 (slope(C) = 0.0051 yr(-1), p < 0.01; slope(CCD) = 0.0040 yr(-1), p < 0.01). The cities with a higher coupling degree were mainly located in the southeastern and northern parts of the CLP, while those with a higher coordination degree were scattered in the marginal parts of the CLP. The research results can provide suggestions for decision-making to achieve high-quality coordinated development of the cities in the CLP.

TI  - Estimation of Terrestrial Net Primary Productivity in the Yellow River Basin of China Using Light Use Efficiency Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation is an essential factor of ecosystem functions, including the biological geochemical carbon cycle, which is often impacted by climate change and human activities. It plays a significant role in comprehending the nature of carbon balance in an ecosystem and demonstrates the global and regional carbon cycle dynamics. The present study used an upgraded CASA model to calculate the NPP in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. The model's simulation ability was improved by changing the model parameters. Further, the CASA model was validated by comparing with MODIS-NPP and in situ observed NPP, wherein the accuracy of the CASA model estimation was found satisfactory to estimate NPP changes in the study area. The simulated results of the improved CASA model showed that the mean annual NPP value of vegetation in the YRB was 283.4 gC m(-2) a(-1) from 2001 to 2020, with a declining trend in spatial distribution from south to north. In contrast, the NPP appeared as an increasing trend in the YRB temporally from 212 gC m(-2) a(-1) in 2001 to 342 gC m(-2) a(-1) in 2020, with a mean annual growth rate of 4.6 gC m(-2) a(-1). The total NPP in the YRB increased by 40,088.3 GgC between 2001 and 2020, from 226.06 TgC to 266.15 TgC. This rise can be attributed to the increase in forests. The average grassland area has reduced by 4651 km(2) during the last two decades, significantly impacting the total NPP of grasslands. Although the increase in NPP in wetlands was minimal, accounting for 815.53 GgC, the highest change percentage of 79.78%, could be observed among the six vegetation types due to the anthropogenic influences and climate change. The conditions favorable for vegetation growth and a sustained environment were enhanced by the increased precipitation and temperature and the reinforced ecological protection by the government.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - ACM SIGMETRICS/Performance conference
CL  - Mumbai, INDIA
AB  - Residential Internet speeds have been rapidly increasing, reaching averages of similar to 100 Mbps in most developed countries. Several studies have shown that users have way more bandwidth than they need, only using about 20-30% on a regular day. Several systems exploit this trend by enabling users to monetize their spare bandwidth, e.g., by sharing their WiFi connection or by participating in distributed proxy or VPN (dVPN) services. Despite the proliferation of such systems, little is known on how such marketplaces operate, what are the key factors that determine the price of the spare bandwidth, and how such prices differ worldwide. In this work, we shed some light on this topic using dVPNs as a use-case. We start by formalizing the problem of bandwidth monetization as an optimization between a buyer's cost and seller's income. Next, we explore three popular dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, and Tachyon) using both active and passive measurements. We find that dVPNs have a large and growing footprint, and offer comparable performance to their centralized counterpart. We identify Mysterium (in the US) as the most concrete realization of a bandwidth marketplace, for which we derive a value of spare Internet bandwidth ranging between 11 and 14 cents per GB. We also show that both buyers and sellers utilize ad-hoc "rules-of-thumb" when choosing their prices, which results in a sub-optimal marketplace. By applying our optimization, a seller's income can be tripled by setting a price lower than the default one which allows to attract more buyers. These observations motivate us to create RING, a first and concrete system which helps sellers to automatically adjust their prices and traffic volumes across multiple marketplaces.

TI  - Crop Classification Based on the Physically Constrained General Model-Based Decomposition Using Multi-Temporal RADARSAT-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop identification and classification are of great significance to agricultural land use management. The physically constrained general model-based decomposition (PCGMD) has proven to be a promising method in comparison with the typical four-component decomposition methods in scattering mechanism interpretation and identifying vegetation types. However, the robustness of PCGMD requires further investigation from the perspective of final applications. This paper aims to validate the efficiency of the PCGMD method on crop classification for the first time. Seven C-band time-series RADARSAT-2 images were exploited, covering the entire growing season over an agricultural region near London, Ontario, Canada. Firstly, the response and temporal evolution of the four scattering components obtained by PCGMD were analyzed. Then, a forward selection approach was applied to achieve the highest classification accuracy by searching an optimum combination of multi-temporal SAR data with the random forest (RF) algorithm. For comparison, the general model-based decomposition method (GMD), the original and its three improved Yamaguchi four-component decomposition approaches (Y4O, Y4R, S4R, G4U), were used in all tests. The results reveal that the PCGMD method is highly sensitive to seasonal crop changes and matches well with the real physical characteristics of the crops. Among all test methods used, the PCGMD method using six images obtained the optimum classification performance, reaching an overall accuracy of 91.83%.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The observations from satellite microwave-sounding instruments have been widely used in weather and climate studies. Since the data resolution varies with frequency and satellite viewing angle, it is normally required that the measurements at each frequency be resampled to obtain a uniform resolution prior to various applications. In this study, the ATOVS and AVHRR pre-processing package (AAPP) Fourier transform algorithm is modified for ATMS data and the results are compared with those derived from Backus-Gilbert inversion (BGI) and the original AAPP. From the simulated and observed ATMS data, we demonstrated the new algorithm has better results in terms of imaging quality and noise suppression, compared with BGI and AAPP. In general, our modified AAPP algorithm reduces the error by at least about 0.5 K in ATMS channels 2 and 6 and at all the viewing angles.

TI  - Integrating the Textural and Spectral Information of UAV Hyperspectral Images for the Improved Estimation of Rice Aboveground Biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and rapid estimation of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of rice is crucial to food security. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mounted with hyperspectral sensors can obtain images of high spectral and spatial resolution in a quick and effective manner. Integrating UAV-based spatial and spectral information has substantial potential for improving crop AGB estimation. Hyperspectral remote-sensing data with more continuous reflectance information on ground objects provide more possibilities for band selection. The use of band selection for the spectral vegetation index (VI) has been discussed in many studies, but few studies have paid attention to the band selection of texture features in rice AGB estimation. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral images of four rice varieties in five nitrogen treatments (N0, N1, N2, N3, and N4) were obtained. First, multiple spectral bands were used to identify the optimal bands of the spectral vegetation indices, as well as the texture features; next, the vegetation index model (VI model), the vegetation index combined with the corresponding-band textures model (VI+CBT model), and the vegetation index combined with the full-band textures model (VI+FBT model) were established to compare their respective rice AGB estimation abilities. The results showed that the optimal bands of the spectral and textural information for AGB monitoring were inconsistent. The red-edge and near-infrared bands demonstrated a strong correlation with the rice AGB in the spectral dimension, while the green and red bands exhibited a high correlation with the rice AGB in the spatial dimension. The ranking of the monitoring accuracies of the three models, from highest to lowest, was: the VI+FBT model, then the VI+CBT model, and then the VI model. Compared with the VI model, the R-2 of the VI+FBT model and the VI+CBT model increased by 1.319% and 9.763%, respectively. The RMSE decreased by 2.070% and 16.718%, respectively, while the rRMSE decreased by 2.166% and 16.606%, respectively. The results indicated that the integration of vegetation indices and textures can significantly improve the accuracy of rice AGB estimation. The full-band textures contained richer information that was highly related to rice AGB. The VI model at the tillering stage presented the greatest sensitivity to the integration of textures, and the models in the N3 treatment (1.5 times the normal nitrogen level) gave the best AGB estimation compared with the other nitrogen treatments. This research proposes a reliable modeling framework for monitoring rice AGB and provides scientific support for rice-field management.

TI  - Analysis of the common model error on velocity field under Colored noise model by GPS and InSAR: A case study in the Nepal and everest region
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of the velocity field will be affected by the noise model and common mode errors through GPS time series analysis. In order to analyze the influence of these two factors on the accuracy of the velocity field, two kinds of data are used, including the three-year observation from 20 permanent GPS stations with high spatial correlation in the Everest, which is about 650 km from north to south and 1068 km from east to west, and three-year 80 ascending images and 141 descending images from sentinel-1A, which are processed by GAMIT/GLOBK software and Small Baseline Subset-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar method (SBAS-InSAR), respectively. The vertical deformation rate is solved by time series analysis through a self-made adaptive algorithm. In the analysis, the linear change rate, period, half period coefficient, and residual sequence of all stations are solved by using James L. Davis periodic model. The noise type of residual sequence is analyzed by the power spectrum model. The spatio-temporal correlated noise, Common Mode Error (CME), is extracted by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Karhunen-Loeve (KLE) methods. The results show that noises can be best described by "flicker noise + white noise" model. After the removal of CME, the R-2 estimates of all stations are above 0.8, with RMS value of velocity field decreasing from 1.428 mm/yr to 1.062 mm/yr and 1.063 mm/ yr to 0.815 mm/yr, in N and E directions, respectively, indicating that the influence of CME can't be ignored in the extraction of the high-precision velocity field in the Nepal and Everest region.

TI  - Evaluation for Appropriate Tillage of Sandy Land in Arid Sandy Area Based on Limitation Factor Exclusion Method
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating and evaluating the quantity and spatial distribution of arable sandy land in arid and semiarid sandy areas is of great significance for the sustainable development and utilization of sandy land resources and the maintenance of the stability of the structure and function of regional ecosystems. Based on the characteristics of sandy soil, being without structure and susceptible to wind erosion, this study used the limiting factor exclusion method to investigate and evaluate arable sandy land in arid and semiarid areas. All sandy soils were taken as the evaluation objects of arable sandy land (including visible sandy land and invisible sandy land). On the basis of following the principle of ecological protection, the evaluation indicators and limiting factor exclusion evaluation methods of arable sandy land were determined. The results of Hangjin Banner are as follows: the total area of the visible sandy land and the recessive sandy land was 1.2 x 106 hm(2); the visible sandy land accounted for 42.6%, and the invisible sandy land accounted for 57.5%. However, only 7.7% of the sandy land was suitable for farming, which is the current cultivated land of bare sand and sandy soil, extremely-low-coverage grassland, inland tidal flats, and other saline-alkali land. Even if these arable sandy lands are to be used sustainably after reclamation, reasonable ecological protection, irrigation engineering measures, and field protective farming measures must be taken. It is hoped that this study can provide a valuable reference for the sustainable development and utilization of arable sandy land and desertification control in arid and semiarid areas.

TI  - Impact of land cover transformation on urban heat islands in Harbin, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - At the local and regional climate scale, one of the most studied environmental issues is urban heat island (UHI). UHI is a thermal anomaly caused by temperature differences between urban and rural settings, which adds heat to the atmosphere and makes people feel uncomfortable. This study explores the influence of new land-cover data on UHI simulations using the high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM) in the city of Harbin. A comparison was performed between the new Tsinghua University (TU) land cover dataset with the default United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover datasets. The results of this study revealed that the new TU land cover data had better representation and more realistic land cover changes than the default datasets. The diurnal, seasonal, and long-term nighttime UHIs of air and surface temperatures were higher than the daytime UHIs for both downtown Harbin and the satellite towns. We discovered that coal-burning during winter had a significant influence on UHI in Harbin. Moreover, the results from our buffer revealed a rapid increase in the UHIs of satellite towns, thus revealing the need to focus on the effects of UHI in satellite towns in the future. Therefore, the timely updating of land cover datasets in the WRF model and implementing mitigation strategies will help improve the urban climatic comfort.

T2  - TURK DILI VE EDEBIYATI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF TURKISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Servet-i Ranun literature represents one of the most celebrated periods in Turkish literary history, both for the innovations it introduced and the stages it skipped. The Edebiyat-1 Cedide Library constituted a book series that assembled printed works by prominent authors of the Servet-i Funun literary circle. This series has a unity of purpose that clearly presents the worldview, expectations from life and art, aesthetic perceptions, and thinking of the Servet-i Rinun generation at the level of the press. Significantly, the series also offers important clues about the social and political conditions of the period. The practices surrounding the publication of the books in this series directly reflect the pattern of censorship during these same years and the Sultan of this period, Abdulhamid II. Over the 16 years from 1899 to 1915, 35 individual volumes in the series were published. In this article, the origin of this series, the titles and authors of individual works, the characteristics of the published volumes, and the relationship of the series with its own period will be examined. As will be seen, the series bears traces of the dynamics of today's sociology of literature, but also has parallels with conditions at the time of its publication.

TI  - Mapping Spatiotemporal Changes in Forest Type and Aboveground Biomass from Landsat Long-Term Time-Series Analysis-A Case Study from Yaoluoping National Nature Reserve, Anhui Province of Eastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A natural reserve's forest is an important base for promoting natural education, scientific research, biodiversity conservation and carbon accounting. Dynamic monitoring of the forest type and forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a nature reserve is an important foundation for assessing the forest succession stage and trend. Based on the Landsat images covering the National Nature Reserve of Yaoluoping in Anhui province spanning from 1987 to 2020, a total of 42 Landsat scenes, the forest cover product set was first developed by using the well-established vegetation change tracker (VCT) model. On this basis, a new vegetation index, NDVI_DR, which considers the phenological characteristics of different forest types, was proposed to distinguish coniferous forest from broad-leaved forest. Next, multiple modeling factors, including remote sensing spectral signatures, vegetation indices, textural measures derived from gray level co-occurrence matrix and wavelet analysis and topographic attributes, were compiled to model the AGB in 2011 by forest type separately by using the stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithm. Then, using the 2011 Landsat image as the base, all the Landsat images in the other years involved in the modelling were relatively normalized by using the weighted invariant pixels (WIP) method, followed by an extrapolation of the 2011 AGB model to other years to create a time-series of AGB. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the VCT-based forest classification products was over 90%. The annual forest type classifications derived from NDVI_DR thresholding gained an overall accuracy above 92%, with a kappa coefficient above 0.8. The 2011 forest-type-dependent SGB-based AGB estimation model achieved an independent validation R-2 at 0.63 and an RMSE at 11.18 t/ha for broad-leaved forest, and 0.61 and 14.26 t/ha for coniferous forest. The mapped time-series of AGB showed a gradual increasing trend over the past three decades. The driving factors responsible for the observed forest cover and AGB changes were analyzed to provide references for reasonable protection and development. The proposed methodology is a reliable tool for evaluating the management status, which can be extended to other similar regions.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning-Based Snow Depth Estimates and Development of a New Operational Retrieval Algorithm over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth estimation with passive microwave (PM) remote sensing is challenged by spatial variations in the Earth's surface, e.g., snow metamorphism, land cover types, and topography. Thus, traditional static snow depth retrieval algorithms cannot capture snow thickness well. In this study, we present a new operational retrieval algorithm, hereafter referred to as the pixel-based method (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid-level), to provide more accurate and nearly real-time snow depth estimates. First, the reference snow depth was retrieved using a previously proposed model in which a microwave snow emission model was coupled with a machine learning (ML) approach. In this process, an effective grain size (effGS) value was optimized by utilizing the snow microwave emission model, and then the nonlinear relationship between snow depth and multiple predictive variables, e.g., effGS, longitude, elevation, and brightness temperature (Tb) gradients, was established with the ML technique to retrieve reference snow depth data. To select a robust and well-performing ML approach, we compared the performance of widely used support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms over China. The results show that the three ML models performed similarly in snow depth estimation, which was attributed to the inclusion of effGS in the training samples. In this study, the RF model was used to retrieve the snow depth reference dataset due to its slightly stronger robustness according to our comparison of results. Second, the pixel-based algorithm was built based on the retrieved reference snow depth dataset and satellite Tb observations (18.7 GHz and 36.5 GHz) from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) during the 2012-2020 period. For the pixel-based algorithm, the fitting coefficients were achieved dynamically pixel by pixel, making it superior to the traditional static methods. Third, the built pixel-based algorithm was verified using ground-based observations and was compared to the AMSR2, GlobSnow-v3.0, and ERA5-land products during the 2012-2020 period. The pixel-based algorithm exhibited an overall unbiased root mean square error (unRMSE) and R-2 of 5.8 cm and 0.65, respectively, outperforming GlobSnow-v3.0, with unRMSE and R-2 values of 9.2 cm and 0.22, AMSR2, with unRMSE and R-2 values of 18.5 cm and 0.13, and ERA5-land, with unRMSE and R-2 values of 10.5 cm and 0.33, respectively. However, the pixel-based algorithm estimates were still challenged by the complex terrain, e.g., the unRMSE was up to 17.4 cm near the Tien Shan Mountains. The proposed pixel-based algorithm in this study is a simple and operational method that can retrieve accurate snow depths based solely on spaceborne PM data in comparatively flat areas.

TI  - The Impacts of Hydrology and Climate on Hydrological Connectivity in a Complex River-Lake Floodplain System Based on High Spatiotemporal Resolution Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The drivers that determine the hydrological connectivity (HC) are complex and interrelated, and disentangling this complexity will improve the administration of the river-lake interconnection system. Dongting Lake, as a typical river-lake interconnected system, is freely connected with the Yangtze River and their HC plays a major role in keeping the system healthy. Climate, hydrology, and anthropogenic activities are associated with the HC. In this study, hydrological drivers were divided into the total flow of three inlets (T-flow) and the total flow of four tributaries (F-flow). To elucidate the HC of the Dongting Lake, HC was calculated by geostatistical methods in association with Sentinel-2 remote sensing images. Then, the structural equation model (SEM) was used to quantify the impacts of hydrology (F-flow, and T-flow) and meteorology (precipitation, evaporation, and temperature) on HC. The geostatistical analysis results demonstrated that the HC showed apparent seasonal change. For East and West Dongting Lake, the dominant element was north-south hydrological connectivity (N-S HC), and the restricted was west-east hydrological connectivity (W-E HC), but the dominant element was E-W HC and the restricted was N-S HC in South Dongting Lake. The results of SEM showed that N-S HC was mainly explained by T-flow (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) and F-flow (r = 0.28, p < 0.05). T-flow, temperature (r = 0.33, p < 0.05), and F-flow explained E-W HC. The finding of this work supports the management of both the Dongting Lake floodplain and other similar river-lake floodplain systems.

AB  - The High-spectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder II(HIRAS-II)is a Fourier transform spectrometer onboard the world's first civil early-morning-orbiting FengYun 3E(FY-3E)meteorological satellite,the FY- 3E/HIRAS-II focus on a number of upgrades such as the sensitivity of the detector,the accuracy of spectral calibration and radiometric calibration,with the designed and manufactured processing based on the first Chinese hyperspectral infrared(IR)sounder FY-3D/HIRAS-I. We conducted a comprehensive pre-launch thermal vacuum(TVAC)calibration tests for HIRAS-II, including the nonlinearity(NL)correction which consists an essential part of radiometric calibration,the NL correction has considerable effects on radiometric accuracy. According to the HIRAS-II nonlinear behavior of the detectors for long-wave(LW)and mid-wave1(MW1)infrared spectral bands,the NL correction of raw data in the spectral domain is a scaling of the observed spectrum,the NL correction coefficients are derived by the methods of minimizing the spread of the responsivity of reconstructed spectrum in each wavenumber with varying temperature,or minimizing the spread of the bias of brightness temperature among calibration targets with varying temperature. The bias of spectral brightness temperature is assessed by comparing the NL correction and the non-NL correction radiometric calibration data,the results show that,the radiometric accuracy has been significantly improved via NL correction.

TI  - Changes of SOC Content in China's Shendong Coal Mining Area during 1990-2020 Investigated Using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining, an important human activity, disturbs soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and decomposition, eventually affecting terrestrial carbon cycling and the sustainability of human society. However, changes of SOC content and their relation with influential factors in coal mining areas remained unclear. In the study, predictive models of SOC content were developed based on field sampling and Landsat images for different land-use types (grassland, forest, farmland, and bare land) of the largest coal mining area in China (i.e., Shendong). The established models were employed to estimate SOC content across the Shendong mining area during 1990-2020, followed by an investigation into the impacts of climate change and human disturbance on SOC content by a Geo-detector. Results showed that the models produced satisfactory results (R-2 > 0.69, p < 0.05), demonstrating that SOC content over a large coal mining area can be effectively assessed using remote sensing techniques. Results revealed that average SOC content in the study area rose from 5.67 gC center dot kg(-1) in 1990 to 9.23 gC center dot kg(-1) in 2010 and then declined to 5.31 gC center dot Kg(-1) in 2020. This could be attributed to the interaction between the disturbance of soil caused by coal mining and the improvement of eco-environment by land reclamation. Spatially, the SOC content of farmland was the highest, followed by grassland, and that of bare land was the lowest. SOC accumulation was inhibited by coal mining activities, with the effect of high-intensity mining being lower than that of moderate- and low-intensity mining activities. Land use was found to be the strongest individual influencing factor for SOC content changes, while the interaction between vegetation coverage and precipitation exerted the most significant influence on the variability of SOC content. Furthermore, the influence of mining intensity combined with precipitation was 10 times higher than that of mining intensity alone.

TI  - Magnetic Activity on Four Short-period Contact Binaries: V0576 Peg, KW Psc, V0873 Per, and FY Boo
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We presented new photometry for four short-period late-type binaries, observed by three small telescopes in China from 2020 September to 2021 December. Seven sets of light curves (including the TESS data for FY Boo) were analyzed by using the W-D method. Three binaries (V0576 Peg, V0873 Per, and FY Boo) are W-type binaries with q similar or equal to 2.5, while KW Psc is an A-type binary with q similar or equal to 0.43. Max.I-Max.II is up to 10% of variable light amplitude for the asymmetric light curves, which are modeled by a dark spot on the surface of the more massive component. Photometric results imply the existence of movement and evolution of the cool spot. From the temperature-luminosity and mass-luminosity diagrams, the more massive components are a bit evolved main-sequence stars, while the less massive ones are oversized and overluminous owing to energy exchange. Orbital period analyses indicate that the cyclic oscillations occur in the (O - C) curves. Their modulated periods approach 11 yr, which may preferably result from the magnetic activity cycle for four late-type contact binaries. With angular momentum loss through magnetic braking, these short-period contact binaries may evolve into deep-contact configurations.

TI  - The Classification Method Study of Crops Remote Sensing with Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction and classification of crops is the core issue of agricultural remote sensing. The precise classification of crop types is of great significance to the monitoring and evaluation of crops planting area, growth, and yield. Based on the Google Earth Engine and Google Colab cloud platform, this study takes the typical agricultural oasis area of Xiangride Town, Qinghai Province, as an example. It compares traditional machine learning (random forest, RF), object-oriented classification (object-oriented, OO), and deep neural networks (DNN), which proposes a random forest combined with deep neural network (RF+DNN) classification framework. In this study, the spatial characteristics of band information, vegetation index, and polarization of main crops in the study area were constructed using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The temporal characteristics of crops phenology and growth state were analyzed using the curve curvature method, and the data were screened in time and space. By comparing and analyzing the accuracy of the four classification methods, the advantages of RF+DNN model and its application value in crops classification were illustrated. The results showed that for the crops in the study area during the period of good growth and development, a better crop classification result could be obtained using RF+DNN classification method, whose model accuracy, training, and predict time spent were better than that of using DNN alone. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of classification were 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. It is also higher than the classification accuracy of random forest (OA = 0.87, Kappa = 0.82), object oriented (OA = 0.78, Kappa = 0.70) and deep neural network (OA = 0.93, Kappa = 0.90). The scalable and simple classification method proposed in this paper gives full play to the advantages of cloud platform in data and operation, and the traditional machine learning combined with deep learning can effectively improve the classification accuracy. Timely and accurate extraction of crop types at different spatial and temporal scales is of great significance for crops pattern change, crops yield estimation, and crops safety warning.

TI  - THE IDEA OF CULTURAL CENTRISM IN MODERN RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of "cultural centrism" was traditionally used to characterize Russian philosophy of the 19th century, which was called culture-centric, since the issue of Russia's cultural identity was at the center of its attention. In Soviet Russia, the idea of culture-centrism fades into the background, as Marxist-Leninist philosophy positions culture as a superstructure on top of the economic basis. In post-Soviet Russia, as a result of the crisis of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, a serious epistemological shift is taking place - a transition from a formational approach to a civilizational one. Within the framework of the latter, culture is defined as the basis - the fundamental factor of social development. Thus, the idea of culture-centrism is actualized. The paper provides the analysis of various interpretations of the idea of culture-centrism in Russian philosophy of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The purpose of the study is to highlight the assessment of the worldview and methodological potential of this idea by leading Russian philosophers. The methodological apparatus of the research results out of synthesis of methods: qualitative content analysis in its historical and philosophical version, hermeneutics and comparative studies. The authors represent both apologetic and critical positions regarding the understanding of the worldview and methodological potential of the idea of cultural centrism, consider the possibility of turning this idea into the principle of social being and cognition. In conclusion, the paper comes up with the statement that the fate of the idea of culture-centrism in Russian philosophy will ultimately depend on how it manages to gain conceptual validity and scientific rigor.

TI  - Simulation of Land Surface Temperature Inversion for Stratospheric Sensor
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to accurately obtain land surface temperature (LST) from stratospheric platform, a simulation data set was established based on the SeeBor atmospheric profile training dataset and MODIS split window channel parameters. Firstly, the effectiveness of the general split window algorithm obtaining surface temperature at stratospheric altitude was analyzed; then, the sensitivities of several key parameters such as observation height, emissivity, water vapor content, noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD), and spectral response drift were analyzed. The LST simulation shows a theoretical error of 0.185 K, in which the emissivity and NETD dominate inversion error. Finally, the deviation constraint demand of different influencing factors is analyzed. Results show that if the uncertainty of emissivity and NETD can be controlled within 1% and 0.4 K, respectively, with spectral response drift within +/- 3 nm, the temperature inversion accuracy can be better than 2 K.

TI  - Climate Drivers of Pine Shoot Beetle Outbreak Dynamics in Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of pine shoot beetles (Tomicus spp.) have caused widespread tree mortality in Southwest China. However, the understanding of the role of climatic drivers in pine shoot beetle outbreaks is limited. This study aimed to characterize the relationships between climate variables and pine shoot beetle outbreaks in the forests of Yunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis Franch) in Southwest China. The pine shoot beetle-infested total area from 2000 to 2017 was extracted from multi-data Landsat images and obtained from field survey plots. A temporal prediction model was developed by partial least squares regression. The results indicated that multi consecutive year droughts was the strongest predictor, as such a condition greatly reduced the tree resistance to the beetles. The beetle-infested total area increased with spring temperature, associated with a higher success rate of trunk colonization and accelerated larval development. Warmer temperatures and longer solar radiation duration promoted flight activity during the trunk transfer to the shoot period and allowed the completion of sister broods. Multi consecutive year droughts combined with the warmer temperatures and higher solar radiation duration could provide favorable conditions for shoot beetle outbreaks. Generally, identifying the climate variables that drive pine shoot beetle outbreaks could help improve current strategies for outbreak control.

TI  - Spatial Scale Effect and Correction of Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is critically important for forest dynamics in the carbon cycle. However, large-scale AGB mapping applications from remote sensing data still carry large uncertainty. In this study, an AGB estimation model was first established with three different remote sensing datasets of GF-2, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. Next, the optimal scale estimation result was considered as a reference AGB to obtain the relative true AGB distribution at different scales based on the law of conservation of mass, and the error of the scale effect of AGB estimation at various spatial resolutions was analyzed. Then, the information entropy of land use type was calculated to identify the heterogeneity of pixels. Finally, a scale conversion method for the entropy-weighted index was developed to correct the scale error of the estimated AGB results from coarse-resolution remote sensing images. The results showed that the random forest model had better prediction accuracy for GF-2 (4 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Landsat-8 (30 m) AGB mapping. The determination coefficient between predicted and measured AGB was 0.5711, 0.4819 and 0.4321, respectively. Compared to uncorrected AGB, R-2 between scale-corrected results and relative true AGB increased from 0.6226 to 0.6725 for Sentinel-2, and increased from 0.5910 to 0.6704 for Landsat-8. The scale error was effectively corrected. This study can provide a reference for forest AGB estimation and scale error reduction for AGB production upscaling with consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of the forest surface.

TI  - Comparative Study on Recognition Models of Black-Odorous Water in Hangzhou Based on GF-2 Satellite Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the ability of remote sensing technology in recognizing black-odorous water bodies in Hangzhou, this study analyzed the typical spectral characteristics of black-odorous water in Hangzhou based on measured spectral data and water quality parameters, including the transparency, dissolved oxygen, oxidation reduction potential, and ammonia nitrogen. The single-band threshold method, the normalized difference black-odorous water index (NDBWI) model, the black-odorous water index (BOI) model, and the color purity on a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) model were compared to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the black-odorous water in Hangzhou. The results showed that: (1) The remote sensing reflectance of black-odorous water was lower than that of ordinary water, the spectral curve was gentle, and the wave peak shifted toward the near-infrared direction in the wavelength range of 650-850 nm; (2) Among the aforementioned models, the normalized and improved normalized black-odorous water index methods had a higher accuracy, reaching 87.5%, and the threshold values for black-odorous water identification were 0.14 and 0.1, respectively; (3) From 2015 to 2018, the quantity of black-odorous water in the main urban area of Hangzhou showed a decreasing trend, and black-odorous water was mainly distributed in the Gongshu District and tended to appear in narrow rivers, densely populated areas, and factory construction sites. This study is expected to be of great practical value for the rapid tracking and monitoring of urban black-odorous water by using remote sensing technology for future work.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring and evaluation of ecological environment quality in Zhouqu County, Gansu, China based on Google Earth Engine cloud platform.
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Zhouqu County is located in the transition region from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the Qinba Mountains, and is an important part of the ecological barrier in the upper stream of the Yangtze River. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine cloud processing platform to perform inter-image optimal reconstruction of Landsat surface reflectance images from 1998-2019. We calculated four indicators of regional wet, green, dry, and hot. The component indicators were coupled by principal component analysis to construct remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of ecological environment quality in Zhouqu County. The results showed that the contribution of the four component indicators to the eigenvalues of the coupled RSEI were above 70%, with even distribution of the loadings, indicating that the RSEI integrated most of the features of the component indicators. From 1998 to 2019, the RSEI of Zhouqu County ranged from 0.55 to 0.63, showing an increasing trend with a growth rate of 0.04 center dot(10 a)(-1), and the area of better grade increased by 425.56 km(2). The area with altitude <= 2200 m was dominated by medium and lower ecological environment quality grade, while the area of bet. ter ecological environment quality grade area increased by 16.5%. The ecological and environmental quality of the region from 2200 to 3300 m was dominated by good grades, increasing to 71.3% in 2019, with the area of medium and below ecological and environmental quality grades decreasing year by year. The area with altitude >= 3300 m was dominated by the medium ecological quality grade. The medium and below ecological quality grades showed a "U" shape trend during the study period. The trend of ecological environment quality in Zhouqu County was becoming better, but with fluctuations. It is necessary to continuously strengthen the protection and management of ecological environment in order to guarantee the continuous improvement of ecological environment quality.

TI  - Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Images Using a Spectral Attention Mechanism
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many visual applications require high-resolution images for an adequate interpretation of the data stored within them. In remote sensing, the appearance of satellites such as Sentinel or Landsat has facilitated the access to data thanks to their free offer of multispectral images. However, the spatial resolution of these satellites is insufficient for many tasks. Therefore, the objective of this work is to apply deep learning techniques to increase the resolution of the Sentinel-2 Read-Green-Blue-NIR (RGBN) bands from the original 10 m to 2.5 m. This means multiplying the number of pixels in the resulting image by 4, improving the perception and visual quality. In this work, we implement a state-of-the-art residual learning-based model called Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), which we train using PlanetScope-Sentinel pairs of images. Our model, named SARNet (Spectral Attention Residual Network), incorporates Residual Channel Attention Blocks (RCAB) to improve the performance of the network and the visual quality of the results. The experiments we have carried out show that SARNet offers better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - On Proximity of Thinking and Poetizing in Early Heidegger. A Search for Traces
T2  - PHAINOMENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the question of the role of the relationship between thinking and poetizing, which is of immense importance for Heidegger's late work, in his early hermeneutics of facticity. Heidegger's early thinking is denoted with the search for the unconditionality of factical life in its historicity that cannot be comprehended neither under the conditions of a worldview nor of a strict science in Husserl's sense. In his search, he continually encounters the realms of art and poetry, which he experiences as fundamental points of orientation. Although Heidegger does not expressly reflect upon them, such experiences of the proximity of thinking and poetizing did leave traces in his lectures.

TI  - Modeling of the Calm Situations in the Atmosphere of Almaty
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer of the city of Almaty (Kazakhstan) in stagnant, environmentally unfavorable conditions using WRF Model. The city is located on the northern slope of Trans-Ili Alatau, where the rate of recurrence of calm and low-wind (1-2 m/sec) days reaches about 80%. All simulations were made for a period from 28.11.2016 to 05.12.2016, covering main synoptic situations of the stagnant atmosphere: the extent of Asian anticyclone, higher and lower pressure gradient fields. The model integrated three nested domains with grid sizes 9, 3 and 1 km, respectively. The initial boundary conditions were formed based on ERA5-reanalysis. Subject to the WRF model requirements, the land-use map with a standard USGS set (24 categories) was developed, to which 3 categories of the urban areas were added. The most relevant configuration of parameterization methods was selected: short-wave and long-wave radiation (Mlawer), surface layer (Monin-Obukhov similarity theory), urban area (BEP), boundary layer (Bougeault-Lacarrere), turbulence (Smagorinsky). The article demonstrates that the WRF model adequately reflects fundamental urban atmosphere patterns in the most unfavorable anticyclone periods of the autumn-winter season. It was established that the accuracy of estimates decreases with the transition to weak cyclonic activity. Based on the simulation results and remote sensing data, the territory in question is divided into four climatic zones to which a comparative method was applied; however for a detailed correlative analysis a denser network of meteorological stations is required. Calculations showed that the wind along the Ili river valley prevails in the northern part, regularly changing its western direction to eastern. Near the mountain area mountain-valley wind circulation prevails. The blocking inversion layer has a strong impact. The urban heat islands strongly depend on wind conditions. For example, a nocturnal heat island is cooled by the cold wind flow from the mountains.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is the first to come up with a comparative analysis of I. A. Bunin "Above the city" (1900) and "Chapel" (1944). The author aims to trace the creative and ideological evolution of I. A. Bunin. The grounds for comparison are the similarity of the key plot situations and likeness of the motive and figurative structures of the stories. The stories are based on the same key plot situation - a man on the border. At the same time, the motive structure of both stories is formed on the basis of the poetics of contrasts. The study reveals key antithetical motifs that create the "two worlds" of stories: children - adults; top - bottom; "here" - "there"; light - darkness; cold warm; "past" - "present"; "living" - "dead". The paper establishes that the contrast manifests itself in the key oppositions of the texts of both stories and realizes at all levels of the works (ideological and thematic, the level of the figurative system, the motive level) and turns out to be the most important property of Bunin's poetics, both "early" (pre-revolutionary) and "late" (emigrant) periods. At the same time, the comparative analysis shows that, despite the similarity and "evolutionary nature" of the motive and figurative structures of the stories, they have an opposite compositional orientation, so that the same plot situation receives a diametrically opposite resolution in the stories. It appears that I. A. Bunin goes through the "reverse" worldview evolution from the story "Above the city" (1900) to "The Chapel" (1944).

TI  - A Newly Developed Algorithm for Cloud Shadow Detection-TIP Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The masking of cloud shadows in optical satellite imagery is an important step in automated processing chains. A new method (the TIP method) for cloud shadow detection in multi-spectral satellite images is presented and compared to current methods. The TIP method is based on the evaluation of thresholds, indices and projections. Most state-of-the-art methods solemnly rely on one of these evaluation steps or on a complex working mechanism. Instead, the new method incorporates three basic evaluation steps into one algorithm for easy and accurate cloud shadow detection. Furthermore the performance of the masking algorithms provided by the software packages ATCOR ("Atmospheric Correction") and PACO ("Python-based Atmospheric Correction") is compared with that of the newly implemented TIP method on a set of 20 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe, covering a wide variety of environments and climates. The algorithms incorporated in each piece of masking software use the class of cloud shadows, but they employ different rules and class-specific thresholds. Classification results are compared to the assessment of an expert human interpreter. The class assignment of the human interpreter is considered as reference or "truth". The overall accuracies for the class cloud shadows of ATCOR and PACO (including TIP) for difference areas of the selected scenes are 70.4% and 76.6% respectively. The difference area encompasses the parts of the classification image where the classification maps disagree. User and producer accuracies for the class cloud shadow are strongly scene-dependent, typically varying between 45% and 95%. The experimental results show that the proposed TIP method based on thresholds, indices and projections can obtain improved cloud shadow detection performance.

TI  - Research on Inversion and Correction Method of Urban Light Environment Based on Cooperative Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuously growing city size and the increasingly complex and changeable light environment in the city, remote sensing and ground-measured technologies have certain limitations in the research of urban night light environment. The ground-measured data are accurate but low in efficiency and small in scale, while the night-light remote sensing data have the characteristics of high accuracy and large coverage. In this paper, high-resolution night-light remote sensing data and high-accuracy ground-measured data were used to establish an urban ground light environment inversion method with the advantages of remote sensing and ground-measured data in a "space-ground collaboration" approach. A ground database is constructed in GIS based on 26,000 ground measurement data of 4 blocks, 3 spatial perspectives, and 3 light environment parameters. Based on the comparison of the numerical relationship between the measured data of each light environment parameter and each window, the horizontal window is selected as the target window for the ground night light environment inversion research. The urban night light environment inversion method based on the correlation between telemetry and ground- measurement is used to construct and compare the correlation between Luojia night light radiance data and 9 sets of measured data of different ground windows and different light environment parameters. The illuminance measured data of horizontal window and Luojia radiance data, both of which are highly correlated, are selected for regression analysis. The mathematical inversion model of ground illuminance is constructed based on the cubic polynomial model with the lowest RMSE among the six regression models. The inversion result not only has photometric calibration, but also is superior to the original data in terms of population data relevance and accuracy.

TI  - Spatiotemporal neural network for estimating surface NO2 concentrations over north China and their human health impact
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important reactive gas pollutant harmful to human health. The spatiotemporal coverage provided by traditional NO2 monitoring methods is insufficient, especially in the suburban and rural areas of north China, which have a high population density and experience severe air pollution. In this study, we implemented a spatiotemporal neural network (STNN) model to estimate surface NO2 from multiple sources of information, which included satellite and in situ measurements as well as meteorological and geographical data. The STNN predicted NO2 with high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 and a root mean squared error of 5.8 mu g/m3 for sample-based 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the surface NO2 concentration determined by the STNN, we analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal trends of NO2 pollution in north China. We found substantial drops in surface NO2 concentrations ranging between 9.1% and 33.2% for large cities during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown when compared to those in 2019. Moreover, we estimated the all-cause deaths attributed to NO2 exposure at a high spatial resolution of about 1 km, with totals of 6082, 4200, and 18,210 for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Provinces in 2020, respectively. We observed remarkable regional differences in the health impacts due to NO2 among urban, suburban, and rural areas. Generally, the STNN model could incorporate spatiotemporal neighboring information and infer surface NO2 concentration with full coverage and high accuracy. Compared with machine learning regression techniques, STNN can effectively avoid model overfitting and simultaneously consider both spatial and temporal correlations of input variables using deep convolutional networks with residual blocks. The use of the proposed STNN model, as well as the surface NO2 dataset, can benefit air quality monitoring, forecasting, and health burden assessments.

TI  - Monitoring the Ice Thickness in High-Order Rivers on the Tibetan Plateau with Dual-Polarized C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice on the Tibetan Plateau has important impacts on the ecosystem and hydrology. High-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an important tool for monitoring the thickness of river ice in high-altitude areas without ground data. However, due to the complex topography and narrow width, it remains challenging to monitor the ice thickness of high-order rivers (high-level branches in the plateau river system) on the Tibetan Plateau using SAR. Therefore, this paper focuses on inverting the ice thickness by utilizing dual-polarized C-band radar data. We select a typical watershed in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, namely, the Babao River basin (including the Babao River and Binggou River), as the study area. The results show the following: (1) Dual-polarized C-band radar data have the potential to monitor the ice thickness of high-order rivers. The RMSEs of the Babao and Binggou Rivers are 0.109 m and 0.258 m, respectively. (2) Ascending and descending orbit radar images perform differently in retrieving the ice thicknesses of rivers with different directions. (3) The thickness of river ice affects the inversion accuracy. (4) Polarization parameters have varying explanatory capacities depending on the river characteristics. Our findings can provide a reference for the subsequent development of highly generalizable river ice inversion equations using dual-polarized radar data.

TI  - Understanding Photolysis of CH<sub>3</sub>ONO<sub>2</sub> with on-the-fly Nonadiabatic Dynamics Simulation at the ADC(2) Level
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The nonadiabatic dynamics of methyl nitrate (CH3ONO2) is studied with the on-the-fly trajectory surface hopping dynamics at the ADC(2) level. The results confirmed the existence of the ultrafast nonadiabatic decay to the electronic ground state. When the dynamics starts from S-1 and S-2, the photoproducts are CH3O+NO2, consistent with previous results obtained from the experimental studies and theoretical dynamics simulations at more accurate XMS-CASPT2 level. The photolysis products are CH3O+NO2 at the ADC(2) level when the dynamics starts from S-3, while different photolysis products were obtained in previous experimental and theoretical works. These results demonstrate that the ADC(2) method may still be useful for treating the photolysis mechanism of CH3ONO2 at the long-wavelength UV excitation, while great caution should be paid due to its inaccurate performance in the description of the photolysis dynamics at the short-wavelength UV excitation. This gives valuable information to access the accuracy when other alkyl nitrates are treated at the ADC(2) level.

TI  - Mapping the Long-Term Evolution of the Post-Event Deformation of the Guang'an Village Landslide, Chongqing, China Using Multibaseline InSAR Techniques
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 October 2017, days of heavy rainfall triggered a landslide in Guang'an Village, Wuxi County, Chongqing, China. According to the field investigation after the incident, there is still a massive accumulation body, which could possibly reactivate the landslide. In this study, to explore the long-term evolution of the deformation after the initial Guang'an Village Landslide, a time-series InSAR technique (TS-InSAR) was applied to the 128 ascending Sentinel-1A datasets spanning from October 2017 to March 2022. A new approach is proposed to enhance the conventional TS-InSAR method by integrating LiDAR data into the TS-InSAR process chain. The spatial-temporal evolution of post-event deformation over the Guang'an Village Landslide is analyzed based on the time-series results. It is found that the post-event deformation can be divided into three main stages: the post-failure stage, the post-failure and reactivation stage, and the reactivation stage. It is also suggested that, although the study area is currently under the reactivation stage, there are two active deformation zones that may become the origin of a secondary landslide triggered by heavy rainfall in the future. Moreover, the nearby Yaodunzi landslide might also play an important role in the generation and reactivation of a secondary Guang'an Village Landslide. Therefore, continuous monitoring for post-event deformation of the Guang'an Village Landslide is important for early warning of a secondary landslide in the near future.

TI  - Comparison of Water Information Extraction Algorithms Based on Sentinel-2A MSI Data
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of surface water information is important for water resource planning and management and related disaster monitoring. Herein, using Sentinel-2A MSI images as the research data, the water body around Poyang Lake was extracted based on 10 typical spectral band index algorithms and the water body recognition results of synthetic aperture radar images combined with visual interpretation were compared and analyzed as the true value. The experimental results demonstrate that the recognition effect of the normalized, Gaussian normalized, and pseudo normalized difference water body indexes is the best. The average F1-score is greater than 95%, and the threshold stability is high. An improved normalized difference water body index is suitable for water extraction in urban areas. The combined water body index has good recognition effect in paddy fields and river areas. The enhanced water body and shadow water body indices are applicable to mountainous areas. The enhanced water body index is also applicable in urban areas. The revised normalized difference water body index is only applicable to the identification of large-area water bodies. A shadow-oriented automatic water index can effectively eliminate the interference caused by terrain shadows. However, the overall performance of a nonshadow oriented automatic water index is relatively poor.

TI  - Accounting for Value Changes in Cultivated Land Resources within the Karst Mountain Area of Southwest China, 2001-2020
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivated land resources are important natural resource assets that are related to food security and sustainable development. Due to the many restrictive factors of the karst landform on agricultural production, the quantity and quality of cultivated land in the karst mountainous areas in Southwest China are poor. Reclaiming cultivated land to develop economy or to avoid transitional reclamation to protect ecology is an important proposition in this area. Analyzing changes in the physical and monetary value of cropland resources can help us to formulate more reasonable policies for the development and utilization of cultivated land resources, and to achieve a win-win scenario for economic development and ecological protection. Using multi-source remote sensing data and 20-year landcover data obtained by the GEE platform, this paper evaluated the cropland resources of the karst mountain areas of China at the pixel level. It was found that under the apparent outflow of the physical account of the cultivated land resources, the monetary value still maintained growth, proving that the current cultivated land-use policy in Guizhou Province has significantly improved the value of local cultivated land resources.

TI  - Long-Term and Bimonthly Estimation of Lake Water Extent Using Google Earth Engine and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are one of the most important parts of the terrestrial hydrosphere. The long-term series of lake area dynamic data with high spatial-temporal resolution is of great significance to the study of global change of the water environment. Satellite observations (such as Landsat) have provided images since the 1970s, but there were challenges for the construction of long-term sequences of lake area on a monthly temporal scale. We proposed a temporal-spatial interpolation and rule-based (TSIRB) approach on the Google Earth Engine, which aims to achieve automatic water extraction and bimonthly sequence construction of lake area. There are three main steps of this method which include bimonthly image sequence construction, automatic water extraction, and anomaly rectification. We applied the TSIRB method to five typical lakes (covering salt lakes, river lagoons, and plateau alpine lakes), and constructed the bimonthly surface water dataset (BSWD) from 1987 to 2020. The accuracy assessment that was based on a confusion matrix and random sampling showed that the average overall accuracy (OA) of water extraction was 96.6%, and the average Kappa was 0.90. The BSWD sequence was compared with the lake water level observation data, and the results show that the BSWD data is closely correlated with the water level observation sequence, with correlation coefficient greater than 0.87. The BSWD improves the hollows in the global surface water (GSW) monthly data and has advantages in the temporal continuity of surface water data. The BSWD can provide a 30-m-scale and bimonthly series of surface water for more than 30 years, which shows good value for the long-term dynamic monitoring of lakes, especially in areas that are lacking in situ surveying data.

TI  - Evaluation of Reprocessed Fengyun-3B Global Outgoing Longwave Radiation Data: Comparison with CERES OLR
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) is a key parameter for understanding and interpreting the relationship between clouds, radiation, and climate interactions. It has been one of the operational products of the Fengyun (FY) meteorological satellites. OLR accuracy has gradually improved with advancements in satellite payload performance and the OLR retrieval algorithm. Supported by the National Key R&D Program Retrospective Calibration of Historical Chinese Earth Observation Satellite data (Richceos) project, a long-term OLR climate data record (CDR) was reprocessed based on the recalibrated Level 1 data of FY series satellites using the latest OLR retrieval algorithm. In this study, Fengyun-3B (FY-3B)'s reprocessed global OLR data from 2010 to 2018 were evaluated by using the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) global daily OLR data. The results showed that there was a high consistency between the FY-3B instantaneous OLR and CERES Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) OLR. Globally, between the two CDR datasets, the correlation coefficient reached 0.98, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was approximately 8-9 W m(-2). The bias mainly came from the edge regions of the satellite orbit, which may be related to the satellite zenith angle and cloud cover distribution. It was shown that the long-term FY-3B OLR had temporal stability compared to CERES OLR long-term data. In terms of spatial distribution, the mean deviations showed zonal and seasonal characteristics, although seasonal fluctuations were observed in the differences between the two datasets. Effects of FY-3B OLR application to the South China Sea monsoon region and ENSO were demonstrated and analyzed, and the results showed that the seasonal deviation of FY-3B's OLR comes mainly from the retrieval algorithm. However, it has little effect on the analysis of climate events.

TI  - Study on the retrieval of 3D atmospheric water vapor distribution using GNSS and RS multi-source data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapor, one of the most important greenhouse gas, plays a crucial role in understanding the global climate change and forecasting the extreme weather events. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) tomography technique has become one of the significant techniques for retrieving the three-dimensional distribution of water vapor, and this technique has developed rapidly and has made some applications come true. However, due to the limitation of GNSS acquisition geometry, traditional tomography model is faced with the problems of uneven distribution of observations and many blank voxels. We propose a new water vapor tomography method using GNSS and Remote Sensing (RS) multi-source data to retrieve high-precision three-dimensional distribution of atmospheric water vapor for the first time. GNSS data and PWV observations from MODIS and MERSI over Xuzhou region are used to validate the GNSS/RS tomography method. The experimental results show that the average number of effective observations is improved by 38. 41% and the mean number of the crossed voxels is increased by 55. 56%. Taking the high-precision radiosonde water vapor profile and 3D water vapor density field from ERAS as reference values, it can be observed that the proposed method is superior to the traditional method in all kinds of precision indexes, with the mean root-mean-square error improved by 29. 68% and 20. 31%, respectively. Additionally, GNSS/RS model can retrieve the more accurate water vapor products than GNSS model in the different altitude layers. This indicates that the GNSS combining RS tomography method is able to improve the quality of tomographic results, retrieving the accurate and reliable 3D atmospheric water vapor distribution.

TI  - Habitat suitability evaluation of Asian elephants in the Yuanjiang-Lixianjiang River Basin based on meta -analysis and remote sensing big data.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat suitability evaluation is a basis for species conservation, habitat management and planning. Over the past decades, the number of wild Asian elephants in Yunnan Province of China has increased sharply, and elephants' emigration from their original habitats frequently occurred. However, habitat quality in the newly inhabited areas is often poorly known due to lack of records in presence of Asian elephants, which hinders Asian elephant protection and risk prevention. The rapid development of remote sensing big data mapping technology provides new data sources for habitat suitability evaluation studies, and offers the possibility of identifying suitable habitats for species on a large regional scale more accurately and finely. In this study, a remote sensing big data-driven habitat suitability evaluation system for Asian elephants is constructed. We selected the Yuanjiang-Lixianjiang River Basin newly immigrated by Asian elephants as a case area, used meta-analysis to search for environmental factors related to Asian elephants habitat evaluation, and screened out habitat suitability evaluation factors by combining correlation analysis with variance inflation factor test. Subsequently, all habitat suitability evaluation factors were quantified based on open -source remote sensing data products and their weights were calculated using principal component analysis and analytic hierarchy process. Finally, we used a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model to determine the habitat suitability of Asian elephants in the study area and analyzed landscape patterns of habitats of Asian elephants. The results show that (1) the habitat suitability of Asian elephants in the Yuanjiang-Lixian River Basin decreased gradually upstream. The optimal habitat mainly occurred in the downstream basin, with a small distribution in the midstream basin and almost no distribution in the upstream basin. (2) The Yuanjiang River Basin was less suitable for Asian elephants than the Lixian River Basin because it had less connected and more fragmented habitat patches, which cannot meet the minimum home range requirements of Asian elephant populations and make it difficult to sustain a long-term survival of the " northward migration elephant herd". (3) The habitat suitability decreased along the northward migration route of elephant herd called "northward migration elephant herd" roaming in 2021 with the decreased distribution of natural broad-leaved forests along the way. The findings provide a basis for scientifically guiding the elephant herd into suitable habitats to avoid the conflicts between the human and wild elephant and thereby to ensure the safety of the elephant herd and the affected residents, which will serve for the regional biodiversity conservation and rural revitalization.

TI  - Estimation of Daily Average Shortwave Solar Radiation under Clear-Sky Conditions by the Spatial Downscaling and Temporal Extrapolation of Satellite Products in Mountainous Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) received by an inclined surface can be estimated accurately based on the mountain radiation transfer model by using the digital elevation model (DEM) and high-resolution optical remote sensing images. However, it is still challenging to obtain the high-resolution daily average DSSR affected by the atmosphere and local topography in mountain areas. In this study, the spatial downscaling and temporal extrapolation methods were explored separately to estimate the high-resolution daily average DSSR under clear-sky conditions based on Himawari-8, Sentinel-2 satellite radiation products and DEM data. The upper and middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin (UM-HRB) and the Laohugou area of Qilian Mountain (LGH) were used as the study areas because there are many ground observation stations in the UM-HRB that are convenient for DSSR spatial downscaling studies and the high-resolution instantaneous DSSR datasets published for the LHG are helpful for DSSR temporal extrapolation studies. The verification results show that both methods of spatial downscaling and temporal extrapolation can effectively estimate the daily average DSSR. A total of 3002 measurements from six observation sites showed that the 50 m downscaled results of the Himawari-8 10-min 5 km radiation products had quite a high correlation with the ground-based measurements from the UM-HRB. The coefficient of determination (R-2) exceeded 0.96. The mean bias error (MBE) and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) were about 41.57 W/m(2) (or 8.22%) and 49.25 W/m(2) (or 9.73%), respectively. The fifty-two measurements from two stations in the LHG indicated that the temporal extrapolated results of the Sentinel-2 10 m instantaneous DSSR datasets published previously performed well, giving R-2, MBE, and RMSE values of 0.65, 41.06 W/m(2) (or 7.89%) and 88.90 W/m(2) (or 17.07%), respectively. By comparing the estimation results of the two methods in the LHG, it was found that although the temporal extrapolation method of instantaneous high-resolution radiation products can more finely describe the spatial heterogeneity of solar radiation in complex terrain areas, the overall accuracy is lower than that achieved with the spatial downscaling approach.

TI  - Nucleic acid aptamer controls mycoplasma infection for inhibiting the malignancy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - MOLECULAR THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Esophageal cancer is one of the most frequent malignant tumors of the digestive tract, among which esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the main pathological type worldwide. Previous studies have shown microbial infections in the upper digestive tract to be a potential risk factor in ESCC etiology. In this study, we identified that Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection promoted the malignancy of ESCC. In response, we generated a single-stranded DNA aptamer, ZY3A, against M. hyorhinis using the cell-SELEX strategy. The underlying recognition mechanism of ZY3A on M. hyorhinis involves its binding to M. hyorhinis-specific p37 protein. This tool allowed us to provide the first proof-of-concept evidence using a nucleic acid aptamer to control mycoplasma infection. More specifically, we found that ZY3A could neutralize M. hyorhinis infection on ESCC cells by blocking the interaction between p37 protein and its receptor TLR4 on the ESCC cell membrane. As a result, ZY3A inhibited the migration and invasion of M. hyorhinis-infected ESCC cells in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate that aptamer ZY3A isa potential candidate for development into a novel molecular tool for treatment of M. hyorhinis infection and a safe first-in-class M. hyorhinis-targeting antitumor agent.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Optimal Plant Cover and Its Influencing Factors for <i>Populus simonii</i> Carr. on the Bashang Plateau, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bashang Plateau is the core zone of the agro-pastoral ecotone in northern China and represents an ecological barrier for preventing the invasion of wind-blown sand in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Increasing plant cover to control soil erosion is an effective measure to address land degradation; however, plant cover is different from climatic conditions. In this study, we determined the optimal spatial distribution of Populus simonii Carr., which is a widely planted species used for revegetation on the Bashang Plateau. A modified Biome-BGC model was used to simulate the dynamics of the net primary productivity (NPP), actual evapotranspiration (AET), and leaf-area index (LAI). The model was validated using field-observed tree-ring and MODIS AET and NPP data. The dynamics of AET, NPP and LAI for P. simonii at 122 representative sites in the study area for the period 1980-2019 were simulated by the validated model. The results showed that the spatial distributions of mean AET, NPP, and LAI generally decreased from southeast to northwest. The ranges of optimal plant cover in terms of maximum LAI for P. simonii were 3.3 in the Fengning-Weichang area, 1.9 in the Shangyi-Zhangbei-Guyuan area and 1.3 in the Kangbao area. Mean annual precipitation (MAP), elevation, soil texture and mean annual temperature were the main factors influencing the distribution of AET, NPP and LAI. As the MAP decreased, the correlations between AET, NPP, LAI and precipitation gradually decreased. In different subregions, the factors influencing optimal-plant-cover distribution varied significantly. These quantitative findings provide the optimal plant cover for the dominant tree in different subregions and provide useful information for land degradation management on the Bashang Plateau.

TI  - Experimental and Analytical Research on Flexural Behavior of Concrete-Filled High-Strength Steel Tubular Members
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using high-strength steel (yield strength f(y) >= 460 MPa) in concrete-filled steel tubes is expected to provide a superior bearing capacity by achieving light weight and efficient construction, but the existing design limitation on diameter-to-thickness (D/t) ratios for concrete-filled high-strength steel tubular (CFHST) members inevitably obstructs its wide application. In this study, aiming at the application of circular CFHST members using Q690 steel (f(y) >= 690 MPa), a total of 15 CFHST beams were examined using a three-point loading test to investigate the failure mode, bearing capacity and plasticity evolution. Subsequently, finite element models (FEMs) were established to analyze the full-range curves, composite effect, failure mechanism and influences of key parameters including material strengths, D/t ratios, and shear-span ratios. A simplified calculation method for bearing capacity was finally proposed and verified. The results indicate that the full-range performance of tested CFHST members with out-of-code D/t ratios have ductile behavior, though they fail through the mode of steel fracture and concrete cracks in the tension zone as well as through local buckling in the compression zone; out-of-code CFHST members (e.g., D/t = 120) can perform reasonable composite behavior because of contact pressure larger than 2.5 MPa, where a thin-walled steel tube experiences an arch failure mechanism similar to core concrete at a trussed angle of 45 degrees; the simplified bearing capacity model achieves a mean value of 0.97, and can be accepted as a primary tool to perform structural design and performance evaluation.

AB  - The traditional mine remote sensing information pre-survey is mainly based on manual interpretation, and interpreters delineate the mine boundary shape. This work is difficult and susceptible to subjective judgment due to the large differences in the characteristics of mining complex within individuals and small differences between individuals. CondInst-VoV and BlendMask-VoV, based on VoVNet-v2, are two improved instance segmentation models proposed to improve the efficiency of mine remote sensing pre-survey and minimize labor expenses. In Hubei Province, China, Gaofen satellite fusion images, true-color satellite images, false-color satellite images, and Tianditu images are gathered to create a Key Open-pit Mine Acquisition Areas (KOMMA) dataset to assess the efficacy of mine detection models. In addition, regional detection was carried out in Daye Town. The result shows that the performance of improved models on the KOMMA dataset exceeds the baseline as well as the verification accuracy of manual interpretation in regional mine detection tasks. In addition, CondInst-VoV has the best performance on Tianditu image, reaching 88.816% in positioning recall and 98.038% in segmentation accuracy.

TI  - Fluorescence Line Height Extraction Algorithm for the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence is an important indicator of the physiological state of phytoplankton in water bodies. The new generation of ocean color satellite remote sensors usually sets fluorescence bands to detect the phytoplankton fluorescence line height (FLH). Yet, the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) offers no FLH products so far, and the FLH results calculated using the fluorescence band (680 nm) and the two baseline bands (660 and 745 nm) have numerous negative values and are quite different from the FLH products of other satellite ocean color sensors. To address this problem, we established an FLH retrieval algorithm suitable for GOCI. We simulated the spectral datasets of different water types using the radiative transfer model HydroLight and established the band conversion relationship from 680 to 685 nm based on the simulated datasets. The remote sensing reflectance after band conversion was applied to the FLH product inversion, significantly reducing the number of negative FLH values and appreciably improving data availability for GOCI FLH products (from 14.78% to 66.73% on average). The new FLH product has a good correlation with the field-measured data (R-2 = 0.73), and the relative error was 6.95%. Moreover, after band conversion, the FLH products retrieved by GOCI are in good agreement with the FLH products of MODIS, and fusion products can be further produced to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of the data. In addition, the radiative transfer simulation datasets also revealed that changes in solar zenith angle have little effect on FLH inversion. The hourly GOCI-derived FLH has good spatiotemporal continuity and can clearly reflect the diurnal variation of FLH. It can provide a stable FLH algorithm for further recovery of time-series GOCI FLH products and research on diurnal changes in FLH.

TI  - Identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of individual red bed landslides: a case study in Western Yunnan, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Strata in red bed areas have typical characteristics of soft-hard interbedding and high sensitivity to water. Under the comprehensive action of internal stratigraphic structure and external hydrological factors, red bed landslides have highly complex spatiotemporal characteristics, presenting significant challenges to the prevention and control of landslide disasters in red bed areas, especially for slope and tunnel engineering projects. In this study, we applied an interdisciplinary approach combining small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR), deep displacement monitoring, and engineering geological surveying to identify the deformation mechanisms and spatiotemporal characteristics of the Abi landslide, an individual landslide that occurred in the red bed area of Western Yunnan, China. Surface deformation time series indicated that a basic deformation range developed by March 2020. Based on InSAR results and engineering geological analysis, the landslide surface could be divided into three zones: an upper sliding zone (US), a lower uplifted zone (LU), and a toe zone (Toe). LU was affected by the structure of the sliding bed with variable inclination. Using deep displacement curves combined with the geological profile, a set of sliding surfaces were identified between different lithology. The groundwater level standardization index (GLSI) and deformation normalization index (DNI) showed different quadratic relationships between US and LU. Verification using the Pearson correlation analysis shows that the correlation coefficients between model calculated results and measured data are 0.7933 and 0.7577, respectively, indicating that the DNI-GLSI models are applicable. A fast and short-lived deformation sub stage (ID-Fast) in the initial deformation stage was observed, and ID-Fast was driven by concentrated rainfall.

TI  - Research on the Impact of BDS-2/3 Receiver ISB on LEO Satellite POD
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the multi-GNSS positioning application is becoming more and more popular, same to the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite precise orbit determination (POD) based on the onboard multi-GNSS measurements. The third-generation Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS-3) provides a new option to obtain the LEO satellite orbit solutions. However, the receiver intersystem bias (ISB) of different GNSS is unavoidable in multi-GNSS data processing. This paper's main goal is absorption of the impact of the ISB between BDS-3 and BDS-2 on the LEO satellite POD. Taking GPS-based POD solutions for the reference orbit, this paper evaluates the orbit accuracy of BDS-2-based POD, BDS-3-based POD, BDS-2 and BDS-3 combined PODs with/without ISB. The BDS-3-based POD accuracy is 6.57 cm in the 3D direction, a 56% improvement over BDS-2-based POD. When the ISB between BDS-3 and BDS-2 is estimated, the BDS-2/3 combined POD accuracy of 5.37 cm in the 3D direction is better than that without ISB, which is a 64% improvement over BDS-2-based POD and 18% improvement over BDS-3-based POD. For GPS and BDS-2/3 combined POD, the GPS and BDS-3 joint POD solutions have the smallest RMS differences in overlapping consistency and smallest RMS differences compared to GPS-based POD. This study indicates that estimating the BDS-2/3 receiver ISB in BDS-2/3 joint POD could improve the orbit accuracy, and the GPS and BDS-3 joint POD solution is better than another combined POD. This paper will provide meaningful references for the LEO satellite multi-GNSS-based POD.

TI  - Case Study of Mesoscale Precipitation Areas within the Comma Head of an Extratropical Cyclone
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - On 12-13 February 2016, a record-breaking rain-snow event during the passage of an extratropical cyclone occurred in Shandong Province, China, in which the 24 h precipitation totals at 48 of 123 national meteorological stations in Shandong Province broke their historical records for the month of February, and a further 25 stations recorded their second-largest February totals. This paper investigates the evolution of the mesoscale precipitation areas and the mechanisms responsible for the formation, organization, and maintenance of the mesoscale precipitation areas, using FY-2G satellite data, Doppler radar observations, and a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model numerical simulation at 4 km grid spacing. The main results show that the comma head cloud of the cyclone developed from four echo strips. Intense precipitation was related to the mesoscale elongated precipitation areas (EPAs) of reflectivity >30 dBZ within the stratiform clouds. The formation and development of the EPAs coincided with the activities of a low-level shear line and an associated increase in frontogenesis. The simulated EPAs occurred in an environment of conditional instability (CI), inertial instability (II), and conditional symmetric instability (CSI). In the initial stage of the elongated rainfall areas (ERAs), rainfall was initiated by the frontal forcing in the presence of elevated CI, and II was generated by upright convection. During the development stage of the ERAs, the CI was absent, and condensational heating was enhanced. II occurred in the absence of upright convection, and it seems likely that the presence of II is a diabatic signature of the precipitation itself. Upper-level II intensified the convective systems by enhancing outflow aloft, and II caused the ERAs to organize. Thus, II played an important role in the organization and maintenance of the ERAs. The frontogenesis provided the dynamic condition for the release of the instability. Enhanced CSI and II intensified slantwise convection, and combining with enhanced frontogenesis, intensified the ERAs. The echo, ascent, and frontogenesis in snowfall areas were weaker than those in rainfall areas.

TI  - Lightweight Hot-Spot Fault Detection Model of Photovoltaic Panels in UAV Remote-Sensing Image
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic panels exposed to harsh environments such as mountains and deserts (e.g., the Gobi desert) for a long time are prone to hot-spot failures, which can affect power generation efficiency and even cause fires. The existing hot-spot fault detection methods of photovoltaic panels cannot adequately complete the real-time detection task; hence, a detection model considering both detection accuracy and speed is proposed. In this paper, the feature extraction part of YOLOv5 is replaced by the more lightweight Focus structure and the basic unit of ShuffleNetv2, and then the original feature fusion method is simplified. Considering that there is no publicly available infrared photovoltaic panel image dataset, this paper generates an infrared photovoltaic image dataset through frame extraction processing and manual annotation of a publicly available video. Consequently, the number of parameters of the model was 3.71 M, mAP was 98.1%, and detection speed was 49 f/s. A comprehensive comparison of the accuracy, detection speed, and model parameters of each model showed that the indicators of the new model are superior to other detection models; thus, the new model is more suitable to be deployed on the UAV platform for real-time photovoltaic panel hot-spot fault detection.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Forest Vegetation Phenology and Its Response to Climate Change in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is an important indicator of vegetation dynamics. The boreal forest ecosystem is the main part of terrestrial ecosystem in the Northern Hemisphere and plays an important role in global carbon balance. In this study, the dynamic threshold method combined with the ground-based phenology observation data was applied to extract the forest phenological parameters from MODIS NDVI time-series. Then, the spatiotemporal variation of forest phenology is discussed and the relationship between phenological change and climatic factors was concluded in the northeast China from 2011 to 2020. The results indicated that the distribution of the optimal extraction threshold has spatial heterogeneity, and the changing rate was 3% and 2% with 1 degrees increase in latitude for SOS (the start of the growing season) and EOS (the end of the growing season). This research also notes that the SOS had an advanced trend at a rate of 0.29 d/a while the EOS was delayed by 0.47 d/a. This variation of phenology varied from different forest types. We also found that the preseason temperature played a major role in effecting the forest phenology. The temperature in winter of the previous year had a significant effect on SOS in current year. Temperature in autumn of the current year had a significant effect on EOS.

TI  - Detection and Statistics of Offshore Aquaculture Rafts in Coastal Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore aquaculture is critical for a marine fishery economy. The spatial distribution of aquaculture that characterizes it plays a vital role in the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the marine environment. In recent years, China's aquaculture has developed rapidly; specifically, the scale of aquaculture has dramatically expanded, and large-scale aquaculture has gradually grown in popularity. Although high-resolution satellite data can accurately extract aquaculture areas, the extraction of a large area of the sea area requires a copious amount of data. In contrast, medium-resolution satellite images allow for the extraction of aquaculture areas from large sea areas with a smaller amount of data, offering significant advantages. Therefore, we used Landsat8 satellite data to extract and count the number of aquaculture rafts based on the Hough transform and Canny edge detection methods. We tested the accuracy of this method by selecting Haizhou Bay as the study area for the experiment and accuracy verification and found that the automatic extraction accuracy for the number of aquaculture rafts was more than 90%. Additionally, we calculated statistics on the number of aquaculture rafts in Haizhou Bay over the past seven years. The findings presented in this paper offer a significant reference value for local marine utilization, marine environment protection, and marine disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - A Mini-Neptune from TESS and CHEOPS Around the 120 Myr Old AB Dor Member HIP 94235
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has enabled discoveries of the brightest transiting planet systems around young stars. These systems are the benchmarks for testing theories of planetary evolution. We report the discovery of a mini-Neptune transiting a bright star in the AB Doradus moving group. HIP 94235 (TOI-4399, TIC 464646604) is a V-mag = 8.31 G-dwarf hosting a 3.00(-0.28)(+0.32) R-circle plus mini-Neptune in a 7.7 day period orbit. HIP 94235 is part of the AB Doradus moving group, one of the youngest and closest associations. Due to its youth, the host star exhibits significant photometric spot modulation, lithium absorption, and X-ray emission. Three 0.06% transits were observed during Sector 27 of the TESS Extended Mission, though these transit signals are dwarfed by the 2% peak-to-peak photometric variability exhibited by the host star. Follow-up observations with the Characterising Exoplanet Satellite confirmed the transit signal and prevented the erosion of the transit ephemeris. HIP 94235 is part of a 50 au G-M binary system. We make use of diffraction limited observations spanning 11 yr, and astrometric accelerations from Hipparcos and Gaia, to constrain the orbit of HIP 94235 B. HIP 94235 is one of the tightest stellar binaries to host an inner planet. As part of a growing sample of bright, young planet systems, HIP 94235 b is ideal for follow-up transit observations, such as those that investigate the evaporative processes driven by high-energy radiation that may sculpt the valleys and deserts in the Neptune population.

TI  - Vegetation Type Classification Based on 3D Convolutional Neural Network Model: A Case Study of Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate vegetation type extraction from remote sensing images can provide decision makers with basic forest cover and land use information, and provides a reliable basis for long-term monitoring. With the development of deep learning, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used successfully to classify tree species in many studies, but CNN models have rarely been applied in the classification of vegetation types on larger scales. To evaluate the performance of CNN models in the classification of vegetation types, this paper compared the classification accuracy of nine dominant land cover types in Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve with four models: 3D-CNN, 2D-CNN, JSSAN (joint spatial-spectral attention network) and Resnet18, using sentinel-2A data. Comparing the difference in classification accuracy between the direct use of raw sentinel images and fused feature indices sentinel images, the results showed that adding feature indices can improve the overall accuracy of the model. After fusing the characteristic bands, the accuracy of the four models was improved significantly, by 5.46-19.33%. The best performing 3D-CNN model achieved the highest classification accuracy with an overall accuracy of 95.82% and a kappa coefficient of 95.07%. In comparison, 2D-CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 79.07% and a kappa coefficient of 75.44%, JSSAN achieved an overall accuracy of 81.67% and a kappa coefficient of 78.56%, and Resnet18 achieved an overall accuracy of 93.61% and a kappa coefficient of 92.45%. The results showed that the 3D-CNN model can effectively capture vegetation type cover changes from broad-leaved forests at lower elevation, to shrublands and grasslands at higher elevation, across a range spanning 542-4007 m. In experiments using a small amount of sample data, 3D-CNN can better incorporate spatial-spectral information and is more effective in distinguishing the performance of spectrally similar vegetation types, providing an efficient and novel approach to classifying vegetation types in nature reserves with complex conditions.

TI  - Characteristics of the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Aerosols in Central Asia and Their Influencing Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are an important component of the atmospheric system. Long time-series observations for aerosols are essential for examining global climate change and the ecological environment. Based on Google Earth Engine and MODIS MCD19A2 data, we monitored the spatio-temporal dynamic characteristics of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Central Asia from 2001 to 2020. The effects of six environmental factors on the AOD distribution were explored using a geographic detector model and analysed in combination with the land-use/land-cover change (LUCC) and desertification in different periods. The results showed that the average multi-year AOD in Central Asia was 0.1442, with insignificant interannual variations. The high-value areas were mainly distributed in the Aral Sea and surrounding areas of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, with notable seasonal variations. The evaluation results for the influencing factors showed that the relative humidity and precipitation had a large effect on the spatial distribution of the AOD. The LUCC directly affected contributions to the AOD. Desertification of land provides rich dust sources, which are the main aerosol sources in Central Asia, thus exacerbating dust aerosol pollution. This study investigated the temporal and spatial characteristics and influencing factors of the AOD in Central Asia, providing a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of air pollution.

TI  - Meandering Characteristics of the Yimin River in Hulun Buir Grassland, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of meandering rivers continues to attract considerable attention in research and for practical applications, given that it is closely associated with the safety of river systems and riparian zones. There has been much discussion regarding the various channel planform features exhibited by meandering rivers under different river systems and riparian conditions. The Yimin River is a good example and is located southeast of the Hulun Buir Grassland, which is characterised by a fragile ecosystem and little anthropological activity along with active flow during the non-frozen season from May to November each year and relatively low sediment discharge compared with the Yellow River and Mississippi River. Improved analysis of the evolution of the Yimin River from 1975 to 2019 can support increased local species diversity and more effective flood risk and river management. With the combined Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technique, remote sensing images, including Landsat images and global surface water data, are used to analyse the channel planform features of the freely meandering river channel in the middle and lower Yimin River. The results show that the percentage of low sinuosity channel bends was higher than that of high-sinuosity bends. Although the bends with an amplitude greater than 0.48 km and sinuosity greater than 2.3 have an evident upstream-skewed trend, the main channel planform features were downstream skewed with 1499 such bends. The river system conditions in the Yimin River, including lower sediment discharge and vegetation cover, are conducive to the development of downstream-skewed bends. The high-sinuosity bends were found to have a relatively larger ratio during 1981-2000, a period with higher mean annual streamflow compared with other time periods.

TI  - Subpixel Snow Mapping Using Daily AVHRR/2 Data over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a linear spectral mixture model and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis, using daily advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR/2) data of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a subpixel snow mapping algorithm was proposed in this paper, for prolonging the historical time series of the fractional snow cover data to 40 years. In particular, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and channels 1 and 2 of AVHRR/2 data were used to automatically select the end-members directly, from a certain AVHRR/2 image. A look-up table of sample spectra of mixed pixels and their respective snow cover percentages was introduced for one AVHRR/2 image. According to the established look-up tables, the fractional snow cover of each mixed pixel can then be extracted from the AVHRR/2 images. Before the subpixel snow mapping, the cloud pollution of the AVHRR/2 images was mitigated, with both the thick and thin clouds almost removed from the AVHRR/2 images. It turns out that the processing speed of the subpixel snow mapping is three times faster than the process not using the look-up table. The mapping algorithm was validated against the snow-covered area from Thematic Mapper (TM) data, with the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) well below 0.12. Results show that the proposed algorithm for subpixel snow mapping is both effective and efficient, especially in such a mountainous region as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Characterizing Spatiotemporal Patterns of Land Deformation in the Santa Ana Basin, Los Angeles, from InSAR Time Series and Independent Component Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The excessive extraction and recharge of groundwater lead to long-time seasonal land subsidence in Los Angeles, USA, and especially in the Santa Ana basin. The rate of land subsidence in the Santa Ana basin has been rising, which could pose a danger to infrastructure and human lives. However, the most recent research on land surface deformation in the area was conducted using the traditional parameter estimation method, resulting in little understanding of the regional spatiotemporal characteristics. The parametric method consists of a least square linear inversion, using the pre-defined mathematical geometric or geophysical theoretical models to describe groundwater deformation, and it requires precise external environmental variables and accurate geophysical parameters, which are more difficult to implement. In this study, multitemporal InSAR-derived deformation time series are analyzed by using 69 descending C-band Sentinel-1A SAR scenes acquired from 2015 to 2018. A method based on independent component analysis (ICA) is applied to characterize the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of land subsidence in the Santa Ana basin. The results reveal two different spatial and temporal deformation patterns in the basin. First, a widespread seasonal deformation is identified by the first component, related to annual seasonal groundwater level changes, and the overall deformation shows a concentrated spatial pattern. The second component captures a long-term signal with a large-scale spatial pattern. For quantitative assessment, the obtained deformation time series are compared with the GNSS data, validating an accuracy of millimeters. We further calculate the cross-correlation coefficient and the elastic skeletal storage coefficient from the ICA-derived seasonal deformation and groundwater level, which reveals that the deformation responds quickly (i.e., a lag of 8 days) to the change in groundwater and the Santa Ana aquifer retains almost the same elasticity for at least 15 years. Quantifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of the deformation in the Santa Ana basin can provide a reference for the monitoring and managing of groundwater.

TI  - Monitoring the Invasive Plant <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> in Jiangsu Coastal Wetland Using MRCNN and Long-Time Series Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Jiangsu coastal wetland has the largest area of the invasive plant, Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), in China. S. alterniflora has been present in the wetland for nearly 40 years and poses a substantial threat to the safety of coastal wetland ecosystems. There is an urgent need to control the distribution of S. alterniflora. The biological characteristics of the invasion process of S. alterniflora contribute to its multi-scale distribution. However, the current classification methods do not deal successfully with multi-scale problems, and it is also difficult to perform high-precision land cover classification on multi-temporal remote sensing images. In this study, based on Landsat data from 1990 to 2020, a new deep learning multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MRCNN) model was developed to identify S. alterniflora. In this method, features at different scales are extracted and concatenated to obtain multi-scale information, and residual connections are introduced to ensure gradient propagation. A multi-year data unified training method was adopted to improve the temporal scalability of the MRCNN. The MRCNN model was able to identify the annual S. alterniflora distribution more accurately, overcame the disadvantage that traditional CNNs can only extract feature information at a single scale, and offered significant advantages in spatial characterization. A thematic map of S. alterniflora distribution was obtained. Since it was introduced in 1982, the distribution of S. alterniflora has expanded to approximately 17,400 ha. In Jiangsu, the expansion process of S. alterniflora over time was divided into three stages: the growth period (1982-1994), the outbreak period (1995-2004), and the plateau period (2005-2020). The spatial expansion direction was mainly parallel and perpendicular to the coastline. The hydrodynamic conditions and tidal flat environment on the coast of Jiangsu Province are suitable for the growth of S. alterniflora. Reclamation of tidal flats is the main factor affecting the expansion of S. alterniflora.

TI  - The Study of Daytime Ionospheric E-Region Radar Echoes Simultaneously Observed by Qujing VHF Radar and Multi-Ionosondes
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the daytime E-region field-aligned irregularities (FAIs) observed by the Qujing (geographic 25.64 degrees N, 103.70 degrees E) Very High Frequency coherent backscatter radar was reported. The range spread and enhanced sporadic-E layer (Es) during the same period of the unusual radar echoes were separately observed by two ionosondes located at the Huize and Qujing. The Huize (geographic 26.51 degrees N, 103.61 degrees E) ionosonde was roughly located underneath the radar scattering volume which measured enhanced and range spread Es layer during this period of the unusual radar echoes, indicating that the daytime E-region FAIs were closely related to the localized density gradient that embedded within the coordinated Es layer. Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite data show that a strong convective activity accompanied by gravity waves occurred near the radar scattering volume region. As a result, we proposed that the gravity waves driven by the convective activity in the lower atmosphere can modulate the Es layers and then generate the daytime FAIs through the polarization process.

TI  - Evil Forces in Traditional Beliefs and Folklore of the Forest Yukagirs
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the formation of images of evil forces in the traditional culture of forest Yukagirs (selfname "Odul") for a long time. Oduls live in the North-East of Russia, in Verkhnekolymskiy ulus (district) of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The chronological range of the study covers from the ancient period to historical modernity (late of XX century). They are attracted by data of archeology and ethnography, language, folklore, arts and crafts of Oduls. The work is written on the published materials and field data of the author, collected from the forest Yukagirs in the period 1996-2007. Classification of evil forces by category made V. I. Jochelson in early of XX century. It was the basis for comparison with the data obtained by us.The material of religious views and folklore reveals the semantics of evil images; causal patterns of their transformation in time. It is assumed that the initial formation of this category of external forces belongs to the pre-religious period. The oldest idea of the surrounding primitive man is not yet divided into cosmic forces and unnamed space, saturated with energy bipolar forces, revealed in the analysis of Yukagir concept Pon 'Something' (Rus. 'Nature').There is no indication of the place of concentration of malicious forces in the mythopoietic graphemes of the two-level and early three-part Universe of the Neolithic-Bronze Age period. Malicious forces iu theta ie are everywhere. Graphemes painted by red ocher on streamside rocks of Central Yakutia. The sign image of sky-father corresponds to the zoomorphic image of the Earth-mother; at the same time there is an idea of the underworld of the dead. Graphemes are known in the jewelry of modern clothing of Oduls.With the addition of the shamanic three-part picture of the world images of evil forces are concentrated on its third level - in the underworld. This picture of the world with the concentration of evil forces of a class of kukul in the world of the dead is seen in religious and mythological views of Oduls and folklore. Hunters and fishermen of the Upper Kolyma who are now leading the economy, shamanistic views were received from the alien peoples.The article compares and contrasts the changes that have occurred in the views of Oduls on malicious forces within 100 years (XIX-XX centuries). The images of ancestors on the maternal (Solomina-Cherv') and paternal (Ostrogolovy dedushka) lines inverted in evil are considered. Were wolves of these and other evil characters of mythology and folklore (Luna-ludoed. Myphichesky staric) are noted.In general, at the late of XX century there was a weakening of emotional tension in the perception by the evil forces of the surrounding world by forest Yukagirs and transformation of previous images into the field of etiological myths and folklore. We believe that one of the main causes of re-meaningimages are atheistic policy of the state.

TI  - Monitoring 3D Changes in Urban Forests Using Landscape Metrics Analyses Based on Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is causing changes in green spaces and ecological connectivity. So far, urban ecosystem research has mainly focused on using landscape metrics (LM) in two-dimensional (2D) space. Our study proposes three-dimensional (3D) measures of urban forests (UF) and LM calculations using LiDAR technology. First, we estimated the UF volume of Krakow (Poland) and the distribution of vegetation (low, medium, high) using a voxel-based GEOBIA approach based on the ALS LiDAR point cloud, satellite imagery, and aerial orthophotos at specific timestamps: 2006, 2012, 2017. Then, the appropriate landscape metrics were selected (NP, AREA_MN, CONTIG_MN, LPI, PARA_MN, SPLIT, MESH, PD, DIVISION, LSI) to quantify the differences between the 2D- and 3D-derived vegetation structures and detect changes in the urban landscape. The results showed that areas with low vegetation decreased due to the expansion of built-up areas, while areas with medium and high vegetation increased in Krakow between 2006, 2012, and 2017. We have shown that the lack of information on the vertical features of vegetation, i.e., 2D greenery analysis, leads to an overestimation of landscape connectivity. In the 3D vegetation classes, it was observed that low vegetation was the best connected, followed by high vegetation, while medium vegetation was dispersed in the city space. These results are particularly relevant for the urban environment, where the distribution of green space is crucial for the provision of ecosystem services.

TI  - Productivity of riparian <i>Populus</i> forests: Satellite assessment along a prairie river with an environmental flow regime
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In semiarid regions, the growth and survival of cottonwoods (riparian Populus species) depend on river water supplementing the limited precipitation. Indicators of growth and productivity are needed to assess how altered streamflow regimes on regulated rivers impact cottonwood trees and the riparian forest ecosystems they support. We used satellite imagery from the Landsat program to make historical (1984-2020) assessments of ecosystem productivity in a riparian cottonwood forest along a regulated prairie river in southern Alberta, Canada, with an environmental flow regime that increased the minimum flows implemented in 1993. A version of the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation scaled with incoming sunlight (NIRvP) was calculated from Landsat images to provide a proxy for primary production. Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation scaled with incoming sunlight was correlated strongly with gross primary production measurements from eddy covariance and basal area increment measurements from tree ring analyses, supporting its use as a practical proxy. The lowest NIRvP values occurred in drought years with low flows and dry weather during the growing season, while the highest values occurred in wet years with high flows, including floods. Across all years, NIRvP was positively correlated with streamflow and a weather-driven soil moisture index. This indicated that ecosystem productivity was limited by water supply, which is sourced from river water and local precipitation. Subsequently, cottonwood forests in this region would be vulnerable to drought from declines in streamflow, due to climatic variations or human water withdrawals, and reductions in shallow soil moisture from limited local precipitation. This satellite proxy should be broadly applicable and can provide a diagnostic indicator for assessing riparian forest health and responses to varying weather, changing climate, and streamflow regulation.

TI  - Questions of studying the history of the Tomsk diocese in modern historical research
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the issues of modern historiography of the Tomsk diocese. In the course of the research, the author identifies four main centers for the study of local church history in Western Siberia, which differ in local historiosophical traditions, approaches, issues and problems raised. The Altai school is characterized by a great research interest in the history of the Altai spiritual Mission and, accordingly, the issues of missionary work, as well as the extensive use of methods of historical geoinformatics. The experience of cartographic reconstruction, produced on the basis of church documentation, seems to be potential for the analysis of demographic, socio-economic, and cultural processes. The Kemerovo School of Church researchers is the most numerous. It is distinguished by a fundamental approach to research and a wide range of issues under consideration, such as monastic and church construction, the parish system, the relationship between the Orthodox clergy and Old Believers, parish education, etc. In Novosibirsk the appeal to the history of the church and church documentation made it possible to significantly expand the source base on the issues of worldview, education, management, and economy of the region, but in recent years the roles and functions of the clergy have been actively studied through certain aspects of their activities such as the fight against drunkenness, health education, charity, etc. The Tomsk school mainly considers the church through biographies and the worldview of the clergy, as well as in the context of the development of Siberia and its socio-political life. Common to all regions are the following: broad study of issues related to the repressions against the clergy that occurred after 1917; local history and search activities to fill in the lost information about churches, clergy. Thus, the author comes to the conclusion about decentralization of study of this issue, which has both positive and negative features. Each of these centers of study has its own scientific school, its own traditions, interests and a set of methodological technologies. The article notes that the list of issues, subjects, problems, in which the clergy of the Tomsk diocese are studied, has been rapidly expanding in recent years, and previously unprocessed documents are being introduced into scientific circulation. The author also expressed the need to more actively use GIS technologies and methods of spatial analysis, which will make it possible to study the territorial and administrative division more systematically, as well as the dynamics of social processes and the influence of topogeographic factors on them in the context of migration processes to Siberia.

TI  - Estimation of Canopy Structure of Field Crops Using Sentinel-2 Bands with Vegetation Indices and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf angle distribution (LAD), or the leaf mean tilt angle (MTA) capturing its central value, is used to quantify the direction of the leaf surface in a canopy and is one of the most important canopy structuraltraits. Combined with the other important structure parameter, leaf area index (LAI), LAD determines the light interception of a crop canopy. However, unlike LAI, only few studies have addressed the direct retrieval of LAD or MTA from remote sensing data. Recently, it has been shown that the red edge is a key spectral region where the effect of leaf angle on crop spectral reflectance can be separated from that of other structural variables. The Multispectral imager (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite has two specially designed red-edge channels in this spectral region and thus can potentially be used for large-scale mapping of MTA at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Unfortunately, no field data on leaf angles at the scale of S2 pixel are available. Therefore, we simulated 5000 observations of different crops using the PROSAIL canopy reflectance model. Further, we used the MTA and LAI data of six crop species growing in 162 experimental plots in Finland and simulated their reflectance signal in S2 bands by resampling AISA airborne imaging spectroscopy data. Four common machine learning regression algorithms (random forest, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron network and partial least squares regression) were examined for retrieving canopy structure parameters, including leaf angle, from the simulated reflectances. Further, we analyzed the utility of 12 vegetation indices (VIs) well known to be sensitive to canopy structure for canopy structure estimation. Six of the studied indices used information from the visible part of the spectrum and the near infrared (NIR) while another six were selected to also utilize the red edge bands specific to S2. We found that S2 band 6 in the red edge had a strong correlation with MTA (R-2 = 0.79 in model simulation and R-2 = 0.87 in field measurements) but a low correlation with LAI (R-2 = 0.07 in model simulation and R-2= 0.06 in field measurements). Of the six red edge-based VIs, four (NDVIRE, CIRE, WDRVIRE and MSRRE) depended less on MTA than the visible NIR-based VIs and thus could be useful for estimating LAI for any LAD. The other two red edge-based VIs, IRECI and S2REP, had stronger correlations with MTA (R-2 = 0.67 and 0.52, respectively) than LAI (R-2 = 0.24 and 0.19, respectively). Additionally, MTA was accurately estimated (RMSE = 1.1-2.4 degrees in model simulations and RMSE = 2.2-3.9 degrees in field measurements) using the four 10 m spatial resolution bands with the RF, SVM and MLP algorithms, without information in the red edge. These promising results indicate the capability of S2 in accurately mapping the MTA of field crops on a large scale.

TI  - Investigating Plant Response to Soil Characteristics and Slope Positions in a Small Catchment
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods enabling stakeholders to receive information on plant stress in agricultural settings in a timely manner can help mitigate a possible decrease in plant productivity. The present work aims to study the soil-plant interaction using field measurements of plant reflectance, soil water content, and selected soil physical and chemical parameters. Particular emphasis was placed on sloping transects. We further compared ground- and Sentinel-2 satellite-based Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data in different land use types. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and NDVI were measured concurrently with calculating the fraction of absorbed photochemically active radiation (fAPAR) and leaf area index (LAI) values of three vegetation types (a grassland, three vineyard sites, and a cropland with maize). Each land use site had an upper and a lower study point of a given slope. The NDVI, fAPAR, and LAI averaged values were the lowest for the grassland (0.293, 0.197, and 0.51, respectively), which showed the highest signs of water stress. Maize had the highest NDVI values (0.653) among vegetation types. Slope position affected NDVI, PRI, and fAPAR values significantly for the grassland and cropland (p < 0.05), while the soil water content (SWC) was different for all three vineyard sites (p < 0.05). The strongest connections were observed between soil physical and chemical parameters and NDVI values for the vineyard samples and the selected soil parameters and PRI for the grassland. Measured and satellite-retrieved NDVI values of the different land use types were compared, and strong correlations (r = 0.761) between the methods were found. For the maize, the satellite-based NDVI values were higher, while for the grassland they were slightly lower compared to the field-based measurements. Our study indicated that incorporating Sentinel-derived NDVI can greatly improve the value of field monitoring and provides an opportunity to extend field research in more depth. The present study further highlights the close relations in the soil-plant-water system, and continuous monitoring can greatly help in developing site-specific climate change mitigating methods.

TI  - Sexuality communication ethics in the Qur'an: A semantic analysis on coitus verses
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - While studies on contextual coitus verses interpretations have been explored by many scholars, there is a paucity of research addressing the theme holistically and spotlighting the aspects of moral ethics of its communication. To fill this lacuna, this study aims to analyse the communication ethics of coitus words in the Qur???an. Two main questions are discussed in this study. Firstly, what is the semantic meaning of coitus in the Qur???an? Secondly, why does the Qur???an employ certain terminologies to convey the topic of coitus? This study applies a case study design to analyse the word ???coitus??? in the verses of the Qur???an holistically. The results show that the Qur???an utilises 12 keywords related to coitus for the purpose of fostering the communication ethics of the Arab community at the time of revelation. Moreover, this study found that the Qur???an uses those specific keywords to respond to the (1) sexual behaviour of pre-Islamic Arab community, (2) narration of eroticism in other scriptures (Kitab) and (3) gender inequality in sexuality. This study resolves that the words of ???coitus??? in the Qur???an have implications for the emergence of Quranic communication ethics, which respects the aspects of comprehensiveness, politeness, analogy, aesthetics, intensity and gender equality. These six aspects form sexual communication ethics that are probed from a humanist perspective. Contribution: This article contends to unify the concept of theology and the principles of communication ethics. In particular, this study provides a theoretical contribution to the ethics of sexual communication that is sourced from the worldview of Qur???anic theology. Also, the methodology of this study can be a prototype of semantic analysis research that discusses certain topics and spot important keywords around that topic.

TI  - Towards a framework for public relations scholarship and practice in Africa: a globalisation perspective
T2  - CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Much of public relations scholarship in the last three decades has been dominated by discussions about best practices. Theories developed over the years have often been based on western practices with little focus on emerging economies such as Africa. The growing call for a shift to a new system, especially from a non-western perspective has resulted in scholars examining public relations scholarship and practice in other jurisdictions, particularly in Asia. The onset of globalisation increased the scholarly discussion on public relations theorising, with culture playing a significant role in these discussions. This paper undertakes a review of the various discussions on public relations theorising due to globalisation and discusses its implications for public relations scholarship and practice in Africa. Design/methodology/approach The paper approaches the issue by examining relevant literature on globalisation and societal changes, public relations theorising, and the African worldview. Findings The paper concludes by proposing an African public relations framework that reflects the African worldview. The framework proposes that African public relations can be premised on four levels, humanist, relational, communalist, and strategic. Research limitations/implications This research is limited in the sense that the proposed framework has not been empirically tested for verification. It offers scholars the opportunity to empirically test it within the African setting. Practical implications The framework presents an opportunity for practitioners to review public relations practice within the African context. Originality/value The paper's originality is premised on the development of a public relations framework premised on African social values.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface of the Earth has been changing as a result of human induced activities and natural processes. Accurate representation of landscape characteristics and precise determination of spatio-temporal changes provide valuable inputs for environmental models, landscape and urban planning, and historical land cover change analysis. This study aims to determine historical land use and land cover (LULC) changes using multi-modal geospatial data, which are the cadastral maps produced in 1858, monochrome aerial photographs obtained in 1955, and multi-spectral WorldView-3 satellite images of 2020. We investigated two pilot regions, Aksu and Kestel towns in Bursa/Turkey, to analyze the long-term LULC changes quantitatively and to understand the driving forces that caused the changes. We propose methods to facilitate the preparation of historical datasets for the LULC change detection and present an object-oriented joint classification scheme for multi-source datasets to accurately map the spatio-temporal changes. Our approach minimized the amount of manual digitizing required for the boundary delineation of LULC classes from historical geospatial data. Also, our quantitative analysis of LULC maps indicates diverging developments for the selected locations in the long period of 162 years. We observed rural depopulation and gradual afforestation in Aksu; whereas, agricultural land abandonment and deforestation in Kestel.

TI  - Association of CT findings in patients with hemoperitoneum due to ruptured ovarian cysts with subsequent intervention
T2  - EMERGENCY RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Hemoperitoneum caused by ovarian cyst rupture may necessitate intervention. The literature is lacking in descriptions of CT findings that help guide patient management. The purpose of this study is to consider CT findings associated with a need for intervention (surgical or interventional radiology management) versus conservative treatment (observation, pain management, and blood transfusions).Methods Two radiologists retrospectively and independently reviewed 103 CTs of pre-menopausal women who presented with acute hemoperitoneum related to ruptured ovarian cysts between January 2010 and January 2019. The following imaging features were assessed: ovarian cyst characteristics, sentinel clot, contrast extravasation, and hemoperitoneum size. Findings were correlated with patient demographics, clinical parameters, and management with surgery/interventional radiology procedure (intervention group) versus conservative management (conservative group).Results Of the 103 patients with hemoperitoneum from cyst rupture, 16% (n = 16) required intervention, and 84% underwent conservative treatment (n = 87). Length of stay (p = .008) was higher in the intervention group. Statistically significant CT findings in the intervention versus conservative group included (p-value reader 1/p-value reader 2) greatest AP dimension of hemoperitoneum (p = .001/p = 0.02), posterior cul-de-sac AP dimension (p = 0.03/p = .006), total cul-de-sac AP dimension (p = .002/p = .007), and number of spaces with hemoperitoneum (p = .01/p = .02). There was good to excellent inter-reader agreement for these findings (ICC 0.68-0.91). Active contrast extravasation was significant for one reader (p = .02) with poor inter-reader agreement (ICC 0.36). In utilizing ROC curves, thresholds of 107 mm (greatest axial AP dimension of hemoperitoneum) yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.81 and 0.62 for reader 1 and 0.69 and 0.55 for reader 2; 45 mm (posterior cul-de-sac AP dimension) yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 0.63 for reader 1 and 0.94 and 0.49 for reader 2; 70 mm (total cul-de-sac AP dimension) yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 0.64 for reader 1 and 0.75 and 0.50 for reader 2; and greater than 5 spaces yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 0.58 for reader 1 and 0.69 and 0.70 for reader 2.Conclusion CT findings associated with intervention in hemoperitoneum due to ovarian cyst rupture include size of hemoperitoneum, number of abdominopelvic spaces with hemoperitoneum, and contrast extravasation.

TI  - The "Primitive Brain Dysfunction" Theory of Autism: The Superior Colliculus Role
T2  - FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of the pathogenesis of autism will help clarify our conception of the complexity of normal brain development. The crucial deficit may lie in the postnatal changes that vision produces in the brainstem nuclei during early life. The superior colliculus is the primary brainstem visual center. Although difficult to examine in humans with present techniques, it is known to support behaviors essential for every vertebrate to survive, such as the ability to pay attention to relevant stimuli and to produce automatic motor responses based on sensory input. From birth to death, it acts as a brain sentinel that influences basic aspects of our behavior. It is the main brainstem hub that lies between the environment and the rest of the higher neural system, making continuous, implicit decisions about where to direct our attention. The conserved cortex-like organization of the superior colliculus in all vertebrates allows the early appearance of primitive emotionally-related behaviors essential for survival. It contains first-line specialized neurons enabling the detection and tracking of faces and movements from birth. During development, it also sends the appropriate impulses to help shape brain areas necessary for social-communicative abilities. These abilities require the analysis of numerous variables, such as the simultaneous evaluation of incoming information sustained by separate brain networks (visual, auditory and sensory-motor, social, emotional, etc.), and predictive capabilities which compare present events to previous experiences and possible responses. These critical aspects of decision-making allow us to evaluate the impact that our response or behavior may provoke in others. The purpose of this review is to show that several enigmas about the complexity of autism might be explained by disruptions of collicular and brainstem functions. The results of two separate lines of investigation: 1. the cognitive, etiologic, and pathogenic aspects of autism on one hand, and two. the functional anatomy of the colliculus on the other, are considered in order to bridge the gap between basic brain science and clinical studies and to promote future research in this unexplored area.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adherence to infection prevention and control measures between 2019 and 2021 in Swiss sentinel private practices: repeated cross-sectional surveys
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIMS OF THE STUDY: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health care settings, including primary care. We aimed to describe how it influenced adherence to infection prevention and control measures in private practices in the Swiss sentinel network (Sentinella).METHOD: An online cross-sectional survey was sent to the 181 Sentinella practices in 2021 that included questions on the practice's spatial organisation, staff habits and vaccination coverage, ventilation, mask wearing, hand hygiene, as well as triage and separation of patients with suspected infection. Results were compared with those of a 2019 survey conducted in the same setting.RESULTS: We received 127 valid questionnaires (70.2% response rate). At the time of the study, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was underway among physicians (51.3%). Between 2019 and 2021, an absence of specific recommendations on mask wearing for staff (55.7%) changed into a recommendation for continuous wearing (93.7%); hand hygiene improved, especially upon arrival at the practice (63.9% vs 85.8%; p <0.001) and before examining patients (74.6% vs 88.2%; p <0.010); impossibility of distancing symptomatic patients dropped (27.9% vs 3.9%, p <0.001); and ventilation and cleaning improved (p <0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to important changes in adherence to the recommended IPC measures.

TI  - Characterizing the spatial patterns of on- and off-year Moso bamboo forests with multisource data in Southeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Moso bamboo forests (MBFs) exhibit unique phenological phenomena, such as on-/off-years, which play an important role in regulating the sustainable management of MBF ecosystems. With human disturbance, on- and off-year effects occur at both spatial and temporal scales. Quantifying the spatial pattern of MBF performance remains a challenge because of physiological and ecological complexity, regional policy differences and human management intensity. In this paper, three zones (Anji, Guangde and Yixing) with similar administrative areas were selected for study. An on-/off-year MBF map was constructed by Sentinel-2 time series data and the multitemporal bamboo index. The spatial distribution patterns of the on-/off-year MBFs were analyzed from different perspectives, such as administrative zones and physical conditions. A new Moso bamboo on-/off-year differentiation index (MODI) was proposed, and MODI spatial pattern maps for different administrative zones were completed and comparatively analyzed. The results showed that (1) the total administrative area of each study zone was nearly 2000 km2, but the MBF distribution areas were quite different, and the MBF spatial areas in Anji, Guangde and Yixing were 637.6 km2, 334.5 km2 and 112.0 km2, respectively. (2) The MBFs were mainly distributed in mountainous areas, especially at elevations ranging from 100 to 400 m and slopes ranging from 5 to 35 degrees. (3) On- and off-year MBFs occurred in different provinces; generally, the area of the off-year MBFs was larger than that of the on-year MBFs in each zone in 2019. (4) The newly proposed MODI can effectively detect spatial distribution differences between the on- and off-year MBFs in a region, providing valuable information for government decision-making and bamboo forest management.

TI  - Geospatial technology-based analysis of land use land cover dynamics and its effects on land surface temperature in Guder River sub-basin, Abay Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is increasing due to the decline of vegetation cover and an increase in barren land in the Guder River sub-basin. In the present study, LST, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), and land use land cover (LULC) and the relationship between them were estimated using thermal bands and multispectral bands from Landsat TM from 1990, ETM + from 2000, and OLI/TIRS from 2020. The LST of the study area is increased by 11.3 degrees C from 1990 to 2020 due to the loss of vegetation cover and expansion of barren land. The relationships between LST, NDVI, and NDBaI were estimated using correlation analysis. The NDBaI has strong positive relationship with LST (R-2 = 0.96), while NDVI has a strong negative relationship with LST (R-2 = 0.96). The mean LST was increased over cultivated land and bare land by 11.3 degrees C and 10.6 degrees C from 1990 to 2020, respectively. Consequently, expansion of cultivated land and bare land was the main reason for the increase of LST. We recommend that decision-makers and concerned stakeholders to promote the importance of vegetation cover in climate change mitigation and minimizing LST.

TI  - Serological and molecular epidemiology of leptospirosis and the role of dogs as sentinel for human infection in Nigeria
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Prospective cross-sectional study of dogs in Nigeria to study leptospirosis, inferred to be endemic in all regions of the country by researchers. Aim is to generate empirical updated evidence of leptospiral infection and delineate serovars involved. Methods: Study determined the sero-prevalence and infection rate in 342 dogs using sero-assays, culture isolation and novel qPCR. In-house designed primers targeting conserved regions were used to amplify genes in quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) for leptospiral detection to serogroups. Molecular analysis of the leptospiral 16S rRNA and LipL32 genes were used for identification of pathogenic Leptospira species. Primers targeting the Oantigen (rfb) region of the Leptospira lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used for differentiating serovars based on comparative melting temperature (Tm) analysis against reference serogroups. Results: Overall serological and bacteriological prevalence of 56 (16.4%) and 40 (11.7%) respectively was recorded. Vaccination, ages and season(s) were the strongest determinants of infection. Unvaccinated animals, stray dogs and symptomatic dogs presented statistically significant (P < 0.05) higher risk of infection: OR 25.531 (6.108, 106.712; 95% CI).Discussion: The evidence suggests 1 of every 10 dogs is infected and could be symptomatic for the disease or a carrier of leptospires in the studied region in Nigeria with attendant public health risks.

TI  - Effect of Mailing Educational Material to Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Their Clinicians on Use of Oral Anticoagulants A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Only about half of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at increased risk for stroke are treated with an oral anticoagulant (OAC), despite guideline recommendations for their use. Educating patients with AF about prevention of stroke with OACs may enable them as agents of change to initiate OAC treatment.OBJECTIVE To determine whether an educational intervention directed to patients and their clinicians stimulates the use of OACs in patients with AF who are not receiving OACs.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Implementation of a Randomized Controlled Trial to Improve Treatment With Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (IMPACT-AFib) trial was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted from September 25, 2017, to May 1, 2019, embedded in health plans that participate in the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System. It used the distributed database comprising health plan members to identify eligible patients, their clinicians, and outcomes. IMPACT-AFib enrolled patients with AF, a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (cardiac failure or dysfunction, hypertension, age 65-74 [1 point] or >= 75 years [2 points], diabetes, and stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [2 points]-vascular disease, and sex category [female]) score of 2 or more, no evidence of OAC prescription dispensing in the preceding 12 months, and no hospitalization-related bleeding event within the prior 6 months.INTERVENTIONS Randomization to a single mailing of patient and/or clinician educational materials vs control.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Analysis was performed on a modified intention-to-treat basis. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with at least 1 OAC prescription dispensed or at least 4 international normalized ratio test results within 1 year of the intervention.RESULTS Among 47 333 patients, there were 24 909 men (52.6%), the mean (SD) age was 77.9 (9.7) years, mean (SD) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score was 4.5 (1.7), 22 404 patients (47.3%) had an ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) bleeding risk score of 5 or more, and 8890 patients (18.8%) had a history of hospitalization for bleeding. There were 2328 of 23 546 patients (9.9%) in the intervention group with initiation of OAC at 1 year compared with 2330 of 23 787 patients (9.8%) in the control group (adjusted OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.95-1.07]; P = .79).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among a large population with AF with a guideline indication for OACs for stroke prevention who were randomized to a mailed educational intervention or to usual care, there was no clinically meaningful, numerical, or statistically significant difference in rates of OAC initiation. More-intensive interventions are needed to try and address the public health issue of underuse of anticoagulation for stroke prevention among patients with AF.

TI  - The impact of urbanization on air quality in Africa from time and spatial perspectives
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of air pollution caused by urbanization in fast-growing countries has begun to receive widespread attention. Africa is facing serious air pollution problem and is experiencing rapid urbanization. However, due to the backward economy and the difficulty of obtaining data, there have been few studies on the impact of urbanization on air quality in Africa. In this paper, we use remote sensing data aerosol optical depth (AOD) to characterize air quality, and night lights to characterize urbanization. We aim to analyze the characteristics of air quality distribution in Africa and investigate the relationship between urbanization and AOD from the perspective of time by random forest and space by adopting the geographically weighted regression models (GWR). The results show that (1) in the past 10 years, though not obvious, the AOD in the African region has a slight downward trend from 2011 to 2020. And a significant spatial correlation between urbanization and AOD is confirmed; (2) treating Africa as a whole, AOD has spatial spillover effects and could be affected significantly and positively by urbanization; (3) locally, taking each country as the scale, urbanization could have different impacts on AOD for different countries. In Central Africa, the increase in urbanization will bring about an increase in AOD; and in Western Africa, the increase in urbanization will help reduce AOD; (4) improving power facilities, increasing per capita income, and strengthening commodity trade are conducive to improving air quality in Africa.
