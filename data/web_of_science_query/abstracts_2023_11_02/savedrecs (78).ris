TI  - One-step nucleic acid amplification vs ultrastaging in the detection of sentinel lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Utilisation of the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) molecular biology method for the detection of the metastatic involvement of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A comparison with histopathological ultrastaging and a description of the clinical consequences. Methods Surgically treated EC patients underwent detection of SLNs. Nodes greater than 5 mm were cut into sections 2-mm thick parallel to the short axis of the node. Odd sections were examined according to the OSNA method, while even ones according to an appropriate ultrastaging protocol. Nodes less than or equal to 5 mm were cut into halves along the longitudinal axis with one half examined according to the OSNA method and the other half by ultrastaging. Results Fifty-eight patients were included and 135 SLNs were acquired. Both ultrastaging and OSNA agreed on 116 results. According to the OSNA method, 20.69% more patients were classified into International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III. When comparing the results of the OSNA method to the conclusions of ultrastaging as a reference method, sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of 85.5% and concordance of 85.9% were attained. Conclusions The results of the OSNA method showed a higher frequency of detection of micrometastases and included 20.69% more patients into FIGO stage III.

TI  - Watershed-scale mapping of fractional snow cover under conifer forest canopy using lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of snow cover is critical for predicting ecohydrological processes and underpins mountain water supplies in ranges like the Sierra Nevada in the Western United States. Many key water supply areas are covered by montane forests, which have substantial effects on the amount and timing of snowmelt. In-situ observations of snow-forest interactions have limited spatial coverage and remote sensing using optical sensors (e.g. MODIS) cannot observe snow cover below the canopy. In this study, we developed and verified a lidar-based method to detect snow cover under canopy, investigated how fractional snow covered area (fSCA) varies with topography in open versus under canopy areas and developed a correction factor that could be used to improve satellite derived fSCA products. We developed our new method using three snow-on lidar overflights and verified it with in-situ distributed temperature sensor (DTS) observations at Sagehen Creek watershed in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. DTS validation of lidar classifications showed excellent agreement at 85-96%, including high agreement and large number of returns in under canopy locations. The lidar-derived fSCA observations generally showed earlier snow disappearance under the canopy than in open positions, which is consistent with relatively warm temperatures and greater longwave radiation. However, in contrast to expectations, areas with high solar exposure (i.e. high southwestness) exhibited higher fSCA under the canopy. Results indicated that the k factor (the ratio of under canopy fSCA to open fSCA) varied systematically with southwestness and elevation. Using this factor to correct the study domain fSCA indicated that the typical assumption that k = 1 could lead to an up to similar to 0.05 bias (in fSCA units) towards overestimation. However, within 10 and 100-m individual pixels the fSCA overprediction bias can be 25-30% for higher fSCA values. Although uncertainty would be reduced using higher snow-on lidar point densities, our method shows promise to improve the typical assumption that snow disappearance is identical in under the canopy and in the open (k = 1). Future applications of our lidar-based method at different sites with varying climate, topography and vegetation structure has the dual potential to expand understanding of snow-forest interactions in complex terrain and improve operational fSCA products.

TI  - Evaluating solar energy technical and economic potential on rooftops in an urban setting: the city of Lethbridge, Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy deployment is gaining greater attention as a sustainable source of energy that could alleviate aspects of the current climate crisis. Knowledge of the characteristics and economics of the solar electricity sector is required to integrate it in the energy generation and utilization mix. Unlike energy generation from fossil fuels, renewable energy sources have relatively low geographic density and are spread unevenly over large areas. Therefore, especially in cities, where space has greater value and opportunity costs, finding suitable spaces for implementing solar systems are essential to promote the use of solar technologies. Using remote-sensing data, the intricate topography of cities can be modelled, and insolation incident at each location can be estimated. A multi-criteria approach based on geographic information systems (GIS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is used in this research to estimate rooftop photovoltaic electricity potential of buildings in an urban environment, the city of Lethbridge. An economic assessment is conducted utilizing present market prices to determine economically attractive rooftop PV systems. The total rooftop photovoltaic (PV) electricity potential is evaluated and compared with the local electricity demand. Effective expansion of solar power systems in the city is achieved by determining the geographic distribution of the best locations for exploiting the systems. This study estimates that the rooftop PV electricity generation potential of the city of Lethbridge is approximately 301 +/- 29 (SD) GWh annually (almost 38% of its annual electricity consumption in 2016), and about 96% of the recognized potential rooftop PV systems are economically feasible. The results can assist in making informed policy decisions about investment in deployment of renewable energy generation.

TI  - How to avoid false interpretations of Sentinel-1A TOPSAR interferometric data in landslide mapping? A case study: recent landslides in Transdanubia, Hungary
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a crucial issue to better understand the usability of Sentinel-1 satellites in geomorphologic applications, since Sentinel-1 and the Copernicus Program are considered to be the workhorse of Earth observation by the European Space Agency during the next decades. Yet, a very limited experience is available on the applicability of Sentinel-1 images in the detection and identification of surface deformations and especially landslide mapping and monitoring in densely vegetated (low-coherence) areas. Few Synthetic Aperture Radar images (not more than 20) are sufficient for a successful run of interferometric stacking algorithms. This number is really low compared to the tremendous data flow of Sentinel-1 images that are available for interferometric analysis nowadays. Despite the availability of acquisitions, only a few papers exist on the accuracy of Sentinel-1 data, signal-to-noise ratio and the value of the acquired imagery for geomorphologic interpretation. Two test sites and a control siteaffected by active surface deformationshave been investigated using 40 Sentinel-1A images and conventional persistent scatterers (PSI) method. PSI results have been combined with the geomorphologic information of the studied sites. We verified that the given number of Sentinel-1A acquisitions provide a unique base for surface deformation recognition and mapping in low-coherence areas. We found that scatterers were corrupted by a strong noise if their line of sight (LOS) velocity was below +/- 6-7mm/year all over the three test sites, although noise can easily be reduced. Noise reduction was achieved by a significant increase of the length of time series, i.e., time range between the first and last image to reduce the effect of atmospheric phase screen (APS).

AB  - The present state of the environment in the rural area has been analyzed. The main factors which led to the existing situation have been revealed. The structure of Ukraine's crops area and the amount of accumulated waste in Ukraine influencing the agricultural landscapes of rural areas have been analyzed. The dependence between the amount of accumulated waste and the incidence within the time interval was revealed. As a result of calculations, we have received the social losses due to an increase in the morbidity of the population living in the area of the impact of landfills, the coefficient of ecological stability of the studied territories was calculated and it was found that the presence of landfills reduces the coefficient of ecological stability. It has been revealed that with the help of satellite data monitoring of agricultural landscapes is possible, which can be used in calculating the price of land considering the quality factor of this land.

T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A local-scale mesquite tree (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) aboveground biomass map contribute to our understanding of the spatial distribution of woody plant aboveground biomass, and carbon stocks and fluxes in rangeland ecosystems. The objective of the study was examining a methodological approach to use airborne lidar data and multispectral imagery to create very high spatial resolution local-scale mesquite tree aboveground biomass maps by comparing three statistical methods and identifying significant prediction variables. The three statistical methods were the stepwise regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and the random forests. These methods were applied to establish the mesquite tree aboveground biomass equations and model from the in-situ mesquite tree aboveground biomass with the lidar metrics and multispectral data. The results showed the stepwise regression and LASSO had limited adj-R-2 and MSE. However, the random forests method with combined multispectral imagery and lidar data presented acceptable MSE and R-2 (1.08 Mg ha(-1) and 0.37). In summary, the random forests method with combined multispectral imagery and lidar data offered the most reliable and reasonable combination to generate a very high spatial resolution local-scale mesquite tree aboveground biomass map.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The use of less radical surgery for early stage cervical cancer has often been discussed. To better determine eligible candidates for less radical surgery, we investigated the risk factors for parametrial involvement (PI). Methods The study included 193 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB cervical cancer who were treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy between 2008 and 2014. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not the parametrium was involved pathologically. The two groups were compared with regards to clinical and histopathological variables. Results Univariate analysis showed that International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, clinical tumor size, depth of stromal invasion, lymphovascular space invasion and pelvic lymph node metastasis were significantly associated with PI (P < 0.05 each). Multivariate analysis showed pelvic lymph node metastasis was an independent risk factor for PI (odds ratio, 10.70; [95% confidence interval, 3.02-48.08]; P = 0.0006). All patients with clinical tumor size less than or equal to 2 cm and negative for pelvic lymph node metastasis had no PI. Conclusion Cervical cancer with the tumor less than or equal to 2 cm and negative for pelvic lymph node metastasis seldom has PI. These patients are good candidates for less radical surgery.

TI  - Quantifying mass balance of East-Karakoram glaciers using geodetic technique
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram Range comprises the heavily glaciated mountains outside the Polar regions. A comprehensive assessment of glaciers variation in this region is crucial to ascertain constant water supply under different scenarios of futuristic climate change. Lack of accessibility to the Karakoram region has limited the use of conventional methods in monitoring variations in thickness and mass of glaciers, alternatively promoting the use of remote sensing based methods. The present study quantifies changes in thickness and mass budget of 24 glaciers in East-Karakoram region using geodetic technique. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) adjustments and comparisons were made between Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) C-band DEM, year 2000 and recent DEMs of the years 2009 and 2014, which were generated using stereo pairs of Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and Cartosat-1 respectively. The vertical accuracy of recent DEMs was assessed using ICESat-1 laser points. Other biases such as elevation dependent, radar penetration, terrain curvature and seasonality were also rectified before computing the glacier mass balance. Geodetic esimates indicate an overall marginal thinning ( - 0.09 +/- 0.16 m/yr) and negative mass budget ( - 0.08 +/- 0.13 m.w.e./yr) during the years 2000-2014. Interestingly, one glacier showed surge-type activity (advancing and thickening terminus) during 2000-2014, with highest (0.59) Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) amongst studied glaciers. Time series analysis of climate data (temperature and precipitation) recorded at field observatories depict overall warming in the East-Karakoram region. The higher rate of mass loss during 2009-2014 ( - 0.07 +/- 0.13 m.w.e./yr) compared to 2000-2009 ( - 0.05 +/- 0.12 m.w.e./yr) was found in agreement with the rise in temperature and decline in precipitation over the region during different years. The results thus indicate an insignificant mass loss in East-Karakoram glaciers and thus exhibit a nearly balanced state since the year 2000 in contrast to glacier mass loss in other Himalayan ranges.

TI  - Assessment of land degradation and desertification due to migration of sand and sand dunes in Beluguppa Mandal of Anantapur district (AP, India), using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and desertification by means of sand migration, is one of the major problems facing the world today. Degradation is the process of conversion of productive land into waste land or degraded to desertified land. Degradation is influenced by the natural and anthropological causes in arid and semi-arid regions. According to a report by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), 96 million hectors or 30 percent of India's agricultural land, is affected by the land degradation. The present study deals with identification, mapping and assessment of desertified areas in Beluguppa Mandal of Anantapur district, using geospatial techniques, aided by Landsat satellite images. The main reason for land degradation and desertification of this area is the migration of sand and sand dunes by aeolian process. Present study is focused to define the desertification in the study area during 18 years period beginning 2000 and onwards. Hence, temporal data of Landsat satellite image of past 18 years (i.e., 2000-2018), were collected and processed, to know how much of land is covered by migrated sand dunes and get desertified. By using geospatial technologies like satellite remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS), identification and mapping of desertified areas and progress of desertification were made in the present study. The results of the present study clearly reveal that 26 hectares of agriculture land is desertified in Srirangapuram village, and an area of 14 hectares of agriculture land is desertified in Narinjagundlapalle village in Beluguppa mandal of Anantapur district, A.P.

T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Exponential growth of population and the resultant rapid rate of urbanization and industrialization in India have significantly transformed its nighttime light environment. The study makes an attempt to analyze the spatio-temporal pattern of light pollution and its causative actors in a fast-developing economy. We utilized nighttime light data from 1993 to 2013 and calibrated through linear regression. Ten patches of major changes from the whole study area were selected to assess the intensity of light pollution at regional scale. Spatial analysis of light pollution in selected patches revealed that New Delhi, Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh experienced increase in very high light pollution intensity. West Bengal, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu witnessed a remarkable change from low to high light pollution. Urban expansion, industrial development and air pollution are main drivers for increasing light pollution. Strong correlation was found between light pollution and digital numbers (DN) values at regional scale. The maps generated through Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner Night Time Light data not only helped in assessing the intensity of light pollution but also identified its causative actors. The results of study can effectively be utilized for setting priorities of environmental protection in different geographical regions at various scales.

TI  - Seizure detection devices for use in antiseizure medication clinical trials: A systematic review
T2  - SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: This study characterizes the current capabilities of seizure detection device (SDD) technology and evaluates the fitness of these devices for use in anti-seizure medication (ASM) clinical trials.Methods: Through a systematic literature review, 36 wireless SDDs featured in published device validation studies were identified. Each device's seizure detection capabilities that addressed ASM clinical trial primary endpoint measurement needs were cataloged.Results: The two most common types of seizures targeted by ASMs in clinical trials are generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures and focal with impaired awareness (FIA) seizures. The Brain Sentinel SPEAC achieved the highest performance for the detection of GTC seizures (F-1-score = 0.95). A non-commercial wireless EEG device achieved the highest performance for the detection of FIA seizures (F-1-score = 0.88).Discussion: A preliminary assessment of device capabilities for measuring selected ASM clinical trial secondary endpoints was performed. The need to address key limitations in validation studies is highlighted in order to support future assessments of SDD fitness for ASM clinical trial use. In tandem, a stepwise framework to streamline device testing is put forth. These suggestions provide a starting point for establishing SDD reporting requirements before device integration into ASM clinical trials.

TI  - On the Potential of RST-FLOOD on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Data for Flooded Areas Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and continuous information about flood spatiotemporal evolution are fundamental to ensure an effective implementation of the relief and rescue operations in case of inundation events. In this framework, satellite remote sensing may provide a valuable contribution provided that robust data analysis methods are implemented and suitable data, in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, are employed. In this paper, the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST) approach, a satellite-based differential approach, already applied at detecting flooded areas (and therefore christened RST-FLOOD) with good results on different polar orbiting optical sensors (i.e., Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer - AVHRR - and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - MODIS), has been fully implemented on time series of Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP-SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. The flooding event affecting the Metaponto Plain in Basilicata and Puglia regions (southern Italy) in December 2013 was selected as a case study and investigated by analysing five years (only December month) of VIIRS Imagery bands at 375 m spatial resolution. The achieved results clearly indicate the potential of the proposed approach, especially when compared with a satellite-based high resolution map of flooded area, as well as with the official flood hazard map of the area and the outputs of a recent published VIIRS-based method. Both flood extent and dynamics have been recognized with good reliability during the investigated period, with only a residual 11.5% of possible false positives over an inundated area extent of about 73 km(2). In addition, a flooded area of about 18 km(2) was found outside the hazard map, suggesting it requires updating to better manage flood risk and prevent future damages. Finally, the achieved results indicate that medium-resolution optical data, if analysed with robust methodologies like RST-FLOOD, can be suitable for detecting and monitoring floods also in case of small hydrological basins.

TI  - A technique for testing hypotheses for distributions of multidimensional spectral data using a nonparametric pattern recognition algorithm
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with a new method of testing hypotheses for the distribution of multidimensional remote sensing spectral data. The proposed technique is based on the use of nonparametric algorithms for pattern recognition. Testing the hypothesis of the identity of two laws of distributions of multidimensional random variables is replaced by testing a hypothesis stating that the pattern recognition error equals 0.5. The application of this technique allows doing without the decomposition of the random variable domain into multidimensional intervals, which is typical for the Pearson criterion. Its effectiveness is confirmed by the results of testing the hypotheses of the distribution of spectral data of remote sensing in forestry. The analysis of the distribution laws for the following types of forestry is carried out: dark coniferous forest, damaged and dry forest stands. The initial information was obtained from the southern Siberia remote sensing data using six spectral channels of Landsat. The results of the research form a basis for a set of significant spectral features when dealing with forest condition monitoring.

TI  - Application of remote sensing technique for drought assessment based on normalized difference drought index, a case study of Bac Binh district, Binh Thuan province (Vietnam)
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon, which occurs in most regions in the world, caused immense damage in agricultural production and seriously affected on the environment. Droughts often occur on a large scale, so traditional observation techniques for drought monitoring are difficult, time consuming and costly. Remote sensing data provides information on the Earth's surface at different spectrum channels and and wide coverage has been used effectively in monitoring and severe drought. This paper presents the results of the study on drought assessment in Bac Binh district, Binh Thuan province using LANDSAT multispectral imagery based on normalized difference drought index (NDDI). The results obtained in the study can be used to create drought level map and provides information to help managers set measures to minimize damage caused by drought.

TI  - Transgenerational Transmission of Trauma: Psychiatric Evaluation of Offspring of Former "Comfort Women," Survivors of the Japanese Military Sexual Slavery during World War II
T2  - PSYCHIATRY INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - "Comfort women" are survivors of sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, who endured extensive trauma including massive rape and physical torture. While previous studies have been focused on the trauma of the survivors themselves, the effects of the trauma on the offspring has never been evaluated before. In this article, we reviewed the first study on the offspring of former "comfort women" and aimed to detect the evidence of transgenerational transmission of trauma. In-depth psychiatric interviews and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Axis I Disorders were conducted with six offspring of former "comfort women." Among the six participants, five suffered from at least one psychiatric disorder including major depressive disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, insomnia disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and alcohol use disorder. Participants showed similar shame and hyperarousal symptoms as their mothers regarding stimuli related to the "comfort woman" issue. Increased irritability, problems with aggression control, negative worldview, and low self-esteem were evident in the children of mothers with posttraumatic stress disorder. Finding evidence of transgenerational transmission of trauma in offspring of "comfort women" is important. Future studies should include more samples and adopt a more objective method.

TI  - Spatial distribution of soil moisture estimates using a multiple linear regression model and Korean geostationary satellite (COMS) data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to estimate the spatial distribution of the soil moisture (SM) in South Korea (99,260 km(2)) from January 2013 to May 2015 using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model with data from the Korean multipurpose geostationary Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), and land surface temperature (LST) data. The normalized distribution vegetation index (NDVI) from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite was used to reflect the vegetation variations. Observed precipitation data measured by automatic weather stations (AWSs) operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) were collected, and SM data were collected from 38 stations operated by various institutions. The regression coefficients of the MLR model were estimated seasonally considering five days of preceding precipitation. The p-values of all regression coefficients were below 0.05, and all coefficients of determination (R-2) ranged from 0.17 to 0.63. Specifically, the R-2 of loam in the summer was the highest at 0.63, and most of the R-2 values were 0.4 or higher. The results of the SM regression showed that the overall R-2 was higher than 0.4 and that the root mean square error (RMSE) was less than 5% at all but a few stations. A time series analysis of the simulated SM revealed that the observed SM data ranged from 0 to 20% for sand, 10 to 30% for loam, 20 to 40% for clay and 30 to 50% for silt. The simulated SM followed the volatility of the observed data in most of the soils. The spatial distribution of the simulated SM showed the same trends with the observed data on the monthly spatial precipitation map. Consequently, the estimated map of the soil moisture index (SMI) can be used to better understand the severity of drought and the variability in the SM.

TI  - Prescription Refill Gap of Endocrine Treatment from Electronic Medical Records as a Prognostic Factor in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Discontinuation of hormone therapy is known to lead to a poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. We aimed to investigate the prescription gap as a prompt index of medication adherence by using prescription data extracted from patient electronic medical records.Methods: A total of 5,928 patients diagnosed with invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer, who underwent surgery from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2009, were enrolled retrospectively. The prescription data for 4.5 years of hormonal treatment and breast cancer-related events after treatment completion were analyzed. We examined the characteristics and prognoses of breast cancer in patients with and without a 4-week gap.Results: Patients with a gap showed a significantly higher risk of breast cancer recurrence, distant metastasis, breast cancer-specific death, and overall death after adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.389; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089-1.772; HR, 1.568; 95% CI, 1.158-2.123; HR, 2.108; 95% CI, 1.298-3.423; and HR, 2.102; 95% CI, 1.456-3.034, respectively). When patients were categorized based on gap summation, the lower third (160 days) and fourth (391 days) quartiles showed a significantly higher risk of distant metastasis (HR, 1.758; 95% CI, 1.186-2.606 and HR, 1.844; 95% CI, 1.262-2.693, respectively).Conclusion: A gap of > 4 weeks in hormonal treatment has negative effects on breast cancer prognosis, and can hence be used as a sentinel index of higher risk due to treatment non-adherence. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether the gap can be used as a universal index for monitoring the adherence to hormonal treatment.

TI  - Mapping woody plant community turnover with space-borne hyperspectral data - a case study in the Cerrado
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective conservation measures require the knowledge on the spatial patterns of species communities and their turnover. This knowledge is, however, many times lacking, particularly so for complex systems. On the other hand, recent developments have resulted in tools that enable the mapping of these patterns from remote sensing data, such as Sparse Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (SGDM). SGDM is a two-stage approach, which combines a Sparse Canonical Component analysis and a Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM), thus being designed to deal with high-dimensional data to predict community turnover in GDM. In this study, we use space-borne hyperspectral data to map woody plant community patterns collected in two study sites in the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah), namely, the Parque Estadual da Serra Azul (PESA) in Mato Grosso state and Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Veadeiros (PNCV) in Goias state. Field data were collected in both study sites, following a systematic sampling scheme adapted for the Cerrado. The Cerrado is the most diverse of all the world's savannahs, and while holding a high diversity and endemism of species, this biome is mostly unprotected and understudied. We used Hyperion data acquired over the two study sites, which were subject to data pre-processing (including radiometric and geometric corrections, as well as correction for sensor errors) and quality screening before analysis. Our models were used to map woody plant community patterns and turnover for the study areas. We also inspected the Hyperion spectral bands which most contributed in the SGDM, for each site. Furthermore, the modelled patterns were interpreted with respect to the ecological characteristics of the respective species, this way further enhancing our understanding of this complex system. This study has demonstrated that this approach is suitable for mapping woody plant communities in heterogeneous systems, based on combined field and space-borne hyperspectral data.

TI  - Expansion of eucalyptus energy plantations under a Livestock-Forestry Integration scenario for agroindustries in Western Parana, Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in the world population has caused a rise in the demand for animal protein, particularly that of swine and poultry. Brazil is among the world's largest producers of these two commodities, with the western region of Parana accounting for a significant fraction of this production. To industrialize this raw material requires a large amount of energy, and much of this demand is supplied by eucalyptus biomass in the form of woodchips originating from distant regions, which increases the cost of production. The Livestock-Forestry Integration (LFI) system, which is encouraged by the national government program of Low Carbon Agriculture (LCA), is a eucalyptus production system that is growing in Brazil. In the Western region of Parana, there is widespread availability of pasture areas which could be used to produce eucalyptus in this type of system, and meet the biomass demand of agroindustries. The objective of this work was to explore the expansion of eucalyptus plantations under an LFI scenario for agroindustries in Western Parana, Brazil. In addition to estimating the area with the potential for expansion of agriculture by means of Landsat-8 satellite images, digital elevation models integrated with the Geographic Information System geoprocessing and the software ArcGIS were used. It was found that conversion of 4.24% of the pasture areas into LFI would meet the current demand for woodchips of the agroindustries that slaughter poultry and swine in Western Parana. Using 8.04% would satisfy the demand until 2025. It was verified that there are 3972.10 km(2) available for expansion of agriculture in the region. The methodology used here serves as a reference for future work.

TI  - An Image-Pyramid-Based Raster-to-Vector Conversion (IPBRTVC) Framework for Consecutive-Scale Cartography and Synchronized Generalization of Classic Objects
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are some key problems in raster-to-vector conversion and cartographic generalization, which include (1) deficient automation and low accuracy in the traditional raster-to-vector conversion processing; (2) data-source inconsistency in cartographic generation, i.e., different raster data sources converted to vector; and (3) how to acquire arbitrary-scale vector data. To solve these problems, we initially propose an innovative image-pyramid-based raster-to-vector conversion (IPBRTVC) framework with quality control for consecutive-scale cartography and synchronized generalization, of which details can be modified accordingly under the IPBRTVC framework. Landsat-8 imagery and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DABP)/Operational Linescan System (OLS) night-time light imagery are used as a test dataset to extract classic objects in the geometry level. Experimental results show that the IPBRTVC framework not only solves the aforementioned problems well but also (1) improves efficiency of data processing by avoiding problems of corresponding features matching and topology errors, (2) contributes to develop relevant parallel computing system, and (3) helps to integrate the raster-to-vector conversion and consecutive-scale cartography.

TI  - Weather induced subtidal flows through multiple inlets of an arctic microtidal lagoon
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine processes in the arctic lagoons are among the least studied but important subjects, especially considering the rapid warming of arctic water which may change the length of ice-free period in the summer. In this paper, wind-driven exchange flows in the micro-tidal Elson Lagoon of northern Alaska with multiple inlets of contrasting widths and depths are studied with in situ observations, statistical analysis, numerical experiments, a regression model on the basis of dynamics, and remote sensing data. Water velocity profiles were obtained from a bottom deployed acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) in the northwestern Eluitkak Pass connecting the Beaufort Sea to the Elson Lagoon during a 4.9 day ice-free period in the summer of 2013. The subtidal flow is found correlated with wind (R2 value similar to 96%). Frequently occurring east, northeast and north winds from the arctic atmospheric high- and low-pressure systems push water from the Beaufort Sea into the lagoon through the wide inlets on the eastern side of the lagoon, resulting in an outward flow against the wind at the narrow northwestern inlet. The counter-wind flow is a result of an uneven wind forcing acting through the asymmetric inlets and depth, an effect of torque or vorticity. Under northwest wind, the exchange flow at the northwestern inlet reverses its direction, with inward flows through the upwind northwestern inlet and outward flows through the downwind eastern inlets. A regression model is established based on the momentum equations and Taylor series expansions. The model is used to predict flows in July and August of 2015 and July of 2017, supported by available Landsat satellite images. About 73%-80% of the time the flows at Eluitkak Pass are out of Elson Lagoon for the summer of 2015 and 2017. Numerical experiments are conducted to corroborate the findings and illustrate the effects under various wind conditions. A quasi-steady state balance between wind force and surface pressure gradient is confirmed.

TI  - Mapping and Characterizing Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Impervious Surfaces Using Landsat Images: A Case Study of Xuzhou, East China from 1995 to 2018
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an effective indicator of urbanization, impervious surfaces play a significant role in urban planning and ecological protection. It is, therefore, important to characterize impervious surfaces in urban geographical studies. As a key city in East China, Xuzhou has experienced rapid urbanization in recent decades and is now becoming an environmentally friendly city. To better understand the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of Xuzhou's urban development, we extracted its impervious surfaces from Landsat images of 1995,2003,2010, and 2018 by a linear spectral mixture analysis. Then, a range of complementary methods including landscape indices, profile lines, median centers, standard deviational ellipses, and spatial autocorrelation were adopted to analyze the landscape pattern and expansion of impervious surfaces on both city and district scales. Results show that (1) there was a constant impervious surface expansion, originating in downtown Xuzhou; (2) promoting ecological protection in urban areas fragmented impervious surfaces with increasing heterogeneity and diversity overall; and (3) expansion directions and rates of impervious surfaces varied with district and town, and the central urban area expanded towards east and southeast, which could be related to their own resources and governmental policies. Findings from this study provide useful insights into urban planning of this economically prospective region.

TI  - Calibration of the Normalized Radar Cross Section for Sentinel-1 Wave Mode
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 (S-1) is a two-satellite constellation for continuity of operational synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. Wave mode (WV) is the default mode over open ocean for S-1 to monitor global ocean waves and wind field. Therefore, proper radiometric calibration is essential to accurately infer these geophysical quantities. Based on the global data set acquired by S-1A WV, assessment of normalized radar cross section (NRCS) is carried out through comparison with CMOD5.N predictions over open ocean. The calibration accuracy quantified by NRCS residuals between SAR measurements and CMOD5.N demonstrates distinct features for two incidence angles (23.8 degrees and 36.8 degrees). Particularly, NRCS at 23.8 degrees is overall consistent with CMOD5.N, while NRCS at 36.8 degrees displays great deviation. Two recalibration methods are then implemented by examining the backscattering profile over Amazon rain forest and ocean calibration. Both methods show the necessity for recalibration and obtain comparable correction factors for WV1 and WV2, respectively. The NRCS residuals by applying both methods are significantly reduced toward zero. By comparison, ocean calibration is more efficient and practical to implement.

TI  - A New Ocean SAR Cross-Spectral Parameter: Definition and Directional Property Using the Global Sentinel-1 Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements have already been proven to be invaluable in detecting and quantifying properties of ocean swell systems. With the improved spatial resolution, Sentinel-1 wave mode measurements can further be extended toward shorter-scale waves, that is, within the surface wave equilibrium range. In this study, a new parameter is derived from filtering SAR image cross-spectra around range-traveling intermediate wind waves (wavelengths 15-20m). This parameter captures both the radar cross-section variability and its time evolution. Given the dependence of intermediate waves on local wind field, this parameter is statistically documented to confirm its sensitivity to both wind speed and wind direction. Comparable to Doppler estimate, the signed parameter can be used to reduce the wind direction ambiguity in the inversion of high-resolution wind fields from SAR imagery. In addition, under complex environmental situations over a polar low event, this parameter is expected to better capture the dynamics of the surface wind. Globally, our analysis demonstrates regional and seasonal variations of this parameter, associated with those of wind/wave patterns. In particular, its directionality reveals the seasonal migration of intertropical convergence zone. This parameter is valuable to various further applications, for example, to help develop wind retrieval scheme from SAR measurements or to map space-time variability of ocean waves at various wavelengths.Plain Language Summary Our paper entitled "A New Ocean SAR Cross-Spectral Parameter: Definition and Directional Property Using the Global Sentinel-1 Wave Mode Measurements" defines a new radar parameter to highlight the properties of intermediate scale ocean waves (wavelength of 15m) based on high-resolution space-borne synthetic aperture radar images. This new parameter is found to be a signed quantity, sensitive to both wind speed and direction. At global scale, we use a 1-year data to demonstrate the distribution and variation of this parameter. It is found that this parameter not only provides directional information of global winds but also exhibits distinct seasonal signatures of regional wind/wave. A case study over a polar low event also proves the capability of our new parameter in carrying surface wind information.

TI  - A Near-Infrared Band-Based Algorithm for Suspended Sediment Estimation for Turbid Waters Using the Experimental Tiangong 2 Moderate Resolution Wide-Wavelength Imager
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean color remote sensing using visible spectral bands with or without the combination of near infrared (NIR) bands for the retrieval of suspended sediment (SS) concentration (SSC) has been proven to be successful in low and medium turbid waters, but the visible bands are prone to be saturated and less sensitive to high-turbid waters. This paper proposes an NIR bands SS index (NISSI) for SSC estimation using an experimental ocean-color sensor, the moderate resolution wide-wavelength imager onboard the Chinese Tiangong 2 Space Lab. The NISSI takes advantage of the reflectance peak height around 820 nm, which is highly related with SSC. Validation using in situ dataset at the Poyang and Taihu Lakes of China and comparison with conventional approaches showed higher accuracy with mean relative error values of 21.9% and 18.6%, respectively. Benefits of NISSI algorithm is proven with higher saturation level of 300 mg/L. Sensitivity of the algorithm is affected by the sensor noise, and SSC variations lower than 12 mg/L would be significantly impeded. The results showed a promising solution for ocean-color remote sensing of extremely turbid waters, with alternative or new NIR bands around 820 nm, or short-wave infrared bands for SSC estimation.

TI  - Bottom-up emission inventories of multiple air pollutants from open straw burning: A case study of Jiangsu province, Eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Open straw burnings during harvest season generated large amounts of air pollutants in a short duration, resulting in significant visibility reduction, air quality deterioration and adverse impact on human health. In this study, a bottom-up approach of county level emission inventory from open straw burning was developed. A 1 km resolution inventories for Jiangsu province, Eastern China, was established as a case study. In order to increase temporal-spatial resolution, county level, seasonal data and local parameters were preferentially used. Per capita disposable income of rural residents was used to adjust burning proportion for different cities. Emissions during summer-harvest and autumn-harvest seasons were calculated separately. The inventory was further allocated based on both MODIS fire product and land use data of cropland. Total emissions of SO2, NOx, THC, NH3, OC, BC and primary PM2.5 from open straw burning in 2015 were 3.72, 15.25, 43.52, 2.65, 16.08, 2.08 and 44.70 Gg, respectively. From 2010 to 2015, provincial emissions decreased by 50.7% in average, and the difference between southern and northern Jiangsu has been even enlarged. Autumn-harvest crop straw contributed 63%-67% to NH3, OC and PM2.5, while summer-harvest crop straw contributed 60% to BC. Wheat and rice straws burning accounted for the majority of emissions at 80%-91% of the total for all 7 pollutants. Uncertainties ranged from a low of within 29% for BC to a high of within 40% for NH3. The EFs and the crop production of autumn-harvest rice and summer harvest wheat, are the key uncertainty sources.

TI  - Hazards Evaluation of Dendrolimus tabulaeformis (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) Based on Weighted Information Value Model.
T2  - Scientia Silvae Sinicae
M3  - Article
AB  - (Objective) The pine caterpillar, Dendrolimus tabulaeformis (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) is a serious defoliator in the stands of Pinus tabulaeformis in China. In this study, a multi-factor disaster risk assessment method is proposed for prevention and early warning before the pest disaster, which is based on climate, topography and other factors that affect disaster occurrence and disaster grade. (Method) The distribution range of P. tabulaeformis was extracted from Landsat data in Western Liaoning Province. The eight risk assessment factors, including elevation, aspect, slope, rainfall, accumulated temperature, sunshine hours, disaster degree in the previous year and the distance from the disaster area in the previous year, were collected, and then the weight of each factor was determined by analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a weighted information model was established. Combining with the spatial analysis method of GIS, the disaster risk of P. tabulaeformis was classified into five levels: extremely low-risk area, low-risk area, medium-risk area, high-risk area and extremely high-risk area. A hazard zone map was made with the above information and the accuracy is verified by comparing with the monitoring result of actual disaster degree. (Result) 1) According to the principle of information quantity method, the greater the amount of information, the greater the risk of disaster. The information values of each factor classification calculated in this paper coincided with the biological characteristics of D. tabulaeformis. 2) The mapping results showed that in 2017 high-risk area and the extremely high-area in the study area was mainly distributed in the northern part of Jianping county. Medium-risk areas were mainly located in the northern part of Jianping County and the interchange between Jianping and Lingyuan. The risk of the insect pest in other areas was low. The mapping results were consistent with the actual survey results. 3) The relationship between the finally classified middle-low risk areas and the actual defoliation rate of P. tabulaeformis is obvious. Around 90.32% of the actual infested P. tabulaeformis forests are classified into high risk areas and extremely high areas. (Conclusion) Based on the weighted information model, the risk assessment of pine caterpillar disaster comprehensively considers the difference of the impact of different evaluation factors on the disaster occurrence. The result of risk zoning is accurate and has certain application value. It can provide technical basis for the risk assessment of forest pests and diseases in large areas.

TI  - An Alternative Bias Correction Scheme for CrIS Data Assimilation in a Regional Model
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Bias correction (BC) is a crucial step for satellite radiance data assimilation (DA). In this study, the traditional airmass BC scheme in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) is investigated for Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) DA. The ability of the airmass predictors to model CrIS biases is diagnosed. Correlations between CrIS observation-minus-background (O - B) samples and the two lapse rate-related airmass predictors employed by GSI are found to be very weak, indicating that the bias correction contributed by the airmass BC scheme is small. A modified BC scheme, which directly calculates the moving average of O - B departures from data of the previous 2 weeks with respect to scan position and latitudinal band, is proposed and tested. The impact of the modified BC scheme on CrIS radiance DA is compared with the variational airmass BC scheme. Results from 1-month analysis/forecast experiments show that the modified BC scheme removes nearly all scan-dependent and latitude-dependent biases, while residual biases are still found in some channels when the airmass BC scheme is applied. Smaller predicted root-mean-square errors of temperature and specific humidity and higher equivalent threat scores are obtained by the DA experiment using the modified BC scheme. If O - B samples are replaced by observation-minus-analysis (O - A) samples for bias estimates in the modified BC scheme, the forecast impacts are reduced but remain positive. A convective precipitation case that occurred on 21 August 2016 is investigated. Using the modified BC scheme, the atmospheric temperature structure and the geopotential height structures near trough/ridge areas are better resolved, resulting in better precipitation forecasts.

TI  - A Global, 0.05-Degree Product of Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Derived from OCO-2, MODIS, and Reanalysis Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) brings major advancements in measuring terrestrial photosynthesis. Several recent studies have evaluated the potential of SIF retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) in estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) based on GPP data from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. However, the spatially and temporally sparse nature of OCO-2 data makes it challenging to use these data for many applications from the ecosystem to the global scale. Here, we developed a new global OCO-2' SIF data set (GOSIF) with high spatial and temporal resolutions (i.e., 0.05 degrees, 8-day) over the period 2000-2017 based on a data-driven approach. The predictive SIF model was developed based on discrete OCO-2 SIF soundings, remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological reanalysis data. Our model performed well in estimating SIF (R-2 = 0.79, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.07 W m(-2) m(-1) sr(-1)). The model was then used to estimate SIF for each 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees grid cell and each 8-day interval for the study period. The resulting GOSIF product has reasonable seasonal cycles, and captures the similar seasonality as both the coarse-resolution OCO-2 SIF (1 degrees), directly aggregated from the discrete OCO-2 soundings, and tower-based GPP. Our SIF estimates are highly correlated with GPP from 91 EC flux sites (R-2 = 0.73, p < 0.001). They capture the expected spatial and temporal patterns and also have remarkable ability to highlight the crop areas with the highest daily productivity across the globe. Our product also allows us to examine the long-term trends in SIF globally. Compared with the coarse-resolution SIF that was directly aggregated from OCO-2 soundings, GOSIF has finer spatial resolution, globally continuous coverage, and a much longer record. Our GOSIF product is valuable for assessing terrestrial photosynthesis and ecosystem function, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.

TI  - Characterizing the relationship between satellite phenology and pollen season: A case study of birch
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollen released by vegetation in urban and surrounding rural areas is an important risk factor for respiratory allergies. Mapping the onset, duration, and severity of pollen is difficult, because of insufficient stations and/or monitoring networks at the national and international levels. To address this challenge, we evaluated the spatiotemporal relationship between satellite derived vegetation phenology and in-situ station derived information of pollen season during 2001-2015 at five stations in Canada. First, we calculated annual indicators of start of season (SOS) and start of pollen season (SPS) for birch from Landsat time series and pollen concentration data, respectively, at the five stations. Second, we explored the relationship between derived indicators of SOS and SPS and investigated the scale effect on the relationship. Our results indicate the Landsat based SOS is a good proxy for the indicator of SPS in the birch dominated area. The mean SOS and SPS in the study period are close (within 2.7 days) across the five stations. The interannual variability of SOS and SPS suggests the satellite derived phenology indicator can capture well the dynamics of pollen season in spring. Our analysis also indicates that the annual SOS at a finer resolution (30m) is more consistent with SPS as compared to the indicators derived from coarser resolution satellite observations. This study shows the potential of using fine spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., Landsat) to derive the pollen season indicators, which is important for predicting pollen season severity and risk, and assessment of their impacts on respiratory allergies in urban domains.

TI  - Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Fusion Classification Using Superpixel Segmentation-Based Local Pixel Neighborhood Preserving Embedding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method of superpixel segmentation-based local pixel neighborhood preserving embedding (SSLPNPE) is proposed for the fusion of hyperspectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data based on the extinction profiles (EPs), superpixel segmentation and local pixel neighborhood preserving embedding (LPNPE). A new workflow is proposed to calibrate the Goddard's LiDAR, hyperspectral and thermal (G-LiHT) data, which allows our method to be applied to actual data. Specifically, EP features are extracted from both sources. Then, the derived features of each source are fused by the SSLPNPE. Using the labeled samples, the final label assignment is produced by a classifier. For the open standard experimental data and the actual data, experimental results prove that the proposed method is fast and effective in hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion.

TI  - Determining Whether High Nodal Burden in Early Breast Cancer Patients Can Be Predicted Preoperatively to Avoid Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The Z0011 trial showed that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be safely avoided in breast cancer patients with low nodal burden (LNB). ALND can be performed in patients with high nodal burden (HNB). We aimed to determine whether HNB in early breast cancer patients can be predicted preoperatively to avoid sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods: Early invasive breast cancer patients (cT1-2cN0) were retrospectively reviewed. We excluded patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and incomplete data. The patients were divided into the following groups based on surgical histology: no positive (N0), LNB, and HNB, defined as 0, 1-2, and >= 3 metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), respectively. Of the patients with metastatic nodal disease, only those with ALND were included in the analysis. Clinical, radiological, and histological parameters were evaluated using logistic regression analysis as predictors of HNB versus LNB and N0 combined.Results: Of the 1,298 included patients, 832 (64.1%), 286 (22.0%), and 180 (13.9%) had N0, LNB, and HNB, respectively. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that sonographic features of breast tumor size (p < 0.0001), number of abnormal LNs (p < 0.0001), cortical thickness (p = 0.0002), effacement of the fatty hilum (p < 0.0001), and needle biopsy being performed (p < 0.0001) were indicators of HNB. Breast tumor grade (p = 0.0001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status (p = 0.0262) were also statistically significant. Among these significant features, multivariable stepwise logistic regression showed that the number of abnormal LNs is the sole independent predictor of HNB (p < 0.0001, area under the curve = 0.774). The positive predictive value of HNB in patients with >= 4 abnormal LNs was 92.9%.Conclusion: The detection of >= 4 abnormal LNs on ultrasound can help to identify HNB patients who require upfront ALND and thus avoid SLNB.

TI  - Double fronts in the Yellow Sea in summertime identified using sea surface temperature data of multi-scale ultra-high resolution analysis
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fronts are ubiquitous phenomena in oceans, and they play a significant role in marine hydrodynamics and ecology. During the stratified season of a shelf sea, the coastal front is usually considered as a single front, i.e., the tidal mixing front. However, using high resolution (similar to 1 km) Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) analysis sea surface temperature (SST) data, this study observes persistent double fronts along the Yellow Sea coast in summertime. The double fronts comprise the well-known offshore tidal mixing front and a nearshore front, and the nearshore front has not been previously reported. The climatological (2002-2017) monthly mean result shows that the double fronts with two SST gradient peaks exceeding similar to 2 degrees C/100 km and opposite SST gradient directions basically remain unchanged from June to August, whereas the frontal spacing decreases in September. Analyses based on a two-layer concept model suggest that a topographic slope along with tidal mixing could induce the pattern of double fronts. The frontogenesis of nearshore thermal front could be associated with the different responses of the water column of different water depths to insolation. The offshore movement of the nearshore front in September could be related to the fast cooling of nearshore water and intensified offshore wind, and the topographic slope is important for determining the pattern of double fronts (loose or tight). This study shows a new pattern of coastal fronts in the stratified season, and indicates the significance of high resolution satellite data. The discovery of the double front pattern implies the influence of coastal fronts during the stratified season on marine ecology and environment in a shelf sea might be underestimated.

TI  - Normalized Difference Latent Heat Index for Remote Sensing of Land Surface Energy Fluxes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Latent heat is the energy released or absorbed by a substance through phase change without changing its temperature. Its flux is a crucial element of the hydrological cycle at the land-air interface. Many water-related indexes have been proposed as indicators for latent heat flux extraction from satellite imagery, while the extraction accuracy still remains a space to improve nowadays. In this paper, a new multiband index, called normalized difference latent heat index (NDLI), is proposed for remote sensing of land surface heat flux. It utilizes the reflectance observations of three bands from Landsat 8 operational land imager, including red, green, and shortwave infrared channels. Its performance in terms of deriving latent heat flux through their incorporation into the commonly used surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) is then compared with the other three existing water-related indexes with two of them using normalized difference water index and normalized difference vegetation index. Results show that NDLI exhibits the strongest correlation with the SEBAL-derived latent heat flux among the used water-related indexes with correlation coefficient r = 0.75. They also indicate that the NDLI is the most sensitive and reliable index outperforming the previously developed indexes to determine the characteristics of water content in different land cover types. It is concluded that NDLI can be used as a good indicator to represent the potential latent heat flux at the earth's surface.

TI  - Research advances of SAR remote sensing for agriculture applications: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective and important technique in monitoring crop and other agricultural targets because its quality does not depend on weather conditions. SAR is sensitive to the geometrical structures and dielectric properties of the targets and has a certain penetration ability to some agricultural targets. The capabilities of SAR for agriculture applications can be organized into three main categories: crop identification and crop planting area statistics, crop and cropland parameter extraction, and crop yield estimation. According to the above concepts, this paper systematically analyses the recent progresses, existing problems and future directions in SAR agricultural remote sensing. In recent years, with the remarkable progresses in SAR remote sensing systems, the available SAR data sources have been greatly enriched. The accuracies of the crop classification and parameter extraction by SAR data have been improved progressively. But the development of modern agriculture has put forwarded higher requirements for SAR remote sensing. For instance, the spatial resolution and revisiting cycle of the SAR sensors, the accuracy of crop classification, the whole phenological period monitoring of crop growth status, the soil moisture inversion under the condition of high vegetation coverage, the integrations of SAR remote sensing retrieval information with hydrological models and/or crop growth models, and so on, still need to be improved. In the future, the joint use of optical and SAR remote sensing data, the application of multi-band multi-dimensional SAR, the precise and high efficient modeling of electromagnetic scattering and parameter extraction of crop and farmland composite scene, the development of light and small SAR systems like those onboard unmanned aerial vehicles and their applications will be active research areas in agriculture remote sensing. This paper concludes that SAR remote sensing has great potential and will play a more significant role in the various fields of agricultural remote sensing.

TI  - Production of bacterial cellulose hydrogels with tailored crystallinity from <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. FY-07 by the controlled expression of colanic acid synthetic genes
T2  - CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogels exhibit smart three-dimensional networks and extraordinary water-absorbing ability. To improve the water-holding capacity of bacterial cellulose hydrogels, the expression of a biosynthetic gene cluster of colanic acid, a water-soluble polysaccharide, was induced in Enterobacter sp. FY-07, which produces an abundance of bacterial cellulose hydrogel under aerobic and anaerobic fermentation conditions. The results indicated that in situ modified bacterial cellulose hydrogels with different crystallinities, rheological properties and water-holding capacities were produced by cultivating the engineered strain Enterobacter sp. FY-07:: tac under different inducing conditions. The water-holding capacity of the modified bacterial cellulose hydrogel was enhanced by more than 1.7 fold compared to the hydrogel produced by Enterobacter sp. FY-07, and the networks of the modified bacterial cellulose hydrogel were densified but still clear. These results suggest that this in situ modification strategy endows bacterial cellulose hydrogels with improved properties and potentially expands their applications in biomedical fields and the food industry.

TI  - Estimating Rangeland Forage Production Using Remote Sensing Data from a Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) and PlanetScope Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands cover similar to 23 million hectares and support a $3.4 billion annual cattle industry in California. Large variations in forage production from year to year and across the landscape make grazing management difficult. We here developed optimized methods to map high-resolution forage production using multispectral remote sensing imagery. We conducted monthly flights using a Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) in 2017 and 2018 over a 10-ha deferred grazing rangeland. Daily maps of NDVI at 30-cm resolution were first derived by fusing monthly 30-cm sUAS imagery and more frequent 3-m PlanetScope satellite observations. We estimated aboveground net primary production as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) derived from NDVI and light use efficiency (LUE), optimized as a function of topography and climate stressors. The estimated forage production agreed well with field measurements having a R-2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 542 kg/ha. Cumulative NDVI and APAR were less correlated with measured biomass (<mml:semantics>R2</mml:semantics> = 0.68). Daily forage production maps captured similar seasonal and spatial patterns compared to field-based biomass measurements. Our study demonstrated the utility of aerial and satellite remote sensing technology in supporting adaptive rangeland management, especially during an era of climatic extremes, by providing spatially explicit and near-real-time forage production estimates.

AB  - In remote sensing image classifications, a reasonable selection of bands can help improve classification accuracy. At present, problems occur in artificial subjective selection of bands in image classifications, thereby resulting in ineffective expression of classification accuracy. In this study, 10 bands of Landsat8 fusion data were used as information sources, and recursive feature elimination based on maximum likelihood classification (MLC-RFE) was conducted to select the most important bands and analyse the classification results of the various band combinations. Results showed that green, red and blue were the three unimportant bands, which had the lowest classification accuracy (92.2312%). Coastal blue, near infrared and short-wave infrared 1 were the three important bands, which had a high classification accuracy (97.5000%). The coastal blue, near infrared, short-wave infrared 1, cirrus, short-wave infrared 2, thermal infrared 1 and thermal infrared 2 constituted the recursive optimal band set in all multi-band combinations and had the highest classification accuracy (99.1667%). The classifications of the 2-7 bands and all 10 bands had an overall accuracy of 95.3495% and 96.9624%, respectively. Additional experiments showed that the Landsat8 band elimination order and optimal band set have certain differences, but the optimal band combinations with high classification accuracies can be coupled from all of them. Our findings confirmed that various band combinations had different classification accuracies, which indicated that selecting the participating bands in a classification was crucial. Furthermore, the MLC-RFE method used in this study selected the optimal classification bands and played an important role in solving the band selection problem.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice in Jiangsu Province, China, based on phenological parameters and a decision tree model
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate mapping of rice planting areas is crucial under China's current cropping structure. This study proposes a new paddy rice mapping method by combining phenological parameters and a decision tree model. Six phenological parameters were developed to identify paddy rice areas based on the analysis of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) time series. The six phenological parameters considered the performance of different land cover types during specific phenological phases (EVI1 and EVI2), one-half of or the entire rice growing cycle (LSWI1 and LSWI2), and the shape of the LSWI time series (Kurtosis(LSWI) and Skewness(LSWI)). A hierarchical decision tree model was designed to classify paddy rice areas according to the potential separability of different land cover types in paired phenological parameter spaces. Results showed that the decision tree model was more sensitive to LSWI1, LSWI2, and Skewness(LSWI) than the other phenological parameters. A paddy rice map of Jiangsu Province for 2015 was generated with an optimal threshold set of (0.4, 0.42, 9, 19, 1.5, -1.7, 0.0) with a total accuracy of 93.9%. The MODIS-derived paddy rice map generally agreed with the paddy land fraction map from the National Land Cover Dataset project, but there were regional discrepancies because of their different definitions of land use and the inability of MODIS to map paddy rice at a fragmental level. The MODIS-derived paddy rice map showed high correlation (R-2= 0.85) with county-level agricultural statistics. The results of this study indicate that the phenological parameter-based paddy rice mapping algorithm could be applied at larger spatial scales.

TI  - Genetic and antigenic characterization of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Yantai, China, during the 2009-2017 influenza season
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study was performed to determine the antigenic and genetic characteristics and evaluate potential vaccine efficacy of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 in Yantai from August 2009 to August 2017. Materials and Methods A total of 10 236 swabs were collected among patients with an influenza-like illness who were admitted to two sentinel surveillance hospitals in Yantai, East China, from August 2009 to August 2017. All specimens were cultured in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and identified by haemagglutination-inhibition assay. Complete sequences of haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase of 51 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in Yantai were amplified, sequenced and analysed using molecular and phylogenetic methods. The potential vaccine efficacy was calculated using the p(epitope) model which measured the antigenic variation based on the changes in the dominant epitope of HA. Results The results showed that most Yantai strains were grouped into genetic clades 1.7, 6C, 6B.1 and 6B.2. The amino acid substitutions accumulated gradually in HA proteins and considerable genetic variation were observed in circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the seven influenza seasons. The V241I, N369K, N386K and K432E mutations which may change the binding pattern and affinity of oseltamivir for neuraminidase were detected in the strains circulating in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons and the recommended vaccine strains could afford optimal protection against the influenza A/H1N1pdm09. Conclusions Although influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses acquired significant genetic variation over the course of seven influenza seasons, the recommended vaccine strains still afforded protection against main circulating strains. Continuous epidemiological and virological surveillance are necessary.

TI  - Extraction of Inundation Areas Due to the July 2018 Western Japan Torrential Rain Event Using Multi-Temporal ALOS-2 Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of heavy rainfalls hit the western half of Japan from June 28 to July 8, 2018. Increased river water overflowed and destroyed river banks, causing flooding over vast areas. In this study, two pre-event and one co-event ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images were used to extract inundation areas in Kurashiki and Okayama Cities, Okayama Prefecture, Japan. First, water regions were extracted by threshold values from three-temporal intensity images. The increased water regions in July 2018 were obtained as inundation. Inundated built-up areas were identified by the increase of backscattering intensity. Differences between the pre-and co-event coherence values were calculated. The area with decreased coherence was extracted as a possible inundation area. The results of a field survey conducted on July 16, 2018 were used to estimate the optimal parameters for the extraction. Finally, the results from the intensity and coherence images were verified by making comparisons between a web-based questionnaire survey report and the visual interpretation of aerial photographs.

TI  - Damage Detection and Analysis of Urban Bridges Using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), Ground-Based Microwave Interferometry, and Permanent Scatterer Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a practical framework for urban bridge damage detection and analysis by using three key techniques: terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), ground-based microwave interferometry, and permanent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR). The proposed framework was tested on the Beishatan Bridge in Beijing, China. Firstly, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the lower surface of the bridge was constructed based on the point cloud generated by using TLS to obtain the potential damage area. Secondly, the dynamic time-series displacement of the potential damage area was acquired by ground-based microwave interferometry, and the Extreme-Point Symmetric Mode Decomposition (ESMD) method was applied to detect damages by the use of signal decomposition and instantaneous frequency calculation. Lastly, the PS-InSAR technique was applied to obtain the surface deformation around Beishatan Bridge by using COSMO-SkyMed images with a ground resolution of 3 m x 3 m, and finally, we analyzed the causes of bridge damage. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework can effectively obtain the potential damage area of the bridge by the DSM from the point cloud by TLS and further judge whether the bridge was damaged by the ESMD method, based on the time-series displacement data. The results also showed that the subway shield construction may be the reason for damage to Beishatan Bridge.

TI  - Characterizing and Monitoring Ground Settlement of Marine Reclamation Land of Xiamen New Airport, China with Sentinel-1 SAR Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial lands or islands reclaimed from the sea due to their vast land spaces and air are suitable for the construction of airports, harbors, and industrial parks, which are convenient for human and cargo transportation. However, the settlement process of reclamation foundation is a problem of public concern, including soil consolidation and water recharge. Xiamen New Airport, one of the largest international airports in China, has been under construction on marine reclamation land for three years. At present, the airport has reached the second phase of construction, occupying 15.33 km(2). The project will last about twenty years. To investigate the temporal and spatial evolution of ground settlement associated with land reclamation, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, including intensity images and phase measurements, were considered. A total of 82 SAR images acquired by C-band Sentinel-1 satellite covering the time period from August 2015 to October 2018 were collected. First, the spatial evolution process of land reclamation was analyzed by exploring the time series of SAR image intensity maps. Then, the small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique was used to retrieve ground deformation information over the past three years for the first time since land reclamation. Results suggest that the reclaimed land experienced remarkable subsidence, especially after the second phase of land reclamation. Furthermore, 26 ground settlement areas (i.e., 0.015% of the whole area) associated with land reclamation were uncovered over an area of more than 1200 km(2) of the Xiamen coastal area from January 2017 to October 2018. This study offers important guidance for the next phase of land reclamation and the future construction of Xiamen New Airport.

TI  - Geometric accuracy of remote sensing images over oceans: The use of global offshore platforms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometric accuracy of tens of millions of scenes of medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images collected in the past 45 years has been systematically evaluated for land scenes, but the accuracy of ocean scenes is poorly known due to the lack of ground control points (GCPs). In this study, the locations of offshore platforms are first derived from time-series of Landsat-8 OLI images, and are then used as offshore reference points to systematically assess the geometric performance of RS images covering offshore oil/gas development areas. An inventory of 16,131 offshore platforms at the global scale is established, and then a novel method using the position-invariant characteristic of offshore platforms and the coherent characteristic of the geometric shift among tie-points (i.e. between sensed points from to-be-assessed images and the corresponding OLI-derived reference points) is developed for assessing the geometric accuracy of Landsat and other RS images. The method has been applied to 112,935 Landsat scenes (similar to 1.87% of the entire archive) over oceans. The results indicate an optimal performance of Landsat OLI images (both pre-collection and Collection-1) but a less reliable performance of Landsat TM/ETM + L1TP images. Approximately 50% of TM L1GS and ETM + L1GT images have at least 2 pixels of geometric error. The new reference points inventory and the developed method were also applied to many other low-resolution and finer-resolution imagery (e.g. VIIRS Night-fire product, Terra/Aqua MODIS active fire product, ENVISAT ASAR, ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 MSI, the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial images, and images from several Chinese satellites), and a quantitative description of the geometric accuracy of these sensors is also presented. The findings suggest that the new offshore reference point inventory is probably useful to help establish more robust offshore GCPs for U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) GCP library and further improve the ongoing USGS Global GCP improvement plan and European Space Agency Global Reference Image plan.

TI  - 30 m Resolution Global Annual Burned Area Mapping Based on Landsat Images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heretofore, global Burned Area (BA) products have only been available at coarse spatial resolution, since most of the current global BA products are produced with the help of active fire detection or dense time-series change analysis, which requires very high temporal resolution. In this study, however, we focus on an automated global burned area mapping approach based on Landsat images. By utilizing the huge catalog of satellite imagery, as well as the high-performance computing capacity of Google Earth Engine, we propose an automated pipeline for generating 30-m resolution global-scale annual burned area maps from time-series of Landsat images, and a novel 30-m resolution Global annual Burned Area Map of 2015 (GABAM 2015) was released. All the available Landsat-8 images during 2014-2015 and various spectral indices were utilized to calculate the burned probability of each pixel using random decision forests, which were globally trained with stratified (considering both fire frequency and type of land cover) samples, and a seed-growing approach was conducted to shape the final burned areas after several carefully-designed logical filters (NDVI filter, Normalized Burned Ratio (NBR) filter, and temporal filter). GABAM 2015 consists of spatial extent of fires that occurred during 2015 and not of fires that occurred in previous years. Cross-comparison with the recent Fire_cci Version 5.0 BA product found a similar spatial distribution and a strong correlation (between the burned areas from the two products, although differences were found in specific land cover categories (particularly in agriculture land). Preliminary global validation showed the commission and omission errors of GABAM 2015 to be 13.17% and 30.13%, respectively.

TI  - Exploring the use of vegetation indices to sense canopy nitrogen to phosphorous ratio in grasses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced availability of plant nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) has detrimental effects on plant growth. Plant N:P ratio, calculated as the quotient of N and P concentrations, is an ecological indicator of relative N and P limitation. Remote sensing has already been widely used to detect plant traits in foliage, particularly canopy N and P concentrations and could be used to detect canopy N:P faster and at lower cost than traditional destructive methods. Despite the potential opportunity of applying remote sensing techniques to detect canopy N:P, studies investigating canopy N:P remote detection are scarce. In this study, we examined if vegetation indices developed for canopy N or P detection can also be used for canopy N:P detection. Using in situ spectrometry, we measured the reflectance of a common grass species, Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus L.), grown under different nutrient ratios and levels. We calculated 60 Vls found in literature and compared them to optimized Vls developed specifically for this study. The Vls were calculated using both the original narrow band spectra and the spectra resampled to the band properties of six satellite sensors (MSI - Sentinel 2, OLCI - Sentinel 3, MODIS - Terra/Aqua, OLI - Landsat 8, WorldView 4 and RapidEye) to investigate the influence of bandwidths and band positions. The results showed that canopy N:P was significantly related to both existing VIs (r(2) = 0.16 - 0.48) and optimized VIs (r(2) = 0.59 - 0.72) with correlations similar to what was observed for canopy N or canopy P. Existing Vls calculated with MSI and OLI sensors bands showed higher correlation with canopy N:P compared to the other sensors while the correlation with optimized VIs was not affected by the differences in sensors' bands. This study might lead to future practical applications using in situ reflectance measurements to sense canopy N:P in grasslands.

TI  - Open-access cloud resources contribute to mainstream REDD plus : The case of Mozambique
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to investigate how Earth Observation data and processing platforms accessible on the cloud can facilitate the implementation of REDD + in developing countries. For that, we explore newly available open-access satellite data, cloud processing, and a ready-made land cover map to assess the extent to which such resources can directly respond to monitoring and measuring, reporting, and verification requisites. Mozambique is one of the 47 countries selected to benefit from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility to implement REDD + strategies. However, to meet funding agreements, the country needs to periodically produce national land cover and land cover change maps at given resolution and accuracy levels. The work presented here shows that the land cover mapping requisites of REDD + may be quickly and cost-effectively met through the development and use of newly available cloud resources. The study relies on an experimental design that tests the results of image processing approaches with algorithms available or developed in Google Earth Engine against country-wide reference data collected by a team of national experts. The results show that, in addition to pre-processing advantages, which facilitate multi-temporal compositing and mosaicking of very large and heavy data sets, developments in cloud processing and image classification swiftly produce large extent and high resolution land cover maps, tailored to a specific objective. The comparison of results between the in-house map obtained using Google Earth Engine, and the pan-African map produced by the European Space Agency (2016) at the same spatial resolution, reveals that both maps meet REDD + requirements for a binary Forest/Non-forest legend. However, the in-house map is more accurate and reaches considerably better results if a more complex, six class IPCC legend is required. Nevertheless, this study shows that, given adequate reference data, the need to periodically produce high resolution land cover maps for national forest monitoring purposes is no longer an obstacle for mainstreaming the implementation of REDD +.

AB  - Objectives To assess the applicability of a novel hybrid dextran-gadolinium nanoparticles (NPs) as high-relaxivity T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for mapping the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Methods Dextran-bis-acrylamide-polyacrylic acid (Dex-MBA-PAA) NPs were synthesized through a self-assembly assisted approach and complexed with multiple chelated gadolinium (Gd) (III) ions. After their characterization was validated, they were used to mapping SLNs by MRI in Wistar rats, and their biosafety was evaluated. Results Dextran-MBA-polyacrylic acid-Gd NPs have suitable particle size and much higher longitudinal relaxivity (r(1)) than that of commonly used clinical MRI contrast agents (eg, gadopentetic acid dimeglumine salt injection). The in vivo T1-weighted MRI results revealed their effectiveness at mapping SLNs. And their biological safety was also verified. Conclusions Dextran-MBA-polyacrylic acid-Gd NPs were synthesized and validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments for their ability to visualize SLNs by MRI with accurate positioning and excellent biosafety, and they have great potential for clinical SLN mapping.

This index integrates Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data (available from 1981 to present), land surface temperature (LST), precipitation (PCP), and soil moisture (SM) data from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) project (available from 1979 to present). This new agriculturally-based drought index incorporates important components controlling agricultural drought, particularly soil moisture, for which there are limited in-situ observations through time and across space. The optimum weights for each component of the ISDI are determined by correlation analysis with commonly used insitu drought indices, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the Palmer Modified Drought Index (PMDI), the Palmer's Z-index, and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at different time scales. Resulting ISDI maps are also visually compared with United States Drought Monitor (USDM) and Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI) maps for empirical validation. ISDI shows strong agreement with these two national-wide drought monitoring systems. ISDI also shows strong linear correlations with corn yield anomalies in July and with soybean yield anomalies in August and strong spatial correspondence with county-level corn/soybean yield anomalies during major drought events. These results illustrate the robustness and usefulness of ISDI. This agriculturally-based drought index integrates the benefits of numerical model simulation and remote sensing technology to account for interannual variability of drought for the longest possible time-frame in the satellite era. This long-term monthly drought index provides a longer historical perspective of drought impacts since 1981. It can be generalized to incorporate other satellite data or in-situ observation and has the potential for operational drought monitoring and assessment.

TI  - An anthropocosmic view: what Confucian traditions can teach us about the past and future of Chinese higher education
T2  - HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The historical debate between a liberal orientation of university education and a university education with a more practical orientation has been reproduced by defenders and detractors of the course that is being adopted by the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Instead of resorting to a dichotomous view of these two arguments, this article employs an anthropocosmic worldview to look at the university by examining the past and present of Chinese higher education, in contrast to the philosophy and reality of the European university within the framework of the EHEA. The anthropocosmic view is central to Confucian holistic humanism, which asserts that humanity is part of a continuum consisting of community, Earth and Heaven. With the self as a centre of relationships', the individual is interconnected with an ever-expanding network of human relatedness, extending from the self to the family, the community, the country, the world and beyond. The authors argue that despite being based on a European model, the Chinese university, in fact, boasts a unique Chinese character that can be traced back to its Confucian learning tradition, which itself reflects this anthropocosmic worldview. In our world today, a world of unprecedented globalisation, an anthropocentric view of higher education is no longer sufficient. Instead, to address the challenges humanity faces, a Chinese model of the university based on anthropocosmism presents a potential new pathway for the global university of the future.

TI  - Machine learning and multi-sensor based modelling of woody vegetation in the Molopo Area, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bush encroachment is a highly relevant environmental issue in South African savannas, influencing ecological processes as well as the grazing capacity of the land. However the drivers of bush encroachment are not yet fully revealed which can partly be attributed to the problem that large-scale data of woody vegetation cover are missing. Using a multi-scale and a multi-sensor approach, this study aimed at providing the status of woody vegetation cover for the Molopo Area in South Africa. Training data for woody vegetation was derived from unsupervised classification of high-resolution aerial image tiles. To derive spatially continuous estimates of fractional woody cover for the entire Molopo Area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were applied in a machine learning based modelling approach. Therefore, a database of training samples was generated by aggregating the classified aerial image tiles to the geometry of the Sentinel data. A Random Forest algorithm with a forward feature variable selection was then trained to relate the spectral and radar information to fractional woody cover. The model was applied to make spatial predictions of fractional woody cover at 10 m resolution for the entire Molopo Area for the year 2016. Spatial cross-validation revealed a prediction error in fractional cover of 12%. The derived model and cover data show the potential for upcoming time series analysis of Sentinel-based woody cover estimates which can serve as a basis to bring new insights into the drivers of bush encroachment.

TI  - UAV based soil moisture remote sensing in a karst mountainous catchment
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution of soil moisture (SM) is a prerequisite for research and management of agriculture and ecology. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve SM data in highly heterogeneous landscapes. By investigating environmental factors (soil, vegetation and topography) and comparing different remote sensing sources (Landsat-8, Radarsat-2, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) V002 (ASTGTM2), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for karst mountainous catchments of southwest China, this study identified key controlling factors on the spatial distribution of SM and built a remote sensing model for SM estimation in highly heterogeneous landscapes. Results showed that vegetation type (35.7%), aspect (7.7%), height index (4.2%), soil bulk density (3.3%), soil total nitrogen (3.1%), aspect interact with vegetation type (3.4%) and soil total phosphorous (1.3%) totally explained 58.8% of the SM variability. The correlations between SM and topographic derivatives varied with DEM resolutions (1-50 m), and generally reached their highest values at 7 m for height index, slope gradient, and aspect, 16 m for flow accumulation and topographic wetness index, and 43 m for curvature. Partial least-squares regression analysis showed that optical and infrared bands from Landsat-8 and topographic derivatives from UAV photogrammetry DEM were more strongly con-elated with SM than other datasets. An empirical model (SM = 9.27 * 10(-2)HI - 1.82 * 10(-5) B5 + 0.519) with only height index and B5 band from Landsat-8 as inputs is proposed, as it shows acceptable performance (R-2 = 0.36; RMSE = 0.076). The results of this study provide useful information for SM remote sensing in karst mountainous area and similar heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Detecting urban ecological land-cover structure using remotely sensed imagery: A multi-area study focusing on metropolitan inner cities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing attention being paid to sustainable urban development and human habitation improvement, urban ecological land cover (UELC), i.e., surface water and green space, has played an important role of the highly compact inner urban regions. In this study, we dreltiped an efficient approach fin-UEL-C-mapping by coupling Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery and Google Earth high-resolution imagery. In contrast with the conventional single-source and multi-source imagery-based classification methods, the proposed method respectively achieved the highest overall accuracies of 91.50% and 94.05% in the UELC mapping for two test sites (i.e. Shanghai and Seoul). The proposed method is used for urban surface mapping among six world-class cities. For an in-depth analysis of the landscape structures for inner urban regions, seven landscape metrics are introduced for the quantification of the UELC structure based on the obtained high-precision UELC maps. The result shows that London appears to have the best UELC-induced ecological quality, that is, with high percentage of landscape, area-weighted mean fractal dimension, edge density, Shannon's evenness index values and a low contagion index value, while Tokyo is exactly the opposite. Several common characteristics found through the statistical analysis are: 1) all the inner-city regions have small UELC coverage (< 50%) and low shape complexity; 2) green space generally contributes more to urban eco-environment than the urban surface water; and 3) all cities show high landscape consistency in the inner urban region.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in the pediatric age: the role of the dentist
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disordered breathing in children designates a wide spectrum of respiratory disorders characterized by partial or complete obstruction of the upper air-ways. It ranges from primary snoring, its mildest clinical manifestation, to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS): complete obstruction of the upper airways with cessation of airflow. The aim of this paper is to highlight the roles of the pediatric dentist and the orthodontist in the therapeutic approach to pediatric OSAS as a "sentinel" who can detect early signs of the disease for immediate referral to the otolaryngologist and as an active participant in therapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review has been performed on the following topics: pediatric OSAS, orthodontic clinical aspects of pediatric OSAS, orthodontic therapy of pediatric OSAS, mandibular advancement devices and functional orthodontic devices in OSAS treatment.RESULTS: The role of the dentist in pediatric OSAS is essential to correct orthodontic alterations that may favor the development of the condition. Orthodontic treatment aims at reducing the severity of OSAS by increasing the airspace and improving airflow through orthopedic expansion of the upper jaw and mandibular advancement. Rapid palatal expanders and mandibular advancement devices are successfully used in the treatment of OSAS.CONCLUSIONS: Scientific evidence of a strong association between craniofacial growth and OSAS; the pediatric dentist and the orthodontist participate as sentinels, observing and identifying conditions requiring referral to the otolaryngologist and playing a pivotal role in the orthodontic treatment phase.

TI  - A targeted initiative to discharge surgical patients earlier in the day is associated with decreased length of stay and improved hospital throughput
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The timing of inpatient discharges can impact hospital throughput with later discharges leading to decreased patient satisfaction, increased length of stay (LOS), and longer boarding times.Methods: A 12-month targeted intervention that included both pre-operative and inpatient components was implemented across all surgical inpatient services to increase the proportion of patients discharged by noon.Results: Discharge by noon rates increased from 14.3% to 21.5% during the 12-month initiative (p <0.01). The case mix index adjusted LOS (aLOS) decreased from 2.17 to 2.02 days (p <0.01). ED, PACU, and ICU boarding times were all significantly lower during the initiative (p <0.01, p <0.01, p = 0.03 respectively).Conclusions: A targeted initiative to discharge surgical patients earlier resulted in a 50% increase in the proportion of patients discharged by noon. Associated with this finding were improvements in hospital throughput as measured by aLOS and boarding times in the ED, ICUs, and PACU. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Application of the water-related spectral reflectance indices: A review
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Water status is an important indicator of ecosystem health. Based on the spectral signatures of liquid water and other land surface features (e.g., soil and vegetation), many water-related spectral reflectance indices (WIs) have been developed to characterize the presence of liquid water. These WIs are widely used in agricultural and ecological applications including surface water body characterization, vegetation water status estimation, soil water content assessment, and wetland (e.g., paddy rice) monitoring. However, choosing the correct WIs for specific studies is confusing due to arbitrary selections of WIs in respective applications and the mixing of WIs names in different studies. To increase the clarity of appropriate usage of WIs in specific conditions, this study reviewed the principles, developments, and applications of various WIs to identify the suitability of WIs for different applications. We started with the discussion of the underlying principles and developments (e.g., from ratio to normalized difference of two bands) of different WIs, based on the spectrum features of water, vegetation, and soil from widely used spectral libraries. Applications from different studies, in each category, were then compared to show the performances of different Wls. This is followed by a brief summary about the terminology of WIs in different studies to further reduce the confusion caused by the mixed use of WIs terms. A field experiment was designed to investigate the dynamics of various WIs in response to different mixing ratios of water and soil or plant. The effectiveness of combining WIs and greenness indices for detecting surface water body and wetland were evaluated using the field experiment data. Finally, we identified the major gaps and pointed out the potential improvements for the future.

TI  - Enhancing SWAT with remotely sensed LAI for improved modelling of ecohydrological process in subtropics
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation growth in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a crucial process for quantifying ecohydrological modelling, as it influences evapotranspiration, interception, soil erosion and biomass production. The simplified version of Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) in SWAT was originally designed for temperate regions and naturally based on temperature to simulate growth cycles of vegetation. However, tropical or subtropical vegetation growth is mainly controlled by rainfall. Due to this limitation, current SWAT simulations in tropics and subtropics have been facing a series of problems on vegetation dormancy, water balance and sediment yield. Therefore, we proposed an approach to enhance the modelling of SWAT vegetation dynamics with remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), to finally increase the applicability of SWAT in tropical or subtropical areas. Spatially and temporally continuous LAI products (1 day, 500 m) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations were integrated into SWAT to replace the LAI simulated by built-in EPIC module. Two advanced filter algorithms were employed to derive a downscaled LAI (30 m) to keep a consistent spatial scale with the size of Hydrological Response Units (HRU) and open data (i.e. SRTM, 30 m), and the source code of the plant growth module were correspondingly modified to incorporate the downscaled LAI into SWAT. To examine the performance of our proposed approach, a case study was conducted in a representative middle-scale (6384 km(2)) subtropical watershed of Meichuan basin, China, and detailed analysis was performed to investigate its ecohydrological effects, such as streamflow, sediment yield and LAI dynamics from 2001 to 2014. Model performances were compared among three scenarios: (1) original SWAT, (2) SWAT with a corrected plant dormancy function, and (3) modified SWAT after integration of MODIS LAI (our proposed method). Results showed that the modified SWAT took advantage of downscaled MODIS LAI and produced more reasonable seasonal curves of vegetation cover factor (C) of plants than the original model. Correspondingly, the modified SWAT substantially improved streamflow and sediment simulations. The findings demonstrated that SWAT model can be a useful tool for simulating ecohydrological process for subtropical ecosystems when integrated with our proposed method.

TI  - Thresholds in forest bird communities along woody vegetation gradients in the South American Dry Chaco
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - World-wide, tropical savannas and dry forests are under increasing pressure from land use. The environmental impacts of agricultural expansion into these ecosystems have received much attention, yet subtler changes in natural vegetation remain severely understudied. We explored how bird communities vary along gradients of woody vegetation in the South American Dry Chaco by combining high-resolution, satellite-based tree, shrub and total woody cover with field data on the frequency of 82 bird species surveyed in 167 plots. We identified change points along woody cover gradients where the relative frequency of individual bird species dropped most strongly. Based on this, we identified forest indicator species and assessed evidence for community-level thresholds. Most forest birds (71%) had clear change points in their frequencies along vegetation gradients, starting as high as 38% total woody cover. Many (41%) forest species declined drastically at woody cover levels of less than 11%. This general pattern was similar for tree and shrub cover. Only 7% of our study area had woody cover levels where we detected no response in forest bird communities. In contrast, 68% of the area had woody cover levels with incremental declines in forest bird species, and 25% of the study area had woody cover levels below the forest bird community threshold. We identified 11 indicator species strongly related to woody cover, with highest frequencies in the eastern and western Dry Chaco. Spatial distributions of these species corresponded well with areas above and below woody vegetation thresholds. Synthesis and applications. We found evidence for critical thresholds for forest birds along woody cover gradients in dry forests and implemented tools to map where these thresholds have been crossed. For the Chaco, we highlight the importance of maintaining woody cover levels above about 40%, such as in certain silvopastoral systems that can be much more wildlife-friendly than other forms of agriculture. We identify remaining areas of potentially intact forest bird communities. More broadly, this study highlights the value of combining species-level (indicator species' distributions) and ecosystem-level (satellite-based, continuous woody cover maps) surrogates for understanding biodiversity patterns and threats.

TI  - Molecular assessment of wild populations in the marine realm: Importance of taxonomic, seasonal and habitat patterns in environmental monitoring
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientists are currently faced with the challenge of assessing the effects of anthropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems. Cellular stress response (CSR) biomarkers are ubiquitous and phylogenetically conserved among metazoans and have been successfully applied in environmental monitoring but they can also vary according to natural biotic and abiotic factors. The reported variability may thus limit the wide application of biomarkers in monitoring, imposing the need to identify variability levels in the field. Our aim was to carry out a comprehensive in situ assessment of the CSR (heat shock protein 70 kDa, ubiquitin, antioxidant enzymes) and oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation) in wild populations across marine taxa by collecting fish, crustaceans, mollusks and cnidarians during two different seasons (spring and summer) and two habitat types (coast and estuary). CSR end-point patterns were different between taxa with mollusks having higher biomarker levels, followed by the cnidarians, while fish and crustaceans showed lower biomarker levels. The PCA showed clear clusters related to mobility/sessile traits with sessile organisms showing greater levels (>2-fold) of CSR proteins and oxidative damage. Mean intraspecific variability in the CSR measured by the coefficient of variation (% CV) (induding data from all seasons and sites) was elevated (35-94%). Overall. there was a seasonal differentiation in biomarker patterns across taxonomic groups, especially evident in fish and cnidarians. A differentiation in biomarker patterns between habitat types was also observed and associated with phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation. Overall, specimens collected in the estuary had lower biomarker levels when compared to specimens collected in the coast. This work highlights the importance of assessing baseline biomarker levels across taxa, seasons and habitats prior to applying biomarker analyses in environmental monitoring. Selecting bioindicator species, defining sampling strategies, and identifying confounding factors are crucial preliminary steps that ensure the success of biomarkers as powerful tools in biomonitoring.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in microinvasive ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i>
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Microinvasive breast cancer is an uncommon pathological entity. Owing to the rarity of this condition, its surgical axillary management and overall prognosis remain controversial.Methods: A database was analysed to identify patients with microinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who had surgery for invasive breast cancer at the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, between 1998 and 2010. Women who had undergone axillary staging by sentinel lymph node biopsy were included in the study.Results: Of 257 women with microinvasive breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), 226 (87.9 per cent) had negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and 31 had metastatic SLNs. Twelve patients had isolated tumour cells (ITCs), 14 had micrometastases and five had macrometastases in sentinel nodes. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 16 of the 31 patients with positive SLNs. After a median follow-up of 11 years, only one regional first event was observed in the 15 patients with positive SLNs who did not undergo axillary lymph node dissection. There were no regional first events in the 16 patients with positive SLNs who had axillary dissection.Conclusion: Good disease-free and overall survival were found in women with positive SLNs and microinvasive DCIS. This study is in line with studies showing that SLNB inmicroinvasive DCIS may not be useful, and supports the evidence that less surgery can provide the same level of overall survival with better quality of life.

AB  - Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal and a 'hotspot' of urban air pollution in South Asia. Its bowl-shaped structure (altitude 1300 m above sea level (masl); floor area 340 km(2)) surrounded by tall mountains provides a unique case study for analyzing pollution trapped by topography and local meteorology. In the absence of long-term in-situ observations, for the first time the columnar aerosol loading trend of the Kathmandu Valley was analyzed using satellite-derived aerosol optical depths (AOD). AOD from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard Aqua and Terra (3 x 3 km, Level 2) was used during the dry season (November-June) in 2000-2015. Trend analysis of Kathmandu AOD (K-AOD) (the Kathmandu Valley AOD (KVal(AOD)) + background AOD (B-AOD)) suggested an increase of similar to 35% during the study period. To derive the KVal(AOD) trend, B-AOD was subtracted from K-AOD. The KVal(AOD) trend indicated an increase of similar to 50-60% during the study period, based on MODIS Aqua and Terra data. Thereafter, the background contribution only at the valley layer (1300-1400 masl) was determined using Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) profiles, in-situ observation and modeling techniques. The CALIPSO-based analysis indicated that background pollution contributed an additional 20-25% to local pollution. This finding was further supported by short-term in-situ measurements from Dhulikhel (the site where Kathmandu background measurements were taken) and Ratnapark (a Kathmandu city center site). Case studies were conducted using chemical transport models (WRF-STEM and WRF-Chem) to quantify the contribution of background air pollution to the Kathmandu valley pollution. These model results contradicted the satellite and in-situ observation by highly underestimating the Kathmandu Valley pollution levels. Comparison of visibility in Kathmandu with AOD suggests a profound role of B(AOD )on decreasing long-distance visibility in particular months.

TI  - Mapping hydrothermal minerals using remotely sensed reflectance spectroscopy data from Landsat
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of hydrothermally altered areas, which are usually associated with mineralization, is essential in mineral exploration. In this research, open source reflectance spectroscopy data from the multispectral moderate-resolution Landsat 8 satellite was used to map altered rocks in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. The unique spectral reflectance and absorption characteristics of remotely sensed Landsat data in the visible, near-infrared (NIR), shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum were used in different digital image processing techniques. The band ratios (red/blue, SWIR 2/NIR, SWIR 1/NIR), spectral band combinations (Kaufmann ratio, Sabins ratio) and principal component analysis (Crosta technique) were applied to efficiently and successfully map hydrothermal alteration minerals. The results showed that the combination of spectral bands and the principal component analysis method is effective in delineating mineral alteration through remotely sensed satellite data. The validation of results by using the published mineral maps of the Council for Geoscience South Africa showed a good relationship with the identified zones of mineralization. The methodology developed in this study is cost-effective and time-saving, and can be applied to inaccessible and/or new areas with limited ground-based knowledge to obtain reliable and up-to-date mineral information.

TI  - Feature-Level Fusion of Landsat 8 Data and SAR Texture Images for Urban Land Cover Classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Each of the urban land cover types has unique thermal pattern. Therefore, thermal remote sensing can be used over urban areas for indicating temperature differences and comparing the relationships between urban surface temperatures and land cover types. On the other hand, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors are playing an increasingly important role in land cover classification due to their ability to operate day and night through cloud cover, and capturing the structure and dielectric properties of the earth surface materials. In this research, a feature-level fusion of SAR image and all bands (optical and thermal) of Landsat 8 data is proposed in order to modify the accuracy of urban land cover classification. In the proposed object-based image analysis algorithm, segmented regions of both Landsat 8 and SAR images are utilized for performing knowledge-based classification based on the land surface temperatures, spectral relationships between thermal and optical bands, and SAR texture features measured in the gray-level co-occurrence matrix space. The evaluated results showed the improvements of about 2.48 and 0.06 for overall accuracy and kappa after performing feature-level fusion on Landsat 8 and SAR data.

TI  - Use of Geospatial Surveillance and Response Systems for Vector-Borne Diseases in the Elimination Phase
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - The distribution of diseases caused by vector-borne viruses and parasites are restricted by the environmental requirements of their vectors, but also by the ambient temperature inside the host as it influences the speed of maturation of the infectious agent transferred. The launch of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in 2015, and the new ECOSTRESS instrument onboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2018, established the leadership of the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) in ecology and climate research by allowing the structural and functional classification of ecosystems that govern vector sustainability. These advances, and the availability of sub-meter resolution data from commercial satellites, contribute to seamless mapping and modelling of diseases, not only at continental scales (1 km(2)) and local community or agricultural field scales (15-30 m(2)), but for the first time, also at the habitat-household scale (<1 m(2)). This communication presents current capabilities that are related to data collection by Earth-observing satellites, and draws attention to the usefulness of geographical information systems (GIS) and modelling for the study of important parasitic diseases.

TI  - Breast cancer surgery: when less is more
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - This brief review traces the evolution of breast cancer surgery from radical mastectomy (MTX) to breast conserving therapy (BCT) where wide local excision (WLE) of the cancer is combined with whole breast irradiation. The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to assess the axilla as an alternative to more extensive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is examined. This review is a contemporary evaluation of these procedures (BCT. SLNB) and their impact on survival and in reduction of morbidity. and shows that local recurrence of breast cancer (BC) after BCT has been reduced to < 5% at 10-year follow-up when guidelines that excision margins should be free of microscopic cancer arc followed and where patients receive whole breast irradiation together with systemic therapy after WLE. Over the past decade. studies of women with early BC entered on the SEER data base. the California Cancer Register and the Norwegian Cancer Registry have shown that overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) arc significantly. better after BCT than following MTX. The improved survival after BCT compared to MTX cannot be attributed to radiation alone. The critical difference between these two procedures is the extent of dissection. Experimental studies using animal models have provided convincing evidences that the more extensive the tissue trauma, the greater the postoperative inflammatory cascade. This cascade of cytokines and growth factors impairs humoral immunity and enhances cancer cell survival and growth. The reduction in tissue trauma in patients undergoing BCT is a likely explanation for their improved survival. Compared to ALND. SLNB results in less lymphoedema, sensory loss and impaired shoulder function. For the clinically negative axilla, normal on palpation and imaging, SLNB is accurate in both the initial assessment and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).

TI  - Measuring Environmental Perceptions Grounded on Different Theoretical Models: The 2-Major Environmental Values (2-MEV) Model in Comparison with the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study examined the two-dimensional nature of the Two Major Environmental Values model (2-MEV) in comparison with the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale's unidimensional construct. The latter places respondents on a continuum from a bio-centric to anthropocentric worldview, where an individual can either have a pro-environmental (bio-centric) or an anti-environmental (anthropocentric) perspective, but not both. On the other hand, the 2-MEV treats biocentrism (Preservation, PRE) and anthropocentrism (Utilization, UTL) as two separate and not necessarily related components. The model allows us to place individuals into one of four quadrants, rather than on either end of a continuum, allowing an individual to have a bio-centric and an anthropocentric worldview at the same time. Students' environmental perceptions were measured using the NEP and 2-MEV questionnaires. As predicted, high preservation/low utilization scorers preferred a biocentric worldview on the NEP; similarly, low preservation/high utilization scorers preferred an anthropocentric worldview on the NEP. However, the NEP failed to differentiate between the high preservation/high utilization and low preservation/low utilizations scorers. Both of these groups of students, while on different quadrants on the 2-MEV, cluster together in the middle of the unidimensional NEP. Evidence suggests that the NEP may not fully explore all dimensions of environmental perceptions.

TI  - Investigating Volcanic Plumes from Mt. Etna Eruptions of December 2015 by Means of AVHRR and SEVIRI Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In early December 2015, a rapid sequence of strong paroxysmal events took place at the Mt. Etna crater area (Sicily, Italy). Intense paroxysms from the Voragine crater (VOR) generated an eruptive column extending up to an altitude of about 15 km above sea level. In the following days, other minor ash emissions occurred from summit craters. In this study, we present results achieved by monitoring Mt. Etna plumes by means of RSTASH (Robust Satellite Techniques-Ash) algorithm, running operationally at the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis (IMAA) on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. Results showed that RSTASH detected an ash plume dispersing from Mt. Etna towards Ionian Sea starting from 3 December at 08:40 UTC, whereas it did not identify ash pixels on satellite data of same day at 04:20 UTC and 04:40 UTC (acquired soon after the end of first paroxysm from VOR), due to a mixed cloud containing SO2 and ice. During 8-10 December, the continuity of RSTASH detections allowed us to estimate the mass eruption rate (an average value of about 1.5 x 10(3) kg/s was retrieved here), quantitatively characterizing the eruptive activity from North East Crater (NEC). The work, exploiting information provided also by Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data, confirms the important contribution offered by RSTASH in identifying and tracking ash plumes emitted from Mt. Etna, despite some operational limitations (e.g., cloud coverage). Moreover, it shows that an experimental RST product, tailored to SEVIRI data, for the first time used and preliminarily assessed here, may complement RSTASH detections providing information about areas mostly affected by volcanic SO2.

TI  - Monitoring Forest Loss in ALOS/PALSAR Time-Series with Superpixels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a flexible methodology to identify forest loss in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) L-band ALOS/PALSAR images. Instead of single pixel analysis, we generate spatial segments (i.e., superpixels) based on local image statistics to track homogeneous patches of forest across a time-series of ALOS/PALSAR images. Forest loss detection is performed using an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained on local radar backscatter features derived from superpixels. This method is applied to time-series of ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 radar images over a boreal forest within the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve in Quebec, Canada. We evaluate four spatial arrangements including (1) single pixels, (2) square grid cells, (3) superpixels based on segmentation of the radar images, and (4) superpixels derived from ancillary optical Landsat imagery. Detection of forest loss using superpixels outperforms single pixel and regular square grid cell approaches, especially when superpixels are generated from ancillary optical imagery. Results are validated with official Quebec forestry data and Hansen et al. forest loss products. Our results indicate that this approach can be applied to monitor forest loss across large study areas using L-band radar instruments such as ALOS/PALSAR, particularly when combined with superpixels generated from ancillary optical data.

TI  - Comprehensive In Situ Validation of Five Satellite Land Surface Temperature Data Sets over Multiple Stations and Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land surface temperature (LST) data derived from satellite-based infrared radiance measurements are highly valuable for various applications in climate research. While in situ validation of satellite LST data sets is a challenging task, it is needed to obtain quantitative information on their accuracy. In the standardised approach to multi-sensor validation presented here for the first time, LST data sets obtained with state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms from several sensors (AATSR, GOES, MODIS, and SEVIRI) are matched spatially and temporally with multiple years of in situ data from globally distributed stations representing various land cover types in a consistent manner. Commonality of treatment is essential for the approach: all satellite data sets are projected to the same spatial grid, and transformed into a common harmonized format, thereby allowing comparison with in situ data to be undertaken with the same methodology and data processing. The large data base of standardised satellite LST provided by the European Space Agency's GlobTemperature project makes previously difficult to perform LST studies and applications more feasible and easier to implement. The satellite data sets are validated over either three or ten years, depending on data availability. Average accuracies over the whole time span are generally within +/- 2.0 K during night, and within +/- 4.0 K during day. Time series analyses over individual stations reveal seasonal cycles. They stem, depending on the station, from surface anisotropy, topography, or heterogeneous land cover. The results demonstrate the maturity of the LST products, but also highlight the need to carefully consider their temporal and spatial properties when using them for scientific purposes.

T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers the works of V. M. Shukshin, the famous Russian writer and film director. The author analyses the epistolary texts in the genre of "a letter to a leader" as well as the stories involving the elements of this genre on the formal, content or intertextual levels. In the prose of V. M. Shukshin, the letter to the party leader (or another major administrative worker) bears mostly negative connotations, as in the literary script "Planting season" ("Posevnaya kampaniya") (1960), short stories "Lyolya Seleznova from the Faculty of journalism" ("Lyolya Selezn'ova s fakul'teta zhurnalistiki") (1962) or "The man Deryabin" ("Muzhik Deryabin") (1974). The main appeal of the author of the letters to the representatives of state power here is the appeal to repressive force. Nevertheless, considering the level of the author's worldview and the artistic world of the works in the aspect of the creative evolution of Shukshin, "a letter to a leader" is the starting point on the path to the new genre of the Shukshin's story. Desperate to seek the Truth from the "leaders," V. M. Shukshin eventually created a new genre at the interface of the document and artistic prose - a documentary story, a vivid example of which is "Slander" ("Kl'auza") (1974), one of the last Shukshin's short stories. However, the documentary story is focused on a different addressee than a "letter to a leader" - on the people.

TI  - Exploring relationships between land use intensity, habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity to identify and monitor areas of High Nature Value farming
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how species richness is distributed across landscapes and which variables may be used as predictors is important for spatially targeting management interventions. This study uses finely resolved data over a large geographical area to explore relationships between land-use intensity, habitat heterogeneity and species richness of multiple taxa. It aims to identify surrogate landscape metrics, valid for a range of taxa, which can be used to map and monitor High Nature Value farmland (HNV).Results show that variation in species richness is distributed along two axes: land-use intensity and habitat heterogeneity. At low intensity land-use, species rich groups include wetland plants, plant habitat indicators, upland birds and rare invertebrates, whilst richness of other species groups (farmland birds, butterflies, bees) was associated with higher land-use intensity. Habitat heterogeneity (broadleaved woodland connectivity, hedgerows, habitat diversity) was positively related to species richness of many taxa, both generalists (plants, butterflies, bees) and specialists (rare birds, woodland birds, plants, butterflies).The results were used to create maps of HNV farmland. The proportion of semi-natural vegetation is a useful metric for identifying HNV type 1. HNV type 2 (defined as a mosaic of low-intensity habitats and structural elements) is more difficult to predict from surrogate variables, due to complex relationships between biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity and inadequacies of current remotely sensed data.This approach, using fine-scaled field survey data collected at regular intervals, in conjunction with remotely sensed data offers potential for extrapolating modelled results nationally, and importantly, can be used to assess change over time.

TI  - Multi-city comparison of the relationships between spatial pattern and cooling effect of urban green spaces in four major Asian cities
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on the role of urban green spaces (UGS) in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect demonstrate the influence of two related, but distinct attributes of UGS: the composition (amount), and configuration (spatial attributes and distribution) of UGS patches. While the positive role of UGS amount in providing cooling effect seems unequivocal, it is still not possible to develop a consensus on the role of UGS configuration from the small number of studies that have been conducted to-date. The latter observation could be due to different methodologies, such as choice of landscape metrics and statistical methods used in different studies, as well as differences in urban form of cities. This study addresses the current knowledge gap by using a same set of methodologies applied to four cities of different urban forms: Singapore and Hong Kong as compact cities, and Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur as sprawling cities. Landsat imageries were used to derive land cover and land surface temperature (LST) maps. Different statistical and spatial analysis techniques were also used. We report several novel findings from this study: (1) only four metrics of percentage of landscape (PLAND), area-weighted mean shape index (SHAPE_AM), patch density (PD), and mean Euclidean nearest neighbor distance (ENN_MN) were adequate to explain UGS pattern-LST relationships in all four cities; (2) the relative importance of composition versus configuration of UGS in determining LST seems to be a function of the existing UGS pattern: what the average per unit area of the city is like in terms of patch size (area-weighted mean patch size (AREA_AM)), shape complexity (SHAPE_AM), and distribution (skewness and kurtosis) of patches; and (3) decision tree classifier is a novel and effective method to unravel hidden patterns in complex UGS pattern-LST relationships. Our results also provide insights on UGS management in cities for higher cooling effects. Greening priorities may differ among cities. In cities where configuration is not a determinant of LST (e.g. Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong), greening may focus on providing conditions necessary for configuration to influence LST and adding greenery, and where configuration already affects LST (e.g. Jakarta and Singapore), the focus may be placed on optimization of UGS by providing larger, simpler in shape, more aggregated and connected, and less fragmented UGS patches.

TI  - Snow Cover Estimation From Image Time Series Based on Spectral Unmixing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A method based on spectral unmixing (SU) for snow cover estimation from a time series of optical images is proposed in this letter. Specifically, we have developed an endmember estimation procedure that exploits the temporal continuity of a scene. Consecutive dates are jointly processed for a more precise description of background materials improving the estimation of a fractional snow cover map. The proposed workflow relies on up to three consecutive acquisitions over the same area to extract an appropriate set of background spectra to be considered as endmembers. In greater details, multiple sets of endmemhers are extracted from different images in the time series by a geometrical automated endmember extraction algorithm and the most relevant one is selected in terms of reconstruction error. Snow cover maps are then estimated by SU considering as endmemhers the snow spectra coming from a spectral library and those associated with the background materials as estimated by the proposed procedure. The proposed technique is quantitatively validated considering Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Terra data over the French Alps and Moroccan High Atlas image time series and comparing the estimated snow cover maps with high-resolution reference data. The experiment clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the generated set of endmemhers using three different approaches to abundance estimation.

TI  - Physiotherapy provision to hospitalised stroke patients: Analysis from the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme
T2  - EUROPEAN STROKE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The purpose of this study is to investigate which factors are associated with physiotherapy provision to hospitalised stroke patients. Methods Data were analysed for stroke patients admitted to hospital in England and Wales between April 2013 and March 2017 recorded on the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) national stroke register. Associations between different patient factors, and applicability for and intensity of physiotherapy were measured using multi-level logistic and regression models. Findings: Data from 306,078 patients were included on the SSNAP register. Median age was 77 years (IQR 67-85) and 84.7% of patients with completed stroke severity data had a mild-moderate stroke. In all, 85.2% of patients recorded on SSNAP were deemed applicable for physiotherapy. Applicability for physiotherapy was 47% higher among thrombolysed patients (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.40-1.54), 36% lower in those with severe pre-morbid disability (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58-0.71) and more than 2.5-fold higher among patients admitted to hospitals with greater availability of early supported discharge (aOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.28-5.37). Patients who were younger, male, had less pre-morbid disability, lower stroke severity, sustained an infarction, received thrombolysis, and had fewer medical complications were more likely to receive more intensive physiotherapy post-stroke. Conclusion Several patient and service organisational factors are associated with physiotherapy provision to stroke patients, some of which may not be justifiable. Physiotherapists should be aware of these factors when planning and delivering physiotherapy as well as any possible biases associated with physiotherapy provision to patients post-stroke.

TI  - Sentinel-3 Delay-Doppler altimetry over Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of Sentinel-3A in February 2016 represented the beginning of a new long-term series of operational satellite radar altimeters, which will provide Delay-Doppler altimetry measurements over ice sheets for decades to come. Given the potential benefits that these satellites can offer to a range of glaciological applications, it is important to establish their capacity to monitor ice sheet elevation and elevation change. Here, we present the first analysis of Sentinel-3 Delay-Doppler altimetry over the Antarctic ice sheet, and assess the accuracy and precision of retrievals of ice sheet elevation across a range of topographic regimes. Over the low-slope regions of the ice sheet interior, we find that the instrument achieves both an accuracy and a precision of the order of 10 cm, with similar to 98% of the data validated being within 50 cm of co-located airborne measurements. Across the steeper and more complex topography of the ice sheet margin, the accuracy decreases, although analysis at two coastal sites with densely surveyed airborne campaigns shows that similar to 60%-85% of validated data are still within 1 m of co-located airborne elevation measurements. We then explore the utility of the Sentinel-3A Delay-Doppler altimeter for mapping ice sheet elevation change. We show that with only 2 years of available data, it is possible to resolve known signals of ice dynamic imbalance and to detect evidence of subglacial lake drainage activity. Our analysis demonstrates a new, long-term source of measurements of ice sheet elevation and elevation change, and the early potential of this operational system for monitoring ice sheet imbalance for decades to come.

TI  - Review of the pansharpening methods for remote sensing images based on the idea of meta-analysis: Practical discussion and challenges
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, the development of pansharpening methods from traditional understanding to the current understanding is comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, the performance of the different categories of pan sharpening methods developed between 2000 and 2016 is evaluated based on the idea of meta-analysis. This is innovatively performed by making a statistical analysis of the studies ever published. In the proposed scheme, based on strict selection criteria, 48 representative articles, which were selected from more than 1000 articles, were applied for the statistical analysis. This paper aims to provide a holistic review of the pansharpening methods, and highlights the development process from the traditional understanding to the current understanding. In addition, the experiments were implemented from a new perspective based on the idea of meta analysis.

TI  - Modelling of river flow in ungauged catchment using remote sensing data: application of the empirical (SCS-CN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Hydrological Model (HEC-HMS)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study an attempt is made to provide empirical and deterministic modelling approach for deriving flood frequency curve in ungauged Keseke river catchment, South Nation Nationality and People (SNNP)-Ethiopia. The research work consists of (i) extracting of remote sensing data; (ii) evaluation and validation of remote sensing data; (iii) modelling of river flow using remote sensing data (climate and physiographic data) of the river catchment; (ii) three types of hydrological models validation and evaluation; (iv) developing of flood frequency model for each sub-catchment. The evaluation and validation of remote sensing data and river flow prediction is carried out on eight selected rivers in Keseke River catchment. The single gamma distribution quantile mapping is a good approximation to adjust satellite precipitation product data and the Pearson correlation function has shown a good correlation, mainly on heavy rain events. Results reveals that the SCS-CN and ANN approaches are suitable to predict river runoff in ungauged with reasonable accuracy in the investigated sub-catchments, and appears acceptable correlation between estimated and corrected satellite rainfall. A field campaign to obtain possible data was executed via interview and river cross section measures. The flood quantiles are compared with one time flow observation from field measured value (which is estimated from the river cross-section size) to identify the most representative hydrological modelstructure.

TI  - A rare case of long-term paraesthesia diagnosed as a paraneoplastic syndrome by anti-SOX1 antibody determination
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Paraneoplastic syndromes (PS) are a rare presentation of cancer, most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), breast cancer and haematologic malignancies. The diagnosis of PS is challenging because it could affect multiple organ systems and it may present before the tumour is visible by imaging. We report a malignant tumour diagnosed in a male patient who referred long-term paraesthesia and proximal muscle strength loss. After ruling out common causes of polyneuropathy, the anti-SOX1 antibody gave light to the diagnosis. A pulmonary opacity in the upper right lobe was observed in the chest X-ray and a pulmonary tumour was later confirmed by CT scan. The biopsy of the cervical lymphadenopathy determined an SCLC, which caused a PS called Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Our case raises awareness of a rare PS presentation, which can be diagnosed by specific antibodies, allowing early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.

TI  - Performance evaluation of textural features in improving land use/land cover classification accuracy of heterogeneous landscape using multi-sensor remote sensing data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Texture analysis of remote sensing images has been received a substantial amount of attention as it plays a vital role in improving the classification accuracy of heterogeneous landscape. However, it is inadequately studied that how the images from different sensors with varying spatial resolutions influence the choice of textural features. This study endeavors to examine the textural features from the Landsat 8-OLI, RISAT-1, Resourcesat 2-LISS III, Sentinel-1A and Resourcesat 2-LISS IV satellite images with spatial resolution of 30, 25, 23.5, 5x20 and 5.8 m respectively, for improving land use/land cover (LULC) classification accuracy. The textural features were extracted from the aforesaid sensor data with the assistance of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) with different moving window sizes. The best combination of textural features was recognized using standard deviations and correlation coefficients following separability analysis of LULC categories based on training samples. A supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier was employed to perform LULC classification and the results were evaluated using ground truth information. This work demonstrates the significance of textural features in improving the classification accuracy of heterogeneous landscape and it becomes more significant as the spatial resolution improved. It is also revealed that textures are vital especially in the case of SAR data.

TI  - Assessment of Complementary Medium-Resolution Satellite Imageries for Nearshore Bathymetry Estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on utilizing Sentinel 2 MSI datasets to generate satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) maps at a resolution of 10 m for two temporally varying datasets of the study region of Ameland Inlet, located in The Netherlands, by using support vector regression (SVR) technique. The relative performance of Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) datasets with SVR technique is also assessed to demonstrate the complementary nature of these freely available medium-resolution imageries. Further, the root mean square error and mean absolute error between the retrieved and measured bathymetries are estimated and reported to evaluate the capability of SVR in estimating depths. It is evident that the SDBs thus generated using this machine learning approach provide dependable estimations of depths that can further be utilized for various coastal engineering studies.

TI  - Monitoring of severe weather events using RGB scheme of INSAT-3D satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, real-time analysis of products and information dissemination (RAPID), a web-based quick visualisation and analysis tool for INSAT satellite data on a real-time basis has been introduced for identification of pre-monsoon severe weather events. The tool introduces the next generation weather data access and advanced visualisation. The combination of channels using red-green-blue (RGB) composites of INSAT-3D satellite and its physical significant value contents are presented. The solar reflectance and brightness temperatures (BTs) are the major components of the RGB composite. The solar reflectance component of the shortwave thermal infrared (IR) (1.6m), visible (0.5) and thermal IR channels (10.8) representing the cloud microstructure is known as Day Microphysics (DMP) RGB and the BT differences between 10.8, 12.0 and 3.9 is known as Night Microphysics (NMP) RGB. The threshold technique has been developed separately for both the RGB products of the year 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 of March-June, prior to the event (1-3 hr) for the detection of the thunderstorms. A validation analysis was conducted using the Forecast Demonstration Project of Storm Bulletins for pre-monsoon weather systems prepared by the India Meteorological Department and RADAR observations, demonstrating that this approach is extremely useful in recognising the area of convection prior to the occurrence of the events by the RGB thresholds. The validation of these thresholds has been carried out for March-June 2017. Both the RGBs i.e., DMP and NMP have a reasonable agreement with the ground-based observations and RADAR data. This threshold technique yields a very good probability of thunderstorm detection more than 94% and 93% with acceptable false alarm conditions, less than 3% and 5% for DMP and NMP, respectively. Furthermore, the limitations of these RGB products are additionally highlighted, and the future extent of refinement of these products in perspective of a rapid scan strategy is proposed. The threshold techniques are found to be useful for nowcasting application and are being used operationally using the RAPID tool.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Spotted-wing drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura, 1931) (Diptera, Drosophilidae) was recorded for the first time in Slovenia in autumn 2010. Shortly thereafter, it turned out to be one of the most important insect pests of soft and stone fruit in Slovenia and elsewhere. Within the expert work in the field of plant protection, more precisely within task inventarisation of beneficial organisms for biological control, the presence of indigenous D. suzukii parasitoids was investigated in 2018. Sentinel traps baited with D. suzukii larvae and pupae in banana slices enriched with artificial food medium for drosophilids were used for inventorying D. suzukii parasitoids in raspberries. The pupal parasitoid Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins, 1910) (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae) and the larval parasitoid Leptopilina heterotoma (Thompson, 1862) (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) were recorded parasitizing D. suzukii for the first time in Slovenia in August 2018 in Central Slovenia (Ljubljana).

TI  - 5 Full and Simulated Compact Polarimetry SAR Responses to Canadian Wetlands: Separability Analysis and Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on spatial distribution of wetland classes is crucial for monitoring this important productive ecosystem using advanced remote sensing tools and data. Although the potential of full- and dual-polarimetric (FP and DP) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for wetland classification has been well examined, the capability of compact polarimetric (CP) SAR data has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This is of great significance, since the upcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), which will soon be the main source of SAR observations in Canada, will have CP mode as one of its main SAR configurations. This also highlights the necessity to fully exploit such important Earth Observation (EO) data by examining the similarities and dissimilarities between FP and CP SAR data for wetland mapping. Accordingly, this study examines and compares the discrimination capability of extracted features from FP and simulated CP SAR data between pairs of wetland classes. In particular, 13 FP and 22 simulated CP SAR features are extracted from RADARSAT-2 data to determine their discrimination capabilities both qualitatively and quantitatively in three wetland sites, located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Seven of 13 FP and 15 of 22 CP SAR features are found to be the most discriminant, as they indicate an excellent separability for at least one pair of wetland classes. The overall accuracies of 87.89%, 80.67%, and 84.07% are achieved using the CP SAR data for the three wetland sites (Avalon, Deer Lake, and Gros Morne, respectively) in this study. Although these accuracies are lower than those of FP SAR data, they confirm the potential of CP SAR data for wetland mapping as accuracies exceed 80% in all three sites. The CP SAR data collected by RCM will significantly contribute to the efforts ongoing of conservation strategies for wetlands and monitoring changes, especially on large scales, as they have both wider swath coverage and improved temporal resolution compared to those of RADARSAT-2.

TI  - Can We Detect the Brownness or Greenness of the Congo Rainforest Using Satellite-Derived Surface Albedo? A Study on the Role of Aerosol Uncertainties
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of spatial remote sensing in the visible domain to properly detect the slow transitions in the Earth's vegetation is often a subject of debate. The reason behind this is that the satellite products often used to calculate vegetation indices such as surface albedo or reflectance, are not always correctly decontaminated from atmospheric effects. In view of the observed decline in vegetation over the Congo during the last decade, this study investigates how effectively satellite-derived variables can contribute to the answering of this question. In this study, we use two satellite-derived surface albedo products, three satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, two model-derived AOD products, and synthetic observations from radiative transfer simulations. The study discusses the important discrepancies (of up to 70%) found between these satellite surface albedo products in the visible domain over this region. We conclude therefore that the analysis of trends in vegetation properties based on satellite observations in the visible domain such as NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), calculated from reflectance or albedo variables, is still quite questionable over tropical forest regions such as the Congo. Moreover, this study demonstrates that there is a significant increase (of up to 14%) in total aerosols within the last decade over the Congo. We note that if these changes in aerosol loads are not correctly taken into account in the retrieval of surface albedo, a greenness change of the surface properties (decrease of visible albedo) of around 8% could be artificially detected. Finally, the study also shows that neglecting strong aerosol emissions due to volcano eruptions could lead to an artificial increase of greenness over the Congo of more than 25% in the year of the eruptions and up to 16% during the 2-3 years that follow.

TI  - Slope instability analysis in South Patagonia applying multivariate and bivariate techniques on Landsat images during 2001-2015 period
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present results of the estimation of surface changes associated with slope instability processes on the Upsala Channel by remote sensing and statistic techniques. Hilislopes, involving lateral moraines, of Upsala Channel at the Argentino Lake have become potentially unstable due to the retreat of Upsala Glacier during the last century. The glaciation and deglaciation processes modify the tensions on the slope stability and may generate landslide processes. A landslide movement destroyed the western edge of the Upsala Channel in February 2013. In addition, the region represents a great tourist attraction usually ships navigate through the Upsala Channel seeing impressive landscapes, especially the Upsala Glacier, stand out. Due to this risky situation the necessity of increasing the knowledge in the area has arisen but has not been addressed yet. Therefore, the main goal of the present study is to investigate the multivariate statistical techniques by the principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminative analysis (DA) in four testing areas (TAS(n)). Besides, we include Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and normal distribution (ND) to determine whether the testing areas suffered slope movements or were temporally stable. The study is based on Landsat optical satellite images, acquired during the period from October 2001 to April 2015. The results show that TAS(1,2,4) are less stable, whereas TAS(5) is a more stable area as compared to another TAS. The PC1 and PC2 principal components explained the total variability of the 76% data. The total apparent error of DA reached 2.2% points. The PCC achieved a positive trend during the years when movement on the slope surface was not observed; while during the periods when slope instability was observed, the correlation showed a negative trend. The TAS(n) that had shown a different behavior presented contrasted Gaussian bells; they are more flattened in those years with instability events.

TI  - THE ATHENIAN ALTAR AND THE AMAZONIAN CHATBOT: A PAULINE READING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND APOCALYPTIC ENDS
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores questions about chatbots in particular and artificial intelligence (AI) in general from a Pauline, that is, a Christian theological perspective. It does so in a way that focuses on a particular scene in the New Testament: Paul in the Athenian Areopagus, considering an altar to an "unknown God," quoting Greek poets and philosophers, and sharing curious theology as he dialogues with Stoic and Epicurean thinkers (Acts 17:16-34). By examining the sociohistorical nuances of this scene and their philosophical and theological implications, this article shows how the altar Paul considers philosophically and theologically becomes the focal point for an important dialogue about apocalyptic ends, or ideas about who we are, where we are going, and who or what is responsible for that who-ness and where-ness. In turn, this can teach us how to ask practical questions, which can uncover the unsuspected apocalyptic ends represented by, or even contained within, common technological objects such as chatbots.

TI  - 3D gray level co-occurrence matrix and its application to identifying collapsed buildings
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the remarkable progress in access to remote sensing imagery data, nowadays research very often utilizes more than one image. We are often able to use multitemporal, hyperspectral, and/or full polarization of microwave radar images. In addition, it has become the general consensus that texture analysis plays an important role in remote sensing. It has been found in several publications that texture analysis was applied to each layer separately; however, this procedure requires a significant amount of computation and produces a massive volume of data. One alternative, and perhaps a better procedure, is to arrange the images into a multi-layered structure and perform texture analysis within some sort of three-dimensional domain. This manuscript extends the concepts of the gray level of co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analysis applied for a single image to a multi-layered set of images, referred to in this paper as 3DGLCM. We then presented an interpretation of the 3DGLCM within the context of building damage identification. A set of 3DGLCM-based features were computed and evaluated as well. As a result, it was observed that some texture features have certain similarities with other methods proposed in previous studies, whereas other features have not been used before. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in learning and detecting collapsed buildings using 3DGLCM-based features. Thus, the empirical evaluation focuses on the identification of collapsed buildings caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, where individual polarized TerraSAR-X intensity images are used to compute the texture features, and the collapsed buildings caused by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, where LIDAR-based digital surface models are used to compute the texture features. Extensive datasets consisting of building damage states that have been visually inspected by local authorities and research teams are used to set up the training and testing subsets. Furthermore, the proposed texture features are compared with features commonly used to identify collapsed buildings. The study concludes that an SVM trained with 3DGLCM-based features identifies collapsed buildings with high accuracy and outperforms an SVM trained with common features used in previous studies.

TI  - THE INVERSE PROBLEM OF KLEIN-GORDON EQUATION BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM AND ITS APPLICATION IN DATA ASSIMILATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the solution of elliptic partial differential equations continuously depends on the boundary condition, the Euler equation derived from variational method cannot be solved without boundary condition. It is often difficult to provide the exact boundary condition in the practical use of variational method. However, in some application problems such as the remote sensing data assimilation, the values can be easily obtained in the inner region of the domain. In this paper, the boundary condition is tried to be retrieved by using part solutions in the inner area. Firstly, the variational problem of remote sensing data assimilation within a circular area is established. The Klein-Gordon elliptic equation is derived from the Euler method of variational problems with assumed boundary condition. Secondly, a computer-friendly Green function is constructed for the Dirichlet problem of two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation, with the formal solution according to Green formula. Thirdly, boundary values are retrieved by solving the optimal problem which is constructed according to the best approximation between formal solutions and high-accuracy measurements in the interior of the domain. Finally, the assimilation problem is solved on substituting the retrieved boundary values into the Klein-Gordon equation. It is a type of inverse problem in mathematics. The advantage of this method lies in that it overcomes the inherent instability of the inverse problem of Fredholm integral equation and alleviates the error introduced by artificial boundary condition in data fusion using variational method in the past.

TI  - 'Sugar from space': Using satellite imagery to predict cane yield and variability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 40th Annual Conference of the Australian-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists (ASSCT)
CL  - Mackay, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Satellite imagery has been demonstrated to be an effective technology for producing accurate pre-harvest estimates in many agricultural crops. For Australian sugarcane, yield forecasting models have been developed from a single date SPOT satellite image acquired around peak crop growth. However, a failure to acquire a SPOT image at this critical growth stage, from continued cloud cover or from competition for the satellite, can prevent an image being captured and therefore a forecast being made for that season. In order to reduce the reliance on a single image capture and to improve the accuracies of the forecasts themselves, time series yield prediction models have been developed for eight sugarcane growing regions using multiple years of free Landsat satellite images. In addition to the forecasting of average regional yield, an automated computational and programming procedure enabling the derivation of crop vigour variability (GNDVI) maps from the freely available Sentinel 2 satellite imagery was developed. These maps, produced for 15 sugarcane growing regions during the 2017 growing season, identify both variations in crop vigour across regions and within every individual crop. These outputs were made available to collaborating mills within each growing region. This paper presents the accuracies achieved from the time series yield forecasting models versus actual 2017 yields for the respective regions, as well as provides an example of the derived mapping outputs.

TI  - A Novel Index to Detect Opencast Coal Mine Areas From Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection, classification, and monitoring of surface mining region from satellite images have vast challenges. Surface mining industry has huge effect on social, economical, ecological, and environmental welfare of a country. Machine learning techniques are used to capture the unique characteristics of surface mining region from satellite images. In opencast coal mines, raw coals stay exposed to the environment. Reflectance measures in certain wavelengths of such areas are distinguishable from other non-coal areas. These surface mining areas can be detected through satellite images using this cue. It has been found in this paper, that the spectral index derived from SWIR-I (1.566-1.651 mu m) and SWIR-II (2.107-2.294 mu m) bands of Landsat 8 exhibit distinctive features to detect high mineral areas of coal seams. Spectral plots of reflectance values of different land cover classes with respect to reflectance values of coal are found to be different. This paper presents a novel index to detect surface coal mines. Coal quarry and coal dump regions are considered as the true positive regions. The accuracy of the index has been validated with high-resolution Google Earth ground truth images and statistical measures. The robustness of the index is analyzed through seasonal variations. The average accuracy of the proposed method over the season is found to be 86.24%. The proposed index can be further used for classification and area monitoring of opencast coal mine regions.

TI  - Environmental Sampling for Influenza A Viruses in Turkey Barns
T2  - AVIAN DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We have examined a variety of sampling strategies for detecting pathogens in turkey flocks undergoing infections with low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV). We found that viral RNA was widely distributed in the barn environment of turkey flocks undergoing an active LPAIV infection and was in both water and drinker biofilm samples. Viral RNA was concentrated in drinker biofilm and sediment and was detectable using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and by virus isolation. Drinker biofilm sample results correlated with concurrently collected oropharyngeal (OP) sample results from flocks on a farm with LPAI in which the two sampling strategies were directly compared. To evaluate the utility of biofilm sampling for the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), biofilm and OP swabs from mortality pools were collected daily from negative turkey flocks on an HPAI-positive premise. The biofilm swabs were positive 1-2 days prior to positives appearing in the OP sample pools. The drinker biofilm sampling strategy overcame the difficulty of finding a subclinical infectious bird in a population by collecting material from a large number of individuals and testing a sample in which a positive signal persists for several days to weeks. The sampling method is convenient for use in turkey barns and has been reliably used in both active and passive surveillance programs for LPAIV and HPAIV using RRT-PCR.

TI  - Remotely sensed retrieval of Local Climate Zones and their linkages to land surface temperature in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study sought to determine Local Climate Zones (LCZs) in Harare metropolitan City, using Landsat 8 multi-spectral and multi-temporal data. The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) and Support Vector Machine classifiers were applied. Training datasets were extracted from Google Earth as prescribed by the WUDAPT procedure. Before image classification, we tested the separability of the LCZs, using the Transformed Divergence Separability Index (TDSI) based on the digitized training datasets and Landsat 8 data. Derived LCZs were then linked with Landsat 8 derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) for the cool and hot seasons. TDSI values greater 1.9 were obtained indicating that LCZs were highly separable. Comparatively, the WUDAPT method produced more accurate LCZs results (Overall accuracy = 95.69%) than the SVM classifier (Overall accuracy = 89.86%) based on seasonal Landsat 8 data. However, SVM derived accuracies were within the acceptable range of at least 80% (overall accuracy) in literature. Further, LST was observed to be high in LCZs with high built-up density and low vegetation proportion, when compared to other zones. Due to high proportion of vegetation, sparsely built areas were at least 1 degrees C cooler. Although LCZs are usually linked at 2 m air temperature, they also strongly explain LST distribution. This work provides insight into the importance of mapping LCZs in third world countries where such information remains scarce.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Based Integrated Approach to Quantify the Impact of Fluvial and Pluvial Flooding in an Urban Catchment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pluvial (surface water) flooding is often the cause of significant flood damage in urban areas. However, pluvial flooding is often overlooked in catchments which are historically known for fluvial floods. In this study, we present a conceptual remote sensing based integrated approach to enhance current practice in the estimation of flood extent and damage and characterise the spatial distribution of pluvial and fluvial flooding. Cockermouth, a town which is highly prone to flooding, was selected as a study site. The flood event caused by named storm Desmond in 2015 (5-6/12/2015) was selected for this study. A high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was produced from a composite digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) obtained from the Environment Agency. Using this DEM, a 2D flood model was developed in HEC-RAS (v5) 2D for the study site. Simulations were carried out with and without pluvial flooding. Calibrated models were then used to compare the fluvial and combined (pluvial and fluvial) flood damage areas for different land use types. The number of residential properties affected by both fluvial and combined flooding was compared using a combination of modelled results and data collected from Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time that remote sensing data, hydrological modelling and flood damage data at a property level have been combined to differentiate between the extent of flooding and damage caused by fluvial and pluvial flooding in the same event. Results show that the contribution of pluvial flooding should not be ignored, even in a catchment where fluvial flooding is the major cause of the flood damages. Although the additional flood depths caused by the pluvial contribution were lower than the fluvial flood depths, the affected area is still significant. Pluvial flooding increased the overall number of affected properties by 25%. In addition, it increased the flood depths in a number of properties that were identified as being affected by fluvial flooding, in some cases by more than 50%. These findings show the importance of taking pluvial flooding into consideration in flood management practices. Further, most of the data used in this study was obtained via remote sensing methods, including UAS. This demonstrates the merit of developing a remote sensing based framework to enhance current practices in the estimation of both flood extent and damage.

TI  - Basin scale rainfall-evapotranspiration dynamics in a tropical semiarid environment during dry and wet years
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In semiarid regions the occurrence of alternating long drought and heavy rainfall periods directly impacts water availability, affecting human water supply, agriculture development and the provision of ecosystem services. Because of that, research on the water input and output fluxes at the basin scale is of paramount importance. In this sense, rainfall-evapotranspiration (ET) dynamics play a critical role in water, soil and vegetation interactions, in hydrometeorological modelling and in the energy fluxes dynamics of semiarid regions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify daily ET during a wet year and a dry year in a watershed located in the Brazilian Semiarid, by using remote sensing data and formulations based on the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) and the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) algorithms. Land surface temperature, albedo and NDVI data from MODIS sensor and solar radiation data from weather stations located in the basin were used. Rainfall analysis indicated 2009 and 2012 as being representatives of anomalously wet and dry years respectively, which were selected for the quantification of ET. The proposed algorithm was adjusted and verified with data from a flux tower equipped with eddy covariance system. Daily remote sensing ET estimates showed good agreement with observed values (RMSE = 0.79 mm.d(-1)) and the annual ET relative error was of 7.7% (35.4 mm.year(-1)). Results showed that the native vegetation can delay its dormant state for five months during wet years. During the wet year, ET differences between land cover classes were less noticeable due to soil saturation and the urgency of vegetated surfaces to meet their physiological needs. In dry year, however, differences were more evident, with bare soil presenting lower ET rates and vegetation classes showing higher ET values.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface has already been exposed to impressive land use/cover changes, which is more evident in residential areas. Land cover changes play an important role in understanding the interactions between human activities and the environment. The aim of this research was to analyze and monitor land cover changes in zone 2 in Tehran, Iran over a time span of 30years and predict the future trend of changes during the period of 2016-2032. Land cover maps for 1986, 2000 and 2016 via RS images obtained from Landsat TM, ETM+, respectively. In order to predict the future land cover in this zone for the next 16years, the Markov CA model was used. Results of the classification of the images indicate a significant increase in the built lands against the reduction of open lands and green lands. The biggest changes that have occurred was an increase in the amount of built lands, from 1986 to 2016, the amount of built lands increased by 25.2%, green land decreased by 4.4%, and the open lands had decreased by 23.6%. These changes reflect the destruction of green lands and open lands as two important and ecological infrastructures. The results of this study can play a useful role in improving the land cover management strategies of the study area.

TI  - Contrast improvement in indocyanine green fluorescence sensing in thick tissue using a time-gating method
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indocyanine green-based fluorescence imaging techniques are very powerful in clinical applications, but the imaging is restricted to the signal from the near-surface region of tissue. Here, we focus on the method to discriminate the fluorescence signal from the background using a time-domain gating technique. The contrast of the fluorescence image from a fluorescence object at more than 1 cm depth in a meat phantom could be enhanced about 4-5 times relative to the continuous wave method if the time-gate range was properly selected. Further, a Monte Carlo simulation with a simple background model indicates that a shorter source and detector distance is more effective to improve the contrast. The simple time-gating method will enable a highly sensitive fluorescence detection in thick tissue. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Several studies have demonstrated the role of meteorological parameters in the seasonality of influenza viruses in tropical and subtropical regions, most importantly temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Objectives This study aimed to describe the influence of meteorological parameters in the seasonality of influenza viruses in Northern Cameroon, a region characterized by high temperatures. Methods This was a retrospective study performed in Garoua Cameroon from January 2014 to December 2016. Monthly proportions of confirmed influenza cases from six sentinel sites were considered as dependent variables, whereas monthly values of mean temperature, average relative humidity, and accumulated rainfall were considered as independent variables. A vector error correction model was used to determine the relationship between influenza activity and the meteorological variables. Results and conclusion Analysis showed that there was a statistically significant association between overall influenza activity and influenza A activity with respect to average relative humidity. A unit increase in humidity within a given month leads to more than 85% rise in the overall influenza and influenza A activity 2 months later. Meanwhile, none of the three meteorological variables could explain influenza B activity. This observation is essential in filling the gap of knowledge and could help in the prevention and control strategies to strengthen influenza surveillance program in Cameroon.

TI  - Comparison of Different Algorithms to Map Hydrothermal Alteration Zones Using ASTER Remote Sensing Data for Polymetallic Vein-Type Ore Exploration: Toroud-Chahshirin Magmatic Belt (TCMB), North Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polymetallic vein-type ores are important sources of precious metal and a principal type of orebody for various base-metals. In this research, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) remote sensing data were used for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with epithermal polymetallic vein-type mineralization in the Toroud-Chahshirin Magmatic Belt (TCMB), North of Iran. The TCMB is the largest known goldfield and base metals province in the central-north of Iran. Propylitic, phyllic, argillic, and advanced argillic alteration and silicification zones are typically associated with Au-Cu, Ag, and/or Pb-Zn mineralization in the TCMB. Specialized image processing techniques, namely Selective Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), Band Ratio Matrix Transformation (BRMT), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) were implemented and compared to map hydrothermal alteration minerals at the pixel and sub-pixel levels. Subtle differences between altered and non-altered rocks and hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages were detected and mapped in the study area. The SPCA and BRMT spectral transformation algorithms discriminated the propylitic, phyllic, argillic and advanced argillic alteration and silicification zones as well as lithological units. The SAM and MTMF spectral mapping algorithms detected spectrally dominated mineral groups such as muscovite/montmorillonite/illite, hematite/jarosite, and chlorite/epidote/calcite mineral assemblages, systematically. Comprehensive fieldwork and laboratory analysis, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), petrographic study, and spectroscopy were conducted in the study area for verifying the remote sensing outputs. Results indicate several high potential zones of epithermal polymetallic vein-type mineralization in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the study area, which can be considered for future systematic exploration programs. The approach used in this research has great implications for the exploration of epithermal polymetallic vein-type mineralization in other base metals provinces in Iran and semi-arid regions around the world.

TI  - Urban Built-Up Effects to Land Surface Temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF MECHANICS OF CONTINUA AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shah Alam is one of the regions which has a dense population and high level of urbanization in Malaysia. The study assumed high urbanization leads to the increase of temperature. The aim is to study the trend and relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) with built-up areas and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in three different years (1997, 2007, 2017) in Shah Alam, Selangor. This study used Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing software to process satellite imagery data (Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, 8 OLI). Built-up area was processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Landsat 8 (OLI) while the land use land cover was processed using Supervised Classification method. The results were analyzed using linear regression analysis in the Statistical Package of the Social Science (SPSS) to describe the relationship of the LST with built-up area and NDVI. The highest LST distribution of 35.717 degrees C is recorded in 2017. This indicates that built-up area gives more impact to the increase of LST in Shah Alam despite NDVI having the highest correlation relationship as shown by the values of R-2 which are 0.557, 0.533, and 0.585 for year 1997, 2007, and 2017 respectively. This paper focused on the changes of land use land cover for built-up area (i.e. residential and industrial area) which have increased from year 1997 to 2017. In year 1997, the percentage of built-up area is 36.69% and it has increased to 44.36% in year 2017. The study can conclude that urban built-up is one of the major factors in the increasing LST.

TI  - Assessing the source and spatial distribution of chemical composition of a rift lake, using multivariate statistical, hydrogeochemical modeling and remote sensing
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The chemical composition of a freshwater surface depends on the sources of input that can be of natural or anthropogenic origin. This study examined the spatial variability of the water quality from Chapala Lake and discussed the possible sources to this freshwater surface which is the largest rift lake in Mexico. The methodology included multivariate statistical techniques to analyze the possible relationship between water quality and the natural and anthropogenic factors of the area. The outcome showed the existence of four groups of water mixture in the lake. Each one showed two or three end members that characterized its chemical nature. The different groups showed a spatial distribution and a particular spectral behavior was detected from the analysis of a Landsat 7 ETM+ image. The spectral signatures extracted from the satellite image showed a high reflectivity in the range of 830 - 1300 nm for the water provided by the Lerma-Chapala (group IV) system, which represents the most polluted water in the lake. This spectral behavior is not present in the rest of the group. The Western portion of the lake is fed mainly by open water. Contributions from groundwater dominate the Central part, and in the Eastern region, the primary source is the contaminated water from the Lerma river system. A high hydraulic head (hydraulic barrier) prevents the highest level of pollution from the Lerma river. This hydraulic barrier constituted by a significant portion of groundwater is at the Central part of the lake. Furthermore, the most polluted water flows directly to the Metropolitan Region of Guadalajara through the Santiago river. The predominant role played by the groundwater in the dynamics of Chapala Lake is explained, in part, from its tectonic origin. The dynamics of water in the Chapala Lake suggest the need to implement some management plans considering the tectonic origin of the Lake as an advantage for the control of pollution because of the significant contribution of groundwater in the Chapala Lake freshwater system.

TI  - A High-Resolution Data Assimilation Framework for Snow Water Equivalent Estimation across the Western United States and Validation with the Airborne Snow Observatory
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountain systems can be biased, and few SWE observations have existed over large domains. New approaches for measuring SWE, like NASA's ultra-high-resolution Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), offer an opportunity to improve model estimates by providing a high-quality validation target. In this study, a computationally efficient snow data assimilation (DA) approach over the western United States at 1.75-km spatial resolution for water years (WYs) 2001-17 is presented. A local ensemble transform Kalman filter implemented as a batch smoother is used with the VIC hydrology model to assimilate the remotely sensed daily MODIS fractional snow-covered area (SCA). Validation of the high-resolution SWE estimates is done against ASO SWE data in the Tuolumne basin (California), Uncompahgre basin (Colorado), and Olympic Peninsula (Washington). Results indicate good performance in dry years and during melt, with DA reducing Tuolumne basin-average SWE percent differences from -68%, -92%, and -84% in open loop to 0.6%, 25%, and 3% after DA for WYs 2013-15, respectively, for ASO dates and spatial extent. DA also improved SWE percent difference over the Uncompahgre basin (-84% open loop, -65% DA) and Olympic Peninsula (26% open loop, -0.2% DA). However, in anomalously wet years DA underestimates SWE, likely due to an inadequate snow depletion curve parameterization. Despite potential shortcomings due to VIC model setup (e.g., water balance mode) or parameterization (snow depletion curve), the DA framework implemented in this study shows promise in overcoming some of these limitations and improving estimated SWE, in particular during drier years or at higher elevations, when most in situ observations cannot capture high-elevation snowpack due to lack of stations there.

TI  - Groundwater Loss and Aquifer System Compaction in San Joaquin Valley During 2012-2015 Drought
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - California's millennium drought of 2012-2015 severely impacted the Central Valley aquifer system and caused permanent loss of groundwater and aquifer storage capacity. To quantify these impacts within the southern San Joaquin Valley, we analyze various complementary measurements, including gravity changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites; vertical land motion from Global Positioning System, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and extensometer; and groundwater level records. The interferometric data set acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite only spans the period January 2015 and October 2017, while the other data sets span the entire drought period. Using GRACE observations, we find an average groundwater loss of 6.12.3km(3)/year as a lower bound estimate for the San Joaquin Valley, amounting to a total volume of 24.29.3km(3) lost during the period October 2011 to September 2015. This is consistent with the total volume of 29.258.7km(3), estimated using only Global Positioning System deformation data. Our results highlight the advantage of using vertical land motion data to evaluate groundwater loss and thus fill the gaps between GRACE and GRACE-Follow-On missions and complement their estimates. We further determine that 0.4-3.25% of the aquifer system storage capacity is permanently lost during this drought period. Comparing groundwater level and vertical land motion data following September 2015, we determine an equilibration time of 0.5-1.5years for groundwater levels within aquitard and aquifer units, during which residual compaction of aquitard and land subsidence continues beyond the drought period. We suggest that such studies can advance the knowledge of evolving groundwater resources, enabling managers and decision makers to better assess water demand and supply during and in-between drought periods.

TI  - Unsupervised Land Cover Change Estimation Using Region Covariance Estimates
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we demonstrate the utility of estimating a probabilistic model of the underlying seasonal and interannual variations experienced by land cover time series in a given geographical region. Time series that deviate from these trajectories due to the human-induced change appear as outliers and can be detected using their Mahalanobis distance from the mean under the joint distribution of time samples. We apply this model to a collection of pixel time series acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer platform over Limpopo province, South Africa, for the task of identifying human settlement expansion. For estimation of the time of change, we present a hypothesis testing approach that tests for a decrease in correlation between samples before and after the change. This was found to be highly effective, yielding a mean absolute error of 52 days.

TI  - Metabolomics based on UHPLC-QToF- and APGC-QToF-MS reveals metabolic pathways reprogramming in response to tidal cycles in the sub-littoral species <i>Mimachlamys varia</i> exposed to aerial emergence
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mimachlamys varia is a sub-littoral bivalve encountered from Norway to the Mediterranean Sea, which lives mostly byssally attached to rocks. During the low tide period, M. varia individuals, located highest on the shore, may experience short time of aerial exposure and face a low availability of oxygen. Here we report a comparative metabolomic profiling of gill samples of M. varia obtained by both LC-QToF and APGC-QToF mass spectrometry, to analyze metabolic changes occurring during emersion in comparison with immersion. Scallops were grown in aquaria with a simulated intertidal environment mimicking short-duration air exposure that they might experience during extreme tides: alternating 2 h emersion and 10 h immersion. Our results show a switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism after only 2 h of emersion, with the resort to different pathways: glucose lactate, glucose-succinate and aspartate-succinate pathways. Furthermore, camitine-conjugated metabolites were found to accumulate during emersion, as well as urate. The level of tyrosine on the contrary was found to decrease. These findings indicate a complex metabolic reprogramming that occurs after a two hour emersion period and upon re-immersion. Furthermore, M. varia is used as sentinel species in pollution biomonitoring, through the assay of biomarkers to evaluate the effects of pollutants. Here we show that emersion induces a significant decrease of superoxide dismutase activity, an enzyme developed by bivalves to face oxidative stress and used as biomarker. These findings have to be taken into account to normalize sampling during campaigns of environmental monitoring, by taking in situ, as far as possible only immersed individuals.

TI  - Is it always necessary to perform an axillary lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer?
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION Recent prospective studies support the feasibility of performing sentinel lymph node biopsy following neoadju- vant chemotherapy in initially fine-needle aspiration cytology or ultrasound-guided biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer. The main aid is to identify preoperative features that help us predict a complete axillary response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these patients and thus select the candidates for sentinel lymph node biopsy post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy to avoid unnecessary axillary lymphadenectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective observational study with a total of 150 patients, biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast surgery and axillary lymphadenectomy were included and retrospectively analysed. A predictive model was generated by a multivariate logistic regression analysis for pathological complete response-dependent variable.RESULTS The response of the primary lesion to neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging, Her2/neu overexpression and a low estrogen receptor expression are associated with a higher rate of nodal pathologically complete response. The multivariant model generated a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.79 and a confidence interval of 0.72-0.87 at a 95% level of significance.CONCLUSION This model could be a helpful tool for the surgeon to help in predicting which cases have a higher likelihood of achieving a pathologically complete response and therefore selecting those who may benefit from a post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy sentinel lymph node biopsy and avoid unnecessary axillary lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Considerations in the Treatment of Osteoporotic Distal Radius Fractures in Elderly Patients
T2  - CURRENT REVIEWS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of ReviewWith the incidence of distal radius fractures increasing in the elderly population, we sought to summarize the current orthopedic and medical management of these fractures in the elderly osteoporotic population.Recent FindingsThe number of osteoporotic patients undergoing surgical fixation for distal radius fractures has increased in recent years. This is likely due to the improved outcomes seen with volar locking plates, as well as an increase in the number of fellowship-trained hand surgeons. Despite this potential improvement in acute fracture management, a majority of these patients are underdiagnosed and undertreated for their underlying osteoporosis or endocrinopathies. The implementation of fracture liaison services and the ability of the treating orthopedist to recognize this gap in patient care result in a higher number of patients initiating appropriate treatment.SummaryIt is vital that when discussing acute fracture management, a thorough discussion is had with patients regarding functional outcome and the benefits of both surgical and non-operative management. As these fractures become more prevalent and a greater percentage undergo surgical intervention, the economic burden of distal radius fractures will continue to rise. It is imperative that the treating surgeon view these fractures as sentinel events that are predictive of future hip and vertebral fractures. While relatively new, the use of fracture liaison services to help aide in proper screening and treatment of osteoporotic patients is of great value. Non-pharmacologic therapy such as physical therapy, smoking and alcohol cessation programs, and dietary modifications are crucial in treating patients with osteoporosis. While bisphosphonates remain the first-line treatment in patients with osteoporosis, novel therapies show promise for future use.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing to Identify Drivers behind Spatial Patterns in the Bio-physical Properties of a Saltmarsh Pioneer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, spatial organization in salt marshes was shown to contain vital information on system resilience. However, in salt marshes, it remains poorly understood what shaping processes regulate spatial patterns in soil or vegetation properties that can be detected in the surface reflectance signal. In this case study we compared the effect on surface reflectance of four major shaping processes: Flooding duration, wave forcing, competition, and creek formation. We applied the ProSail model to a pioneering salt marsh species (Spartina anglica) to identify through which vegetation and soil properties these processes affected reflectance, and used in situ reflectance data at the leaf and canopy scale and satellite data on the canopy scale to identify the spatial patterns in the biophysical characteristics of this salt marsh pioneer in spring. Our results suggest that the spatial patterns in the pioneer zone of the studied salt marsh are mainly caused by the effect of flood duration. Flood duration explained over three times as much of the variation in canopy properties as wave forcing, competition, or creek influence. It particularly affects spatial patterns through canopy properties, especially the leaf area index, while leaf characteristics appear to have a relatively minor effect on reflectance.

TI  - The influence of runoff and wind on the dispersion patterns of suspended sediment in the Zhujiang (Pearl) River Estuary based on MODIS data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-free moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of the Zhujiang (Pearl) River Estuary (ZRE) taken between 2002 and 2012 are retrieved and used to study the spatial and temporal patterns of suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) across the estuary under runoff, wind, and tropical storm conditions. Five typical dispersal patterns of suspended sediments in the estuary are defined: Case I shows generally low SSCs under low dynamics; Case II shows a river-dominant dispersal pattern of suspended sediments from the outlets, particularly from Modaomen, Jiaomen, Hengmen, and others; Case III shows wind-dominant dispersal of high SSCs derived from the west shoal and southwesterly transport under a strong NE wind; Case IV is the combination of relatively large runoff and wind; and Case V is caused by a strong tropical storm with high river discharge and wind, which is characterized by the high SSCs across the entire estuary that are transported eastward by winddriven and buoyancy currents outside the estuary. Runoff is a dominant factor that controls seasonal and annual SSC variations in the ZRE, with the area of high SSCs being largest in the summer and smallest in the spring. The correlation coefficients between the monthly averaged river-suspended sediment discharge and the area of the high SSCs are approximately 0.6. The wind power over the west shoal increases with a wind speed, which induces more sediment resuspension and shows a close relationship between the wind speed and high SSC area.

TI  - Predictive modeling of wildfires: A new dataset and machine learning approach
T2  - FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires, whether natural or caused by humans, are considered among the most dangerous and devastating disasters around the world. Their complexity comes from the fact that they are hard to predict, hard to extinguish and cause enormous financial losses. To address this issue, many research efforts have been conducted in order to monitor, predict and prevent wildfires using several Artificial Intelligence techniques and strategies such as Big Data, Machine Learning, and Remote Sensing. The latter offers a rich source of satellite images, from which we can retrieve a huge amount of data that can be used to monitor wildfires. The method used in this paper combines Big Data, Remote Sensing and Data Mining algorithms (Artificial Neural Network and SVM) to process data collected from satellite images over large areas and extract insights from them to predict the occurrence of wildfires and avoid such disasters. For this reason, we implemented a methodology that serves this purpose by building a dataset based on Remote Sensing data related to the state of the crops (NDVI), meteorological conditions (LST), as well as the fire indicator "Thermal Anomalies", these data, were acquired from "MODIS" (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), a key instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. This dataset is available on GitHub via this link (https://github.com/ouladsayadyounes/Wildfires). Experiments were made using the big data platform "Databricks". Experimental results gave high prediction accuracy (98.32%). These results were assessed using several validation strategies (e.g., classification metrics, cross-validation, and regularization) as well as a comparison with some wildfire early warning systems.

TI  - Detecting canopy damage caused by <i>Uromycladium acaciae</i> on South African Black Wattle forest compartments using moderate resolution satellite imagery
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uromycladium acaciae, also known as wattle rust, is a rust fungus that has adversely impacted black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in South Africa. This study assessed the potential of the Landsat 8 multispectral sensor to detect canopy damage caused by wattle rust on two plantation farms near Richmond, KwaZulu-Natal. The Landsat 8 bands and vegetation indices detected forest canopy damage caused by Uromycladium acaciae with an accuracy of 88.24% utilising seven bands and the Partial Least Squares Discriminate Analysis (PLS-DA) algorithm. Additionally, the model was optimised using the Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) method which only selected the most influential bands in the model. The coastal aerosol band (430nm-450nm), red band (640nm-670nm), near infrared (850nm-880nm) and NDVI were exclusively used in the optimised model and an accuracy of 82.35% was produced. The study highlighted the potential of remote sensing to detect canopy damage caused by a rust fungus and contributes towards a monitoring framework for analysing trends using freely available Landsat 8 imagery.

TI  - Development of water turbidity index (WTI) and seasonal characteristics of total suspended matter (TSM) spatial distribution in Ichkeul Lake, a shallow brackish wetland, Northern-East Tunisia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The decrease of fresh water supply from connected rivers induces the reverse of gravity flow from Bizert Lagoon which increases the salinity and the total suspended matter (TSM). Therefore, multi-date MODIS images were analyzed by GIS to calculate and identify the spatial distribution of WTI, TSM indicator. Then, the relationship between wind conditions and TSM's resuspension in Ichkeul Lake was clarified. After that, the cluster analysis and the temporal fluctuation of daily wind speed; rainfall, and the Potamogeton pectinatus phenology were used to interpret the seasonal distribution of the turbid water. Consequently, the linear correlation between WTI and observed data was found (R-2=0.66; r=0.809) and proved by ANOVA test, where P=0.00143 (<=0.05). Besides, the prevailing effects of winds on turbidity were detected, where the daily mean value of WTI was positively correlated with daily wind speed with r=0.63 and r=0.65, respectively, for P1 and P2. Thus, the turbidity increases with the increase of wind velocity. Subsequently, wind speed threshold was chosen to be 2.8m/s. Moreover, the frequent wind with velocity varied between 5 and 7m/s and may exceed the 9m/s blew from the WNW direction. Added to this, the seasonal distribution of WTI revealed that the most and moderate turbid days were detected frequently in summer season. Following the prevailing wind direction, the TSM was distributed from the center of the SSE part of Ichkeul Lake.

TI  - Effects of a Public Subsidy Program for Mumps Vaccine on Reducing the Disease Burden in Nagoya City, Japan
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nagoya City initiated a public subsidy program for mumps vaccination using either the Torii or Hoshino strains in August 2010. To determine the effects of the program, we used publicly available information from Nagoya City to investigate the changes in immunization rates and numbers of patients who developed post-immunization adverse reactions, including post-vaccinal aseptic meningitis, in the 7 years since its initiation. We also investigated the numbers of mumps patients reported by sentinel sites in a national database during this period. The immunization rate in one-year-old children increased from 24.3% before the program to 91.0% after 7 years. The mean numbers of reported mumps cases per sentinel site in one-year-old to preschool children the age groups targeted by the program were 12.9 in the 7 years before the program and 4.93 in the 7 years after initiation of the program, showing a significant decrease of 1/2.6 (p = 0.01). The number of vaccinations during the 6.5-year period was 140,316, with only one case of aseptic meningitis reported (0.7 cases/100,000 vaccinations). No other serious adverse reactions were observed. The present findings demonstrate that the public subsidy program in Nagoya City is an effective and safe measure against mumps in children.

TI  - Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis in equines in the northwest region of Parana
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis are diseases that may affect man and domestic and wild animals. They also have wide geographical distributions and thus cause large public health issues. The objective of the current study was to conduct leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis seroepideiniology in horses used for animal traction in small rural propertiesof the municipality of Umuarama. in northwest region of the state of Parana, Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 312 horses from 87 small farms. Microscopic agglutination tests (MAT) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis were performed on sera to detect leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis, respectively. These were performed in conjunction with an epidemiological questionnaire. The MAT results included 180 (57.69%) samples that were considered reactive with titers between 100 and 12800 for one or more serovars. Thirty-three (10.57%) samples subjected to IT were considered reactive, with titers ranging between 64 and 1024. From the analyzed variables, contact with wild animals (p= 0.012) and animal exchange between properties (p = 0.004) were associated with toxoplasma infection. The study revealed that horses in the northwestern region of Parana were exposed to Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii, with an insignificant implication of the animals' clinical condition; however, since it is possible for animals to transmit infection to other animals as well as humans via the intermittent shedding of leptospires through urine into the environment, it may be considered a problem of one health. As for the presence of T. gondii antibodies, these horses played the role of sentinel of the infection. Environmental sanitation measures, serological studies of herds, control of rodents and felids on properties, and the dissemination of information about these diseases are relevant for disease control at the study site.

TI  - Comparison of four UAV georeferencing methods for environmental monitoring purposes focusing on the combined use with airborne and satellite remote sensing platforms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This work is aimed at the environmental remote sensing community that uses UAV optical frame imagery in combination with airborne and satellite data. Taking into account the economic costs involved and the time investment, we evaluated the fit-for-purpose accuracy of four positioning methods of UAV-acquired imagery: 1) direct georeferencing using the onboard raw GNSS (GNSSNAV) data, 2) direct georeferencing using Post Processed Kinematic single-frequency carrier-phase without in situ ground support (PPK1), 3) direct georeferencing using Post-Processed Kinematic double-frequency carrier-phase GNSS data with in situ ground support (PPK2), and 4) indirect georeferencing using Ground Control Points (GCP). We tested a multispectral sensor and an RGB sensor, onboard multicopter platforms. Orthophotomosaics at < 0.05 m spatial resolution were generated with photogrammetric software. The UAV image absolute accuracy was evaluated according to the ASPRS standards, wherein we used a set of GCPs as reference coordinates, which we surveyed with a differential GNSS static receiver. The raw onboard GNSSNAV solution yielded horizontal (radial) accuracies of RMSEr <= 1.062 m and vertical accuracies of RMSEz <= 4.209 m; PPK1 solution gave decimetric accuracies of RMSEr <= 0.256 m and RMSEz <= 0.238 m; PPK2 solution, gave centimetric accuracies of RMSEr <= 0.036 m and RMSEz <= 0.036 m. These results were further improved by using the GCP solution, which yielded accuracies of RMSEr <= 0.023 m and RMSEz <= 0.030 m. GNSSNAV solution is a fast and low-cost option that is useful for UAV imagery in combination with remote sensing products, such as Sentinel-2 satellite data. PPK1, which can register UAV imagery with remote sensing products up to 0.25 m pixel size, as WorldView-like satellite imagery, airborne lidar or orthoimagery, has a higher economic cost than the GNSSNAV solution. PPK2 is an acceptable option for registering remote sensing products of up to 0.05 m pixel size, as with other UAV images. Moreover, PPK2 can obtain accuracies that are approximate to the usual UAV pixel size (e.g. co-register in multitemporal studies), but it is more expensive than PPK1. Although indirect georeferencing can obtain the highest accuracy, it is nevertheless a time-consuming task, particularly if many GCPs have to be placed. The paper also provides the approximate cost of each solution.

TI  - Early estimation of the wheat crop yield in irrigation district 038, Rio Mayo, Sonora, Mexico
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Irrigation District No. 38, Rio Mayo, in the state of Sonora, Mexico, wheat cultivation represents around 70 % of the area under irrigation (around 68,000 ha), so several studies have been performed with the aim of relating the crop yields with values of the NDVI index obtained from images by satellites Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Deimos, as well as with estimations of evapotranspiration of the crops (ETc), evaluated through two methods, with the ETc = K-cb* ETr relation (ETr, Reference evapotranspiration), where Kcb is estimated as a function of the NVDI index, and through the MATRIC moisture balance method. Specifically, for the early estimation, a relationship between the yield and the value obtained with the NDVI index during the crop's flowering has been considered, a time when it generally achieves its highest value and because there are enough antecedents in the literature, among them studies performed by the International Water Management Institute and "Colegio de Postgraduados", which stand out. However, this NDVI value is not enough for the estimation, so the value accumulated from heat units can be used, as will be shown in this article. On the other hand, in order to communicate the conditions of their crops to agricultural producers, viewers have been built, accessible through the Internet or local networks. Also, as part of the PLEIADeS and SIRIUS projects, financed by the European Commission, where the authors collaborate, the SPIDER viewer was created, which allows observing the NDVI and ETc values in each plot, although there are others, one designed by one of the authors and another by a doctoral student from Colegio de Postgraduados; the latter is installed in the Irrigation District. To calibrate the methodology proposed in estimating the probable yield, operations staff from the irrigation district performed measurements of the yields in several plots, with the objective of finding a function between the yields and the NDVI values during the crop's flowering.

TI  - Evaluation of 3B42V7 and IMERG daily-precipitation products for a very high-precipitation region in northwestern South America
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of water is critical in determining the distribution of species by favoring or limiting their development, and leading to the formation of different ecosystems. Thus, analyzing the trends and fluctuations of the precipitation is a key factor to understanding our planet's biodiversity. Different physical conditions exist in northwestern South America that cause extreme climate conditions, especially on the west coast of the continent. This region, known as Biogeographic Choco, has high annual precipitation caused by interactions between the humid currents of the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains. A limited network of hydro -meteorological stations are available in the region to monitor precipitation. Satellite precipitation products can provide valuable information in the absence of field stations, complementing the network of field stations in remote areas, and completing time series for stations that have stopped working. However, remote sensing data must be validated before being used. The goal of this study is thus to evaluate the accuracy of the products of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42V7 and the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), under very high precipitation conditions, and evaluate their strengths and shortcomings. These programs provide daily-precipitation information with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees for the former and 0.1 degrees for the latter. The validation was done by using a time series of daily-precipitation data obtained from 185 hydro meteorological stations distributed over the Biogeographic Choco. Different statistic metrics were used in the evaluation and comparison: error metrics (mean difference MD, relative mean difference RMD, and root mean square error RMSE), a correlation metric (Pearson correlation CP), contingency metrics (probability of detection POD, false-alarm ratio FAR, and critical success index CSI). We also evaluate the grid and areal scale. The results show that (i) the 3B42V7 and IMERG daily-precipitation products represent well the spatial and temporal distribution of mean daily precipitation over the Biographic Choco, and both products are accurate for detecting precipitation events. (ii) Mean daily precipitation tends to be overestimated in areas with relative low precipitation and medium-to-high altitude whereas, on the contrary, mean daily precipitation tends to be underestimated in areas with very high precipitation and medium-to-low altitude. (iii) Finally, copious precipitation (i.e., an annual accumulated precipitation over 5000 mm, which is common for over 55% of the study area) strongly affects the accuracy of the satellite products, leading to significant errors in estimates of daily precipitation for some regions. This study constitutes one of the first exhaustive validation of the IMERG daily precipitation product over the Biogeographic Choco, and the results provide important information about the potential for using this product in the study area and over regions with high precipitation.

TI  - MODIS snowline elevation changes during snowmelt runoff events in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates MODIS snow cover characteristics for large number of snowmelt runoff events in 145 catchments from 9 countries in Europe. The analysis is based on open discharge daily time series from the Global Runoff Data Center database and daily MODIS snow cover data. Runoff events are identified by a base flow separation approach. The MODIS snow cover characteristics are derived from Terra 500 m observations (MOD10A1 dataset, V005) in the period 2000-2015 and include snow cover area, cloud coverage, regional snowline elevation (RSLE) and its changes during the snowmelt runoff events. The snowmelt events are identified by using estimated RSLE changes during a runoff event. The results indicate that in the majority of catchments there are between 3 and 6 snowmelt runoff events per year. The mean duration between the start and peak of snowmelt runoff events is about 3 days and the proportion of snowmelt events in all runoff events tends to increase with the maximum elevation of catchments. Clouds limit the estimation of snow cover area and RSLE, particularly for dates of runoff peaks. In most of the catchments, the median of cloud coverage during runoff peaks is larger than 80%. The mean minimum RSLE, which represents the conditions at the beginning of snowmelt events, is situated approximately at the mean catchment elevation. It means that snowmelt events do not start only during maximum snow cover conditions, but also after this maximum. The mean RSLE during snowmelt peaks is on average 170 m lower than at the start of the snowmelt events, but there is a large regional variability.

TI  - Mapping Agricultural Landuse Patterns from Time Series of Landsat 8 Using Random Forest Based Hierarchial Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increase in irrigated area, driven by demand for more food production, in the semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa is putting pressure on the already strained available water resources. To cope and manage this situation, monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of the irrigated area land use at basin level is needed to ensure proper allocation of water. Publicly available satellite data at high spatial resolution and advances in remote sensing techniques offer a viable opportunity. In this study, we developed a new approach using time series of Landsat 8 (L8) data and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm by introducing a hierarchical post-processing scheme to extract key Land Use Land Cover (LULC) types. We implemented this approach for Mashhad basin in Iran to develop a LULC map at 15 m spatial resolution with nine classes for the crop year 2015/2016. In addition, five irrigated land use types were extracted for three crop years2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016using the RF models. The total irrigated area was estimated at 1796.16 km(2), 1581.7 km(2) and 1578.26 km(2) for the cropping years 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016, respectively. The overall accuracy of the final LULC map was 87.2% with a kappa coefficient of 0.85. The methodology was implemented using open data and open source libraries. The ability of the RF models to extract key LULC types at basin level shows the usability of such approaches for operational near real time monitoring.

TI  - A Novel Sharpening Approach for Superresolving Multiresolution Optical Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to provide a compact superresolution formulation specific for multispectral (MS) multiresolution optical data, i.e., images characterized by different scales across different spectral bands. The proposed method, named multiresolution sharpening approach (MuSA), relies on the solution of an optimization problem tailored to the properties of those images. The superresolution problem is formulated as the minimization of an objective function containing a data-fitting term that models the blurs and downsamplings of the different bands and a patch-based regularizer that promotes image self-similarity guided by the geometric details provided by the high-resolution bands. By exploiting the approximately low-rank property of the MS data, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem in hand is strongly reduced, thus sharply improving its conditioning. The state-of-the-art color block-matching and 3D filtering (C-BM3D) image denoiser is used as a patch-based regularizer by leveraging the "plug-and-play" framework: the denoiser is plugged into the iterations of the alternating direction method of multipliers. The main novelties of the proposed method are: 1) the introduction of an observation model tailored to the specific properties of (MS) multiresolution images and 2) the exploitation of the high-spatial-resolution bands to guide the grouping step in the color block-matching and 3D filtering (C-BM3D) denoiser, which constitutes a form of regularization learned from the high-resolution channels. The results obtained on the real and synthetic Sentinel 2 data sets give an evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Seasonal variations of eddies in North Indian Ocean using wind data and satellite altimetry
T2  - RESEARCH IN MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying surface current fluctuations on a monthly basis in an oceanic area, it is possible to recognize the manner of pollutant accumulations, sea fronts, and ocean eddies' propagations. Investigation of eddies as important factors in horizontal ocean mixing is also essential because of their influence on biological population in the sea, the transfer and distribution of heat and salinity, and the ocean heat exchange with the atmosphere. Observations show that the sea surface current is usually controlled by two factors including: Ekman component (wind driven) and geostrophic parameter (due to the changes in mean sea level). Because direct field measurements for ocean currents are difficult and time consuming, the monthly OSCAR satellite data for the Indian Ocean are used for a period of three years, to map current vectors that are illustrated in the ArcMap software. Indexed eddies for each season are identified and their characteristics are investigated. The results show that the eddies formed in summer and autumn have the higher speeds with maximum value of about 1.3 m/s of the Somali Coast and less energetic ones are formed over the other vast oceanic areas. While the ones created in winter have maximum velocity of about 1.5 m/s and also the currents with intermediate-scale have a velocity of 0.7 m/s.

TI  - Spatiotemporal remote sensing of ecosystem change and causation across Alaska
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary climate change in Alaska has resulted in amplified rates of press and pulse disturbances that drive ecosystem change with significant consequences for socio-environmental systems. Despite the vulnerability of Arctic and boreal landscapes to change, little has been done to characterize landscape change and associated drivers across northern high-latitude ecosystems. Here we characterize the historical sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbances using expert knowledge, remote sensing data, and spatiotemporal analyses and modeling. Time-series analysis of moderate-and high-resolution imagery was used to characterize land- and water-surface dynamics across Alaska. Some 430,000 interpretations of ecological and geomorphological change were made using historical air photos and satellite imagery, and corroborate land-surface greening, browning, and wetness/moisture trend parameters derived from peak-growing season Landsat imagery acquired from 1984 to 2015. The time series of change metrics, together with climatic data and maps of landscape characteristics, were incorporated into a modeling framework for mapping and understanding of drivers of change throughout Alaska. According to our analysis, approximately 13% (similar to 174,000 +/- 8700 km(2)) of Alaska has experienced directional change in the last 32 years (+/- 95% confidence intervals). At the ecoregions level, substantial increases in remotely sensed vegetation productivity were most pronounced in western and northern foothills of Alaska, which is explained by vegetation growth associated with increasing air temperatures. Significant browning trends were largely the result of recent wildfires in interior Alaska, but browning trends are also driven by increases in evaporative demand and surface-water gains that have predominately occurred over warming permafrost landscapes. Increased rates of photosynthetic activity are associated with stabilization and recovery processes following wildfire, timber harvesting, insect damage, thermokarst, glacial retreat, and lake infilling and drainage events. Our results fill a critical gap in the understanding of historical and potential future trajectories of change in northern high-latitude regions.

TI  - Post-marketing studies of pharmaceutical opioid abuse-deterrent formulations: a framework for research design and reporting
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Opioid formulations with properties to deter abuse (abuse-deterrent formulations; ADFs) have been developed as one response to the prescription opioid 'epidemic'. As for all medicines, ADFs undergo evaluation of safety and efficacy prior to registration for marketing. However, reduced extra-medical use (the primary intended outcome of ADFs and reason for their introduction) can only be established in post-marketing observational studies, comparing them to opioid formulations without abuse-deterrent properties. This has implications for various features of study design and analysis. We discuss proposals for the design, conduct, governance and reporting of post-marketing studies on the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and opioid ADFs. Methods A review of current guidance documents, public work-shops and forums and our own experience with post-marketing studies of ADFs. Results and conclusions Research questions for post-marketing studies on ADFs of opioids should reasonably be framed around detecting any probable intended or unintended clinical and/or meaningful changes in specific aspects of extra-medical use (e.g. injection use) and harms. Outcomes reported by prevalence and frequency of occurrence and disaggregated by specific product and route of administration can illustrate the magnitude of ADF impact. We argue that a multi-faceted approach is required, using data from both general population and sentinel high-risk cohorts and from primary and secondary data sources. The comparator (historical non-ADF formulation of that opioid, equivalent current generic or similar opioid product), duration of monitoring and analytical approach require justification and should be sufficient to add weight to conclusions of causality. To maximize transparency, we recommend explicit declarations of funding and conflict of interest, establishment of an advisory committee, publication of study protocol and access to study results.

TI  - Estimating soil salinity from remote sensing and terrain data in southern Xinjiang Province, China
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Pedometrics Conference
CL  - Wageningen, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the main reasons for soil health and ecosystem deterioration in most degraded arid and semiarid areas. To monitor its spatial variation as precise as possible over a large area, we collected 225 samples using traditional field experiment and laboratory analysis method from the southern part of the Xinjiang Province, China, affected by soil salinity under strong arid climate. Then, we constructed both Cubist and partial least square regression (PLSR) models on electrical conductivity (EC) (150 ground-based measurements as calibration set) using various related covariates (e.g. terrain attributes, remotely sensed spectral indices of vegetation and salinity from landsat8 OLI satellite) that are at the same time period corresponding to soil sampling. Two models were validated using remaining 75 independent ground based measurements and were then used to map the soil salinity over the study area. Finally, the validation results of two models were compared under different intervals of EC, soil moisture content and vegetation coverage. The results indicated that Cubist model could predict EC value with better accuracy and stability under variable environment than PLSR. The R-2, RMSE, MAE and RPD of the Cubist model were 0.91, 5.18 dS m(-1), 3.76 dS m(-1) and 3.15 while corresponding values of the PLSR model were 0.66, 10.46 dS m(-1), 8.21 dS m(-1) and 1.56 in validation dataset, respectively. Additionally, the map derived from Cubist model revealed more detailed variation information of the spatial distribution of EC than that from PLSR model across the study area. Thus, Cubist model was recommended for mapping soil salinity using indices derived from satellite and terrain in other arid areas.

TI  - The sensitivity of snow ephemerality to warming climate across an arid to montane vegetation gradient
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifts from longer seasonal snowpacks to shorter, ephemeral snowpacks (snowpacks that persist for <60days) due to climate change will alter the timing and rates of water availability. Ephemeral snowmelt has less predictable timing and lowers soil water availability during the growing season. The Great Basin, United States is an ideal system to study snow ephemerality across a broad climate gradient. To identify the climatic controls on snow ephemerality, we analysed moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-covered products from water years 2001-2015 using an object-based mapping approach and a random forest model. Winter temperature and precipitation were the most influential variables on the maximum snow duration. We predict that warming the average winter air temperature by 2 and 4 degrees C would reduce the areal extent of seasonal snow by 14.7 and 47.8%, respectively (8.8% of the Great Basin's areal extent is seasonal in the historical record), with shifts to ephemeral snowpack concentrated in lower elevations and warmer regions. The combination of warming and interannual precipitation variability (i.e., reductions of 25%) had different effects on vegetation types. Vegetation types that have had consistent seasonal snow cover in their historical record are likely to have lower resilience to a new hydrologic regime, with earlier and more intermittent snowmelt causing a longer but drier growing season. Implications of increased snow ephemerality on vegetation productivity and susceptibility to disturbance will depend on local topography, subsurface water storage, and physiological adaptations. Nevertheless, patterns found in this study can help target management intervention to species that are most at risk.

TI  - The light-deficient climates of western Central African evergreen forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall thresholds under which forests grow in Central Africa are lower than those of Amazonia and southeast Asia. Attention is thus regularly paid to rainfall whose seasonality and interannual variability has been shown to control Central African forests' water balance and photosynthetic activity. Nonetheless, light availability is also recognized as a key factor to tropical forests. Therefore this study aims to explore the light conditions prevailing across Central Africa, and their potential impact on forests' traits. Using satellite estimates of hourly irradiance, we find first that the four main types of diurnal cycles of irradiance extracted translate into different levels of rainfall, evapotranspiration, direct and diffuse light. Then accounting for scale interactions between the diurnal and annual cycles, we show that the daily quantity and quality of light considerably vary across Central African forests during the annual cycle: the uniqueness of western Central Africa and Gabon in particular, with strongly light-deficient climates especially during the main dry season, points out. Lastly, using an original map of terra firme forests, we also show that most of the evergreen forests are located in western Central Africa and Gabon. We postulate that despite mean annual precipitation below 2000 mm yr(-1), the light-deficient climates of western Central Africa can harbour evergreen forests because of an extensive low-level cloudiness developing during the June-September main dry season, which strongly reduces the water demand and enhances the quality of light available for tree photosynthesis. These findings pave the way for further analyses of the past and future changes in the light-deficient climates of western Central Africa and the vulnerability of evergreen forests to these changes.

AB  - Alarm fatigue is the most common contributing factor in alarm-related sentinel events. Researchers have demonstrated a 35% overuse of telemetry, a key factor in alarm fatigue. This project evaluates practice patterns for the ordering and discontinuation of telemetry on medical-surgical units. Practice patterns were reviewed to determine if they aligned with the American Heart Association evidence-based practice guidelines for telemetry monitoring and whether the order indication was congruent with the patient's clinical status. Nurse's attitudes and practices related to alarm safety were evaluated.

TI  - Assessing wellness in the well-child check What about social and emotional development?
T2  - CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine whether Canadian children aged 4 to 6 received well-child checks; to explore the nature of these checkups in a large family practice; and to examine the merit of using parent questionnaires about child resilience as a means of introducing a discussion about social and emotional development into this checkup.Design Three-part mixed-methods study, using data derived from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), chart reviews of a family practice, and semistructured interviews with parents.Setting Primary care practices associated with CPCSSN, and a large primary care practice in Kingston, Ont.Participants Patients who were born between 2008 and 2011, and a sample of parents whose children were between the ages of 6 and 9.Methods International Classification of Diseases, version 9, codes from CPCSSN records were used to identify the prevalence of well-child checks in the 4-to-6 age group. Then 110 randomly selected charts from a large family practice were audited for inclusion of behavioural and social assessments of those aged 4 to 6. Finally, randomly selected parents from the same practice were invited to pilot-test the PERIK (Positive development and resilience in kindergarten) resilience questionnaire, interviewed about its merit, and asked to recall whether the identified areas of child development had been included in previous well-child checkups.Main findings Data from CPCSSN indicated that 11% of Canadian children aged 4 to 6 had had an explicit well-child check by their family physician. Among the reviewed charts from the one practice, social context was documented for 45% of them, but social and behavioural development was usually not recorded. The 42 parents interviewed found the PERIK questionnaire useful, but not perfect, for opening discussions about aspects of child development that they had not realized were central to the child's future health.Conclusion This study offers an initial approach to exploring resilience in children and therefore addressing recognized and alterable predictors of adult well-being. Early social and emotional development predicts resilience that, in turn, foreshadows future health. The PERIK questionnaire facilitated discussions that could add tremendous value to the well-child checks of children aged 4 to 6.

TI  - Anagnorisis and narrative incorporation: How significant incidents affect language-learning behavior
T2  - STUDIES IN SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines how fleeting experiences exert a disproportionately powerful effect on the language learning motivation and behavior of university students. A thematic analysis of interview data is used to show how significant incidents have two principal consequences. The first, anagnorisis, is an immediate, revelatory change in beliefs about language learning. The second, narrative incorporation, is a process through which the memory of the incident and/or its anagnorisis becomes a constituent of self-narratives. It is argued that the significant incident is best understood not as an external influence on motivation, but as a component of the learner's worldview.

TI  - Deep religion: policy as faith in Kinnock's Labour Party
T2  - BRITISH POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shorn of a coherent theoretical basis for the party's socialism, some of the Labour Party's policies become emblematic of the party's worldview. While Labour's commitment to public ownership has long been considered in this way, comprehension of how the party's 'nostalgia' or 'traditions' affect the party's trajectory could be aided by a better understanding of why certain policies become so deeply rooted. This article contributes to the existing literature on this topic in two ways. First, in expanding upon Henry Drucker's concept of ethos, it seeks to establish a framework for understanding why some policies become tantamount to faith in the Labour Party. Second, using this frame, it analyses how Kinnock successfully changed a symbolic policy, working within and through Labour's ethos. This article explores policy characteristics that combine to make a policy emblematic of Labour's ideology: a strong socialist heritage; a stark contrast with the Conservative opposition; an adhesive quality which can bind Labour people together and relevance to internal factionalism. As the current Labour leadership consolidates its power, this article also suggests that, while long-dormant, policies such as unilateralism retain their potency and may once again form a part of Labour's platform.

TI  - Vertical land motion and relative sea level changes along the coastline of Brest (France) from combined space-borne geodetic methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of the recent advances and the current perspectives of satellite radar altimetry to reach the coastline and monitor coastal sea level changes, this space-borne technology remains geocentric by essence. In contrast, the quantity that matters for coastal management and society is relative sea level. That is, the sea level relative to the land, as measured by conventional tide gauges. However, two important issues are associated with the use of tide gauges. First, supplemental information is required to separate vertical land motion from ocean climate signals in tide gauge records, and hence to understand the causes of future coastal sea level changes and their relative importance. This can be provided by space-borne geodetic techniques, for instance installing a permanent Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna at the tide gauge. Second, vertical land motion can show local spatial patterns, which limits the spatial validity of the point-wise information at the GPS station. Using Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and high-precision GPS data, the above-mentioned limitations were addressed in the case study of Brest (France). Our findings show that, over the past decades, Brest and its surroundings are overall stable, in agreement with the geological setting, except for the embankment areas of the commercial and military harbours. The GPS-calibrated InSAR results were then further combined with geocentric satellite radar altimetry data to obtain relative sea level trends along the Brest coastline with an unprecedented high-spatial resolution of 200 m. Our approach is applicable beyond the case study of Brest, especially in coastal areas where tide gauge data are not available, provided satellite data are.

TI  - Extent of lymphadenectomy and postoperative major complications among women with endometrial cancer treated with minimally invasive surgery
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with endometrial cancer, sentinel lymphadenectomy is used to accurately prognosticate extent of disease, and has been proposed as a method to decrease the incidence of medical and surgical complications associated with more extensive lymphadenectomy. It is unknown whether patients who undergo traditional lymphadenectomy experience major postoperative complications at the same rates as those who undergo sentinel lymphadenectomy or those who do not undergo lymphadenectomy.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of major postoperative complications among endometrial cancer patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy with traditional lymphadenectomy vs sentinel or no lymphadenectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy recorded in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database between 2015 and 2016 were identified using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Primary exposure was extent of lymphadenectomy. The primary outcome was major postoperative complications as defined by the Clavien - Dindo scale. Associations were examined with bivariable tests and multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 3282 women with endometrial cancer who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy were identified; of these, 2049 (62.4%) did not undergo lymphadenectomy, 1089 (33.2%) underwent traditional lymphadenectomy, and 144 (4.4%) underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy. Traditional lymphadenectomy had the highest rate of major complications (3.6%) compared with sentinel lymphadenectomy (2.0%) and no lymphadenectomy (2.0%) (P = .03). Patients who underwent traditional lymphadenectomy also had the longest operating room times and procedures that were most surgically complex (171 minutes, 30.6 relative value units [RVU]) compared with patients who underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy (166 minutes, 24.9 RVU) or no lymphadenectomy (141 minutes, 15.0 RVU) (all P < .001). Patients who underwent traditional lymphadenectomy had nearly twice the odds of a major complication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2e2.9) and need for readmission (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.4) compared to those who underwent sentinel or no lymphadenectomy. The incidence of readmission after traditional lymphadenectomy was higher (4.6%) than after sentinel lymphadenectomy (1.4%) and no lymphadenectomy (2.2%) (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Sentinel lymphadenectomy among patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer was associated with a decreased incidence of major postoperative complications and need for readmission when compared with traditional lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Assessment of fish community structure along the Jakarta Bay-Pulau Seribu reef complex
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems have been increasingly subjected to poor water quality. Remote sensing has been used to monitor water quality, but few studies have integrated remotely sensed data with compositional and/or abundance data of coral reef taxa. In the present study, fish biomass was assessed along the Jakarta Bay Thousand Island reef system and variation in the biomass of selected fish families related to substrate cover and remotely sensed data. Overall, fish biomass and the biomass of each of the families Acanthuridae, Apogonidae, Caesionidae, Chaetodontidae, Ephippidae, Pomacentridae, Labridae and the subfamily Scaridae were much higher mid- and offshore than inshore. Substrate cover and chlorophyll-a concentrations proved to be significant predictors of spatial variation in fish biomass, suggesting an important impact of reef degradation and eutrophication on reef fish abundance.

MODIS-Aqua-derived SST and chlorophyll data are used to develop seasonal nitrate maps for the period of 2002-2017. Seasonally developed nitrate images were validated for the year 2013 with corresponding in situ datasets, and the validation of this nitrate model provides the statistically significant relationship for postmonsoon (R-2 = 0.612), summer (R-2 = 0.535), premonsoon (R-2 = 0.554) and monsoon (R-2 = 0.533) seasons. The seasonal SST, chlorophyll a, nitrate and wind speed images depict the clear seasonal pattern between the seasons without any abrupt increase or decrease in trend observed during all these years. This was also confirmed by the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks with a statistical significance (P = < 0.001) between the seasons. From the results, this is a clear indication that the nitrate concentration is under the natural control without any anthropogenic contaminations.

T2  - AI MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The intelligence explosion hypothesis (for example, a technological singularity) is roughly the hypothesis that accelerating knowledge and technological growth radically changes humanity. While 20th-century figures are commonly credited as the first discoverers of the hypothesis, I assert that Nicolas de Condorcet, the 18th-century mathematician, is the earliest to (1) mathematically model an intelligence explosion, and (2) present an accelerating historical worldview, and (3) make intelligence explosion predictions that were restated centuries later. Condorcet provides insights on how ontology and social choice can help resolve value alignment.

TI  - Simulation of satellite reflectance data using high-frequency ground based hyperspectral canopy measurements for in-season estimation of grain yield and grain nitrogen status in winter wheat
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing allows the assessment of biomass and grain yield of cereals. An enhanced potential to detect specific traits is offered by proximal hyperspectral sensing, in contrast the potential of satellite remote sensing might still be leveraged up seen the degree of spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, hyperspectral satellite data are still not readily available for most agricultural applications and ground truth validation done at high frequency throughout the season remains scarce. Here, we simulate multispectral satellite data through resampling ground based hyperspectral reflection (400-1000 nm). Spectral data were collected at 3 nm resolution at high temporal frequency during 5-14 growth stages over three winter wheat growing seasons for investigating the influence of year and seasonality. The field experiment comprised 24 different genotypes, which varied in morphology and phenology, grown at varying nitrogen application and additionally by varying the sowing time and fungicide intensity during the third season. Ground based reflectance data were resampled to fit the spectral resolution of the satellite sensors Landsat-8, Quickbird, RapidEye, WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2. The resulting spectral bands were used for calculating all possible normalized difference vegetation indices, which were correlated to grain yield, grain N uptake and grain N concentration. The index performance depended substantially on the growth stages and years. For grain yield, maximum linear relationships (R-2) obtained from hyperspectral sensing over the season ranged from 0.65 in 2017 to 0.88 in 2015 compared to 0.40 to 0.79 for the best simulated multispectral sensor, Sentinel-2. In most cases, indices performed better for grain N uptake and less well for grain N concentration. Typically, correlations peaked at early to medium grain filling but decreased around ear emergence. Index performance from multispectral compared to hyperspectral data decreased over time during grain filling. The sensor ranking remained consistent with Sentinel-2 followed by Worldview-2 and RapidEye clearly outperforming the other sensors. Advantages are attributed to the red edge band for N-related traits and the better coverage of the NIR range between 800 and 1000 nm by the Sentinel-2. The results can possibly be extrapolated to the application of UAV and satellite sensing by elucidating optimized measurement stages and enhancing spectral properties of sensors.

TI  - A framework to quantify impacts of elevated CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration, global warming and leaf area changes on seasonal variations of water resources on a river basin scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With concerns about future catastrophic disasters, elevated CO2 concentration (eCO(2)), global warming and vegetation changes have received much attention globally. In recent years, studies have suggested controlling climate change should be based on regional impacts. However, regional quantitative assessments of respective and combination influences of CO2, temperature and vegetation variations on water resources remain limited. To address this issue, a comprehensive framework is developed. This framework integrates a dynamic vegetation simulation approach, a biosphere hydrological model and a variance-based sensitivity analysis approach which enables identification of predominant influential factors including their combinations. A medium-sized river basin in northeast China is used to illustrate the application based on different CO2 concentration and temperature rise assumptions. Validation using MODIS products shows the proposed approach can simulate Leaf Area Index (LAI) changes well. Results show sum of the influences of LAI and temperature variations on transpiration are more than 1.6 times higher than physiological effects of eCO(2) in growing seasons, which implies more water could be transpired than conserved with eCO(2), global warming and LAI changes. Results also show runoff increases with eCO(2) and decreases with increasing temperatures, but LAI changes play a dominate role in runoff decrease in hot summer. Therefore, considering LAI changes is of utmost importance in projections of future water resources, and severity of future water shortage could be underestimated if LAI changes are neglected. This research is useful in gaining insights into the complicated impacts of eCO(2), global warming and LAI changes on regional water security and sustainability.

TI  - Temporal-spatial differences in lake water storage changes and their links to climate change throughout the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Change in lake water storage is an important factor influencing hydrological cycle, regional environment, and climate on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) because of the large number (> 1000 lakes) and huge areas ( > 46,500 km(2)) of lakes. Due to the lack of in situ lake level monitoring for most lakes, and long-term continuous satellite altimetry data for some large lakes, estimates of water storage changes for all lakes throughout the TP over a long time is challenging. We have estimated the lake water storage changes of 315 lakes (each lake is > 10 km(2)) during the period of 1976-2013 through an empirical equation based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data and Landsat images. These lakes are located within endorheic basins and occupied approximately 80% of the total lake surface areas of the TP in 2013 based on the results of this study and Zhang et al. (2014). The results showed that the lake water storage decreased by 23.69 Gt from 1976 to 1990 and increased by 140.8 Gt from 1990 to 2013. Increased water storage was mainly concentrated in the central TP (regions A) and northern TP (region B). The increase in total lake surface area during the period 2000-2013 in region B (1981.6 km(2)) was greater than that in region A (1869.1 km(2)), but the increase in the water storage in the former was half of that in the latter, indicating that lake surface area changes cannot represent the degree of lake water storage change due to differences in the topography and lake size. Although the total variation in the rate of the lake water storage change (7.19 Gt/y) was similar to the rate of increase in the mass (7 +/- 7 Gt/y) estimated from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for the whole region, the spatial distribution of these variations was largely different. During the period 2000-2013, a trend analysis revealed that precipitation was perhaps the primary reason for lake change throughout the TP, while a decreasing evaporation rate only contributed approximately 1.5%, 2.5% and 1.7% to the expansions of the lakes in regions A, C and D respectively. However, based on modern glacier mass balance observation data, we estimated that glacial meltwater may have contributed 22.2%, 39.8%, 50.6% and 100% to the increasing water storage during the period 2000-2013 by rough estimates in regions A, B, C and D, respectively, indicating that glacial meltwater perhaps was a primary contributor to lake expansion in region D, which was located in an extremely cold and dry climate with a broad distribution of glaciers.

TI  - Varicella vaccine effectiveness over 10 years in Australia; moderate protection from 1-dose program
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To examine the impact of Australia's single dose infant varicella vaccination program, we assessed single dose varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing hospitalised disease using two methods.Methods: Clinically confirmed varicella cases from the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) sentinel network were age-matched to 20 controls obtained from the Australian Immunisation Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate VE and compared with estimates obtained using our second approach.Results: There were 78 hospitalised varicella cases during the post vaccine introduction period from January 2008 to December 2015, who were eligible for funded varicella vaccination. Median age at onset was 4.5 years and more than half (59%) were vaccinated. The majority of children received one vaccine brand (Varilrix, GSK). The estimated case-control VE for one dose of vaccine against hospitalised varicella was 64.7% (95% CI: 43.3-78.0%); estimates using the screening method were not significantly different. Exclusion of children who were immunocompromised did not significantly alter VE estimates.Conclusions: Although Australia's program has impacted on the burden of varicella disease, single dose VE against varicella hospitalisation is only moderate. Greater reductions in varicella disease could potentially be achieved by incorporation of a second vaccine dose into the program to minimise breakthrough disease and interrupt virus circulation.

TI  - The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) from MODIS and global biodiversity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data can help to identify both suitable habitat for individual species, and environmental conditions that foster species richness, which is important when predicting how biodiversity will respond to global change. The question is how to summarize remotely sensed data so that they are most relevant for biodiversity analyses, and the Dynamic Habitat Indices are three metrics designed for this. Our goals here were to a) derive, for the first time, the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) globally, and b) use these to evaluate three hypotheses (available energy, environmental stress, and environmental stability) that attempt to explain global variation in species richness of amphibians, birds, and mammals. The three DHIs summarize three key measures of vegetative productivity: a) annual cumulative productivity, which we used to evaluate the available energy hypothesis that more energy is associate with higher species richness; b) minimum productivity throughout the year, which we used to evaluate the environmental stress hypothesis that higher minima cause higher species richness, and c) seasonality, expressed as the annual coefficient of variation in productivity, which we used to evaluate the environmental stability hypothesis that less intra-annual variability causes higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs globally at 1-km resolution from MODIS vegetation products (NDVI, EVI, LAI, fPAR, and GPP), based on the median of the good observations of all years from the entire MODIS record for each of the 23 or 46 possible dates (8- vs. 16-day composites) during the year, and calculated species richness for three taxa (amphibians, birds, and mammals) at 110-km resolution from species range maps from the IUCN Red List. We found marked global patterns of the DHIs, and strong support for all three hypotheses. The three DHIs for a given vegetation product were well correlated (Spearman rank correlations ranging from -0.6 (cumulative vs. variation DHIs) to -0.93 (variation vs. minimum DHI)). Similarly, DHI components derived from different MODIS vegetation products were well correlated (0.8-0.9), and correlations of the DHIs with temperature and precipitation were moderate and strong respectively. All three DHIs were well correlated with species richness, showing in ranked order positive correlations for cumulative DHI based on GPP (Spearman rank correlations of 0.75, 0.63, and 0.67 for amphibians, resident birds, and mammals respectively) and minimum DHI (0.73, 0.83, and 0.62), and negative for variation DHI (-0.69, -0.83, and -0.59). Multiple linear models of all three DHIs explained 67%, 65%, and 61% of the variability in species richness of amphibians, resident birds, and mammals, respectively. The DHIs, which are closely related to well-established ecological hypotheses of biodiversity, can predict species richness well, and are promising for application in biodiversity science and conservation.

TI  - Assessment on surface energy imbalance and energy partitioning using ground and satellite data over a semi-arid agricultural region in north China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The processes of surface energy and water exchange are significantly necessary to the forming and evolution of regional climate. The most critical issues and challenges are 1) dynamics of surface energy balance components, 2) the surface energy imbalance problem, which is still unsolved and 3) energy partitioning in an ecosystem. This study assessed the seasonal and annual variations of the surface energy fluxes, the surface energy balance closure (EBC), the reasons behind the surface energy imbalance, and energy partitioning based on the two years (2014-2015) flux observation datasets over a semi-arid agricultural region in north China. The estimation of surface fluxes was also examined using satellite data. The EBC analysis was carried out using the ordinary least square (01.5) regression model of the dependent turbulent fluxes against the independently available energy and the energy balance ratio (EBR). The results revealed that the EBC ranged from 0.63 to 0.78 at all respects with an overall EBC of 0.74, and the daily EBC was better than 30-min averages. The identified main reasons behind this imbalance were 1) the ignorance of the heat storage terms (soil and canopy), which improved the EBC by approximately 7%; 2) the vegetation and surface heterogeneity negatively affected the EBR; and 3) the occurrence of advection broke the energy balance by decreasing EBC. The energy partitioning was investigated using the residual method and two ratios (sensible heat flux/net radiation and latent heat flux/net radiation). The results showed that the sensible heat flux was dominating during dry periods and the latent heat flux was dominating during the wet periods, and the rate of dominance was controlled by the availability of water, vegetation dynamics and weather conditions.

TI  - Static and Seismic Bearing Capacity of Strip Footings on Sand Overlying Clay Soils
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examined the ultimate bearing capacity of a strip footing located on a two-layer substrate composed of a sandy soil on a clay layer. The analysis was conducted through discontinuity layout optimization, which is an upper bound limit analysis. This study focused on various factors contributing to the problem, i.e. sand layer internal friction angle, sand layer thickness, clay layer undrained shear strength (c(u)), unit weight of soil layers (gamma), footing width (B) and surcharge pressure (q). Failure in both soil layers was governed by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. The bearing capacity improves when there are two layers of sand-clay soil in comparison to the homogeneous clay soil. Such improvement is intensified by increasing the internal friction angle and thickness of the sand layer and surcharge pressure. The maximum improvement of the bearing capacity was found in a scenario where the entire failure zone was within the sand layer. The pseudo-static method was used to examine the seismic mode. According to the results, the higher the sand internal friction angle and lower c(u)/(gamma B), the lower the decrease in the seismic bearing capacity compared to the static mode. Furthermore, the variations of failure surface in static and seismic modes were investigated. The results obtained in this study were compared against the results of other methods, indicating good consistency.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of the trade-off and synergy relationship among ecosystem services in Poyang Lake Region, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake region is the largest freshwater lake impacted area in China. Quantitative analysis of trade-off and synergy in ecosystem service is of great significance for realizing regional sustainable development. Based on multi-source data of remote sensing, soil, meteorology and DEM , we quantitatively measured food supply service, soil conservation service and water yield service in Poyang Lake region from 2005 to 2015, and analyzed their spatiotemporal patterns and evolution characteristics. The spatial and temporal characteristics of trade-off and synergy between services on the scale of 1 kmx 1 km were analyzed by using correlation analysis , hot spot analysis and spatial mapping method. The differences of ecosystem services and their relationships in the perspective of land use were studied. The results showed that food supply service increased , soil con servation service decreased , and water yield service increased first and then decreased during the study period. In terms of spatial distribution, food supply service presented "low-high-low-high" in the northwest-southeast direction, soil conservation service was concentrated in high and low values, and water yield service was high in south and low in north. There were trade-off relationships between food supply and soil conservation, and between food supply and water yield. There was synergistic relationship between soil conservation and water yield. Moreover, the relationship between food supply and soil conservation showed a spatial pattern of synergy in northern but trade-off in southern region. There was a clear spatial trade-off between food supply and water yield , and from north to south the relationship between soil conservation and water yield existed synergy-tradeoff-synergy differentiation , like a "sandwich". Among different land use types , there was a significant synergy between cultivated land and food supply , garden land and soil conservation , water area and water yield, but trade-off relationships between construction land and three services. The relationship between food supply and soil conservation and water yield was mainly trade-off in different land use types. The relationship between soil conservation and water yield was synergy in cultivated land , garden land , grassland and construction land , but was trade-off in water and unused land. The hot spots of multiple ecosystem services in the Poyang Lake region were mainly in the eastern and southern plain areas , with a decreasing trend.

TI  - Evaluating the Responses of Streamflow under Future Climate Change Scenarios in a Western Indian Himalaya Watershed
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources in the mountain ecosystem are very important in supporting the livelihood of the population. It is crucial to assess changes in climate variables and their effect on streamflow to determine water availability in a watershed. Thus, this paper aimed to understand the changes in climate variables and their effect on streamflow in the upper Beas basin of Western Himalaya by mid-21st century. The topographical details of the basin were taken from Cartosat digital elevation model (DEM). Non-parametric methods were applied for climate variability analysis of Manali, Bhuntar and Katrain stations. The decision tree technique was applied to the Landsat image in making land use/land cover (LULC) map of the study area. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was employed to simulate the future streamflow under different climate change scenarios. SWAT was calibrated and validated using observed streamflow data of Thalout station. The study found a rise (0.31% to 14.18%) in mean annual streamflow while seasonal flow was more pronounced in pre-monsoon and monsoon in the near future. However, there would be lesser streamflow in the latter half of this century due to reduction in snow cover consequent to rise in temperature. This will adversely affect the irrigation potential and hydroelectricity generation capacity in the region.

Special attentions are given on awareness building, attitude, behavior change and action of the people towards. Data was collected through semi structured questionnaires and interviews. Landsat images of last 26 years were acquired on spatial-temporal bases for the years i.e 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2015. Supervised classification and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were used to measure the scope and thickness of vegetation. The study findings showed that during the last 26 years from 1990 to 2015, vegetation cover and barren land has been decreased 25% and 6% respectively. The agriculture land was increased about 29%. The study indicate that forest cutting, destruction of natural habitat for the agriculture purposes, hunting and killing of wild animals were the main factors in degradation of the biodiversity. In this article the present threats and challenges faced by biodiversity are highlighted. The findings of the study will be helpful for future conservation of various species in the study area.

TI  - Ground deformation due to steam cap processes at Reykjanes, SW-Iceland: effects of geothermal exploitation inferred from interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1 images 2015-2017
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Reykjanes geothermal system is a high-temperature sea water system situated in SW-Iceland. Interferometric analysis of the Sentinel-1 satellite synthetic aperture radar data has been used to determine a time-series of ground deformation induced by geothermal utilization between April 2015 and October 2017. Surface displacements have been estimated at coherent pixels, indicating a steady and linear subsidence within a subcircular bowl centred on the well field at a maximum near-vertical rate of about 25 mm yr(-1), together with horizontal contraction. The average line-of-sight displacement rates from ascending and descending tracks are inverted to determine the characteristics of the deformation source at depth, modelling the geothermal reservoir as a body of simple geometry within an elastic half-space. The results indicate a deformation source at about 1-km depth contracting at a rate of (0.7-0.9) x 10(5) m(3) yr(-1) during the 2015-2017 period. Using pressure and temperature monitoring data at 900-m depth as well as an analysis of the reservoir structure and rock properties, we infer that the recent estimated volume change can be attributed to processes in the steam cap situated in the topmost part of the geothermal reservoir, in the 800-1200 m depth range. Processes involve a combination of compaction under pressure decrease and/or thermal contraction due to cooling of the rocks within or near the steam cap. The steam cap expanded in response to a sudden pressure drop resulting from the increase in extraction of geothermal fluids for a new power plant in 2006.

TI  - Integration of persistent scatterer interferometry and ground data for landslide monitoring: the Pianello landslide (Bovino, Southern Italy)
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an example of integration of persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) and in situ measurements over a landslide in the Bovino hilltop town, in Southern Italy. First, a wide-area analysis of PSI data, derived from legacy ERS and ENVISAT SAR image time series, highlighted the presence of ongoing surface displacements over the known limits of the Pianello landslide, located at the outskirts of the Bovino municipality, in the periods 1995-1999 and 2003-2008, respectively. This prompted local authorities to install borehole inclinometers on suitable locations. Ground data collected by these sensors during the following years were then compared and integrated with more recent PSI data from a series of Sentinel-1 images, acquired from March 2014 to October 2016. The integration allows sketching a consistent qualitative model of the landslide spatial and subsurface structure, leading to a coherent interpretation of remotely sensed and ground measurements. The results were possible thanks to the synergistic operation of local authorities and remote sensing specialists, and could represent an example for best practices in environmental management and protection at the regional scale.

TI  - Hydrological complexities in irrigated agro-ecosystems with fragmented land cover types and shallow groundwater: Insights from a distributed hydrological modeling method
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological effects caused by fragmented land cover types in human-dominated agro-ecosystems are poorly understood. In this study, based on visual interpreted high-resolution land cover map, an agro-hydrological model (HYDRUS-dualKc) was used in a distributed manner to investigate the hydrological complexities caused by fragmented land cover types and shallow groundwater. An irrigation system located in the upper Yellow River basin was chosen as a case study area, where field observations were conducted in 2012 and 2013. Combined effects of vegetation, soil, irrigation and groundwater were considered. Simulations of soil moisture and soil salinity fitted well with field observations; evapotranspiration (ETa) was also comparable with remote sensing data. Results showed that the growing season ETa varied from 162 to 567 mm among the different vegetation covers with the values for crop fields usually higher than those for natural lands. The soil evaporation was obviously larger in natural land and the natural vegetation growth was seriously stressed. Through lateral groundwater exchange, the cropland functioned as a stable groundwater recharge zone while the natural land functioned as a discharge zone during the growing season. As a result, 21% of the total water diverted to Jiyuan migrated to natural lands through groundwater due to field percolation and canal seepage, along with 50-75% of the total salt introduced. The fragmented land covers and complex hydrological processes bring many challenges to remote sensing and model simulation. Future land planning and water resources management should consider the hydrological effects caused by the fragmented land cover types and the associated management strategies.

TI  - Estimating green biomass ratio with remote sensing in arid grasslands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to estimate green biomass ratio (GBR), the ratio of green aboveground biomass to total aboveground biomass, using common broad-band vegetation indices in arid grasslands due to similar spectral features between bare soil and non-photosynthetic vegetation in near-infrared (NIR) and visible bands. We evaluated the performance of the broad-band RVI (ratio vegetation index), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index), MSAVI (modified soil-adjusted vegetation index), OSAVI (optimized soil adjusted vegetation index), NDVIgreen (green normalized difference vegetation index), CI (canopy index), and NCI (normalized canopy index) for GBR estimation in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. We also explored best narrow-band hyperspectral vegetation indices for GBR estimation using hyperspectral remotely sensed data and GBR measurements during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons in the desert steppe. Broad-band vegetation indices were not suitable for GBR estimation. The best narrow-band vegetation indices used reflectance at 2069 and 2042 nm; particular 1.5 x (R-2069 - R-2042)/(R-2069 + R-2042 + 0.5). The index could partially overcome the influence of bare soil cover. It explained 68% of the variance of GBR and dramatically improved GBR estimation accuracy over common broad-band indices. More importantly, the accuracy was not affected by varying bare soil cover. Nevertheless, caution is required for the index application within varying growing seasons. The development of this index is an important resource for future spectral sensors that will permit GBR monitoring at regional scales in arid grasslands. Our results show that remote imagery can monitor GBR in the desert steppe and potentially in many arid grasslands.

TI  - Segmentation of Marine SAR Images by Sublook Analysis and Application to Sea Traffic Monitoring
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a segmentation algorithm for marine synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed approach is based on the analysis of image sublooks along azimuth direction and exploits a novel indicator, called incoherent entropy, to divide the input targets into three classes, namely, ship, sea, and ambiguity. A global threshold detector is then implemented to discriminate between stable targets (ships), providing low incoherent entropy amplitude, and ambiguity or sea, implying very high and high values of the indicator, respectively. An integration of the segmentation algorithm into maritime surveillance systems is investigated, proposing its use as a discrimination tool to limit the false alarm rate of traditional prescreening algorithms. The main steps of a standard SAR-based ship detection system are thus implemented to provide a first screening of the candidate targets, which are, then, processed by sublook analysis using incoherent entropy to identify false detections. The proposed technique is tested on stripmap SAR images collected by the TerraSAR-X mission, over the Gulf of Naples, Italy. Algorithm detections are validated using ground-truth data, provided by automatic identification system. The results confirm the capability of the proposed discrimination approach to reject the vast majority of the false detections resulting from the prescreening algorithm.

TI  - Forest depletion gradient along the Amazon floodplain
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the process of forest cover depletion over the last 40 years at three landscapes distributed along the Amazon floodplain. To this end, we created multi-temporal forest cover maps based on time series of Landsat images, and then analyzed the forest cover dynamics through landscape metrics. Based on landscape analyzes and bibliographic information, we assessed the degree of forest depletion of each landscape and made inferences regarding the main drives of forest changes and their impacts on ecosystem integrity. Results show the existence of an east-to-west gradient of forest depletion that varies in time and space along the floodplain of the SolimOes/Amazonas River, and provides evidence that it is a response to the history of human occupation and public policies. The most degraded landscapes are located on the eastern region, where forest depletion degree indicates substantial damage to biodiversity and ecosystem services. The study increases the scarce knowledge about the dynamics of the floodplain forest over the last decades, allows a deeper understanding of the human influence on the floodplain ecosystem, and supports further studies on the impacts of forest loss and fragmentation on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in the Amazon floodplain.

TI  - Modeling forest aboveground biomass using deterministic and stochastic techniques
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - By estimating forest biomass, it is possible to determine the amount of forest resources existing in a given territory, however, this is an expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to model the aerial tree biomass of a forest ecosystem located in the south central region of the state of San Luis Potosi. To define this process, we compared deterministic methods (weighted reverse distance) and stochastic methods (kriging and cokriging), with which the forest biomass was determined based on field and spectral data. Field data corresponded to 50 conglomerates of the National Forest Inventory, from which the biomass was calculated by using allometric equations. The spectral data (traditional NDVI -red and infrared bands of electromagnetic spectrum) were derived from a Landsat 5TM image of the year 2009. With the results of calculation of biomass and NDVI, semivariograms and cross variograms were tested with spherical, exponential and gaussian models to analyze which will result in the best fit. Subsequently, the exponential model derived from the cokriging technique was selected, based on which a square root value of the RMSE mean squared error of 32.01 Mg ha(-1) was obtained. Finally, based on the selected model, a map was generated of the aerial biomass distribution, in which results that range from the 0.85 Mg ha(-1) to 157 Mg ha(-1 )are presented.

TI  - Analysis of spatio-temporal dust aerosol frequency over Iran based on satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Iran is located in the dust-belt region and so dust is a main environmental issue over the country. The main purpose of this study is to better understand of the spatial and temporal properties of the Dust Aerosol Frequency (DAF) over Iran using satellite data. Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) deep blue Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE) (both Terra and Aqua, Level 3, Collection 6.1) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Absorption Aerosol Index (AAI) were obtained at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution over Iran for the 10 years from 2006 to 2015. In this study observations with AOD higher than 0.3, AE < 0.75 and AAI > 0.7 are considered to be dust aerosols. Results showed that the maximum areas with high DAF are located in the Khuzestan province in the southwest and Sistan in the east of the country. The other areas with peak DAF were observed in the low elevation areas of the country, namely coastal plain of the Oman Sea, Jaz Murian depression and Lut desert in the southeast, and Southern Dasht-e Kavir in central northern. DAF is decreased significantly at latitudes higher than 34.5 degrees N. The maximum and minimum DAFs over Iran occur in July (Terra = 2.02, Aqua = 2.1) and November (Terra = 0.1, Aqua = 0.05), respectively. We found good spatial relationship between DAF with the meteorological codes frequency related to the dust from weather stations as well as with the fraction of dust AOD and from Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project. In addition, results showed that dust frequencies based on both weather station and satellite data exhibited corresponding relationships with latitude, elevation, vegetation cover, precipitation and temperature.

TI  - Revisiting a simple degree-day model for integrating satellite data: implementation of SWE-SCA hystereses
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual degree-day snow models are often calibrated using runoff observations. This makes the snow models dependent on the rainfall-runoff model they are coupled with. Numerous studies have shown that using Snow Cover Area (SCA) remote sensing observation from MODIS satellites helps to better constrain parameters. The objective of this study was to calibrate the CemaNeige degree-day snow model with SCA and runoff observations. In order to calibrate the snow model with SCA observations, the original CemaNeige SCA formulation was revisited to take into account the hysteresis that exists between SCA and the snow water equivalent (SWE) during the accumulation and melt phases. Several parametrizations of the hysteresis between SWE and SCA were taken from land surface model literature. We showed that they improve the performances of SCA simulation without degrading the river runoff simulation. With this improvement, a new calibration method of the snow model was developed using jointly SCA and runoff observations. Further analysis showed that the CemaNeige calibrated parameter sets are more robust for simulating independent periods than parameter sets obtained from discharge calibration only. Calibrating the snow model using only SCA data gave mixed results, with similar performances as using median parameters from all watersheds calibration.

TI  - Characterization of food cultivation along roadside transects with Google Street View imagery and deep learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the development of tools to exploit the enormous resource of street-level imagery in Google Street View to characterize food cultivation practices along roadside transects at very high spatial resolution as a potential complement to traditional remote sensing approaches. We report on two software tools for crop identification using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to Google Street View imagery. The first, a multi-class classifier distinguishes seven regionally common cultivated plant species, as well as uncultivated vegetation, built environment, and water along the roads. The second, a prototype specialist detector, recognizes the presence of a single plant species: in our case, banana. These two classification tools were tested along roadside transects in two areas of Thailand, a country where there is good Google Street View coverage.On the entire test set, the overall accuracy of the multi-class classifier was 83.3%. For several classes, (banana, built, cassava, maize, rice, and sugarcane), the producer's accuracy was over 90%, meaning that the classifier was infrequently making omission errors. This performance on roadside transects is comparable with that of some remote-sensing classifiers, yet ours does not require any additional site-visits for ground-truthing. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the classifier on the 40% of images it is most sure about is excellent: 99.0%. For the prototype specialist detector, the area under the ROC curve was 0.9905, indicating excellent performance in detecting the presence of banana plants.While initially tested over the road network in a small area, this technique could readily be deployed on a regional or even national scale to supplement remote sensing data and yield a fine-grained analysis of food cultivation activities along roadside transects.

TI  - Detection of the sentinel node using a magnetic tracer in thyroid cancer. A technical pilot study
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: There is no standard procedure for the detection of the sentinel node (SN) in thyroid disease. However, the recent detection of the SN using a paramagnetic tracer is proving to be useful in breast cancer and melanoma. The objective was to assess the utility of super paramagnetic iron oxide tracer for the intraoperative detection of the SN in patients with papillary thyroid cancer without nodal involvement in the preoperative study.Method: A single center, prospective pilot study of a class IIa medical device (a paramagnetic tracer). The study included thyroid cancers which were T1-T2 tumors in the cytohistological analysis with a negative preoperative nodal assessment, operated on consecutively during scheduled treatment. For the localization of the SN, an interlesional injection of 2 mL of super paramagnetic iron oxide was administered. After ten minutes, ferromagnetic activity was detected in the adjacent nodes. Once the node had been detected, we proceeded by extracting it for intraoperative analysis. The effectiveness of the procedure for detecting the SN was assessed, with the main variable being whether it was detected or not.Results: The project was assessed after the first cases had been carried out. The SN was located in all cases, which was done easily in the first four, but in the fifth case the SN detection was complicated by the interference of the reusable neurostimulation electrodes with the ferromagnetic signal. Intraoperative histology revealed the SN was positive in 80% (n = 4) of cases (20% [n = 1] were macrometastases and 60% [n = 3] micrometastases). Total thyroidectomies were carried out, with central lymph node dissection in 4 of the patients and lateral in one due to the result of the detected SN. The histology showed the carcinoma was papillary, a classic type, in 80% (n = 4) and a follicular variant in 20% (n = 1). Forty percent (n = 2) were multifocal, 40% (n = 2) had vascular infiltration, and 60% (n = 3) had extrathyroidal extension. Staging determined the application of radioactive iodine therapy (150 mCi) in 80% of cases (n = 4).Conclusions: A paramagnetic tracer can be useful for detecting the SN and correctly staging papillary carcinoma.

TI  - Legitimation strategies and theistic worldview in sociopolitical discourse: A systemic functional critical discourse analysis of Pakistani social media discussions
T2  - TEXT & TALK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study employs a systemic functional critical discourse analytical approach to the analysis of integrated theistic worldview of Pakistani social media users. To achieve its end, the study focuses on legitimation strategies, where these strategies serve to construct certain truth claims of the people. So, three thousand comments (comprising 8,401 words and 90,423 words) from online discussion forums of Dawn.com and Zemtv.com were studied and discourse samples were collected for in-depth analysis. The legitimation strategies, it is argued, are condensed and interpersonally charged through certain lexico-grammatical choices which embody people's integrated theistic worldviews. The identity(ies) and identification claims of Pakistanis are found to be internally cohesive, based on theistic legitimation claims. To represent, legitimize and justify their worldviews, Pakistani social media users recontextualize discourses constructed from various combinations of discursive strategies, supported by references to Islamic scripture and popular narratives. The study is a prelude to a more detailed investigation of discursive strategies which represent (de)legitimized worldview and discourses internalized by Pakistani Muslims. Such studies provide deeper insights into (de)construction of (de)legitimation strategies of a society and facilitate further development of systemic functional critical discourse analytical approaches to text and context relations.

TI  - Recent drought and tree mortality effects on the avian community in southern Sierra Nevada: a glimpse of the future?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds respond rapidly to changes in both habitat and climate conditions and thus are good indicators of the ecological effects of a changing climate, which may include warmer temperatures, changing habitat conditions, and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme events like drought. We investigated how a widespread tree mortality event concurrent with a severe drought influenced the avian community of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. We assessed and compared the separate effects of climate stresses and altered habitat conditions on the avian community and used this information to evaluate the changes that are likely to occur in the near future. We built tree mortality maps from freely available Landsat imagery with Google Earth Engine. We analyzed avian point counts from 2010 to 2016 in the southern Sierra Nevada, to model temperature, water deficit, and tree mortality effects on the abundances of 45 bird species, and then used these models to project abundances into the future based on three climate projections. A large portion of the avian community, 47%, had a positive relationship with temperature increase, compared to 20% that responded negatively. More species (36%) declined with drier conditions than increased (29%). More species declined in response to high tree mortality (36%) than increased (9%). A preponderance of species adapted to colder temperatures (higher elevation) had negative responses to high tree mortality and water deficit, but positive responses to increasing temperature. We projected the highest total bird abundances in the future under the warmest climate scenario that we considered, but habitat modification (e.g., tree mortality) and water deficit could offset the positive influence of temperature for many species. As other studies have shown, climate warming may lead to substantial but idiosyncratic effects on wildlife species that could result in community composition shifts. We conclude that future climate conditions may not have a universally negative effect on biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada, but probable vegetation changes and increased likelihood of extreme events such as drought should be incorporated into climate-smart forest and wildlife management decisions.

TI  - Current state of sentinel lymph nodes for women with endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been investigated as an alternative to conventional pelvic and para-aorticlymphadenectomy for the surgical staging of endometrial cancer. Clinical trials have established the accuracy of sentinel nodes in the detecting metastatic disease. Novel advancements in tracers from the historically favored blue dyes and radio labeled colloids to near infrared imaging of fluorescent dyes has improved the ability to detect sentinel nodes and increased options for surgeons. The uterine cervix has been shown to be a feasible and accurate injection site for tracer, though the potential for under-evaluation of the para-aortic nodes remains a controversy, particularly for high-risk cancers. Additionally, sentinel node evaluation provides qualitatively different information than traditional staging techniques by identifying lymph nodes outside of traditional sampling locations and through the identification of very low volume meta static disease implants, such as isolated tumor cells. It is unclear how this altered staging information should be interpreted, guide the prescription of adjuvant therapy and its impact on long term clinical outcomes such as recurrence and survival. In this review we will discuss the evidence that has supported the use of the SLN technique in the staging of endometrial cancer, the options for surgical technique and the implications of managing the results of staging pathology.

TI  - Assessing Harvested Sites in a Forested Boreal Mountain Catchment through Global Forest Watch
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Forest Watch (GFW) provides a global map of annual forest cover loss (FCL) produced from Landsat imagery, offering a potentially powerful tool for monitoring changes in forest cover. In managed forests, FCL primarily provides information on commercial harvesting. A semi-autonomous method for providing data on the location and attributes of harvested sites at a landscape level was developed which could significantly improve the basis for catchment management, including risk mitigation. FCL in combination with aerial images was used for detecting and characterising harvested sites in a 1607 km(2) mountainous boreal forest catchment in south-central Norway. Firstly, the forest cover loss map was enhanced (FCLE) by removing small isolated forest cover loss patches that had a high probability of representing commission errors. The FCLE map was then used to locate and assess sites representing annual harvesting activity over a 17-year period. Despite an overall accuracy of >98%, a kappa of 0.66 suggested only a moderate quality for detecting harvested sites. While errors of commission were negligible, errors of omission were more considerable and at least partially attributed to the presence of residual seed trees on the site after harvesting. The systematic analysis of harvested sites against aerial images showed a detection rate of 94%, but the area of the individual harvested site was underestimated by 29% on average. None of the site attributes tested, including slope, area, altitude, or site shape index, had any effect on the accuracy of the area estimate. The annual harvest estimate was 0.6% (standard error 12%) of the productive forest area. On average, 96% of the harvest was carried out on flat to moderately steep terrain (<40% slope), 3% on steep terrain (40% to 60% slope), and 1% on very steep terrain (>60% slope). The mean area of FCLE within each slope category was 1.7 ha, 0.9 ha, and 0.5 ha, respectively. The mean FCLE area increased from 1.0 ha to 3.2 ha on flat to moderate terrain over the studied period, while the frequency of harvesting increased from 249 to 495 sites per year. On the steep terrain, 35% of the harvesting was done with cable yarding, and 62% with harvester-forwarder systems. On the very steep terrain (>60% slope), 88% of the area was harvested using cable yarding technology while harvesters and forwarders were used on 12% of the area. Overall, FCL proved to be a useful dataset for the purpose of assessing harvesting activity under the given conditions.

TI  - Development of a Sentinel-2 burned area algorithm: Generation of a small fire database for sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A locally-adapted multitemporal two-phase burned area (BA) algorithm has been developed using as inputs Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance measurements in the short and near infrared wavebands plus the active fires detected by Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors. An initial burned area map is created in the first step, from which tile dependent statistics are extracted for the second step. The whole Sub-Saharan Africa (around 25 M km(2)) was processed with this algorithm at a spatial resolution of 20 m, from January to December 2016. This period covers two half fire seasons on the Northern Hemisphere and an entire fire season in the South. The area was selected as existing BA products account it to include around 70% of global BA. Validation of this product was based on a two-stage stratified random sampling of Landsat multitemporal images. Higher accuracy values than existing global BA products were observed, with Dice coefficient of 77% and omission and commission errors of 26.5% and 19.3% respectively. The standard NASA BA product (MCD64A1 c6) showed a similar commission error (20.4%), but much higher omission errors (59.6%), with a lower Dice coefficient (53.6%). The BA algorithm was processed over > 11,000 Sentinel-2 images to create a database that would also include small fires (< 100 ha). This is the first time a continental BA product is generated from medium resolution sensors (spatial resolution = 20 m), showing their operational potential for improving our current understanding of global fire impacts. Total BA estimated from our product was 4.9 M km(2), around 80% larger area than what the NASA BA product (MCD64A1 c6) detected in the same period (2.7 M km(2)). The main differences between the two products were found in regions where small fires (< 100 ha) account for a significant proportion of total BA, as global products based on coarse pixel sizes (500 m for MCD64A1) unlikely detect them. On the negative side, Sentinel-2 based products have lower temporal resolution and consequently are more affected by cloud/cloud shadows and have less temporal reporting accuracy than global BA products. The product derived from S2 imagery would greatly contribute to better understanding the impacts of small fires in global fire regimes, particularly in tropical regions, where such fires are frequent. This product is named FireCCISFD11 and it is publicly available at: https://www.esa-fire-cci.org/node/262, last accessed on November 2018.

TI  - DROUGHT EVALUATION WITH NDVI-BASED STANDARDIZED VEGETATION INDEX IN LOWER NORTHEASTERN REGION OF THAILAND
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon that usually occurs in various areas of the northeastern part of Thailand and it has a major impact on agriculture. The main objective of this studywas to apply remote sensing technology and the Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) for the evaluation of drought in the aforementioned areas. For the implementation, data of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Terra/MODIS satellite was utilized for the analysis in order to examine the drought areas due to the change of the vegetation conditions by the SVI within a period of three years: 2014, 2015, 2106. According to the study, it was found that the worst drought was in 2016, followed by the years 2014 and 2015, respectively. Furthermore, for the reliability of this technique, the analysis results from the SVI to find the statistical relationship with the rainfall in the target areas was completed. The results of both sets of the data showed a high relationship in all three years (2014, R-2 = 0.83; 2015, R-2 = 0.88 and 2016, R-2 = 0.97). Thus, it could be concluded that examining the drought situation by remote sensing technology and the SVI at different periods in the areas of the Lower Northeastern region of Thailand could identify the forms of drought effectively.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring of mangrove along the Odisha coast based on remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital image processing techniques using multi-temporal satellite imagery are widely used to understand landscape dynamics. In this study, we analysed the spatio-temporal changes of mangrove along the Odisha coast, India using Landsat satellite images of four different time periods, i.e., Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper satellite images of 1990 and 2009, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite images of 2000 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager satellite images of 2015. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Normalized Difference Wetland Index (NDWI) are used to extract and classify the mangroves into three classes such as dense mangrove, sparse mangrove and open mangrove. The study reveals that total mangrove of the study area increased from 18573.49ha (1990) to 23871.49ha (2015) during the last three decades. This may be attributed to mangrove plantation, restoration and proper coastal zone management plan. The paper highlights the importance of digital change detection techniques using NDVI, SAVI and NDWI for mangrove mapping and monitoring along the Odisha coast. This study aids Odisha coastal zone management authority to take timely decisions for conservation of mangrove and future mangrove plantation plans with help of satellite image processing in GIS environment.

TI  - Groundwater recharge estimation in karst aquifers of southern Apennines (Italy) by integration of remotely sensed data
T2  - RENDICONTI ONLINE SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - In many Italian regions, karst aquifers are main sources of drinking water and play a crucial role for socio-economic development of the territory. Hence, estimating groundwater recharge of these aquifers is a fundamental task for a proper management of water resources, also considering impacts of climate changes.In karst areas of the southern Apennines, the assessment of hydrological parameters needed for the estimation of groundwater recharge is a challenging issue, specifically for the spatial discontinuity of the rain and air temperature monitoring networks and variability of land use. In such a framework, the integration of terrestrial and remotely sensed data is a promising approach to limit these uncertainties.This research deals with the estimation of groundwater recharge for karst aquifers of southern Apennines by the application of remotely sensed data gathered by the MODIS satellite in the period 2000-2014 for assessing actual evapotranspiration (MODIS Eta). To assess uncertainties in the estimation of Eta affecting conventional methods based on empirical formulas, MODIS Eta values were compared with those calculated by Turc, Coutagne and Thornthwaite methods. In addition, annual rainfall time series of 266 rain gauge and 150 air temperature stations, recorded by regional meteorological networks in the period 2000-2014, were considered to reconstruct regional distributed models of ETa and groundwater recharge.Considering the MODIS Eta, a mean annual groundwater recharge of about 448 mm.year(-1 )was estimated for karst aquifers of southern Apennines Instead, by the Turc, Coutagne and Thornthwaite formulas, ETa mean annual values of 494, 533 and 437 mm.year(-1) were estimated respectively.The obtained results open a new perspective in the assessment of actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge of karst aquifer at the regional and mean annual scales allowing a reduction of uncertainties and achieving a spatial resolution greater than that of the existing meteorological networks.

TI  - An analytical model for estimation of land surface net water flux from near-surface soil moisture observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate determination of land surface water fluxes at various spatiotemporal scales remains a challenge in hydrological sciences. It is intuitive that land surface net water flux (i.e., infiltration minus evapotranspiration) directly affects near-surface soil moisture. However, there exists no hydrological model suitable to calculate net water flux based on measured near-surface soil moisture data. This is a consequence of the mathematical structure of existing models that use 'boundary conditions' to determine 'internal conditions', whereas what is needed is a model amenable to use near-surface soil moisture data (an internal condition) to determine the surface water flux (a boundary condition). To pursue the idea of utilizing remotely-sensed or in situ (i.e., sensor networks) near surface soil moisture data for estimation of net water flux, we derived an analytical model via inversion of Warrick's 1975 analytical solution to the linearized Richards' equation for arbitrary time-varying surface flux boundary conditions. The applicability of the new analytical solution was evaluated based on actual water flux observations as well as HYDRUS-1D simulations for four vastly different sites in Arizona, California, Idaho, and Indiana. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model reasonably captures net water flux variations in natural settings, including layered and vegetated soils, especially at larger time scales (e.g., monthly). While the model works for a wide range of climatic conditions, the prediction accuracy is somewhat lower for extreme dry or wet conditions. A major advantage of the new model is that it does not require calibration, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for large scale estimation of land surface net water flux using remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture observations.

TI  - Scalable Database Indexing and Fast Image Retrieval Based on Deep Learning and Hierarchically Nested Structure Applied to Remote Sensing and Plant Biology
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digitalisation has opened a wealth of new data opportunities by revolutionizing how images are captured. Although the cost of data generation is no longer a major concern, the data management and processing have become a bottleneck. Any successful visual trait system requires automated data structuring and a data retrieval model to manage, search, and retrieve unstructured and complex image data. This paper investigates a highly scalable and computationally efficient image retrieval system for real-time content-based searching through large-scale image repositories in the domain of remote sensing and plant biology. Images are processed independently without considering any relevant context between sub-sets of images. We utilize a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model as a feature extractor to derive deep feature representations from the imaging data. In addition, we propose an effective scheme to optimize data structure that can facilitate faster querying at search time based on the hierarchically nested structure and recursive similarity measurements. A thorough series of tests were carried out for plant identification and high-resolution remote sensing data to evaluate the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the proposed approach against other content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques, such as the bag of visual words (BOVW) and multiple feature fusion techniques. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and considerably faster than conventional indexing structures.

TI  - Integrated assessment of sediment contaminant levels and biological responses in sentinel fish species <i>Atherinella brasiliensis</i> from a sub-tropical estuary in south Atlantic
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combined data of the concentrations of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products (PPCPs) in the sediments and the biological responses of the Atherinella brasiliensis fish in two different sites and climate seasons in the Estuarine-Lagoon Complex of Iguape-Cananeia, Southeast Brazil. The presence of metals, PAHs, and PPCPs were observed in the sediments demonstrating the contamination throughout the system with contributions of sewage and residues disposal, oil and combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. Higher contaminations were identified in the point of greater human presence (C - Cananeia City), especially during the cold-dry season. The influence of anthropic activities and variations in the estuarine conditions, such as lower hydrodynamics during the lower rainfall period, were observed. In fish, spatial and seasonal changes in the parameters of oxidative stress and biotransformation, genotoxicity and histopathological alterations followed the same trend, with more pronounced responses in C in the cold-dry season. The biological responses of the fish revealed adverse effects in the local species population and indicated the presence of metals, PAHs and PPCPs as stressors. The multivariate analysis and the integrated biomarker response index (IBR) corroborated with these results, also indicating that site C had the worst environmental quality. The present study provides new information about the contamination of the sediments of Estuarine-Lagoon Complex of Iguape-Cananeia and the chronic exposure to contaminants in A. brasiliensis. Therefore, contributing to a better understanding of the local environmental quality with data that can support protective management of the area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of land use change on runoff in Chenar Rahdar watershed. Land use map of the studied basin was determined using Landsat satellite imagery for 2004 and 2015 using ENVI software. After applying the necessary corrections to the images and field surveys to take the educational points, supervised classification technique and maximum probability algorithm were applied to mapping land use change in the study area. According to results, 6 classes of land use were investigated (bare land, rain fed land, forest land, water agriculture land, rangelands and urban lands). In this study, 21 model parameters were calibrated with monthly runoff using 2004-2012 data and validated using 2012-2015 data. The efficiency coefficient for calibration and validation were between 0.88 and 0.94, respectively. The land use changes trend within the time interval showed that the highest percentage of incremental changes is related to urban lands with 108.45%, whereas, the highest decline was observed for agricultural land with 12.46%. In order to investigate the effect of land use change on surface runoff, different land use maps were applied to SWAT model, supposing constant condition for other parameters of the model. The results show that surface runoff increased by 11%, in 2015 compared to 2004. Comprehensive water management can reduce surface runoff in the watershed. The results showed that if all uncertainties were minimized, the calibrated SWAT model can give acceptable runoff simulation results regarding the land use change. These results can be useful for water and environmental resource managers.

TI  - Fire Recurrence and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Dynamics in Brazilian Savanna
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the main modeling agents of savanna ecosystems, affecting their distribution, physiognomy and species diversity. Changes in the natural fire regime on savannas cause disturbances in the structural characteristics of vegetation. Theses disturbances can be effectively monitored by time series of remote sensing data in different terrestrial ecosystems such as savannas. This study used trend analysis in NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) time series to evaluate the influence of different fire recurrences on vegetation phenology of the Brazilian savanna in the period from 2001 to 2016. The trend analysis indicated several factors responsible for changes in vegetation: (a) The absence of fire in savanna phytophysiognomies causes a constant increase in MODIS-NDVI, ranging from 0.001 to 0.002 per year, the moderate presence of fire in these areas does not cause significant changes, while the high recurrence results in decreases of MODIS-NDVI, ranging from -0.002 to -0.008 per year; (b) Forest areas showed a high decrease in NDVI, reaching up to -0.009 MODIS-NDVI per year, but not related to fire recurrence, indicating the high degradation of these phytophysiognomies; (c) Changes in vegetation are highly connected to the protection status of the area, such as areas of integral protection or sustainable use, and consequently their conservation status. Areas with greater vegetation conservation had more than 70% of positive changes in pixels with significant tendencies. Absence or presence of fire are the main agents of vegetation change in areas with lower anthropic influence. These results reinforce the need for a suitable fire management policy for the different types of Cerrado phytophysiognomies, in addition to highlighting the efficiency of remote sensing time series for evaluation of vegetation phenology.

TI  - Using unmanned aerial vehicle-based multispectral, RGB and thermal imagery for phenotyping of forest genetic trials: A case study in <i>Pinus halepensis</i>
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of genetic differentiation in functional traits is fundamental towards understanding the adaptive characteristics of forest species. While traditional phenotyping techniques are costly and time-consuming, remote sensing data derived from cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide potentially valid high-throughput information for assessing morphophysiological differences among tree populations. In this work, we test for genetic variation in vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy temperature among populations of Pinus halepensis as proxies for canopy architecture, leaf area, photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic efficiency and water use. The interpopulation associations between vegetation properties and above-ground growth (stem volume) were also assessed. Three flights (July 2016, November 2016 and May 2017) were performed in a genetic trial consisting of 56 populations covering a large part of the species range. Multispectral (visible and near infrared wavelengths), RGB (red, green, blue) and thermal images were used to estimate canopy temperature and vegetation cover (VC) and derive several VIs. Differences among populations emerged consistently across flights for VC and VIs related to leaf area, indicating genetic divergence in crown architecture. Population differences in indices related to photosynthetic pigments emerged only in May 2017 and were probably related to a contrasting phenology of needle development. Conversely, the low population differentiation for the same indices in July 2016 and November 2016 suggested weak interpopulation variation in the photosynthetic machinery of mature needles of P. halepensis. Population differences in canopy temperature found in July 2016 were indicative of variation in stomatal regulation under drought stress. Stem volume correlated with indices related to leaf area (positively) and with canopy temperature (negatively), indicating a strong influence of canopy properties and stomatal conductance on above-ground growth at the population level. Specifically, a combination of VIs and canopy temperature accounted for about 60% of population variability in stem volume of adult trees. This is the first study to propose UAV remote sensing as an effective tool for screening genetic variation in morphophysiological traits of adult forest trees.

TI  - Artificial neural network based prediction of malaria abundances using big data: A knowledge capturing approach
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: Malaria is one of the most prevalent diseases in urban areas. Malaria flourishes in subtropical countries and affect the public health. The impact is very high, where health monitoring facilities are very limited. To minimize the impact of malaria population in sub-tropical domains, a suitable disease prediction model is required. The objective of this study is to determine the malaria abundances using clinical and environmental variables with Big Data on the geographical location of Khammam district, Telanagana, India.Methods: Prediction model is based on the data collected from primary health centres of department of vector borne diseases (DVBD) of Khammam district and satellite data such as rain fall, relative humidity, temperature and vegetation taken for the time period of 1995-2014. In this study, we test the efficacy of the artificial neural network (ANN) for mosquito abundance prediction. Prediction model was developed for the period of 2015 using a feed forward neural network and compared with the observed values.Results and conclusions: The results vary from area to area based on clinical variables and rainfall in the prediction model corresponding to areas. The average error of the prediction model ranges from 18% to 117%. Clinical data such as number of patients treated with symptoms and without symptoms can improve the prediction level when combined with environmental variables. We perform preliminary findings of malaria abundances by collecting clinical big data across different seasons. Further, more exploration is required in prediction of malaria using big data to improve the accuracy in real practice. In this manuscript, we perform some preliminary findings of malaria abundances by collecting larger data across different seasons. Till today, many models have been developed to examine the malaria prediction with different approaches, but malaria prediction with environmental and clinical data is a new approach with big data analysis.

TI  - Hierarchical clustering and stochastic distance for indirect semi-supervised remote sensing image classification
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Usually, image classification methods have supervised or unsupervised learning paradigms. While unsupervised methods do not need training data, the meanings behind the classified elements are not explicitly know. Conversely, supervised methods are able to provide classification results with an intrinsic meaning, since a labeled dataset is available for training, which may be a limitation in some cases. The semi-supervised learning paradigm, which simultaneously exploits both labeled and unlabeled data, may be an alternative to this dilemma. This work proposes a semi-supervised classification framework through the combination of the Hierarchical Divisive Algorithm and stochastic distance concepts, where the former is adopted to automatically determine clusters in the data and the latter is used to label such clusters in a supervised way. In order to verify the potential of the proposed framework, two case studies about land use and land cover classification were carried out in an Amazonian area using synthetic aperture radar and multispectral data acquired by ALOS PALSAR and LANDSAT-5 TM sensors. Supervised methods based on statistical concepts were also included in these studies as baselines. The results show that when very small training sets are available, the proposed method provides results up to 14.6% and 3.8% more accurate than the baselines with respect to the classification of TM and PALSAR images, respectively.

TI  - A solar irradiation GIS as decision support tool for the Province of Salta, Argentina
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The province of Salta is characterized by its solar energy high potential. The use of solar resource would improve living conditions in the area, diversify the energy matrix, promote more sustainable production systems and reduce greenhouse gases emissions. However, there are only a few studies that describe in high spatial resolution the variability of the solar resource in Argentina. Multidimensional tools, that consider the environment and the socio-economic situation, have to be considered for adequate support decision-making, such as solar collector location assessment and photovoltaic potential. In this sense, a deep evaluation of the solar resource is needed first, as solar irradiation is an essential input variable for the design and evaluation of solar application systems.In this paper, we detail the methodology used to elaborate a GIS tool to support decisions related to renewable energy policies and solar technology design. A comparison between global solar irradiation measurements in situ, empirical models, and data provided by Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA-SAF), is performed in daily, monthly and annual basis for a seven-year period. This analysis validates the use of this satellite data for the determination of solar irradiation in the region. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring thermal anomaly and radiative heat flux using thermal infrared satellite imagery - A case study at Tuzla geothermal region
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal energy, which is renewable, reliable and environmentally friendly, is one of the most important energy resources. Thus, it is crucial to explore geothermal areas in order to reduce the use of other energy sources that are detrimental to the environment and ecology. Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an effective way to detect thermal anomalies in geothermal areas and volcanoes, since it is cost and time effective, and offers to work on a large scale compared to geophysical methods. The aim of this study is to investigate thermal anomalies in Tuzla geothermal region using daytime and nighttime TIR data with reference to Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Radiative Heat Flux (RHF). Many geophysical studies have been conducted in this region; however, it can also be studied with TIR remote sensing for further exploration. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data, acquired on 15.06.2012 and 15.07.2017 as daytime image and 15.09.2013 and 31.12.2017 as nighttime image, were utilized as satellite imagery. In addition to ASTER data, we proposed a multi-sensor based LST retrieval for nighttime using Landsat 8 data for emissivity acquisition. In order to evaluate the accuracy of LST images, cross-validation method was utilized with reference to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were considered as statistical metrics and the lowest result was obtained as 90% and 1.76 K, respectively. As a result of the analyses, it was observed that nighttime LST presented better results for thermal anomalies in that geothermal area than daytime LST. Considering geothermal anomaly, the geothermal area had higher LST values even though it held identical or same NDVI values as compared to non-geothermal surroundings. In addition, the net radiative heat loss values were calculated as 17.83 MW and 121.28 MW for 2013 and 2017, respectively. The obtained results proved that TIR remote sensing could be utilized in the studies of geothermal area exploration.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Gwadar Bay is located in the southwest coasts far end of Iran at Sistan and Baluchestan province at 25 degrees 1 ' to 25 degrees 12 ' N and 61 degrees 25 ' to 61 degrees 46 ' E. The Gwadar Bay has about 435 km(2) area. Almost 40% of the bay is in Iran and the rest belongs to Pakistan. Mangrove forests of Bahukalat and Gwadar inlets in Gwadar Bay are important factors in this province. These forests are considered as a unique habitat for a vast number of animals and living creatures and have great economic importance. The aim of this study is investigating quantity changes of mangrove forests in Gwadar Bay. For this purpose, the TM and IRS satellite images during 1987 and 2008 were used. First, the detection operation and geo-referencing of the images was performed. Then classification of the images and detection of forests boundaries was made by the multi-band supervised classification. Finally, the area of the forests was calculated during considered years and the final processing was analyzed. The results shows, the situation a quantity mangrove forests has been upward in Gwadar Bay. The results show that the forests area increased from 384 hectares in 1987 to 607 hectares in 2008. This amount is also visible in Bahukalat and Gwadar Bay.

TI  - Endosomolytic polymersomes increase the activity of cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists to enhance cancer immunotherapy
T2  - NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are a promising class of immunotherapeutics that activate innate immunity to increase tumour immunogenicity. However, the efficacy of CDNs is limited by drug delivery barriers, including poor cellular targeting, rapid clearance and inefficient transport to the cytosol where STING is localized. Here, we describe STING-activating nanoparticles (STING-NPs)-rationally designed polymersomes for enhanced cytosolic delivery of the endogenous CDN ligand for STING, 2'3' cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP). STING-NPs increase the biological potency of cGAMP, enhance STING signalling in the tumour microenvironment and sentinel lymph node, and convert immunosuppressive tumours to immunogenic, tumoricidal microenvironments. This leads to enhanced therapeutic efficacy of cGAMP, inhibition of tumour growth, increased rates of long-term survival, improved response to immune checkpoint blockade and induction of immunological memory that protects against tumour rechallenge. We validate STING-NPs in freshly isolated human melanoma tissue, highlighting their potential to improve clinical outcomes of immunotherapy.

TI  - Retrospective monitoring of the spatial variability of crystalline iron in soils of the east shore of Urmia Lake, Iran using remotely sensed data and digital maps
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil ripening process can be defined as change in the soil/sediment matrix from exposure to air in previously inundated areas. Early pedogenesis crystalline iron oxide is one of the most important diagnostic criteria to monitor the aforementioned process. In this study, the east shore of the shrinking Urmia Lake located in the north west of Iran was selected for investigation. This article aims to express the importance of advanced digital soil mapping to link between a difficult-to-measure soil attribute (i.e. crystalline iron oxides) and remotely sensed data as easy-to-measure variables. Additionally, the spatial distribution of clay and soil total iron density was also assessed. In this article, both Landsat 8 and Landsat 7 imagery were acquired for July 2017 and 1999 respectively. Eighteen remotely sensed data (environmental covariates) were employed for analysis, and a bootstrapping method was used to analyze the associated uncertainty of the created maps. Three data mining techniques namely; multiple linear regression, decision tree modeling and Cubist modeling were candidate models for mapping the target variables across the study area. Regarding optimality, a multiple linear regression model was fitted to predict clay content, while a Cubist model was fitted to predict both soil total iron density (SFeD) and crystalline iron oxide (Fe-crys). From the summary output, spectral bands in the visible region did not predict SFeD as strongly as that found for Fe-crys. As we expected, Fe-crys content increases with increasing the distance from the shore. This means that the ripened soils have been established far from the water body.

TI  - Extraction and Analysis of the Scattering Stability in Urban Areas Based on Dual-Polarization SAR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The stability characteristics of scattering are of great significance for achieving radiometric calibration without calibration fields. This letter used dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to explore the temporal and spatial stability of microwave scattering. Based on Sentinel-1 SAR data, we mainly studied the stability of the median value of SAR image slices in urban areas, under the HH- and HV-polarization modes. The urban slices with stable scattering were extracted by an improved deep neural network designed herein. Based on 33 images of the Houston region, the results show that this suitable network, which is trained by dual-polarization data, can effectively distinguish the stable slices from the unstable ones. In addition, some meaningful characteristics about SAR scattering stability of dual-polarization data are also obtained, which can provide a good reference for SAR nonfield radiometric calibration.

TI  - Potential eco-distribution mapping of <i>Myrica esculenta</i> in northwestern Himalayas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Myrica esculenta is a socio-economically important but underutilized keystone species of lesser Himalayas. The population of M. esculenta is declining in lesser Himalayas due to change in male-female ratio, habitat fragmentation, invasion by chir pine, over-exploitation, and an ever-increasing human population - with an increasing demand of land for agriculture, industries, and urbanization. The shrinking habitat along with unknown genetic diversity may hinder the application of conservation and genetic improvement of this species. The present research work was carried out to map the geographical distribution and predict the potential occurrence of M. esculenta in Uttarakhand, India. The Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (RS & GIS) based technology is utilized for prediction modeling and eco-distribution mapping. In total, 1022 species occurrence geospatial data were recorded for M. esculenta. The field surveys provided wide-range of slope, aspect and elevation of the species. The well distributed geo-coordinates (30.52%) were used in the Maxent model for predicting the distribution. Digital Image Processing (DIP) was done through geo-model tools. The results of Maxent model was found to be highly accurate with a statistically highly significant AUC value of 0.913 +/- 0.020. The Jackknife test revealed temperature seasonality (Bio 4), mean temperature of the wettest quarter (Bio 8), slope and precipitation of driest month (Bio 14) contributed significantly in predicting the distribution. The eco-distribution map, prepared using the LANDSAT-8 satellite imagery, showed 477.26 km(2) geographical area under M. esculenta distribution. Within the total area, 111.17, 260.52 and 105.57 km(2) were observed under very dense, moderately dense and open forest, respectively. The potential distribution area calculated in ASTER - GDEM satellite image was 2017.14 km(2). The satellite-based distribution map would be useful for forest departments, scientists, and researchers to locate actual M. esculenta distribution sites for future in situ and ex situ conservation. This approach could be promising in overlaying genetic diversity values over the map and could be effectively utilized in M. esculenta conservation, restoration and management programmes. The present study provides the first eco-distribution map and generated base-line data of M. esculenta in Uttarakhand, India.

TI  - Using Landsat and <i>in situ</i> data to map turbidity as a proxy of cyanobacteria in a hypereutrophic Mediterranean reservoir
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote estimates of phycocyanin (PC) have become valuable for monitoring the quality of inland waters affected by harmful cyanobacterial blooms. In this study, we developed an algorithm for mapping turbidity as a proxy of PC content through Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data and in situ measurements. The chosen study site is Karaoun Reservoir, in Lebanon, a hypereutrophic freshwater body where turbidity is mostly driven by cyanobacteria. Satellite images were corrected for atmospheric effects with the 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) code which proved to be more accurate than the DOS (Dark Object Subtraction) approach with R = 0.98 and R = 0.5, respectively. A strong relationship was found between turbidity and PC measurements (R = 0.92, R-2 = 0.86), as well as between turbidity and the ratio of band 5 to band 4 of the OLI (R = 0.88, R-2 = 0.77). Results reveal a promising performance of the algorithm for predicting PC concentrations with high correlations determined through simple linear regression analysis for both the calibration (R = 0.92, R-2 = 0.85) and validation (R = 0.88, R-2 = 0.78) periods. An application of the approach to a set of historical Landsat images revealed a time series of cyanobacterial bloom occurrence with high variation in surface area at the study site. The algorithm is considered to be suitable for retrieving cyanobacteria in highly eutrophic waters dominated by cyanobacteria where turbidity is mostly a function of the latter. This approach will improve monitoring cyanobacterial blooms on a spatial and timely basis.

TI  - A Quantitative Analytical Framework for Photon Transfer Curve-Based Preflight Characterization of the Indian Remote Sensing Imaging Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Preflight performance characterization of spaceborne imaging systems offers high-quality images for scientific applications. A key challenge in the laboratory characterization process is to identify the candidate signal chains requiring performance optimization. For the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) imaging systems, light transfer characterization has been identified as a standard process for performance characterization. Photon transfer curve (PTC) is another powerful and widely used tool to characterize the imaging systems in terms of camera gain (e(-)/DN), read noise (e(-)), charge-to-voltage conversion factor (CVF), signal-to-noise ratio, mean-variance linearity, and so on. There have been no detailed investigations on the PTC characteristics of the IRS imaging systems. We present here PTC-based characterization studies on two high-resolution IRS imaging systems, namely, Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2. For this, a quantitative analytical framework has been developed, which enables comparative studies among multiple signal chains by applying various statistical measures on the PTC derived parameters. This framework provides not only a quantitative assessment of performance deviations but also enables performance traceability up to detector level. Taken together, our analysis shows that all the signal chains have well behaved PTC characteristics, and performance deviations are less than 10%. In particular, performance traceability is established by the close match of the system-level CVF values within the detector manufacturer's specified range. Studies on the adequacy of linear approximation of the PTC curve reveal large residual errors in the lower dynamic range due to an increase in read noise floor. The analytical framework developed here can significantly help optimize future IRS imaging systems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal detection of land use/land cover change in the large basin using integrated approaches of remote sensing and GIS in the Upper Awash basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of the changing environmental conditions is essential for planning the wise use of natural resources. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the historical and future modeled LULC changes using multi-temporal Landsat images in the Upper Awash basin, Ethiopia. The supervised image classification method was used to determine the historical LULC changes based on Landsat 1 MSS 1972, Landsat 5 TM 1984, Landsat 7 ETM+2000, and Landsat 8 OLI TIRS 2014. The future LULC change was predicted using the machine-learning approaches of Land Change Modeler (LCM). The LULC change detection analysis exhibited significant increment in the areal extent of the cropland and urban areas, and decreasing trends in the pasture, forests and shrubland coverage. Mainly, the LULC change matrices indicated that larger conversion rate was observed from shrubland to cropland area. The urban area found to increase by 606.2% from the year 1972 to 2014 and cropland has also increased by 47.3%. Whereas, a decreasing trend was obtained in the forest by -25.1%, pasture -87.4%, shrubland -28.8% and water -21.0% in the same period. The modeled future LULC change scenarios of the year 2025 and 2035 have exhibited significant expansion of cropland and urban areas at the expense of forest, pasture and shrubland areas. The study has revealed the extent and the rate of LULC change at larger basin and subbasin level which can be useful for knowledge-based future land management practice in the Upper Awash basin.

TI  - Joint Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth and Surface Reflectance Over Land Using Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced Himawari imager (AHI) aboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite provides high-frequency observations with broad coverage, multiple spectral channels, and high spatial resolution. In this paper, AHI data were used to develop an algorithm for joint retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land and land surface bidirectional reflectance. Instead of performing surface reflectance estimation before calculating AOD, the AOD and surface bidirectional reflectance were retrieved simultaneously using an optimal estimation method. The algorithm uses an atmospheric radiative transfer model coupled with a surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) model. Based on the assumption that the surface bidirectional reflective properties are invariant during a short time period (i.e., a day), multiple temporal AHI observations were combined to calculate the AOD and surface BRF. The algorithm was tested over East Asia for year 2016, and the AOD retrieval results were validated against the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) sites observation and compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 6.0 AOD product. The validation of the retrieved AOD with AERONET measurements using 14 713 colocation points in 2016 over East Asia shows a high correlation coefficient: R = 0.88, root-mean-square error = 0.17, and approximately 69.9% AOD retrieval results within the expected error of +/- 0.2 . AOD(AERONET) +/- 0.05. A brief comparison between our retrieval and AOD product provided by Japan Meteorological Agency is also presented. The comparison and validation demonstrates that the algorithm has the ability to estimate AOD with considerable accuracy over land.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of surface hydrological parameters for Kyushu Island, Japan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Defining the surface hydrological parameters represents a crucial factor for the sustainable development purposes. In areas with heavy precipitation and rugged topography, these parameters control the occurrence of some natural hazards, from which the flash flood gets the most attention. Traditional methods for the assessment of the surface hydrological parameters are costly, time-consuming and provide information for limited geographic extent. On the other hand, remotely sensed data provide a cost-effective, rapid and wide aerial coverage with adequate accuracy. Geospatial analysis of these remotely sensed data provides a suitable and effective method for the reconnaissance determination of the surface hydrological parameters. In this work, digital elevation models, Landsat 8 satellite images as well as digital maps of soil and land use for Kyushu Island were acquired and analyzed using geographic information system. Surface hydrological parameters were determined in terms of watershed boundaries, soil moisture, initial abstraction as well as flash flood potentiality. Results of this research show a great correlation with historical flash flood events that occurred in the island. The northern parts of the island are subjected to the threat of flash floods. A follow-up is recommended in some areas on the island. As a conclusion, the geospatial analysis performs an accurate reconnaissance method for hydrological analysis at regional scale, which in turn guides the detailed field observation saving time and cost.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Fusion Based Cloud Removal Method for Remote Sensing Images With Land Cover Changes
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud contamination greatly limits the potential utilization of optical remote sensing images for geoscience applications. Many solutions have been developed to remove the clouds from multispectral images. Among these approaches, the temporal-based methods which borrow complementary information from multitemporal images outperform the other methods. However, the common fundamental supposition of the temporal-based methods decides that they are only suitable for scenes with phenological changes, while they perform poorly in cases with significant land cover changes. In this paper, a cloud removal procedure based on multisource data fusion is developed to overcome this limitation. On the basis of the temporal-based approaches, which employ a cloud-free image as reference, this method further introduces two auxiliary images with similar wavelengths and close acquisition dates to the reference and target (contaminated) images into the reconstruction process. The temporal variability of the land cover is captured from the two auxiliary images through a modified spatiotemporal data fusion model, and thus, the serious errors produced by the temporal-based methods can be avoided. Moreover, a residual correction strategy based on the Poisson equation is used to enhance the spectral coherence between the recovered and remaining regions. The experiments confirmed that the proposed method can perform very well for cases with significant land cover changes. Compared with some state-of-the-art approaches, it produces lower bias and more robust efficacy. In conclusion, our method will act as an important technical supplement to the current cloud removal framework, and it provides the possibility to handle scenes with significant land cover changes.

TI  - Mapping Annual Forest Change Due to Afforestation in Guangdong Province of China Using Active and Passive Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate acquisition of spatial distribution of afforestation in a large area is of great significance to contributing to the sustainable utilization of forest resources and the evaluation of the carbon accounting. Annual forest maps (1986-2016) of Guangdong, China were generated using time series Landsat images and PALSAR data. Initially, four PALSAR-based classifiers were used to classify land cover types. Then, the optimal mapping algorithm was determined. Next, an accurate identification of forest and non-forest was carried out by combining Landsat-based phenological variables and PALSAR-based land cover classifications. Finally, the spatio-temporal distribution of forest cover change due to afforestation was created and its forest biomass dynamics changes were detected. The results indicated that the overall accuracy of forest classification of the improved model based on the PALSAR-based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) classification and the maximum value of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; SGB-NDVI) were approximately 75-85% in 2005, 2010, and 2016. Compared with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) PALSAR-forest/non-forest, the SGB-NDVI-based forest product showed great improvement, while the SGB-NDVI product was the same or slightly inferior to the Global Land Cover (GLC) and vegetation tracker change (VCT)-based land cover types, respectively. Although this combination of multiple sources contained some errors, the SGB-NDVI model effectively identified the distribution of forest cover changes by afforestation events. By integrating aboveground biomass dynamics (AGB) change with forest cover, the trend in afforestation area closely corresponded with the trend in forest AGB. This technique can provide an essential data baseline for carbon assessment in the planted forests of southern China.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal variations of aerosol optical depth over Yellow and Bohai Sea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) level-2 Dark Target (DT) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations at 550nm (AOD(550)) for the highest quality flag assurance (QA=3) were obtained to analyze spatiotemporal variations of aerosol optical properties over the Yellow and the Bohai Sea from 2002 to 2017. Spectral AOD observations at 470nm (AOD(470)) and 660nm (AOD(660)) were obtained to calculate Angstrom Exponent (AE(470-660)) and classify the aerosol types including clean continental (CC), clean maritime (CM) biomass and urban industrial (BUI), dust (D), and mixed (MXD) aerosol types. Results showed a very distinct spatial pattern of AOD distribution over the Bohai Sea which looks suspicious, i.e., high aerosol loadings (AOD>0.8) throughout the entire time period, whereas relative low AOD distribution was observed over the adjacent land pixels especially in autumn and winter, which suggested that the DT algorithm might be influenced by a large number of sediments located in the Bohai Sea. Significant differences in spatial distributions were found in different seasons in terms of area coverage as a maximum number of pixels were available during autumn, and regional high and low aerosol loadings were observed during autumn and summer, respectively. Trend analysis from 2002 to 2017 showed that AOD was increased up to 0.04 over the Bohai Sea and decreased up to 0.04 over the Yellow Sea, and this trend varies from month to month. Aerosol classification showed significant contributions of BUI and CC over the region, and contributions of CM, DUST, and MXD aerosols over the Yellow Sea were relatively high compared to the Bohai Sea.

TI  - An insight into land-cover changes and their impacts on ecosystem services before and after the implementation of a comprehensive experimental zone plan in Pingtan island, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pingtan Island has undergone changes in socio-economic and policy environment with significant effect on land cover change (LCC) and ecosystem service values (ESV). The most notable changes in both land cover and ESV were linked to Pingtan Comprehensive Experimental Zone (PCEZ) plan, economic development plan with the aim of making Pingtan an international tourism island and free trade zone. However, evaluation of LCC and its impact on ESV is not yet attempted in the area. Using multispectral Landsat images, value transfer method and socioeconomic data, this study aims to quantify and track LCC, landscape pattern and ESV (2003-2017). The results showed that farmland, forest land and urban land covered > 74% of the total area in the years considered. The class-to-class transition was also substantial among them. During the period 2003-2010, LCC was slow with stable areas of 73.52%. In the second period (2010-2017), it showed remarkable differences with the highest change in water bodies (9.76% less than its initial proportion), urban land (9.47% higher), farmland (8.67% less) and the stable areas reduced to 63.87%. Regardless of class-level variations, landscape fragmentation generally increased but shape irregularity among patches decreased during the study period. The total ESV was 32 million US$ in 2003. It changed slowly in the first period (1.61%/year) and rapidly in the second period (-2.869%/year) that caused the overall net loss of 4.35 million US$ (13.594%). Partial least square regression model also showed the highest variance of ESV (85%) due to the variance of LCC (92%), whereas it exhibited less variance owing to the variance of landscape pattern. Following PCEZ plan, the policy reforms accelerated construction land and economic development that negatively affected ecosystem services. Our results could help understand the relationship between LCC and ESV along with socioeconomic and policy factors to make sustainable land management interventions.

TI  - Forest degradation monitoring and assessment of biomass in Harenna Buluk District, Bale Zone, Ethiopia: a geospatial perspective
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest is one of the major natural resources which play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of nature. Detection of forest degradation with remote sensing remains a challenging field of study. Over exploitation of forest resources has resulted in the depletion of the extent and quality forests resources. The present study was undertaken to monitor deforestation, forest degradation, and biomass estimation using remote sensing and GIS technology in Harenna Buluk District in Ethiopia. Supervised classification technique was applied to landsat images of 1995, 2005 and 2016. Satellite images were classified into different land-use/land-cover classes using maximum likelihood algorithm with the aid of field observations and Google Earth. Forest degradation was assessed using object-based image analysis from Sentinel-2A satellite image. Results of this study have revealed that during 1995-2005 and 2005-2016, forest and shrubland areas were decreased by 119.2 km(2) (6.19%) and 12.1 km(2) (0.62%), respectively. The extent of farmland, bareland, grassland, settlement and water body were increased by 99.94 km(2) (5.19%), 43.11 km(2) (2.24%), 75.78 km(2) (3.94%), 20.54 km(2) (1.06%) and 6.93 km(2) (0.36%), respectively. As a result, the biomass dramatically decreased. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value decreased significantly during 1995-2016 indicating that the vegetation cover in the study area was highly disturbed. The estimated degradation during the year 2016 was 145.91 km(2) (7.58%), while deforestation accounted for 171.39 km(2) (8.91%) of the total study area. Thus, advanced satellite images are useful to monitor forest cover and degradation processes of natural habitats in the context of human related impacts.

AB  - Background/Aim: One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a newly developed procedure for detection of node metastasis by targeting CK19 mRNA. This study aimed to compare the prognosis of ER-positive/HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer patients with negative sentinel lymph node (SLN), as determined by OSNA with that determined by pathology. Patients and Methods: A total of 508 patients who underwent breast surgery and SLN biopsy were enrolled. Of 263 patients with negative SLN by OSNA (osN0), 239 were treated with endocrine therapy alone (osN0-ET), and of 107 with negative SLN by pathology (pN0), 103 were treated with endocrine therapy alone (pN0-ET). Results: Distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) of osN0-ET group (99.5% at 6 years) was significantly better (p=0.044) than that of pN0-ET group. Multivariate analysis revealed that osN0 was significantly associated (p=0.019) with favorable DRFS. Conclusion: ER+/HER2-breast cancer patients with negative SLN by OSNA show an excellent prognosis with endocrine therapy alone.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can inform agricultural knowledge of crop water use through observation of land surface temperature, which can act as an indicator of plant function and health. This study uses remotely sensed data to quantify thermal variability within fruit and nut orchards during an intense drought period in California's Central Valley (2013-2015). First, fractions of green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil were derived for a variety of crop species using visible-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectra imaged by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Fractional estimates were then used to select thermal endmembers for each class using simultaneously collected MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) thermal imagery and a crop species map. Expected pixel temperatures of non-stressed crop fields were then modeled, and the per-pixel difference between measured and expected temperatures was calculated as a temperature residual. Crop residuals serve to capture variability in temperature that may be attributable to differences in crop health and/or management practices. We found multiple distinct thermal classes to exist across the study site. Furthermore, crop temperatures correlated to expected crop ET rates, and temperature residuals showed correlations to changes in crop yields during the study period. Further assessment of findings revealed an increase in temperature residuals during the study period that is consistent with increasing stress, likely linked to the progression of drought. The method presented here shows utility for regional agricultural analysis of crop water use and is particularly relevant for ECOSTRESS and the upcoming Surface Biology & Geology mission.

AB  - Cyanobacteria, as well as green algae and higher plants, have highly conserved photosynthetic machinery. Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 is a unicellular, aerobic, diazotrophic cyanobacterium that fixes N-2 in the dark. In Cyanothece, the psbA gene family is composed of five members, encoding different isoforms of the D1 protein. A new D1 protein has been postulated in the literature, which blocks PSII during the night and allows the fixation of nitrogen. We present data showing changes in PSII function in cells grown in cycles alternating between 12h of light and dark, respectively, at Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 uses intrinsic mechanisms to protect its nitrogenase activity in a two-stage process. In Stage I, immediately after the onset of darkness, the cells lose photosynthetic activity in a reversible process, probably by dissociation of water oxidation complex from photosystem II via a mechanism that does not require de novo protein synthesis. In Stage II, a more severe disruption of photosystem II function occurs is in part protein synthesis dependent and it could be a functional signature of the presence of sentinel D1 in a limited number of reaction centers still active or not yet inactivated by the mechanism described in Stage I. This process of inhibition uses light as a triggering signal for both the inhibition of photosynthetic activity and recovery when light returns. The intrinsic mechanism of photosynthetic inactivation during darkness with the interplay of the two mechanisms requires further studies.

TI  - Using time-lapse omics correlations to integrate toxicological pathways of a formulated fungicide in a soil invertebrate
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of an integrative molecular approach can actively improve the evaluation of environmental health status and impact of chemicals, providing the knowledge to develop sentinel tools that can be integrated in risk assessment studies, since gene and protein expressions represent the first response barriers to anthropogenic stress.This work aimed to determine the mechanisms of toxic action of a widely applied fungicide formulation (chlorothalonil), following a time series approach and using a soil model arthropod, Folsomia candida. To link effects at different levels of biological organization, data were collected on reproduction, gene expression and protein levels, in a time series during exposure to a natural soil.Results showed a mechanistic mode of action for chlorothalonil, affecting pathways of detoxification and excretion, immune response, cellular respiration, protein metabolism and oxidative stress defense, causing irregular cell signaling (JNK and NOD 'A pathways), DNA damage and abnormal cell proliferation, leading to impairment in developmental features such as molting cycle and reproduction. The omics datasets presented highly significant positive correlations between the gene expression levels at a certain time-point and the corresponding protein products 2-3 days later. The integrated omics in this study has provided useful insights into pesticide mechanisms of toxicity, evidencing the relevance of such analyses in toxicological studies, and highlighting the importance of considering a time-series when integrating these datasets.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Different Surgical Procedures for Axillary Staging After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Node-positive Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of different surgical axillary staging procedures compared with ALND.Summary of Background Data: Optimal axillary staging after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) in node-positive breast cancer is an area of controversy. Several less invasive procedures, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), marking axillary lymph node with radioactive iodine seed (MARI), and targeted axillary dissection (a combination of SLNB and a MARI-like procedure), have been proposed to replace the conventional axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with its concomitant morbidity.Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched for studies comparing less invasive surgical axillary staging procedures to ALND to identify axillary burden after NST in patients with pathologically confirmed node-positive breast cancer (cNthorn). A meta-analysis was performed to compare identification rate (IFR), false-negative rate (FNR), and negative predictive value (NPV).Results: Of 1132 records, 20 unique studies with 2217 patients were included in quantitative analysis: 17 studies on SLNB, 1 study on MARI, and 2 studies on a combination procedure. Overall axillary pathologic complete response rate was 37%. For SLNB, pooled rates of IFR and FNR were 89% and 17%. NPV ranged from 57% to 86%. For MARI, IFR was 97%, FNR 7%, and NPV 83%. For the combination procedure, IFR was 100%, FNR ranged from 2% to 4%, and NPV from 92% to 97%.Conclusion: Axillary staging by a combination procedure consisting of SLNB with excision of a pre-NST marked positive lymph node appears to be most accurate for axillary staging after NST. More evidence from prospective multicenter trials is needed to confirm this.

TI  - Geo-spatial Modeling for Automated Demarcation of Snow Avalanche Hazard Areas Using Landsat-8 Satellite Images and In Situ Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to generate a reliable dynamic snow avalanche hazard map using analytical hierarchy process method based on multisource geo-spatial data for the Chowkibal-Tangdhar (C-T) road axis in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India. Avalanche-prone areas of C-T axis have been demarcated using three causative parameters, i.e., terrain, ground cover and meteorological parameters. Terrain parameters, e.g., elevation, slope, aspect and curvature, have been estimated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2. Ground cover information has been extracted from Landsat-8 data. Meteorological parameters maps, i.e., snow depth, relative humidity and air temperature, have been generated using geo-spatial interpolation techniques of in situ data. All the parameters have been incorporated in Geographic Information System environment to generate the hazard map. Validation of hazard map was accomplished with the area under the curve method. The prediction rate was observed to be 93.2%. Further, 20% of the study area was estimated having no hazard, 55% as low hazard, 12% as moderate hazard and 13% as high hazard on April 13, 2015. Dynamic hazard map thus generated using remote sensing and in situ data will be useful for mitigation of snow avalanche hazard, regional planning for development of infrastructure, transportation, troops movement, army deployments and communication network.

TI  - Evaluating the influence of watershed characteristics on flood vulnerability of Markanda River basin in north-west India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrain characteristics determine the hydrological response behaviour of watershed systems and have serious effect on incidence and magnitude of floods. Assessment of floods in watershed systems is one of the most complex processes in hydrological investigations. Therefore, this study evaluates the influence of watershed terrain characteristics on flood vulnerability of Markanda River basin in north-west India based on geospatial techniques coupled with field data. This basin is subjected to frequent floods during monsoons (July-September) causing heavy damage to agriculture and other infrastructure. For this study, Cartosat-1-based digital elevation model was used as input data in geographic information system to delineate the Markanda basin and its sub-basins. Subsequently, various watershed characteristics (linear, areal, shape and relief) were selected, measured, calculated and interlinked to evaluate the degree of flood vulnerability. These selected characteristics were both directly and inversely proportional to flooding behaviour. The results of these parameters were analysed and categorized into three classes using simple statistical technique, and then, rank score was assigned to each class of all selected parameters depending on its relation to flood hazard. Apart from this, flood vulnerability was recognized and categorized into high, moderate and low degree of hazard. Analysis reveals that about 7, 21 and 72% area of the basin is vulnerable to high, moderate and low degree of floods, respectively. High flood vulnerable areas are located in upper reaches where about 2.8% of human population is settled. These reaches are characterized by steep slopes, impermeable and barren surfaces and high basin relief. The accuracy of vulnerable areas was assessed through secondary data pertaining to past floods damages such as number of affected villages, households and population, economic losses, relief released, crop damages and human casualties. The findings of this study can assist disaster managers in initiating the flood mitigation measures in highly vulnerable areas of Markanda basin in north-west India.

TI  - Observing Larsen C ice-shelf using ISRO's SCATSAT-1 data
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - ISRO's SCATSAT-1 is a miniature satellite which serves as a continuity mission to the bygone Oceansat-2. Three important parameters from SCATSAT-1 are made available through the Meteorological & Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC), Space Applications Centre-ISRO. They are the backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)), incidence angle normalized backscattering coefficient or the gamma naught (gamma(0)) and the scatterometer noise-derived brightness temperature (T-b). In this paper, an attempt has been made to use the initially available SCATSAT-1 data in native resolution of 25 km as well as the enhanced resolution at 0.225 degrees to explore the Larsen C ice-shelf, West Antarctica during the recent calving event of 2017. Moreover, a preliminary study on the plausible melt conditions over the shelf is reported.

TI  - Accounting tropical forest carbon stock with synergistic use of space-borne ALOS PALSAR and COSMO-Skymed SAR sensors
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to precisely quantify the forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon stock in a tropical deciduous forest with synergistic use of space-borne L-band ALOS PALSAR and X-band COSMO-Skymed SAR data, along with field inventory data. AGB serves as a decisive parameter for preparing global decision making policy targeting the impact of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and climate change. The study proposed optimal regression models for assessing above-ground bole biomass over tropical deciduous mixed forests of Munger (Bihar, India) with synergistic use of ALOS PALSAR and COSMO-Skymed sigma nought images. Coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.89 and RMSE of 15.12 Mg ha(-1) were calculated for the best fit integrated model. On validation, the integrated model produced a model accuracy of 78%, r(2)=0.89, RMSE=16.64 Mg ha(-1) and Willmott's index of agreement of 0.934. Resulting modeled AGB were converted to carbon and carbon dioxide equivalents using conversion factors. L-band showed higher accuracy in the estimation in comparison to X-band; but the estimation accuracy improved with the synergistic use of both X- and L-band SAR data. Hence, the study recommends the combined use of X- and L-band SAR with exceptional capabilities for improved assessment of tropical forest stand AGB and carbon with significant contribution towards operational forestry and policy making.

TI  - HIERARCHICAL SYSTEMACY OF SECONDARY MYTHOLOGICAL REALITY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Myth is a priori collective worldview paradigm, taken as a model. Some cultural strata, compiled as allusions, based on primary cultural characteristics such as consciousness syncretism, archetype usage, create secondary mythological reality. Fantasy is one of the most productive genres. It is difficult to be distinguished among all the other fictions of this kind. A link between these two notions, myths and fantasy, is obvious. Most of fantasies are composed on the basis of one or amalgam of mythologies, constructed in hierarchy, and syncretism. Tolkien is not the father but a Godfather of fantasy. He did make this genre popular, but was not the pioneer. His stories, being a typical secondary mythological reality, are unique in depth and challenge, though their semantic complexity, close to ancient sagas, is difficult for modern readers to be comprehended. These tales are of linguistic nature, very polysemantic, intended to reconstruct lost authentic Anglo-Saxon mythological system in all its hierarchical complexity.

TI  - The Impact of Noise in a GRACE/GOCE Global Gravity Model on a Local Quasi-Geoid
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a local quasi-geoid (QG) model which combines a satellite-only global gravity model with local data sets using weighted least squares. The QG is computed for an area comprising the Netherlands, Belgium, and the southern North Sea. It uses a two-scale spherical radial basis function model complemented by bias parameters to account for systematic errors in the local gravity data sets. Variance factors are estimated for the noise covariance matrices of all involved data sets using variance component estimation. The standard deviation (SD) of the differences between the computed QG and GPS/leveling data is 0.95 and 1.52cm for the Netherlands and Belgium, respectively. The fact that the SD of the control data is about 0.60 and 1.20cm for the Netherlands and Belgium, respectively, points to a lower mean SD of the computed QG model of about 0.7cm for the Netherlands and 1.0cm for Belgium. The differences to a QG model computed with the remove-compute-restore technique range from -5.2 to 2.6cm over the whole model domain and from -1.5 to 1.5cm over the Netherlands and Belgium. A variogram analysis of the differences with respect to GPS/leveling data reveals a better performance of the computed QG model compared to a remove-compute-restore-based QG model for wavelengths >100km for Belgium but not for the Netherlands. The latter is due to the fact that at the spatial scales resolved by the global gravity model, variance component estimation assigns significantly lower weights to the local data set in favor of the global gravity model.

TI  - Review of pig health and welfare surveillance data sources in England and Wales
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Review
AB  - The capability to set baselines and monitor trends of health and welfare conditions is an important requirement for livestock industries in order to maintain economic competitiveness and sustainability. Monitoring schemes evaluate the relative importance of conditions so that: appropriate actions can be determined, prioritised and implemented; new and (re) emerging conditions can be promptly detected and the effectiveness of any actions can be measured. In 2011, the national pig levy board published a strategy document highlighting health and welfare conditions of importance to the pig industry that were to be targeted for control. In this study, existing schemes that could be used to monitor or set baselines for these conditions in pigs were reviewed, in order to evaluate their suitability for this purpose, using a standardised surveillance evaluation framework (SERVAL). The schemes included: government-funded surveillance of endemic and exotic disease and pig welfare; industry surveillance of endemic diseases; regional schemes for improving pig health; national accreditation schemes and information collected by retailers, private veterinary practices and private laboratories. The evaluation of each scheme highlights its capability to monitor any of the targeted conditions. This study identifies the biases, strengths and gaps in each scheme and provides discussion of opportunities for future development.

TI  - Comparison of Landsat and Land-Based Phenology Camera Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for Dominant Plant Communities in the Great Basin
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology of plants is important for ecological interactions. The timing and development of green leaves, plant maturity, and senescence affects biophysical interactions of plants with the environment. In this study we explored the agreement between land-based camera and satellite-based phenology metrics to quantify plant phenology and phenophases dates in five plant community types characteristic of the semi-arid cold desert region of the Great Basin. Three years of data were analyzed. We calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for both land-based cameras (i.e., phenocams) and Landsat imagery. NDVI from camera images was calculated by taking a standard RGB (red, green, and blue) image and then a near infrared (NIR) plus RGB image. Phenocam NDVI was calculated by extracting the red digital number (DN) and the NIR DN from images taken a few seconds apart. Landsat has a spatial resolution of 30 m(2), while phenocam spatial resolution can be analyzed at the single pixel level at the scale of cm(2) or area averaged regions can be analyzed with scales up to 1 km(2). For this study, phenocam regions of interest were used that approximated the scale of at least one Landsat pixel. In the tall-statured pinyon and juniper woodland sites, there was a lack of agreement in NDVI between phenocam and Landsat NDVI, even after using National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery to account for fractional coverage of pinyon and juniper versus interspace in the phenocam data. Landsat NDVI appeared to be dominated by the signal from the interspace and was insensitive to subtle changes in the pinyon and juniper tree canopy. However, for short-statured sagebrush shrub and meadow communities, there was good agreement between the phenocam and Landsat NDVI as reflected in high Pearson's correlation coefficients (r > 0.75). Due to greater temporal resolution of the phenocams with images taken daily, versus the 16-day return interval of Landsat, phenocam data provided more utility in determining important phenophase dates: start of season, peak of season, and end of season. More specific species-level information can be obtained with the high temporal resolution of phenocams, but only for a limited number of sites, while Landsat can provide the multi-decadal history and spatial coverage that is unmatched by other platforms. The agreement between Landsat and phenocam NDVI for short-statured plant communities of the Great Basin, shows promise for monitoring landscape and regional-level plant phenology across large areas and time periods, with phenocams providing a more comprehensive understanding of plant phenology at finer spatial scales, and Landsat extending the historical record of observations.

TI  - Acute Toxicity of Chlorpyrifos to Hyalella curvispina: Comparison of Species Sensitivity and Assessment of Environmental Risk
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the work reported here was to determine the acute toxicity of chlorpyrifosthe most commonly used pesticide in Argentinato the amphipod Hyalella curvispina, with that species being widely distributed in South America. The 50% lethal concentration (LC 50) of chlorpyrifos to H. curvispina was determined and compared to that of other crustacean species by means of the species-sensitivity distribution (SSD). The ecological risk was assessed as the Hazard Quotient (HQ). The mean 48-h LC50 recorded in this study was 0.38 +/- 0.04g/L. Hyalella curvispina was considerably sensitive compared to other crustacean species reported in the literature. The HQ values calculated from the LC50s estimated here and the chlorpyrifos concentrations reported in previous studies in the Argentine Pampas ranged within 0.6-46. The chlorpyrifos concentrations in those stream waters were often above the H. curvispina 48-h LC50, indicating that acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos to H. curvispina is predicted to be occurring in these streams. The present results suggest that H. curvispina represents a suitable sentinel species for water-quality assessment and that H. curvispina along with similarly sensitive macroinvertebrate species in intensively cultivated areas in South America are likely to be affected by the application of chlorpyrifos to the neighboring crops.

TI  - Spatial variability of selected metals using auxiliary variables in agricultural soils
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial estimation of the content of soil heavy metals in agriculture is critical for monitoring farmland contamination and ensuring sustainable eco-agriculture. In this study, a hyperspectral image (115 bands) and 17 environmental parameters were used as auxiliary variables to predict the concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Pb and Zn in agricultural soils. The study also combined hybrid geostatistical methods, such as regression-ordinary kriging (ROK) and back propagation neural network-ordinary kriging (BPNNOK). To this end, a total of 100 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were collected in Zengcheng in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. The results showed that the BPNNOK with input principal components (PCs) from auxiliary variables had the best prediction performance for As (RMSE = 5.02 mg kg(-1) and R-2 = 64.21%), Cd (RMSE = 0.014 mg kg(-1) and R-2 = 61.82%), Cr (RMSE = 3.78 mg kg(-1) and R-2 = 54.39%), Pb (RMSE = 4.09 mg kg(-1) and R-2 = 60.92%), and Zn (RMSE = 2.86 mg kg(-1) and R-2 = 59.31%) in comparison with simple kriging (SK), ordinary kriging (OK) and ROK. The effects of hyperspectral remote sensing data exhibited the best sensitivity and responses for all soil heavy metals by the multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models, which were obviously superior to environmental parameters. It was concluded that information from hyperspectral remote sensing data is promising, and that the efficient use of auxiliary variables for monitoring sustainable pollution prevention and control of soil heavy metals, which improve mapping quality of soil heavy metals, is the primary process in non-point source variations of soil heavy metals.

TI  - Probabilistic snow cover and ensemble streamflow estimations in the Upper Euphrates Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting snow cover dynamics and relevant streamflow due to snowmelt is a challenging issue in mountainous basins. Spatio-temporal variations of snow extent can be analyzed using probabilistic snow cover maps derived from satellite images within a relatively long period. In this study, Probabilistic Snow Depletion Curves (P-SDCs) and Probabilistic Snow Lines (P-SLs) are acquired from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud-filtered daily snow cover images. Analyses of P-SDCs show a strong correlation with average daily runoff (R-2 = 0.90) and temperature (R-2 = 0.96). On the other hand, the challenge lies in developing noteworthy methods to use P-SDCs in streamflow estimations. Therefore, the main objective is to explore the feasibility of producing probabilistic runoff forecasts with P-SDC forcing in a snow dominated basin.Upper Euphrates Basin in Turkey has large snow extent and high snowmelt contribution during spring and summer periods. The melting characteristics are defined by P-SDCs using MODIS imagery for 2001-2012. The value of snow probability maps on ensemble runoff predictions is shown with Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) during 2013-2015 where the estimated runoff values indicate good consistency (NSE: 0.47-0.93) with forecasts based on the derived P-SDCs. Therefore, the probabilistic approach distinguishes the snow cover characteristics for a region and promotes a useful methodology on the application of probabilistic runoff predictions especially for snow dominated areas.

TI  - Using the 'dispersion-retention-formulation method' to estimate clinical and preclinical dosage limits for interstitial nanomedicines or agents
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Conference on the Scientific and Clinical Applications of Magnetic Carriers (MagMeet)
CL  - Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB  - We propose the "DRF method" for estimating dosage limits for interstitially administered therapeutic or diagnostic nanomedicines or agents from three characteristic parameters that can be experimentally determined from in vivo data. These are: (i) the dispersion of the injected fluid around the injection site; (ii) the retention of the injected fluid at the injection site; and (iii) the formulation characteristics of the fluid with respect to local and systemic tolerability. We present formulae that allow dose-limit estimates to be made for any preclinical model, as well as for clinical studies. We illustrate the DRF method for the case of iron-oxide-based magnetic fluids, with reference to the published dose limits of regulatory-body-approved magnetic nanoparticles for MRI contrast enhancement, sentinel node detection, iron replacement therapy, and magnetic thermoablation.

TI  - Influenza epidemics observed in primary care from 1984 to 2017 in France: A decrease in epidemic size over time
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Epidemiological analysis of past influenza epidemics remains essential to understand the evolution of the disease and optimize control and prevention strategies. Here, we aimed to use data collected by a primary care surveillance system over the last three decades to study trends in influenza epidemics and describe epidemic profiles according to circulating influenza viruses. Methods Influenza-like illness (ILI) weekly incidences were estimated using cases reported by general practitioners participating in the French Sentinelles network, between 1984 and 2017. Influenza epidemics were detected by applying a periodic regression to this time series. Epidemic (co-)dominant influenza virus (sub)types were determined using French virology data. Results During the study period, 297 607 ILI cases were reported allowing the detection of 33 influenza epidemics. On average, seasonal epidemics lasted 9 weeks and affected 4.1% of the population (95% CI 3.5; 4.7). Mean age of cases was 29 years. Epidemic size decreased over time by -66 cases per 100 000 population per season on average (95% CI -132; -0.2, P value = 0.049) and epidemic height decreased by -15 cases per 100 000 (95% CI -28; -2, P value = 0.022). Epidemic duration appeared stable over time. Epidemics were mostly dominated by A(H3N2) (n = 17, 52%), associated with larger epidemic size, higher epidemic peak and older age of cases. Conclusions The declining trend in influenza epidemic size and height over the last 33 years might be related to several factors like increased vaccine coverage, hygiene improvements or changing in influenza viruses. However, further researches are needed to assess the impact of potential contributing factors to adapt influenza plans.

TI  - Global Energy Dynamics During Substorms on 9 March 2008 and 26 February 2008 Using Satellite Observations and the WINDMI Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze three substorms that occur on (1) 9 March 2008 05:14 UT, (2) 26 February 2008 04:05 UT, and (3) 26 February 2008 04:55 UT. Using ACE solar wind velocity and interplanetary magnetic field B-z values, we calculate the rectified (southward B-z) solar wind voltage propagated to the magnetosphere. The solar wind conditions for the two events were vastly different, 300 kV for 9 March 2008 substorm, compared to 50 kV for 26 February 2008. The voltage is input to a nonlinear physics-based model of the magnetosphere called WINDMI. The output is the westward auroral electrojet current which is proportional to the auroral electrojet (AL) index from World Data Center for Geomagnetism Kyoto and the SuperMAG auroral electrojet index (SML). Substorm onset times are obtained from the superMAG substorm database, Pu et al. (2010, https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JA014217), Lui (2011, https://doi.org/10.1029/2010JA016078) and synchronized to Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms satellite data. The timing of onset, model parameters, and intermediate state space variables are analyzed. The model onsets occurred about 5 to 10 min earlier than the reported onsets. Onsets occurred when the geotail current in the WINDMI model reached a critical threshold of 6.2 MA for the 9 March 2008 event, while, in contrast, a critical threshold of 2.1 MA was obtained for the two 26 February 2008 events. The model estimates 1.99 PJ of total energy transfer during the 9 March 2008 event, with 0.95 PJ deposited in the ionosphere. The smaller events on 26 February 2008 resulted in a total energy transfer of 0.37 PJ according to the model, with 0.095 PJ deposited in the ionosphere.

TI  - Identification of paleochannels in and around "Chandraketugarh", Ganges Delta through remote sensing techniques using fuzzy inference system
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for identification of most probable paleochannels in and around Chandraketugarh (an archeological site in the western part of Ganges Delta) was developed through remote sensing techniques using fuzzy inference system (FIS). The method was adopted considering the uniqueness of the geomorphology in terms of terrain homogeneity of the area. In order to categorize different geomorphological features, NDVI, NDWI, and elevation datasets were generated using multispectral images (LISS III) and CARTOSAT I datasets. Based on the unique spectral signatures of the different geomorphological units, the said datasets were critically examined to be utilized as the input parameters of the employed FIS-based image segmentation method. The result of subsequent analysis lead to development of a land use/land cover (LULC) map which portrayed inferred paleochannels. The developed method was validated with reference to a finer resolution image and ground truth datasets. It is concluded that the newly developed FIS-based method is quite efficient for identifying probable paleochannels in a terrain where slope variation is minimal and geomorphology does not seem to have been strongly affected by structural elements.

TI  - Bridging the Gap Between Health Psychology and Philosophy: An Existential Approach to Promoting Physical Activity
T2  - PHYSICAL CULTURE AND SPORT STUDIES AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Participation rates in a number of health-related behaviors, such as physical activity, have shown recent declines. To promote participation, psychological health behavior change theories have been developed to understand and help identify relevant psychological processes. Such processes can then be targeted within interventions utilizing specific behavior change techniques (BCTs). Although the use of these theories and BCTs is useful in facilitating change, such work could be enhanced through the inclusion and consideration of philosophical positions. Existentialism suggests that the absurdity and meaningless of human life allows the individual to create their own meaning within a behavior. This philosophical position thus places meaning and individual purpose at the center of human behavior. The purpose of this article is to connect the theoretical insights and BCTs outlined within health psychological behavior change theories with the philosophical position of existentialism. The integration of this philosophical position, and potentially many others, with psychological ideas may provide useful insights into the promotion of health-related behaviors.

T2  - FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING AND DECISION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article I defend the thesis that modern computer science has a significant philosophical potential, which is expressed in a form of worldview, called here informational worldview (IVW). It includes such theses like: a) each being contains a certain informational content (which may be revealed by computer science concepts, such as code or algorithm), b) the mind is an information processing system (which should be modeled by means of data processing systems), c) cognition is a type of computation. These (pre)philosophical theses are accepted in many sciences (e.g. in cognitive science), and this is both an expression and strengthening of the IWV. After a general discussion of the relations between philosophy, particular sciences and the worldview, and then the presentation of the basic assumptions and theses of the IWV, I analyze a certain specification of thesis b) expressed in the statement that "the mind is the Turing machine". I distinguish three concepts of mind (static, variable and minimal) and explain how each of them is connected with the concept of the Turing machine.

TI  - First discovery of adventive populations of Trissolcus japonicus in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), native to East Asia, emerged as an invasive pest in Europe in the 2000s. In its native range, Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) is the dominant egg parasitoid of H. halys, and thus it has been considered for classical biological control in countries invaded by the pest. A survey of native egg parasitoids conducted in 2017 and 2018 with frozen, sentinel egg masses of H. halys revealed that T. japonicus was already present in apple orchards in the Canton Ticino, Switzerland. Trissolcus japonicus was recovered in both years and from three different sites. In total, 17 egg masses were recovered from which 42 adult parasitoids emerged. A genetic analysis using the barcode mitochondrial DNA confirmed the morphological identification of T. japonicus and evidenced a best match of the Ticino populations to Japanese populations, but the pathways of entry remain unknown.

TI  - The Presence of Western Esotericism in Latvian Literature
T2  - FORUM FOR WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - After detecting a gap in cultural studies regarding the influence of Western esotericism on Latvian culture, this paper attempts to illustrate the presence of Western esotericism in Latvian literature. From the late 19th century, Latvian writers searching for new means of expression found a source of inspiration in esotericism, gaining metaphors and symbols from Spiritualism, Theosophy and Agni Yoga/Living Ethics. With particular attention paid to Antons Austrins (1884-1934), Viktors Egliris (1877-1945), Rihards Rudzitis (1898-1960) and Konstantins Raudive (1909-1974), the author seeks to show, that the influence of esotericism on the creative work of writers strongly differs: some adopted esoteric ideas without a critical approach, others did some sifting and reworked them, while others, having read a few esoteric texts or having heard something about it, just got some idea or image. As the artist's worldview is reflected directly in their creative work independently of the author's own will, the paper argues that it would be timely for contemporary literary studies to focus greater attention on the connection of authors with Western esotericism.

TI  - Estimating Rice Agronomic Traits Using Drone-Collected Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of rice nitrogen (N) requirements and uptake capacity are fundamental for the development of improved N management. This paper presents empirical models for predicting agronomic traits that are relevant to yield and N requirements of rice (Oryza sativa L.) through remotely sensed data. Multiple linear regression models were constructed at key growth stages (at tillering and at booting), using as input reflectance values and vegetation indices obtained from a compact multispectral sensor (green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared channels) onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The models were constructed using field data and images from two consecutive years in a number of experimental rice plots in Greece (Thessaloniki Regional Unit), by applying four different N treatments (C0: 0 N kg.ha(-1), C1: 80 N kg.ha(-1), C2: 160 N kg.ha(-1), and C4: 320 N kg.ha(-1)). Models for estimating the current crop status (e.g., N uptake at the time of image acquisition) and predicting the future one (e.g., N uptake of grains at maturity) were developed and evaluated. At the tillering stage, high accuracies (R-2 0.8) were achieved for N uptake and biomass. At the booting stage, similarly high accuracies were achieved for yield, N concentration, N uptake, biomass, and plant height, using inputs from either two or three images. The results of the present study can be useful for providing N recommendations for the two top-dressing fertilizations in rice cultivation, through a cost-efficient workflow.

TI  - Ritual economy and ancient Maya bloodletting: Obsidian blades from Actun Uayazba Kab (Handprint Cave), Belize
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ancient Maya material culture can be investigated from the perspective of ritual economy as a means to interpret the dynamic interrelationships between economic processes and the use of objects in ritual activities. Such interrelationships include access to raw materials, control of production and consumption, and the legitimate use of objects in various activities, including rites and performances, as constituted through a culture's worldview. This paper presents an exploration of the relationship between obsidian blades and bloodletting in Maya ritual contexts from the perspective of ritual economy, highlighting the use of blades in Actun Uayazba Kab (Handprint Cave) in Western Belize. The roles of producers, consumers, practitioners, and observers are examined in terms of gender, status, and power by tracing the functional and ideological characteristics of obsidian blades, as both objects used to let blood and as symbols of bloodletting, based on evidence derived from microscopic use-wear analysis and iconography. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric information is employed to assist in contextualizing ancient Maya ritual activity in caves and to provide a cultural lens to reconstruct how bloodletting was connected to resource production and consumption, the creation and maintenance of identity, and the allocation of power among Maya participants through ritual.

TI  - Exploiting Time Series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery to Detect Meadow Phenology in Mountain Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A synergic integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical time series offers an unprecedented opportunity in vegetation phenology monitoring for mountain agriculture management. In this paper, we performed a correlation analysis of radar signal to vegetation and soil conditions by using a time series of Sentinel-1 C-band dual-polarized (VV and VH) SAR images acquired in the South Tyrol region (Italy) from October 2014 to September 2016. Together with Sentinel-1 images, we exploited corresponding Sentinel-2 images and ground measurements. Results show that Sentinel-1 cross-polarized VH backscattering coefficients have a strong vegetation contribution and are well correlated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values retrieved from optical sensors, thus allowing the extraction of meadow phenological phases. Particularly for the Start Of Season (SOS) at low altitudes, the mean difference in days between Sentinel-1 and ground sensors is compatible with the acquisition time of the SAR sensor. However, the results show a decrease in accuracy with increasing altitude. The same trend is observed for senescence. The main outcomes of our investigations in terms of inter-satellite comparison show that Sentinel-1 is less effective than Sentinel-2 in detecting the SOS. At the same time, Sentinel-1 is as robust as Sentinel-2 in defining mowing events. Our study shows that SAR-Optical data integration is a promising approach for phenology detection in mountain regions.

TI  - Equivalences among five game specifications, including a new specification whose nodes are sets of past choices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current literature formally links "ORforms" (named afterOsborne and Rubinstein, in A course in game theory. MIT, London, 1994) with "KS forms" (named after Kuhn and Selten by Kline and Luckraz, in Econ Theory Bull 4: 85-94, 2016). It also formally links "simple forms" with "AR forms" (the former is less prominent than the latter, and both are from Alos-Ferrer and Ritzberger, in The theory of extensive form games. Springer, Berlin, 2016a). This paper makes three contributions. First, it introduces a fifth game form whose nodes are sets of past choices. Second, it formally links these new "choice-set forms" with OR forms. Third, it formally links KS forms with simple forms. The result is a formal five-way equivalence which provides game theorists with a broad spectrum of alternative game specifications.

TI  - Ocean circulation along the southern Chile transition region (38°-46°S): Mean, seasonal and interannual variability, with a focus on 2014-2016
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite and atmospheric model fields are used to describe the wind forcing, surface ocean circulation, temperature and chlorophyll-a pigment concentrations along the coast of southern Chile in the transition region between 38 degrees and 46 degrees S. Located inshore of the bifurcation of the eastward South Pacific Current into the equator-ward Humboldt and the poleward Cape Horn Currents, the region also includes the Chiloe Inner Sea and the northern extent of the complex system of fjords, islands and canals that stretch south from near 42 degrees S. The high resolution satellite data reveal that equatorward currents next to the coast extend as far south as 48 degrees-51 degrees S in spring-summer. They also display detailed distributions of forcing from wind stress and wind stress curl near the coast and within the Inner Sea. Between 38 degrees-46 degrees S, both winds and surface currents during 1993-2016 change directions seasonally from equatorward during summer upwelling to poleward during winter downwelling, with cooler SST and greater surface chlorophyll-a concentrations next to the coast during upwelling, opposite conditions during downwelling. Over interannual time scales during 1993-2016, there is a strong correlation between equatorial El Nino events and sea level and a moderate correlation with alongshore currents. Looking more closely at the 2014-2016 period, we find a marginal El Nino during 2014 and a strong El Nilio during 2015 that connect the region to the tropics through the oceanic pathway, with some atmospheric connections through the phenomenon of atmospheric blocking (as noted by others). The period also includes a Harmful Algal Bloom of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella during early-2016 that occurred during a sequence of physical conditions (winds, currents and temperatures) that would favor such a bloom. The most anomalous physical condition during this specific bloom is an extreme case of atmospheric blocking that creates a long period of calm in austral autumn after strong upwelling in austral summer. The blocking is related to the 2015-2016 El Nino and an unusual coincident positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode.

TI  - Performance of wetland environmental quality assessment indicators at evaluating palustrine wetlands in northeastern New York State
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency delegates to States and Tribes primary responsibility for monitoring the condition of wetlands under their jurisdiction, and suggests that wetland assessment be performed in a buildable process deemed the 1-2-3 framework. Level One assessment uses remotely-sensed data, Level Two uses a checklist of site attributes during a single visit, and Level Three includes effortful field surveys of biotic and water quality indicators. We used 16 accepted wetland assessment metrics that varied in levels of effort to evaluate the ecological integrity of 71 palustrine wetlands in New York State, including wetlands with a broad range of disturbance histories. We detected significant correlations across multiple levels and within levels, which indicates that these metrics, regardless of effort, are measuring similar attributes of wetlands. Most metrics also successfully distinguished between three wetland disturbance groups: natural, restored, and Area of Concern. The implication of this finding is that the landscape setting (as assessed by Level One) is linked to the biotic wetland community (as assessed by Level Three), and can be used to predict the ecological condition of a wetland using less complex methods. The relationships did have limits, however, indicating that some metrics either cannot be substituted or may not be as effective as previously thought at evaluating ecological condition of palustrine wetlands. The positive associations among the Levels indicate that it is possible to efficiently and validly evaluate and monitor wetlands using the 1-2-3 framework with appropriately selected indicator metrics.

TI  - Retrieving Corn Canopy Leaf Area Index from Multitemporal Landsat Imagery and Terrestrial LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf angle is a critical structural parameter for retrieving canopy leaf area index (LAI) using the PROSAIL model. However, the traditional method using default leaf angle distribution in the PROSAIL model does not capture the phenological dynamics of canopy growth. This study presents a LAI retrieval method for corn canopies using PROSAIL model with leaf angle distribution functions referred from terrestrial laser scanning points at four phenological stages during the growing season. Specifically, four inferred maximum-probability leaf angles were used in the Campbell ellipsoid leaf angle distribution function of PROSAIL. A Lookup table (LUT) is generated by running the PROSAIL model with inferred leaf angles, and the cost function is minimized to retrieve LAI. The results show that the leaf angle distribution functions are different for the corn plants at different phenological growing stages, and the incorporation of derived specific corn leaf angle distribution functions distribute the improvement of LAI retrieval using the PROSAIL model. This validation is done using in-situ LAI measurements and MODIS LAI in Baoding City, Hebei Province, China, and compared with the LAI retrieved using default leaf angle distribution function at the same time. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the retrieved LAI on 4 September 2014, using the modified PROSAIL model and the in-situ measured LAI was 0.31 m(2)/m(2), with a strong and significant correlation (R-2 = 0.82, residual range = 0 to 0.6 m(2)/m(2), p < 0.001). Comparatively, the accuracy of LAI retrieved results using default leaf angle distribution is lower, the RMSE of which is 0.56 with R-2 = 0.76 and residual range = 0 to 1.0 m(2)/m(2), p < 0.001. This validation reveals that the introduction of inferred leaf angle distributions from TLS data points can improve the LAI retrieval accuracy using the PROSAIL model. Moreover, the comparations of LAI retrieval results on 10 July, 26 July, 19 August and 4 September with default and inferred corn leaf angle distribution functions are all compared with MODIS LAI products in the whole study area. This validation reveals that improvement exists in a wide spatial range and temporal range. All the comparisons demonstrate the potential of the modified PROSAIL model for retrieving corn canopy LAI from Landsat imagery by inferring leaf orientation from terrestrial laser scanning data.

TI  - Polar ice image segmentation using improved estimation and normalization of illumination
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud computing is a large-scale paradigm in computing that is driven by the economies of scale. It is a pool of the virtualized, abstracted, dynamically scalable, storage, platforms, managed power of computing and the services that are delivered based on demand to its external customers. With advent of cloud services, remote sensing data have been effectively used for identifying Region of Interest in various industries. Cloud computing will be well suited for all the computationally-intensive and also the data-intensive services of remote sensing. One popular application of remote sensing data is the estimation of ice sheet thickness in sub glacial topography and estimate mass balance of large bodies of ice. Segmentation plays a very important role in identifying the mass. The Automated polar ice-based image interpretation normally consists of the lower level segmentation based on a higher level of classification and on the basis of this homogeneity criteria or its definitions which is a region boundary, and this will be partitioned into the image pixels of a number of necessary regions. The statistical as well as the structural characteristics for such regions are used with the process of classification for deriving the nature and its class for all the regions and the success of its final interpretation in the polar ice will depend upon the performance of its low-level segmentation. This work proposes a novel technique for ice image segmentation using a modified estimation and normalization of illumination technique used in the Retinex algorithm along with Fuzzy C Means segmentation technique and Gaussian Mixture Model technique based on the layer of ice. Experiments carried out with the proposed technique shows improved accuracy in segmentation.

TI  - Hierarchical mapping of annual global land cover 2001 to present: The MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and land use maps provide an important basis for characterizing the ecological state and biophysical properties of Earth's land areas. The Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, initially released in 2010, was produced at annual time steps and has been widely used in the land science community. In this paper we describe refinements and improvements, in both the algorithm and the resulting map data sets, that have been implemented in the MODIS Collection 6 Global land Cover Type product. Unlike the Collection 5 product, which was based on the 17-class International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) legend, the Collection 6 algorithm uses a hierarchical classification model where the classes included in each level of the hierarchy reflect structured distinctions between land cover properties. The resulting suite of nested classifications is combined to create eight distinct classification schemes including the five legacy schemes included in Collection 5, and three new legends based on the FAO-Land Cover Classification System (LEGS) that distinguish between land cover, land use, and surface hydrologic state. The Collection 6 algorithm also incorporates a state-space multitemporal modeling framework based on hidden Markov models that reduce spurious land cover changes introduced by classification uncertainty in individual years. Among other changes, relative to Collection 5, the Collection 6 product includes less area mapped as forests, open shrublands, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics, and more area mapped as woodlands and grasslands. Accuracy assessment indicates that the Collection 6 product has an overall accuracy of 73.6% for the primary LCCS layer and that the amount of spurious land cover change has been substantially reduced in Collection 6 relative to Collection 5 (1.6% in C6 and 11.4% in C5).

TI  - Evaluation of enhanced oviposition attractant formulations against Aedes and Culex vector mosquitoes in urban and semi-urban areas
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance is not only an important tool to assess the population dynamics of vector mosquitoes, but it can also be used to control vector-borne diseases. Mosquito vectors that belong to several genera such as Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex play a crucial role in the transmission of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and elephantiasis diseases worldwide. We tested the efficacy of two commercial-grade oviposition attractant formulations that were developed for the container-inhabiting Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes present in urban or semi-urban environments. These attractants can lure gravid females. Field trials were conducted in residential yards during a post-rainy season in September and October. Our data showed considerable efficacy for both attractants. Aedes-attractant collected 1.6-fold more larvae (101.2 +/- 10.5 larvae/trap) than the control, and Culex-attractant collected 1.27-fold more larvae (151.2 +/- 12.5 larvae/trap) than the control, resulting in 0.8 and 0.7 oviposition attraction indices (OAIs), respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the Aedes-attractant was more stable than the Culex-attractant. Location and time did not alter the efficacy of these attractants. Our experiment suggests that these attractants can be used for the development of species-specific gravid traps to detect, estimate, and control the mosquito population in urban and semi-urban areas.

TI  - Using Time-Series HSI Mapping to Determine Ecological Processes and Driving Forces of Red-Crowned Crane (<i>Grus japonensis</i>) Habitat in the Yancheng Biosphere Reserve (China)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is generally accepted that biodiversity will be better protected from anthropogenic disturbances after a region has been designated as a protected area. However, this common perception is not true in the case of the Yancheng Biosphere Reserve (YBR), which is widely regarded as the largest wintering habitat in the world for red-crowned cranes. Combining previous information with multisource remote sensing data, this study constructed a highly accurate habitat suitability index (HSI) model and produced a series of HSI hierarchical maps to fill in the blanks of long-term monitoring and regular data acquisition in the YBR. Based on the integrated methods of geographic information system analysis, landscape indices, and redundancy analysis, this study characterized the entire process of shrinkage and deterioration of the habitats of red-crowned cranes and revealed the underlying driving forces. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) The total area of suitable and secondary suitable habitats decreased significantly, from 43.3 to 24.6%, during 1991-2013, and suitable habitats became increasingly concentrated in the core zone. (2) The ecological quality of the habitats was significantly degraded, as reflected by increasing fragmentation, isolation, and scattering of suitable and secondary suitable habitats, as well as by expansion and aggregation of marginal suitable and unsuitable habitats. (3) The extensive transformation of the original natural wetlands to aquafarms is the main reason for habitat shrinkage, with construction of buildings and overall increased intensity of human activity being significantly responsible for the ecological deterioration.

TI  - Spatial Evaluation of Soil Moisture (SM), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and LST-Derived SM Indexes Dynamics during SMAPVEX12
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Downscaling microwave soil moisture (SM) with optical/thermal remote sensing data has considerable application potential. Spatial correlations between SM and land surface temperature (LST) or LST-derived SM indexes (SMIs) are vital to the current optical/thermal and microwave fusion downscaling methods. In this study, the spatial correlations were evaluated at the same spatial scale using SMAPVEX12 SM data and MODIS day/night LST products. LST-derived SMIs was calculated using NLDAS-2 gridded meteorological data with conventional trapezoid and two-stage trapezoid models. Results indicated that (1) SM agrees better with daytime LST than the nighttime or the day-night differential LST; (2) the daytime LSTs on Aqua and Terra present very similar spatial agreement with SM and they have very similar performances as downscaling factors in simulating SM; (3) decoupling effect among SM, LST, and LST-derived SMIs occurs not only in very wet but also in very dry condition; and (4) the decoupling effect degrades the performance of LST as a downscaling factor. The future downscaling algorithms should consider net surface radiation and soil type to tackle the decoupling effect.

TI  - Extracting Urban Impervious Surface from WorldView-2 and Airborne LiDAR Data Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban impervious surface has been recognized as a key quantifiable indicator in assessing urbanization and its environmental impacts. Adopting deep learning technologies, this study proposes an approach of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) to extract impervious surfaces from the WorldView-2 and airborne LiDAR datasets. The influences of different 3D CNN parameters on impervious surface extraction are evaluated. In an effort to reduce the limitations from single sensor data, this study also explores the synergistic use of multi-source remote sensing datasets for delineating urban impervious surfaces. Results indicate that our proposed 3D CNN approach has a great potential and better performance on impervious surface extraction, with an overall accuracy higher than 93.00% and the overall kappa value above 0.89. Compared with the commonly applied pixel-based support vector machine classifier, our proposed 3D CNN approach takes advantage not only of the pixel-level spatial and spectral information, but also of texture and feature maps through multi-scale convolutional processes, which enhance the extraction of impervious surfaces. While image analysis is facing large challenges in a rapidly developing big data era, our proposed 3D CNNs will become an effective approach for improved urban impervious surface extraction.

TI  - Neighborhood grid clustering and its application in fault diagnosis of satellite power system
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART G-JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven fault diagnosis, known to be simple and convenient, is more suitable for diagnosing the complicated spacecraft systems, e.g. the satellite power system. Nevertheless, it is difficult to extract the rules for diagnosing from unlabeled data. In this paper, a clustering approach based on neighborhood relationship and spatial grid partition is proposed to compensate for the above deficiency. In order to deal with the data-driven fault diagnosis issue, a diagnostic strategy is designed, which is a combination of the proposed clustering method and the entropy weight. Finally, multiple experiments, consisting of the artificial data clustering, comparison experiments on satellite data mining, and a case of fault diagnosis on satellite power system, are carried out to illustrate the versatility and superiority of the proposed method.

TI  - High curvatures drive river meandering
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the long- and widely held ideas about the dynamics of meandering rivers is that migration slows down in bends with higher curvatures. High-resolution measurements of migration rates of more than 1600 bends in time-lapse Landsat satellite images, covering more than 4000 km of seven rapidly migrating meandering rivers in the Amazon Basin, suggest that the variation of migration rate closely follows that of the local channel curvature. However, locations of maximum migration rate are shifted downstream relative to peak curvature, with a phase lag that shows limited variability for the same river segment. A quasi-linear relationship exists between the two if this lag is taken into account. Overall, bends with the highest curvatures show the highest migration rates; exceptions with limited migration seem to be related to the low erodibility of the outer bank, not the hydrodynamics of the flow. The implication is that one of the most important ways river migration is rejuvenated and meander-ing patterns are reshuffled is the generation of high-curvature bends through cutoffs.

TI  - Fusing Sentinel-2 Imagery and ALS Point Clouds for Defining LULC Changes on Reclaimed Areas by Afforestation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was performed on two former sulphur mines located in Southeast Poland: Jeziorko, where 216.5 ha of afforested area was reclaimed after borehole exploitation and Machow, where 871.7 ha of dump area was reclaimed after open cast strip mining. The areas were characterized by its terrain structure and vegetation cover resulting from the reclamation process. The types of reclamation applied in these areas were forestry in Jeziorko and agroforestry in the Machow post-sulphur mine. The study investigates the possibility of applying the most recent Sentinel-2 (ESA) satellite imageries for land cover mapping, with a primary focus on detecting and monitoring afforested areas. Airborne laser scanning point clouds were used to derive precise information about the spatial (3D) characteristics of vegetation: the height (95th percentile), std. dev. of relative height, and canopy cover. The results of the study show an increase in afforested areas in the former sulphur mines. For the entire analyzed area of Jeziorko, forested areas made up 82.0% in the year 2000 (Landsat 7, NASA), 88.8% in 2009 (aerial orthophoto), and 95.5% in 2016 (Sentinel-2, ESA). For Machow, the corresponding results were 46.1% in 2000, 57.3% in 2009, and 60.7% in 2016. A dynamic increase of afforested area was observed, especially in the Jeziorko test site, with the presence of different stages of vegetation growth.

TI  - Subgrid Precipitation Properties of Mesoscale Atmospheric Systems Represented by MODIS Cloud Regimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of mesoscale precipitation exhibits diverse patterns: precipitation can be intense but sporadic, or it can be light but widespread. This range of behaviors is a reflection of the different weather systems in the global atmosphere. Using MODIS global cloud regimes as proxies for different atmospheric systems, this study investigates the subgrid precipitation properties within these systems. Taking advantage of the high resolution of Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG; GPM is the Global Precipitation Measurement mission), precipitation values at 0.1 degrees are composited with each cloud regime at 1 degrees grid cells to characterize the regime's spatial subgrid precipitation properties. The results reveal the diversity of the subgrid precipitation behavior of the atmospheric systems. Organized convection is associated with the highest grid-mean precipitation rates and precipitating fraction, although on average only half the grid is precipitating and there is substantial variability between different occurrences. Summer extratropical storms have the next highest precipitation, driven mainly by moderate precipitation rates over large areas. These systems produce more precipitation than isolated convective systems, for which the lower precipitating fractions balance out the high intensities. Most systems produce heavier precipitation in the afternoon than in the morning. The grid-mean precipitation rate is also found to scale with the fraction of precipitation within the grid in a faster-than-linear relationship for most systems. This study elucidates the precipitation properties within cloud regimes, thus advancing our understanding of the precipitation structures of these atmospheric systems.

TI  - A novel and direct ecological risk assessment index for environmental degradation based on response curve approach and remotely sensed data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems are at risk of environmental degradation by the intensification of human activities and climate change over the world. This manuscript aims to present a systematic and direct methodology for abiotic risk assessment. In this study, a novel ecological risk assessment index called "performance relative severity index" (PRS) was developed to directly identify the risk of ecosystem collapse due to abiotic stress. The index is acquired by calculating the degree of deviation from performance of ecosystems to optimum performance that caused by the degradation of environment. First, the key abiotic variables distinguishing ecosystems should be identified. Second, the response curve indicating the relationship between ecosystem performance and key abiotic variables should be constructed. Due to the lack of the information on the response curve for some regions, the minimum and maximum points of optimum and tolerance range, defining the response curve of ecosystem to abiotic variables, should be acquired. The minimum and maximum optimal points were obtained through the relationships between the index derived from remotely sensed data and abiotic variables, and the minimum and maximum tolerance points were acquired by the relationships between the occurrence of ecosystem and its environment. Based on the response curve of ecosystem to abiotic variable, the performance of ecosystem to current abiotic variables were available. Finally, the PRS was acquired through calculating the ratio of the change in the performance of ecosystems caused by environmental degradation to the change that would cause an ecosystem to collapse. The proposed methodology was applied to calculate the PRS of the natural forest regarding temperature in Xishuangbanna, a biodiversity hotspot located in Southwestern China. The results show that the suitable bioclimatic zone for ecosystems in Xishuangbanna would be shifted to higher altitude region under global warming. Considering ecosystems are always lag behind the effects of climate changes, these conversions indicate potential heat-stress to the natural forests of lowland in Xishuangbanna due to significantly rising temperatures in the future.

TI  - Characteristics of non-tectonic tremors around the Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica, during 2013-2015
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Characteristics of non-tectonic tremors, excited mainly by the interaction within the cryosphere, were investigated using seismic waveform data of 2013-2015 recorded at broadband stations on the east coast of the Liitzow-Holm Bay (LHB), East Antarctica. The tremors were classified into three types by spectral and waveform features. Type A events have long durations, typically several hours to days, with high amplitudes of spectra over 1-8 Hz. They occur dominantly in austral summers. Type B events have characteristically irregular variations in discrete dominant frequencies in spectra. Type C events are harmonic tremors with discrete dominant frequencies in spectra that vary regularly with time. Type B and C events show similar seasonal variations: they are numerous around April and less so in austral winter. Comparison of spectra between seismic waves and infra-sound, together with satellite images, suggests that type A events originated from storm-induced swells near off-LHB. Source locations of type C events and satellite images suggest that type C events are likely to result from the collision/crevassing of ice blocks in fast-sea-ice in LHB. Similar seasonal variations of type B and C events imply that these two events have similar origins.

TI  - Single-polarization SAR Data Flood Water Detection Method Based on Markov Segmentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - China is a flood disaster-prone country, where floods occur frequently every year, from July to August. Therefore, rapid disaster detection and assessment of floods affected areas is of great significance. GF-3 SAR satellite data has obvious advantages of all-day, all-weather imaging characteristics in flood disaster reduction applications because of its active observation technology. For the purpose of rapid water detection in flooding area, a rapid detection method of flood area based on GF-3 single-polarized SAR data is proposed, including SAR preprocessing, flood extraction based on Markov random fields, shadow false alarm removal. Its detecting accuracy is evaluated with manual detection result. The test results show that this method can realize the rapid and accurate extraction of waters in flood disaster area.

M3  - Article
AB  - Using four satellite data sets (TOMS/SBUV, OMI, MLS, and HALOE), we analyze the seasonal variations of the total column ozone (TCO) and its zonal deviation (TCO*), and reveal the vertical structure of the Ozone Low (OV) over the Asian continent. Our principal findings are: (1) The TCO over the Asian continent reaches its maximum in the spring and its minimum in the autumn. The Ozone Low exists from May to September. (2) The Ozone Low has two negative cores, located in the lower and the upper stratosphere. The lower core is near 30 hPa in the winter and 70 hPa in the other seasons. The upper core varies from 10 hPa to 1 hPa among the four seasons. (3) The position of the Ozone Low in the lower and the upper stratosphere over the Asian continent shows seasonal variability.

AB  - Motivated by the need of resource flexibility in high throughput satellite systems, a hot-spot cell configuration is introduced and analyzed in terms of throughput performance. Cell partitioning and user scheduling are also addressed in conjunction with the application of different types of linear precoding algorithms. The analysis is based on a real satellite system design and uses a system simulation approach, encompassing the random user distribution inside the hot-spot cell area. Results provide guidelines on the design of the hot-spot cell partitioning and show the achievable gains of precoding with respect to conventional, non precoded, transmission.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for Classification and LULC Mapping in the Urban Area of Belem, Eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical regions, such as in the Amazon, the use of optical sensors is limited by high cloud coverage throughout the year. As an alternative, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) products could be used, alone or in combination with optical images, to monitor tropical areas. In this sense, we aimed to select the best Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification approach for tropical regions using Sentinel family products. We choose the city of Belem, Brazil, as the study area. Images of close dates from Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) were selected, preprocessed, segmented, and integrated to develop a machine learning LULC classification through a Random Forest (RF) classifier. We also combined textural image analysis (S-1) and vegetation indexes (S-2). A total of six LULC classifications were made. Results showed that the best overall accuracy (OA) was found for the integration of S-1 and S-2 (91.07%) data, followed by S-2 only (89.53%), and S-2 with radiometric indexes (89.45%). The worse result was for S-1 data only (56.01). For our analysis the integration of optical products in the stacking increased de OA in all classifications. However, we suggest the development of more investigations with S-1 products due to its importance for tropical regions.

TI  - OncotypeDX Recurrence Score Does Not Predict Nodal Burden in Clinically Node Negative Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOncotypeDX recurrence score (RS)((R)) has been found to predict recurrence and disease-free survival in patients with node negative breast cancer. Whether RS is useful in guiding locoregional therapy decisions is unclear. We sought to evaluate the relationship between RS and lymph node burden.MethodsPatients with invasive breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node dissection from 2010 to 2015 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were excluded if they were clinically node positive or if they received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RS was classified as low (<18), intermediate (18-30), or high (>30). The association between RS, lymph node burden, and disease recurrence was evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.0; p<0.05 was considered significant.ResultsA positive SLN was found in 168 (15%) of 1121 patients. Completion axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 84 (50%) of SLN-positive patients. The remaining 84 (50%) patients had one to two positive SLNs and did not undergo further axillary surgery. RS was low in 58.5%, intermediate in 32.6%, and high in 8.9%. RS was not associated with a positive SLN, number of positive nodes, maximum node metastasis size, or extranodal extension. The median follow-up was 23months. High RS was not associated with locoregional recurrence (p=0.07) but was significantly associated with distant recurrence (p=0.0015).ConclusionsOncotypeDX RS is not associated with nodal burden in women with clinically node-negative breast cancer, suggesting that RS is not useful to guide decisions regarding extent of axillary surgery for these patients.

TI  - Stepwise En Bloc Resection of Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma with Oncologic Considerations.
T2  - Aesthetic surgery journal. Open forum
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network state that standard of care treatment for the majority of patients with breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is surgical resection. This cancer is generally indolent, and if confined to the capsule, curative treatment is usually surgery alone. An en bloc resection involves a total capsulectomy, explantation, complete excision of associated masses, and excision of any involved lymph node(s). Patients with surgical control of disease have favorable long-term overall and event-free survival. Oncologic principles should be applied when resecting BIA-ALCL, and a complete oncologic resection is essential to cure patients of the disease. Incomplete resections, partial capsulectomies, and positive margins are all associated with high rates of disease recurrence and have potential for progression of the disease. Routine sentinel lymph node biopsy is unnecessary and full axillary lymph node dissection is rarely indicated except in cases of proven involvement of multiple nodes. Lymphoma oncology consultation and disease staging by imaging is performed prior to surgery. Importantly, en bloc resection is indicated only for an established diagnosis of BIA-ALCL, and is not recommended for merely suspicious or prophylactic surgeries. The purpose of this article was to demonstrate a stepwise approach to surgical ablation of BIA-ALCL with an emphasis on oncologic considerations critical to disease prognosis.

TI  - Flood hazard mapping using geospatial techniques and satellite imagesa case study of coastal district of Tamil Nadu
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, extreme rainfall events have resulted in several devastating floods especially in the east coast of Tamil Nadu, India. The main aim of this study is to identify the flood hazard zones in Cuddalore district by integrating spatial distribution of extreme rainfall events, slope, drainage density, soil, and geomorphology. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data was used to delineate the flood inundation area for the flood event which occurred in 2010 to validate the derived flood hazard zones by using geographical information system (GIS) and satellite images. The ground truth points were collected from the field to validate flood hazard zones, and it was identified that 92% of results were matched with hazard zones. Highly vulnerable blocks including Cuddalore, Kattumannarkoil, Keerapalayam, Kumaratchi, Kurinjipadi, Melbhunagiri, and Parangipettai were identified in Cuddalore district. From this study, it was also identified that nearly 45% of the total area of 3678km(2) were inundated during the flood time. This present study will be a very useful tool and a resource for the policy planners and coastal planners to make effective decisions towards mitigation measures in flood-prone areas in the coastal districts.

TI  - Risk of empty lymph node packets in sentinel lymph node mapping for endometrial cancer using indocyanine green
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine whether the rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissections that do not yield a lymph node on pathological analysis ('empty packet dissection') changes with increasing surgeon experience in the setting of patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy and SLN mapping using indocyanine green dye for endometrial cancer.Methods All patients undergoing SLN mapping using indocyanine green dye at the time of minimally invasive hysterectomy for endometrial cancer or complex atypical hyperplasia were identified between January 2013 and September 2017 at our institution. All surgeons had prior experience performing SLN mapping for endometrial cancer using other methods. The rate of empty packet dissections and SLN counts were evaluated using a logistic regression model analysis.Results In total, 236 patients undergoing SLN mapping for either endometrial cancer (85%) or complex atypical hyperplasia (15%) were identified from a prospectively maintained database. When examining all six surgeons together, the percentage of empty packet dissections decreased with increasing number of procedures performed. Each additional procedure was associated with a 3.6% reduction in the odds of an empty packet SLN dissection. After adjusting for individual surgeons, each additional procedure was associated with a 4.9% reduction in the odds of an empty packet. The expected odds of an empty packet after 10 additional procedures decreased by 40.1% (95% CI 12.4% to 58.6%). The addition of two covariates (age and body mass index) did not contribute significantly to the model (likelihood ratio test: X-2=2.75, p=0.25). The rate of empty packets appeared to stabilize after approximately 30 procedures. The number of SLNs removed did not change with increasing surgeon experience.Conclusion The rate of empty packet SLN dissections using indocyanine green dye decreases with increasing number of procedures. This stabilizes after 30 procedures, suggesting completion of a learning curve.

TI  - Stroke mortality audit using the Structured Judgement Review method
T2  - CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Mortality data provided by the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme demonstrated the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT) to have a higher than national average mortality ratio.(1) In response to this, the RCHT stroke department undertook a mortality review of patients admitted with stroke making use of the Structured Judgement Review (SJR) process.(2)The review found all patients were deemed as receiving adequate, good or excellent care. There were no cases where death was deemed as definitely avoidable. The team found the SJR to be a useful, validated tool for mortality review though recognised specific limitations to its use and wider limitations within our review process. Focused areas for improvement derived from the review included improving compliance with local palliative care guides, improved documentation, links with primary care via Care Quality Commission atrial fibrillation group and consideration of improved scanning facilities. We also acknowledged wider unaccounted factors which may impact stroke mortality and thus influence perceived mortality ratios.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability of mangrove ecosystems in the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in central Vietnam play an important role in protecting the coast line; reducing erosion and salinization; as well as regulating climate. Mangrove ecosystems in Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve contribute significantly to the role of coastal protection, climate change resilience, and local economic development. Historical satellite remote sensing data, intensive field surveys and GIS techniques have been employed in many tropical areas worldwide to detect mangrove changes. The objective of this study is to use Landsat imagery covering the past 44 years (1973-2016) to study historical changes of the mangrove ecosystems in the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve and to document the current distribution of species diversity in the Reserve's mangrove ecosystems. The field surveys and analysis of satellite remote sensing data revealed that the mangrove ecosystem in Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve has fluctuated significantly in both temporal and spatial distribution. This study has newly documented eight mangrove species to the inventory of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve mangroves species composition. This study is regarded as the first study using multi-spectral satellite remote sensing image to assess the distribution status and historical changes of mangrove ecosystems in central Vietnam. The outcomes can contribute to assessing the dynamic trends of coastal ecosystem changes during the past 44 years to provide sustainable development strategies for the area. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modelling ship detectability depending on TerraSAR-X-derived metocean parameters
T2  - CEAS SPACE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Different metocean conditions have an impact on the detectability of ship signatures on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. During the EMSec Project algorithms for retrieval of wind and sea state fields from TerraSAR-X data have been developed in conjunction with a near real-time-capable constant false alarm rate ship detection processor. This paper presents a new model connecting these three information extraction systems into a ship detectability model by setting the probability of detection in dependency to the four parameters: Wind speed, significant wave height, incidence angle and ship length. The model is based on a binary L2-regularized logistic regression classifier trained on a large dataset of X-band SAR ship samples, which are identified using Automatic Identification System messages co-located automatically in space and time and further checked manually to avoid possible mismatches. Results are compared to the state-of-the-art simulation-based ship detectability model available in literature. For the first time it has been possible to evaluate not only qualitatively but also quantitatively the effects of acquisition geometry and metocean conditions for the different image resolution classes obtainable with the high-flexible SAR sensor on-board the TerraSAR-X satellite.

TI  - Extension of Ship Wake Detectability Model for Non-Linear Influences of Parameters Using Satellite Based X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The physics of the imaging mechanism underlying the emergence of ship wakes in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images has been studied in the past by many researchers providing a well-understood theory. Therefore, many publications describe how well ship wakes are detectable on SAR under the influence of different environmental conditions like sea state or local wind, ship properties like ship speed or ship heading, and image acquisition parameters like incidence angle or satellite heading. The increased imaging capabilities of current satellite SAR missions facilitate the collection of large datasets of moving vessels. Such a large dataset of high resolution TerraSAR-X acquisitions now enables the quantitative analysis of the previously formulated theory about the detectability of ship wakes using real data. In this paper we propose an extension of our wake detectability model by using a non-linear basis which allows consideration of all the influencing parameters simultaneously. Such an approach provides new insights and a better understanding of the non-linear influence of parameters on the wake detectability and their interdependencies can now be represented. The results show that the non-linear, interdependent influence of the different influencing parameters on the detectability of wakes matches well to the oceanographic expectations published in the past. Also possible applications of the model for the extraction of missing parameters and automatic for wake detection systems are demonstrated.

TI  - Dynamical Malaria Forecasts Are Skillful at Regional and Local Scales in Uganda up to 4 Months Ahead
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria forecasts from dynamical systems have never been attempted at the health district or local clinic catchment scale, and so their usefulness for public health preparedness and response at the local level is fundamentally unknown. A pilot preoperational forecasting system is introduced in which the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction system and seasonal climate forecasts of temperature and rainfall are used to drive the uncalibrated dynamical malaria model VECTRI to predict anomalies in transmission intensity 4months ahead. It is demonstrated that the system has statistically significant skill at a number of sentinel sites in Uganda with high-quality data. Skill is also found at approximately 50% of the Ugandan health districts despite inherent uncertainties of unconfirmed health reports. A cost-loss economic analysis at three example sentinel sites indicates that the forecast system can have a positive economic benefit across a broad range of intermediate cost-loss ratios and frequency of transmission anomalies. We argue that such an analysis is a necessary first step in the attempt to translate climate-driven malaria information to policy-relevant decisions.Plain Language Summary The malaria parasite and its mosquito vector are both weather sensitive, with temperature impacting development rates and mortality, and rainfall providing mosquito breeding sites. We take advantage of these effects to provide forecasts of malaria transmission intensity up to 4months ahead, using a state-of-the-art climate prediction system to drive a mathematical model of the parasite/vector cycle. The system is evaluated to have skill in Uganda at the district and local clinic scale, a first for subnational forecasts. We then perform an economic analysis to show at which range of decision entry points and anomalous transmission events the system has positive benefit, necessary for integration into decision-making processes.

TI  - Statistical Model of Cloud Optical Depths in Certain Zones of the Yamal Peninsula Region Using Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical depths of summertime clouds are statistically analyzed in the region of Ob Bay in three bounded zones over dry areas and areas comprising large water basins. We used experimental data, obtained onboard the European satellite ENVISAT (MERIS instrument) in 2008-2011. The shape of the probability distribution functions of the optical depths in each of the zones is determined. These functions have 3-4 modes in logarithmic coordinates. The functions were fit using a set of normal logarithmic distributions with adjusted parameters, found to be well repetitive from one year to another. The water-poor western zone is characterized by three modes; and for eastern zones, with northward-flowing rivers full of relatively warm waters, the number of modes increases to four. Very likely, the additional mode at small optical depths is explained by water evaporation, followed by condensation of water vapor. It is hypothesized that a certain role in the latter case may be played by anthropogenic emissions, owing to which the number of condensation nuclei in the atmosphere is larger in the eastern than the western zone. We present the plots of the distribution functions and tables of fit parameters that define these functions. These data may be useful in calculation of radiation budget for small territories in the region of the Yamal Peninsula.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma
T2  - PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma lymph node staging is challenging due to varied patterns of lymphatic drainage and the suboptimal predictive value of available imaging modalities. Furthermore, regional relapse rates are unacceptably high, and the toxicity of empiric radiation is undesirable in the pediatric and young adult population. In an attempt to improve locoregional control without excess morbidity, we have adopted routine sentinel lymph node biopsy in head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma, which is safe and feasible in pediatric patients. Of six procedures reported here, pathologic findings led to intensification of regional and/or systemic therapy in two patients.

TI  - Bio-optical response of surface waters to wind-induced upwelling off the Kanyakumari coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of wind-induced coastal upwelling on bio-optical properties over waters off the Kanyakumari coast for two consecutive winters (October 2011 to March 2012 and October 2012 to March 2013). Level-2 wind datasets from Oceansat-2 Scatterometer (12.5 km) have been used to estimate rate of up welling using a published approach. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on-board Aqua and Terra space-platform has been used to obtain bio-optical datasets (level-3, 4 km) that include chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration, absorption due to phytoplankton at 443 nm (aph_443), absorption due to detritus and gelbstoff at 443 rim (adg_443) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at multiple wavelengths. Wind speed resulting in upwelling is found to be in range of 6.95 m s(-1)-18.67 m s(-1). Phytoplankton bloom occurs when upwelling intensity is ranging between approximately 0.90 m/day -3.50 m/day at a lag of about 2-3 days. Chl-a, aph_443, adg_443 and POC concentrations show simultaneous increment after upwelling and Chl-a is found to be the major parameter controlling other bio-optical properties of the study region. The waters belong to Case-1 type mainly co-dominated by phytoplankton and CDOM with very low concentrations of suspended particulate matter. Additionally, a noticeable drop in SST ranging between 0.55 degrees C to 1.50 degrees C has been observed at the same day of upwelling when upwelling intensity is around 1.5 m/day or above.

TI  - Evidence of Active Tectonic Deformation in Kishtwar Area, Jammu and Kashmir, Northwest Himalaya, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the interpretation of satellite data and fieldwork in Kishtwar and surrounding area some geomorphic signatures of active tectonics which include uplifted river terraces, palaeo-channels and their causative faults have been identified. The technique used in this study to delineate these geomorphic features includes the generation of digital elevation model (DEM), hill-shaded images and anaglyphs from high resolution satellite data Cartosat-1. The anaglyphs and hill-shaded images helped to identify the fault scarp and palaeochannel of Chenab river. The ground truth further confirmed the displacement in the Quaternary river terraces lying along these faults. The presence of Quaternary fluvial sediments throughout the palaeochannel of Chenab river and the presence of wind-gap further confirmed that the river was once flowing from this area and shifted toward west in the recent geological past. Based on the geological evidences the present study leads to identification of a N-S striking fault which is represented by a > 10 km fault scarp where the fluvial and lacustrine sediments are uplifted upto an elevation of 350-400 m from present river bed and another E-W striking fault that caused upliftment in river terraces and shifting of the river channel. These faults show clear evidence of active tectonics indicated by the displacement and deformation in the river terraces. Beside the geomorphological and geological evidences the seismic data of last three years obtained from the seismic observatories installed in this area ascertained the active nature of this area.

TI  - Application of DInSAR Technique to High Coherence Sentinel-1 Images for Dam Monitoring and Result Validation Through <i>In Situ</i> Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dam monitoring represents a crucial issue in order to avoid catastrophic failures due to infrastructure aging or earthquake damages. Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) is a technique suitable for critical infrastructure monitoring, also for the availability of free data and tools, that can be used by experts in SAR remote sensing and also by geologists and civil engineers, after having acquired the right confidence and experience in these data processing and tool use. In order to apply the DInSAR technique, in its basic and simple version, to critical infrastructure monitoring, it is very important to assess its performance. Nevertheless, validation results are not largely available in literature, because heterogeneous technical competencies are required to this aim and in situ measurements must be collected and made available. In this paper, we propose a highly reproducible DInSAR workflow that can be effectively used for dam monitoring, by validating its results with in situ measurements on some significant case studies in Italy.

TI  - A Comparison of Hybrid Machine Learning Algorithms for the Retrieval of Wheat Biophysical Variables from Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the comparison of hybrid methods of estimation of biophysical variables such as leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), fraction of vegetation cover (FVC), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) from Sentinel-2 satellite data. Different machine learning algorithms were trained with simulated spectra generated by the physically-based radiative transfer model PROSAIL and subsequently applied to Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra. The algorithms were assessed against a standard operational approach, i.e., the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox, based on neural networks. Since kernel-based algorithms have a heavy computational cost when trained with large datasets, an active learning (AL) strategy was explored to try to alleviate this issue. Validation was carried out using ground data from two study sites: one in Shunyi (China) and the other in Maccarese (Italy). In general, the performance of the algorithms was consistent for the two study sites, though a different level of accuracy was found between the two sites, possibly due to slightly different ground sampling protocols and the range and variability of the values of the biophysical variables in the two ground datasets. For LAI estimation, the best ground validation results were obtained for both sites using least squares linear regression (LSLR) and partial least squares regression, with the best performances values of R-2 of 0.78, rott mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.68 m(2) m(-2) and a relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 19.48% obtained in the Maccarese site with LSLR. The best results for LCC were obtained using Random Forest Tree Bagger (RFTB) and Bagging Trees (BagT) with the best performances obtained in Maccarese using RFTB (R-2 = 0.26, RMSE = 8.88 g cm(-2), RRMSE = 17.43%). Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) was the best algorithm for all variables only in the cross-validation phase, but not in the ground validation, where it ranked as the best only for FVC in Maccarese (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.08, RRMSE = 9.86%). It was found that the AL strategy was more efficient than the random selection of samples for training the GPR algorithm.

TI  - The Feasibility and Safety of Preoperative Fluorescence Marking with Indocyanine Green (ICG) in Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSecuring the surgical margin is the most essential and important task in curative surgery. However, it is difficult to accurately identify the tumor location during laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer, and existing methods, such as preoperative endoscopic marking with tattooing and clipping, have multiple disadvantages.AimsWe investigated the feasibility and safety of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence marking for determining the tumor location during laparoscopic gastrectomy.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed preoperative and perioperative data from consecutive patients with gastric cancer undergoing planned laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. Data was maintained in a prospectively compiled surgical database, and patients were categorized into ICG (n=84) or non-ICG (n=174) groups based on whether they underwent preoperative endoscopic mucosal ICG injection. One-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare outcomes between the two groups.ResultsWe included 84 patient pairs after PSM, and there were no significant differences in preoperative patient characteristics. The ICG group had shorter procedure time (p<0.001), lower estimated blood loss (p=0.005), and significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay (p<0.001). Positive resection margins were confirmed in five cases (6.0%) in the non-ICG group, whereas there were none in the ICG group (p=0.008). Real-time confirmation was possible during laparoscopy, and the injected ICG did not affect the surgical procedure or result in adverse events.ConclusionICG fluorescence imaging is feasible and safe and can potentially be used as a tumor-marking agent for determining the surgical resection line.

TI  - Assessing coastal erosion and accretion trends along two contrasting subtropical rivers based on remote sensing data
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal shoreline position is a key indicator of coastal development and provides information on beach dynamics. Previous studies have indicated that there is a strong relationship between riverine sediment fluxes and beach volume. As such, worldwide hydroelectric projects and the associated damming infrastructure have decreased suspended sediment loads, and consequently increasing coastal erosion and deterioration of wetlands. The study was conducted along the coastline of the San Pedro River and the Santiago River on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Both rivers discharge into the ocean separated by 12 km of coastline, however the San Pedro River does not present dams through its watershed. Contrary, six dams had been constructed along the Santiago River since 1976. Results indicated that after 45 years, the San Pedro River coastline presented minimum variability and a total of 379 ha of accretion. Contrary, the Santiago River coastline showed major erosion trends with a total of 669 ha of beach and wetland losses. Our study highlights the feasibility of combining historical remote sensing data and GIS analysis in order to assess coastal variability trends when field-based surveys are not available.

TI  - Agro-ecological variability effects on an index-based insurance design for extreme events
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Pedometrics Conference
CL  - Wageningen, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Index-based insurance (IBI) is a risk transfer tool that is widely used in low-incomes countries, especially catered to smallholder farmers. A good correlation between the selected index (in this case Normalized Difference Vegetation Index -NDVI-) and the crop losses of the insured area is a key requirement for well-performing system. Usually, IBI application area is defined by political boundaries, despite that variation in soil, topography, and climate is more important. In this work, agro-ecological variability effects will be studied in the IBI context. The case study was the rice crop failure in Babahoyo canton (Ecuador), using NDVI as the crop damage indicator.In a previous study, zones of similar soil, topographic and climatic characteristics (AHZs) were defined using principal component analysis in Babahoyo canton. Two largest AHZs were found in this canton. They were f7 and f15, which account for 91% of the total rice crop area in Babahoyo. We sampled reflectance values of red, blue, near infra-red (NIR) and medium infra-red (MIR) bands over bare soil (1st of January) by observation points, within f7 and f15. The reflectance band values were used to study whether the difference between the two AHZs could be appreciated through remote sensing. Then, we did the same but for NDVI average of the rice crop cycle, i.e., 15th of January to 15th of May (NDVI_ave). It was done for confirming that the AHZs (f7 and f15) have an influence over rice crop development. The used product was MODIS imagery (2001-2017).We stratified the sampling through the AHZs, applying 30% density for ensuring the accuracy of the selected pixels. Statistically significant differences between the f7 and f15 zones were found in all the analysed reflectance bands and in NDVI_ave. This found supported the differences that the agro-ecological map pointed out in its database. At the same time, the NDVI_ave distribution for each AHZ presented a statistically significant difference of the accumulated probability below the threshold (0.4), which is confirmed as a reliable threshold for rice crop failure. This stratified sampling could improve the representativeness and accuracy of crop state assessments and reduce the basis risk.

TI  - Japanese Encephalitis Virus in Australia: From Known Known to Known Unknown
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a major cause of neurological disease in Asia. It is a zoonotic flavivirus transmitted between water birds and/or pigs by Culex mosquitoes; humans are dead-end hosts. In 1995, JEV emerged for the first time in northern Australia causing an unprecedented outbreak in the Torres Strait. In this article, we revisit the history of JEV in Australia and describe investigations of JEV transmission cycles in the Australian context. Public health responses to the incipient outbreak included vaccination and sentinel pig surveillance programs. Virus isolation and vector competence experiments incriminated Culex annulirostris as the likely regional vector. The role this species plays in transmission cycles depends on the availability of domestic pigs as a blood source. Experimental evidence suggests that native animals are relatively poor amplifying hosts of JEV. The persistence and predominantly annual virus activity between 1995 and 2005 suggested that JEV had become endemic in the Torres Strait. However, active surveillance was discontinued at the end of 2005, so the status of JEV in northern Australia is unknown. Novel mosquito-based surveillance systems provide a means to investigate whether JEV still occurs in the Torres Strait or is no longer a risk to Australia.

TI  - Technologies for image-guided surgery for managing lymphatic metastases in prostate cancer
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - One of the challenges for the surgical management of prostate cancer is the lymphatic spread of metastases. Lymph node metastases vary in size (micrometastases (<2 mm) or macrometastases (>2 mm)), and their interactions with the lymphatic environment differ (whether they are hypoxic or connected to blood flow). Thus, devising a universal imaging system and an image-guided surgical approach that supports the resection of all affected lymph nodes is difficult. Two complementary approaches to identifying affected lymph nodes have been described as alternatives to performing a traditional pelvic lymph node dissection: lymphatic mapping using radioguidance (the most widely applied modality), fluorescence guidance, integrated hybrid radioguidance and fluorescence guidance or magnetic guidance; and surgery guided by radiolabelled prostate-specific membrane antigen. Careful patient selection using preoperative imaging seems to be a crucial aspect in determining whether one of the individual image-guided surgery procedures alone would be optimal or whether a combination would be considered to be the most desirable course of action. The successful implementation and dissemination of both lymph-node-targeted and disease-targeted procedures are very much reliant on ongoing technical developments in the field and their standardization and interpretation. However, when these innovative surgical procedures are fully refined, evaluation of their influence on oncological outcome is imperative.

TI  - Bored Like Hell: Religiosity Reduces Boredom and Tempers the Quest for Meaning
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Boredom involves a lack meaning. Conversely, religiosity offers people a sense of meaning. Accordingly, we proposed that by imbuing a sense of meaningfulness, religiosity leads people to experience less boredom. Furthermore, we hypothesized and tested that by reducing boredom, religiosity indirectly inhibits the search for meaningful engagement. In Study 1, following boring tasks, religious people experienced lower levels of boredom and were less motivated to search for meaning than nonreligious people. We found in Study 2 that religious (vs. non- or less religious) people reported higher perceived meaning in life, which was associated with a reduced tendency to feel bored, and with a reduced need to search for meaning in life. Study 3 confirmed that the meaning in life associated with religiosity was associated with reduced state boredom. Religious participants were again less inclined to search for meaning, which was explained by the relatively low levels of boredom that religious (vs. nonreligious) participants experienced.

TI  - The use of whole blood in US military operations in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan since the introduction of low-titer Type O whole blood: feasibility, acceptability, challenges
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death in military and civilian traumatic injury. Blood product resuscitation improves survival. Low-titer Type O Whole Blood (LTOWB) was recently re-introduced to the combat theater as a universal resuscitation product for hemorrhagic shock. This study assessed the utilization patterns of LTOWB compared to warm fresh whole blood (WFWB) and blood component therapy (CT) in US Military Operations in Iraq/Syria and Afghanistan known as Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) respectively. We hypothesized LTOWB utilization would increase over time given its advantages. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Using the Theater Medical Data Store, patients receiving blood products between January 2016 and December 2017 were identified. Product utilization ratios (PUR) for LTOWB, WFWB, and CT were compared across Area of Operations (AORs), medical treatment facilities (Role 2 vs. Role 3), and time. PUR was defined as number of blood products transfused/(number of blood products transfused + number of blood products wasted). RESULTS The overall PUR for all blood products was 17.4%; the LTOWB PUR was 14.3%. Over the study period, the total number of blood products transfused increased 133%. Although the total whole blood (WB) increased from 2.1% to 6.6% of all products transfused, WFWB use remained at 2% while LTOWB transfusions increased from 0.5% to 4%. Transfusion of LTOWB occurred more in austere Role 2 facilities compared to Role 3 hospitals. CONCLUSIONS LTOWB transfusion is feasible in austere, far-forward environments. Further investigation is needed regarding the safety, clinical outcomes, and drivers of LTOWB transfusions.

TI  - Harmonization of Pharmacovigilance Regulation in Brazil: Opportunities to Improve Risk Communication
T2  - CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian pharmacovigilance regulations involve 3 spheres: health services, Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs), and sanitary agency. Drug tolerability began to be effectively assessed in Brazil after the founding of the National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance, which developed the Sentinel Network Project, The objective of the Sentinel Network Project is to increase the adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting rate by health care professionals in the hospital setting. Pharmacovigilance practices became mandatory for MAHs, and patient tolerability issues were considered in drug policy in Brazil only as recently as 2000. However, despite recent events, the regulatory advancements in pharmacovigilance in Brazil are only equivalent to international practices (ie, those of the European Union). The pharmacovigilance system in the European Union integrates the national authorities, the European Commission, and the European Medicines Agency, which is responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision, and safety monitoring of medicines for human and veterinary use in the European Union. Furthermore, ADR patient reporting is included in the new EU pharmacovigilance regulations. Numerous possible ways are available to improve the Brazilian pharmacovigilance system, mainly through regulations of biosimilar, nanotechnology, and veterinary medicines or by training health care professionals and patients to report nonserious cases and quality deviations. It is necessary to encourage and develop strategies for decentralizing pharmacovigilance actions in the whole country, as is common practice in several EU countries. Motivating and considering ADR reports by patients and improving feedback and audit practices in health care services and MAHs are also necessary measures. With the inclusion of Brazil as a member of the International Conference of Harmonization, significant changes in pharmacovigilance regulation are expected; these updates, which will consider international standards, will improve signal detection and risk communication.

TI  - Spectral Adjustment Model's Analysis and Application to Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differences in the relative spectral response functions of sensors lead to data inconsistencies that should be harmonized before multisensor exploitation. In this paper, we use spectral libraries to simulate satellite data and build models to correct them. We then explore and compare different models for coarse and medium spatial resolution optical sensors, including moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), visible infrared imaging radiometer suite, multispectral instrument aboard Sentinel-2, and Operational Land Imager aboard Landsat 8. We found that optimal correction of different bands depends on the model used. For the green and near infrared bands, a multilinear land cover dependent regression improves the accuracy by up to 80.9%. For the red band, a novel exponential dependence of the spectral band adjustment factor with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provides an accuracy improvement of up to 72.8%. The best way to correct the NDVI value is to use the corrected NIR and red bands using these models. We apply the proposed methods to 445 BELMANIP2 sites using AVHRR data from the long-term data record from 1982-2017. High NDVI pixels result in 30-year trends varying up to 0.06 when comparing uncorrected to spectrally adjusted NDVI. Further application of these methods to NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel 2 product shows that for the red band and NDVI, our proposed method provides improved accuracy (54.6% and 62.5%) over the linear spectral adjustment currently used.

TI  - Improving the AVHRR Long Term Data Record BRDF Correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Long Term Data Record (LTDR) project has the goal of developing a quality and consistent surface reflectance product from coarse resolution optical sensors. This paper focuses on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) part of the record, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument as a reference. When a surface reflectance time series is acquired from satellites with variable observation geometry, the directional variation generates an apparent noise which can be corrected by modeling the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The VJB (Vermote, Justice and Breon, 2009) method estimates a target's BRDF shape using 5 years of observation and corrects for directional effects maintaining the high temporal resolution of the measurement using the instantaneous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The method was originally established on MODIS data but its viability and optimization for AVHRR data have not been fully explored. In this study we analyze different approaches to find the most robust way of applying the VJB correction to AVHRR data, considering that high noise in the red band (B1) caused by atmospheric effect makes the VJB method unstable. Firstly, our results show that for coarse spatial resolution, where the vegetation dynamics of the target don't change significantly, deriving BRDF parameters from 15+ years of observations reduces the average noise by up to 7% in the Near Infrared (NIR) band and 6% in the NDVI, in comparison to using 3-year windows. Secondly, we find that the VJB method can be modified for AVHRR data to improve the robustness of the correction parameters and decrease the noise by an extra 8% and 9% in the red and NIR bands with respect to using the classical VJB inversion. We do this by using the Stable method, which obtains the volumetric BRDF parameter (V) based on its NDVI dependency, and then obtains the geometric BRDF parameter (R) through the inversion of just one parameter.

TI  - A Combiner-Based Full Resolution Quality Assessment Index for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the problem of fusing a multispectral (MS) image and a panchromatic image in order to get an MS image at a finer spatial resolution than the one of the original MS image. Due to the lack of a reference image, the assessment of the quality of a pansharpened product is a challenging task. Typical solutions are related to the reduced resolution assessment by exploiting Wald's protocol or to indexes without reference. In this letter, an efficient approach based on the combination of the two above-mentioned solutions is proposed. The performance is assessed using real data acquired by sensors with very different features mounted on-hoard of the Pleiades, the WorldView-3, and the WorldView-4 satellite platforms.

TI  - Mapping irrigated agriculture in complex landscapes using SPOT6 imagery and object-based image analysis - A case study in the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation infrastructure development for smallholder farmers in developing countries increasingly gains attention in the light of domestic food security and poverty alleviation. However, these complex landscapes with small cultivated plots pose a challenge with regard to mapping and monitoring irrigated agriculture. This study presents an object-based approach to map irrigated agriculture in an area in the Central Rift Valley in Ethiopia using SPOT6 imagery. The study is a proof-of-concept that the use of shape, texture, neighbour and location information next to spectral information is beneficial for the classification of irrigated agriculture. The underlying assumption is that the application of irrigation has a positive effect on crop growth throughout the field, following the field's borders, which is detectable in an object-based approach. The type of agricultural system was also mapped, distinguishing smallholder farming and modern large-scale agriculture. Irrigated agriculture was mapped with an overall accuracy of 94% and a kappa coefficient of 0.85. Producer's and user's accuracies were on average 90.6% and 84.2% respectively. The distinction between smallholder farming and large-scale agriculture was identified with an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.88. The classifications were performed at the field level, since the segmentation was able to adequately delineate individual fields. The additional use of object features proved essential for the identification of cropland plots, irrigation period and type of agricultural system. This method is independent of expert knowledge on crop phenology and absolute spectral values. The proposed method is useful for the assessment of spatio-temporal dynamics of irrigated (smallholder) agriculture in complex landscapes and yields a basis for land and water managers on agricultural water use.

TI  - Seasonal and Interannual Variability of Phytoplankton in the Black Sea on the Basis of Remote Sensing Data and In Situ Measurements of Chlorophyll-a
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The patterns of the seasonal and interannual variability in the development of phytoplankton, including coccolithophores, were studied in the northeastern part of the Black Sea in various seasons. The research was carried out on the basis of long-term observations and data provided by the Modis Aqua ocean color scanner. This paper reports that, in the coastal and open waters of the Black Sea, the development of phytoplankton reaches the highest level in the fall-winter and winter-spring seasons, i.e., in the periods of active winter convection. Coastal waters are also characterized by expressed spring peak of chlorophyll a concentrations associated with phytoplankton bloom in March. Winter and spring coccolithophore blooms, which are unusual for the Black Sea, were registered on the basis of satellite data. It was noted that there is a relationship between the level of coccolithophore development in the summer period and the minimal temperature of the sea surface layer in the preceding winter. The most active coccolithophore blooms, which were registered in 2006 and 2012, were observed after the coldest winters.

TI  - The Hemopump™, The First Intravascular Ventricular Assist Device
T2  - ASAIO JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), based on rotary flow blood pumps, began in earnest after the successful implantation of a catheter-mounted axial flow blood pump via intravascular access in 1988. This device, the Hemopump, successfully supported the circulation of a patient in cardiogenic shock secondary to acute rejection of a transplanted heart. Duration of support was 46 hours, resulting in complete recovery of cardiac function and hospital discharge. In effect, this sentinel event demonstrated that continuous-flow blood pumps could be used to support patients in cardiogenic shock. This held true in spite of many widely held paradigms against rotary blood pumps regarding blood damage, diminished pulsatility, and thrombosis. At this writing, 50,000 patients have been implanted with durable LVADs based on rotary blood pumps as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or destination support as long as 10 years.

TI  - An Illumination-Invariant Change Detection Method Based on Disparity Saliency Map for Multitemporal Optical Remotely Sensed Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal airborne and satellite imagery data with frequent repeat coverage provide great capability for change detection (CD). When comparing two images taken at different times of day or in different seasons for CD, the variation of topographic shades and shadows caused by the change of sunlight angle can be so significant that it overwhelms the real object and environmental changes, making automatic detection unreliable. An effective CD algorithm, therefore, has to be robust to the illumination variation. In this paper, the robustness of phase correlation (PC) to shadow effects is proven via mathematical analysis, and then, an illumination-invariant change detection (IICD) metric is proposed based on pixel-wise dense PC matching. In the proposed IICD method, a graph-based visual saliency map is introduced for the initial CD followed by an active contour-based segmentation to precisely quantize the change region. Compared to the state-of-the-art CD algorithms, experiments using daily images of a landscape model and Landsat satellite images demonstrate that only the proposed method can effectively detect and precisely segment appearance changes under daily and seasonal sunlight changes.

TI  - Effects of aerosol-radiation feedback and topography during an air pollution event over the North China Plain during December 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The online coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was used to investigate a regional haze event, which occurred over the North China Plain (NCP) from 27 to 30 December 2017. Modeling scenarios with and without aerosol-radiation feedback within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) were investigated. By adding aerosol-radiation feedback to the model, we captured the spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed temperature and relative humidity (RH), as well as surface PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 concentrations during this event. The primary meteorological driver of this event was stable meteorological conditions, namely, a low PBL, strong temperature inversion, high RH, and a weak wind field. Aerosol-radiation feedback mechanisms affected these meteorological fields, causing reductions in maximum surface solar radiation, the surface energy budget, PBL height, surface 2-m temperature and middle atmosphere RH, while increasing surface 2-m RH, middle atmosphere temperature, and atmospheric stability. Changes in meteorological variables in turn affected air pollutant distributions and concentrations, with PM2.5 increasing by more than 20 mu g/m(3) over the NCP during this event. Another sensitivity experiment was carried out over the Taihang and Yanshan mountain areas, in which topography was flattened to a 30-m height to explore the impacts of topography on air pollution in the NCP region. Modeling revealed various topographic effects on meteorological variables related to these two mountains, including a lowered PBL height, reduced wind speed, blocked uniform surface winds, and more intense temperature inversion. Consequently, surface air pollutant concentrations increased unevenly over the NCP in this experiment. Implementation of more detailed PBL processes, as well as radiosonde and satellite data products into the WRF-Chem model would improve simulations of haze formation over the NCP.

TI  - A new algorithm for the estimation of leaf unfolding date using MODIS data over China's terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using solely vegetation indices (VIs) from remote sensing is not always sufficient to accurately detect spring leaf phenology, i.e., the leaf unfolding date (LUD). Several current phenology products failed to provide reliable LUD estimates for specific regions and plant functional types, e.g., evergreen species at mid-low latitudes. Therefore, increasing efforts have been made to improve LUD modeling by combining VIs and meteorological variables. Temperature before the growing season ('preseason' henceforth) plays an important role in regulating spring phenology. With ground observations of LUD (LUDOBS) across different plant functional types (PFTs) in China during 2001-2014, we analyzed the response of LUDOBS to preseason temperature temporally and spatially, and proposed an improved LUD modeling algorithm by developing a temperature-based scale factor to adjust the traditional VI-based (i.e., two band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2)) LUD estimates. We found that the new algorithm can better characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of LUD variability for different PFTs, especially for evergreen species where MODIS phenology product failed to provide reliable LUD estimates. Furthermore, we investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of LUD over China with respect to both different vegetation types and climate systems. We showed that for similar to 70% pixels, our new model predicted an overall later LUDs than MODIS phenology product, possibly suggesting an overestimated greening potential of China's terrestrial ecosystems. Our study suggests that preseason temperature plays a previously neglected role in modeling spring LUD and instead of using VIs or temperature alone, a combination of temperature and VIs can improve the prediction of spring phenology.

TI  - Extracting Coastal Raft Aquaculture Data from Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information, especially spatial distribution data, related to coastal raft aquaculture is critical to the sustainable development of marine resources and environmental protection. Commercial high spatial resolution satellite imagery can accurately locate raft aquaculture. However, this type of analysis using this expensive imagery requires a large number of images. In contrast, medium resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat 8 images, are available at no cost, cover large areas with less data volume, and provide acceptable results. Therefore, we used Landsat 8 images to extract the presence of coastal raft aquaculture. Because the high chlorophyll concentration of coastal raft aquaculture areas cause the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the edge features to be salient for the water background, we integrated these features into the proposed method. Three sites from north to south in Eastern China were used to validate the method and compare it with our former proposed method using only object-based visually salient NDVI (OBVS-NDVI) features. The new proposed method not only maintains the true positive results of OBVS-NDVI, but also eliminates most false negative results of OBVS-NDVI. Thus, the new proposed method has potential for use in rapid monitoring of coastal raft aquaculture on a large scale.

TI  - Impact of Climate Variabilities and Human Activities on Surface Water Extents in Reservoirs of Yongding River Basin, China, from 1985 to 2016 Based on Landsat Observations and Time Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yongding River is the largest river flowing through Beijing, the capital city of China. In recent years, Yongding River Basin (YDRB) has witnessed increasing human impacts on water resources, posing serious challenges in hydrological and ecological health. In this study, remote sensing techniques and statistical time series approaches for hydrological studies were combined to characterize the dynamics and driving factors of reservoir water extents in YDRB during 1985-2016. First, 107 Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 images were used to extract surface water extents in YDRB during 1985-2016 using a combination of water indices and Otsu threshold algorithm. Significant positive correlation was found between water extents and the annual inflow for the two biggest reservoirs, the downstream Guanting and upstream Cetian reservoirs, proving their representativeness of surface water availability in this basin. Then, statistical time series approaches including trend-free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall trend test, Pettit change-point test and double mass curve method, which are frequently used in hydrological studies, were adopted to quantify the trend of reservoir water extents dynamics and the relative contributions of climate variability and human activities. Results showed that the water extents in both reservoirs exhibited significant downward trend with change point occurring in 2001 and 2005 for Guanting and Cetian, respectively. About 74%75% of the shrinkage during the post-change period can be attributed to human activities, among which GDP, population, electricity power production, raw coal production, steel and crude iron production, value of agriculture output, and urban area were the major human drivers. Hydrological connectivity between the upstream Cetian and downstream Guanting reservoirs declined during the post-change period. Since 2012, water extents in both reservoirs recovered as a result of various governmental water management policies including the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. The methodology presented in this study can be used for analyzing the dynamics and driving mechanism of surface water resources, especially for un-gauged or poorly-gauged watersheds.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Based on MODIS AOD and NAQPMS Data over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating fine ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) is important to assess air quality and to support epidemiological studies. To analyze the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 concentrations, previous studies used different methodologies, such as statistical models or neural networks, to estimate PM2.5. However, there is little research on full-coverage PM2.5 estimation using a combination of ground-measured, satellite-estimated, and atmospheric chemical model data. In this study, the linear mixed effect (LME) model, which used the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), meteorological data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and elevation data as predictors, was fitted for 2017 over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH). The LME model was used to calibrate the PM2.5 concentration using the nested air-quality prediction modeling system (NAQPMS) simulated with ground measurements. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was used to fuse satellite-estimated and model-calibrated PM2.5. The results showed a strong agreement with ground measurements, with an overall coefficient (R-2) of 0.78 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 26.44 g/m(3) in cross-validation (CV). The seasonal R-2 values were 0.75, 0.62, 0.80, and 0.78 in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The fusion results supplement the lack of satellite estimates and can capture more detailed information than the NAQPMS model. Therefore, the results will be helpful for pollution process analyses and health-related studies.

TI  - Crop type mapping without field-level labels: Random forest transfer and unsupervised clustering techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping at the field level is necessary for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring and food security. As remote sensing imagery continues to increase in spatial and temporal resolution, it is becoming an increasingly powerful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, automated crop type mapping remains constrained by a lack of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models, in this study, we explore the use of random forests transferred across geographic distance and time and unsupervised methods in conjunction with aggregate crop statistics for crop type mapping in the US Midwest, where we simulated the label-poor setting by depriving the models of labels in various states and years. We validated our methodology using available 30 m spatial resolution crop type labels from the US Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Using Google Earth Engine, we computed Fourier transforms (or harmonic regressions) on the time series of Landsat Surface Reflectance and derived vegetation indices, and extracted the coefficients as features for machine learning models. We found that random forests trained on regions and years similar in growing degree days (ODD) transfer to the target region with accuracies consistently exceeding 80%. Accuracies decrease as differences in GDD expand. Unsupervised Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with class labels derived using county-level crop statistics classify crops less consistently but require no field-level labels for training. GMM achieves over 85% accuracy in states with low crop diversity (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska), but performs sometimes no better than random when high crop diversity interferes with clustering (North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan). Under the appropriate conditions, these methods offer options for field-resolution crop type mapping in regions around the world with few or no ground labels.

TI  - <i>The 2017 M</i><sub>w </sub><i>6</i>.<i>6 Poso Earthquake</i>: <i>Implications for Extrusion Tectonics in Central Sulawesi</i>
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining how faults behave during large earthquakes can help provide insight into the mechanism of regional tectonism. Here, we use Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to estimate the source parameters of the 2017 M-w 6.6 Poso earthquake, eastern Indonesia. The results show that the coseismic rupture was predominated by normal faulting at depths of 3-10 km, whereas some distinct dextral strike slip is also resolved along the down-dip direction of normal-faulting zones. We analyze the background seismicity, regional topography, and fault kinematics to investigate the present-day tectonics of central Sulawesi as well as its evolutionary processes. Our preferred slip model provides support for the proposed kinematic model that attributes the extension in central Sulawesi to gravitational collapse, in which mass lateral extrusion along the large-scale Palu-Koro strike-slip fault played an important role.

TI  - Displacement monitoring and modeling of Qinghai-Tibet Railway in permafrost area using Sentinel-1A data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal freezing and thawing of permafrost can cause great damage to the environment and the geological structure, resulting in instability of engineering structures. Therefore, it is very necessary to continuously monitor the deformation of Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) in the seasonal permafrost region. In this study, 38 Sentinel-1A SAR images, spanning from October 20, 2014 to March 26, 2017, were explored for displacement monitoring of QTR in permafrost area. Displacement time series (about 2.5years) of QTR from Dangxiong to Yangbajin (QTR_DY) section were achieved. Seasonal characteristic of the displacement, negatively correlated to temperature (R=-0.833) and precipitation (R=-0.727), is shown. Possible uneven settlement in two sections along QTR_DY is detected. A multivariate displacement model, considering both temperature and precipitation, which is proposed, can be used for railway displacement prediction.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of phenology in Yangtze River Delta based on MODIS NDVI time series from 2001 to 2015
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology has become a good indicator for illustrating the long-term changes in the natural resources of the Yangtze River Delta. However, two issues can be observed from previous studies. On the one hand, existing time-series classification methods mainly using a single classifier, the discrimination power, can become deteriorated due to fluctuations characterizing the time series. On the other hand, previous work on the Yangtze River Delta was limited in the spatial domain (usually to 16 cities) and in the temporal domain (usually 2000-2010). To address these issues, this study attempts to analyze the spatiotemporal variation in phenology in the Yangtze River Delta (with 26 cities, enlarged by the state council in June 2016), facilitated by classifying the land cover types and extracting the phenological metrics based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series collected from 2001 to 2015. First, ensemble learning (EL)-based classifiers are used for land cover classification, where the training samples (a total of 201,597) derived from visual interpretation based on GlobelLand30 are further screened using vertex component analysis (VCA), resulting in 600 samples for training and the remainder for validating. Then, eleven phenological metrics are extracted by TIMESAT (a package name) based on the time series, where a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL-decomposition) is used to remove spikes and a Savitzky-Golay filter is used for filtering. Finally, the spatio-temporal phenology variation is analyzed by considering the classification maps and the phenological metrics. The experimental results indicate that: 1) random forest (RF) obtains the most accurate classification map (with an overall accuracy higher than 96%); 2) different land cover types illustrate the various seasonalities; 3) the Yangtze River Delta has two obvious regions, i.e., the north and the south parts, resulting from different rainfall, temperature, and ecosystem conditions; 4) the phenology variation over time is not significant in the study area; 5) the correlation between gross spring greenness (GSG) and gross primary productivity (GPP) is very high, indicating the potential use of GSG for assessing the carbon flux.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of MODIS Collection 6.1 aerosol optical depth against AERONET over regions in China with multifarious underlying surfaces
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products and compared them with the Collection 6 (C6) products over regions in China with multifarious underlying surfaces during 2001-2016. The AOD retrievals were validated against 20 AERONET (V3) sites, and the results show that the correlation coefficient (R) for dark target (DT) retrievals in C6.1 is 0.946, while the fraction within the expected error (EE) can be considered relatively low at only 54.03%. Deep blue (DB) retrievals in C6.1 have a slightly lower R value (0.931), but the other criteria are superior to DT. Comparing the results over urban and vegetation areas in C6.1, the overall quality of the DB retrievals is better than the DT retrievals in urban areas. The performance of DT is significantly superior to DB in the low elevation vegetation (LEV) areas. For the high elevation vegetation (HEV) areas, DB performs integrally better than DT. In the spatial distribution aspect in C6.1, most of the DB AOD values are less than those of DT, and the relationship between DT and DB varies with the land cover types and surface reflectance. For the AOD coverage in C6.1, DT retrievals with high coverage mainly distribute in east-central China. However, the effects of high surface reflectance lead to low AOD coverage in the southwest. In contrast, the AOD coverage of DB tends to be high in areas where the main land cover type is arid or semiarid and tends to be low in areas affected by snow. In terms of the comparison between C6.1 and C6, the overestimation of DT over urban areas in C6 is effectively mitigated in C6.1. However, a nearly systematic decline in DT is discovered in C6.1 as well. With respect to DB, consistent AOD coverage distribution is observed, with only subtle distinction. The AOD coverage of DB in C6.1 appears higher than that in C6 in the middle, south, and northeast of China. The quality of the DB retrievals in C6.1 increases slightly compared to C6, and the major improvements are observed for the coarse aerosol particles and for high elevation areas at surface reflectance from 0.11 to 0.2, respectively.

TI  - Automatic Ship Detection Based on RetinaNet Using Multi-Resolution Gaofen-3 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Independent of daylight and weather conditions, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is widely applied to detect ships in marine surveillance. The shapes of ships are multi-scale in SAR imagery due to multi-resolution imaging modes and their various shapes. Conventional ship detection methods are highly dependent on the statistical models of sea clutter or the extracted features, and their robustness need to be strengthened. Being an automatic learning representation, the RetinaNet object detector, one kind of deep learning model, is proposed to crack this obstacle. Firstly, feature pyramid networks (FPN) are used to extract multi-scale features for both ship classification and location. Then, focal loss is used to address the class imbalance and to increase the importance of the hard examples during training. There are 86 scenes of Chinese Gaofen-3 Imagery at four resolutions, i.e., 3 m, 5 m, 8 m, and 10 m, used to evaluate our approach. Two Gaofen-3 images and one Constellation of Small Satellite for Mediterranean basin Observation (Cosmo-SkyMed) image are used to evaluate the robustness. The experimental results reveal that (1) RetinaNet not only can efficiently detect multi-scale ships but also has a high detection accuracy; (2) compared with other object detectors, RetinaNet achieves more than a 96% mean average precision (mAP). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder Onboard the FY-3D Satellite From Prelaunch Multiangle Calibration Data in Thermal/Vacuum Test
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A newly designed thermal/vacuum (T/V) prelaunch multiangle calibration test is proposed for Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) onboard the Feng Yun 3D satellite. Compared with other existing prelaunch calibration tests designed at fix scan angle, this test is first proposed to analyze the measurements of MWHTS from multiscan angles. A set of comprehensive calibration method is established and used for calibration data processing. The high-quality data preprocessing methods are performed. Essential calibration coefficients such as cold bias, hot bias, and nonlinearity coefficients, and calibration results such as calibration residual error, sensitivity, and calibration accuracy of MWHTS are all obtained and analyzed in MWHTS's six observing positions. The measured sensitivity value of channel 2 is 1.5 K while the measured sensitivities of the others range from 0.18 to 0.57 K. The calibration accuracy of channel 2 is 1.5 K while the calibration accuracies of the others range from 0.32 to 0.7 K. According to the discrepancy of multiangle calibration test results, the radiation leakage and the response lag for special channels are discovered for the first time in T/V test, and the reasons of these two special phenomena are fully analyzed. Moreover, the measurements of the T/V test with fast changing instrument temperatures are analyzed and the applicability of nonlinearity coefficients obtained in T/V test for in-orbit calibration is verified. In conclusion, MWHTS meets the basic design requirements of sensitivity and calibration accuracy, the changing of the MWHTS observing positions does not impact the calibration coefficients and results, and the nonlinearity coefficients obtained in T/V test are valid when instrument temperature experiences some fast changing.

T2  - CHIANG MAI JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Jupiter's auroral region, a spot-like emission feature, called the auroral magnetic footprint, is the result of a magnetic disturbance near the extended atmosphere of Io. The magnetic footprint is direct evidence of the interaction between the atmosphere of slow-orbiting Io and the rapidly-corotating magnetic field and magnetospheric plasma of Jupiter. The result of the magnetic disturbance is that a significant amount of current is carried from the interaction region towards Jupiter's ionosphere. Accordingly the precipitating electrons result in the auroral emission. Far ultraviolet (FUV) images of Jupiter's auroral region were used to study this phenomenon. In 2007, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the observation of Io's magnetic footprint provided the opportunity for a detailed study of the correlation between the spot's brightness and its angular size. With a strong correlation (>0.7) between the brightness and the angular size, these two physical properties were clearly related during March and June, 2007, several weeks after major volcanic eruptions on Io were observed. These results suggest a connection between the plasma supply from Io, due to the volcanic activities on Io and the satellite's auroral magnetic footprint morphology.

T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we evaluated several Earth observation methodologies for automatically delineating crop field boundaries from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The methodology makes use of edge detection that is applied to multiple images acquired during a growing season and image segmentation to delimit agricultural fields, orchards and vineyards. Two edge detection operators (Canny and Scharr) and three image segmentation algorithms (watershed, multi-threshold and multi-resolution) were combined and evaluated, resulting in six experiments (scenarios). A rule-based (knowledge-based) classification was applied to the extracted image objects to discard uncultivated areas. Reference field boundaries, manually digitised from very high (10 cm) resolution aerial imagery, were used for quantitative accuracy assessments and qualitative comparisons. The quantitative accuracy assessment consisted of both area- and edge-based metrics. The results showed that the watershed segmentation, combined with Canny edge detection, produced the most accurate field boundaries with an OA of 92.9% and combined MAE of 24.5 m. The Scharr algorithm produced thicker edges, causing positional errors along the boundaries. The multi-resolution and multi-threshold segmentation algorithms produced boundary inaccuracies ranging from 1 to 3 pixels, largely due to the creation of thick boundary objects, which caused offsets of the extracted borders on both sides of the reference boundaries. The combination of Canny edge detection (performed on multiple Sentinel-2 images acquired during the growing season) and watershed segmentation is thus recommended for operational field boundary delineation.

TI  - Application of remote sensing technologies to identify impacts of nutritional deficiencies on forests
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The application of fertiliser is an important silvicultural practice that can induce significant increases in tree growth. However, as responses to fertilisation vary widely, the accurate identification of infertile stands is critical to ensure that this treatment is applied in a cost-effective manner. Through synthesising literature from a range of disciplines the aim of this review is to examine the utility of remotely sensed data for diagnosing nutritional deficiencies in forests.Key symptoms associated with nutrient deficiencies include reductions in leaf area and lower foliar concentrations of important elements and pigments such as chlorophyll, Nitrogen (N), and Phosphorus (P). Methods that have been used for diagnosing nutrient deficiencies include soil and foliage sampling and knowledge of the underlying parent material or soil type. Water availability and forest stand variables that include age, basal area, stand density, and Site Index have been found to influence forest responsiveness to fertiliser application. Although simple models have been developed from these variables their predictive utility is often limited. More recently, diagnostic tools have been developed based on variables that are more physiologically aligned with growth processes influenced by fertilisation, such as leaf area index (LAI), and forest canopy level foliage properties.Remotely sensed data provides a means of scaling predictions of nutrient limitations to the landscape level and has most potential in predicting important stand attributes such as LAI and foliage nutrition. Models of LAI have been developed using both spectral data and LiDAR. However, background effects and increased scattering from non-vegetation components limit the precision of reflectance-based models and these models are most suitable at lower LAI (less than or similar to 4). In contrast, LiDAR-based models have been found to have a higher precision than reflectance-based models and do not saturate at high LAI. Empirical and semi-physical models developed from discrete LiDAR have been successfully used to predict LAI in a range of forest types and waveform LiDAR shows considerable promise for direct measurement of gap fraction.Canopy level foliage properties have been most commonly predicted using hyperspectral imagery. Considerable research shows that in situ hyperspectral imagery can be used to develop precise models of foliage chlorophyll, N, and P content, but relationships from this data source are weaker for other elements. The most commonly used platform for scaling these predictions to the canopy level has been a fixed wing aircraft although satellite imagery has also been widely used for this purpose. Of the methods used to develop models, machine learning produces the most precise models, followed by partial least squares which is in turn more precise than regression.Although much research has examined how remotely sensed data can be used to predict foliage properties and LAI, very few studies have used these relationships to develop a framework for accurately diagnosing nutrient deficiencies within forests. Further research should focus on developing decision support tools, based on remotely sensed data, for diagnosing nutrient deficiencies. Such an approach is likely to provide managers with a cost-effective means of improving forest productivity.

TI  - MODIS Collection 6.1 aerosol optical depth products over land and ocean: validation and comparison
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the newest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products were available with various refinements and improvements made to both the radiation calibration and Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms. A combined DT and DB dataset (DTB) was also added based on piecewise fixed thresholds using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for taking advantage of one's merits. This study provides a cross-comparison and evaluation of these Terra MODIS aerosol products with reference to the enhanced ground-based AOD measurements by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Level 3 Version 2.0 data at 384 ground stations. Their absolute and relative performance are evaluated in the period of 2013-2017 among the products, as well as between the current (C6.1) and previous (C6) releases. In general, the C6.1 aerosol products are found to be superior over the C6 products for three datasets from all scales, but the differences and improvements are rather non-uniform that varies with region. Overall, the DB AOD products show the best performance in most regions at about half of the sites, especially in Europe and North America. Meanwhile, besides bright surfaces (i.e., deserts and arid/semi-arid areas), DB products match more closely with the AERONET AODs than that of DT over medium or densely vegetated areas. The dependences of retrieval errors illustrate that the performance of three datasets deteriorates as surface reflectance, elevation and aerosol loading increase. However, the DB algorithm remains relatively more stable and less affected by changes in atmospheric and surface conditions. While the merged product using NDVI has some improvements over individual ones in general, worse performance is also shown in many cases. A more optimal method is thus wanting.

TI  - Onshore-offshore wind energy resource evaluation based on synergetic use of multiple satellite data and meteorological stations in Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for efficient and cost-effective renewable energy is increasing as traditional sources of energy such as oil, coal, and natural gas, can no longer satisfy growing global energy demands. Among renewable energies, wind energy is the most prominent due to its low, manageable impacts on the local environment. Based on meteorological data from 2006 to 2014 and multi-source satellite data (i.e., Advanced Scatterometer, Quick Scatterometer, and Windsat) from 1999 to 2015, an assessment of the onshore and offshore wind energy potential in Jiangsu Province was performed by calculating the average wind speed, average wind direction, wind power density, and annual energy production (AEP). Results show that Jiangsu has abundant wind energy resources, which increase from inland to coastal areas. In onshore areas, wind power density is predominantly less than 200 W/m(2), while in offshore areas, wind power density is concentrates in the range of 328-500 W/m(2). Onshore areas comprise more than 13,573.24 km(2), mainly located in eastern coastal regions with good wind farm potential. The total wind power capacity in onshore areas could be as much as 2.06 x 10(5) GWh. Meanwhile, offshore wind power generation in Jiangsu Province is calculated to reach 2 x 10(6) GWh, which is approximately four times the electricity demand of the entire Jiangsu Province. This study validates the effective application of Advanced Scatterometer, Quick Scatterometer, and Windsat data to coastal wind energy monitoring in Jiangsu. Moreover, the methodology used in this study can be effectively applied to other similar coastal zones.

TI  - "Flower spirals": incomplete incarnation as a constructive principle in Afanasii Fet's poetry
T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fet's worldview is interpreted as a tense combination of two mutually exclusive trends. One is a permanent, essentially suicidal urge to dissolve and cease to exist, motivated, on the surface, by Schopenhauer. The other expressed itself in the pragmatic desire to achieve a career, that is to assert and strengthen one's earthly existence however ephemeral it is perceived by the mind. The former view, captured in Fet's very poetry, led to the unrestrained dynamics of the lyrical subject who is always prone to become one with objects of the external world, to transform into another person or to melt away in a dreamy haze. The second trend was expressed in all Fet's constructive social roles as a country squire and as a judge and, not least, in his conservative journalism and then in the servile behavior in contacts with the throne. In Fet's poetry, however, a compromise is achieved between the two polar aspirations, attraction to non-existence and desire to be. It is the permanent motif of under-incarnation, incompleteness of all action or state. This prevailing treat turns into an inescapable fear of sex. It possibly was prompted by Fet's own phobias, but it also coincided which one of Russian romanticism dominant features.

TI  - Formyl peptide receptor-1 activation exerts a critical role for the dynamic plasticity of arteries via actin polymerization
T2  - PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Several human diseases, include cancer and stroke are characterized by changes in immune system activation and vascular contractility. However, the mechanistic foundation of a vascular immuno-physiology network is still largely unknown. Formyl peptide receptor-1 (FPR-1), which plays a vital role in the function of the innate immune system, is widely expressed in arteries, but its role in vascular plasticity is unclear. We questioned why a receptor that is crucial for immune defense, and cell motility in leukocytes, would be expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We hypothesized that activation of FPR-1 in arteries is important for the temporal reorganization of actin filaments, and consequently, changes in vascular function, similar to what is observed in neutrophils. To address our hypothesis, we used FPR-1 knockout and VSMCs lacking FPR-1. We observed that FPR-1 activation induces actin polymerization in wild type VSMCs. Absence of FPR-1 in the vasculature significantly decreased vascular contraction and induced loss of myogenic tone to elevated intraluminal pressures via disruption of actin polymerization. Actin polymerization activator ameliorated these responses. In conclusion, we have established a novel role for FPR-1 in VSMC contractility and motility, similar to the one observed in sentinel cells of the innate immune system. This discovery is fundamental for vascular immuno-pathophysiology, given that FPR-1 in VSMCs not only functions as an immune system receptor, but it also has an important role for the dynamic plasticity of arteries.

TI  - Geophysical Monitoring of Moisture-Induced Landslides: A Review
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Geophysical monitoring of landslides can provide insights into spatial and temporal variations of subsurface properties associated with slope failure. Recent improvements in equipment, data analysis, and field operations have led to a significant increase in the use of such techniques in monitoring. Geophysical methods complement intrusive approaches, which sample only a very small proportion of the subsurface, and walk-over or remotely sensed data, which principally provide information only at the ground surface. In particular, recent studies show that advances in geophysical instrumentation, data processing, modeling, and interpretation in the context of landslide monitoring are significantly improving the characterization of hillslope hydrology and soil and rock hydrology and strength and their dynamics over time. This review appraises the state of the art of geophysical monitoring, as applied to moisture-induced landslides. Here we focus on technical and practical uses of time-lapse methods in geophysics applied to monitoring moisture-induced landslide. The case studies identified in this review show that several geophysical techniques are currently used in the monitoring of subsurface landslide processes. These geophysical contributions to monitoring and predicting the evolution of landslide processes are currently underrealized. Hence, the further integration of multiple-parametric and geotechnically coupled geophysical monitoring systems has considerable potential. The complementary nature of certain methods to map the distribution of subsurface moisture and elastic moduli will greatly increase the predictive and monitoring capacity of early warning systems in moisture-induced landslide settings.

TI  - Automatic bathymetry retrieval from SAR images
T2  - CEAS SPACE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry, the topography of the sea floor, is in high demand due to the increase in offshore constructions like wind parks. It is also an important dataset for climate change modelling, when sea level rises and changes in circulation currents are to be simulated. The retrieval of accurate bathymetry data is a cost-intensive task usually requiring a survey vessel charting the respective area. However, bathymetry can also be retrieved remotely using data from Earth observation satellites. The main point of this study is the development of a processor that allows the automatic derivation of gridded bathymetry information from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Observations of sea state modifications in SAR images are used to derive the bathymetry in shelf areas using the shoaling effect, which causes wavelengths to become shorter when reaching shallower waters. The water depth is derived using the dispersion relation for surface water waves, which requires wavelength and wave period as input parameters. While the wavelength can be directly retrieved from the SAR image, for the peak period additional information and procedures are required, e.g. local measurements or complex SAR data. A method for automatically deriving the wave period for swell waves in SAR images was developed and tested in this paper. It uses depth data from public databases as initial values which are compared to derived depths iterating through possible peak periods along the calculation grid; the peak period resulting in a minimal root-mean-square deviation is then used for bathymetry calculation. The bathymetry derived from a TerraSAR-X acquisition of the Channel Islands is presented; the resulting peak wave period of 11.3 s fits well to nearby in situ measurement data.

TI  - Terror Management Theory and mortality awareness: A missing link in climate response studies?
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptation and mitigation efforts are hampered by multiple obstacles and thus lag behind climate changes' speed and scope. Some of the most powerful obstacles to climate action are the social-psychological factors that influence human thought, preferences, and behaviors. These factors, including those articulated by environmental psychology generally, and Terror Management Theory (TMT) specifically, are neglected within climate response research. TMT underlies an extensive and well-established literature; researchers have shown that efforts to repress one's mortality awareness, triggered when people are explicitly or implicitly reminded of their unavoidable death, influences individuals' attitudes and behavior. These psychological defenses, including denial, distraction and worldview defense, sometimes produce counter-intuitive and potentially counter-productive outcomes. Meanwhile, the growing global awareness and media coverage of climate change, and much scholarly research, has skewed toward negative "disaster and death" narratives. Exposure to such stimuli, highlighting climate change's potentially life-threatening effects, may exacerbate counter-productive responses. In this thought experiment, we propose that mortality awareness could be a critical variable that helps explain climate action at the individual and societal levels. We survey TMT insights, focusing on the relationship between mortality reminders and human responses. We then identify how climate change may lead to increased mortality awareness and consider the psychological defenses triggered by this awareness. We argue that mortality defenses may both limit and advance climate action. Finally, we set out an agenda for TMT-climate response research and discuss the potential to advance several inquiry lines, including climate change communication, collective action and the capacity for transformational responses.

TI  - Oral injuries in children less than 24 months of age in a pediatric emergency department
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Oral injuries in young children may indicate physical abuse. The prevalence of oral injuries in young children presenting to the emergency department is unknown. These data would assist providers in making decisions about the need for further abuse evaluation.Objective: To determine the prevalence of oral injuries, associated chief complaints and characteristics, and frequency of abuse evaluations in children younger than 24 months presenting to a pediatric emergency department (PED).Participants and Setting: Twelve pediatric emergency medicine physicians consecutively enrolled children younger than 24 months in a tertiary care PED.Methods: We performed a prospective observational study. Enrolled patients underwent a complete oral examination. Providers recorded patient demographics, type of chief complaint, oral injury details, developmental ability, and the presence of an abuse evaluation.Results: Oral injuries occurred in 36/1303 (2.8%, 95% CI 1.9-3.8%) and were more common in patients with traumatic (26/200, 13%) versus medical chief complaints (10/1,103, 0.9%) (p <.001). Of patients with oral injuries (36), 78% were mobile and 72% had traumatic chief complaints. Nine (25%) children with oral injuries were evaluated for abuse. Oral injuries in children 0-11 months old were more likely to be evaluated for abuse than children 12-24 months old (70.0% vs. 7.7%, p <.001).Conclusions: The prevalence of oral injuries in children < 24 months old presenting to a PED was low. Most occurred in mobile children and in children with traumatic chief complaints. Younger, non-mobile children with oral injuries had a higher likelihood of having an abuse evaluation.

TI  - A Novel Method to Extract Narrow Water Using a Top-Hat White Transform Enhancement Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel water extraction method is proposed to improve the ability of delineation of the narrow water for the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) derived from remotely sensed images. This method introduces a morphological white top-hat transforming operation on the MNDWI to construct a morphological narrow water index (MNWI). The MNWI can effectively enhance the local contrast of linear objects, such that the narrow water can be easily separated from mountain shadows, bare patches and other land covers in the MNDWI image. Furthermore, a dual-threshold segmentation method was also used to extract the potential water bodies by combining an empirical threshold segmentation on the MNDWI and an automatic threshold segmentation on the MNWI. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated with three experimental datasets, clipped from two different Landsat images, and the results demonstrate that the narrow water bodies can be effectively extracted with the overall accuracy being over 90%. Visually, most of the narrow streams or rivers keep continuous shapes in space and their water boundaries are also precisely delineated.

TI  - Sparsity-Driven GMTI Processing Framework With Multichannel SAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a processing framework to separate moving targets from the clutter, under multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenarios, and addresses the moving target imaging and velocity estimation problems for ground moving target indication (GMTI) applications. A practical implementation is introduced to break the SAR/GMTI problem into two processing stages, and the sparsity of the moving targets in the observed scene is exploited throughout the stages. The two-stage process extracts the moving targets from the monitored region via a sparsity-based iterative decomposition algorithm and subsequently estimates the complete velocity vectors of moving targets by enforcing sparsity constraints. The model is sufficiently versatile to incorporate digital elevation map information, which further improves the moving target relocation accuracy. The effectiveness of the presented framework is demonstrated using the Air Force Research Laboratory Gotcha GMTI challenge data.

TI  - Investigation of Remote Sensing Imageries for Identifying Soil Texture Classes Using Classification Methods
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the usefulness of remote sensing imageries for identifying soil texture classes was evaluated by classification trees under one-against-one (OAO), one-against-all, and all-together schemes. A set of normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) was obtained from cloud-free Landsat images over a small mountainous watershed. Terrain indicators (elevation, slope, and topographic wetness index) were derived from a digital elevation map (30 m). Models with different input parameters (purely NDVI, purely topography and stratum, and NDVI plus topography and stratum) were developed. Overall accuracy, kappa statistic, receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and the area under ROC curve (AUC) were applied to evaluate the classification accuracy. Results showed that the classification strategy had great effects on the outputs. The models under OAO scheme performed better with averaged overall accuracy, kappa statistic, and AUC of 0.949, 0.821, and 0.87, respectively. Among them, the model with NDVI plus topography and stratum performed best with overall accuracy, kappa statistic, and AUC of 0.975, 0.918, and 0.907, respectively. Similar performances were obtained by the model with purely NDVI and the model with purely topography and stratum. More samples of clay and sand were identified with the help of NDVI. The contributions of NDVI to explain soil texture class variability were 144%, 0%, and 14% for clay, loam, and sand, respectively. NDVI measured during the stem and leaf growth period of sweet potatoes was the optimum period for identifying soil texture classes in the watershed. Our findings will provide valuable information for assessing the quality of ecological environment using remote sensing data.

TI  - Reassessment of high prevalence human adenovirus detections among residents of two refugee centers in Kenya under surveillance for acute respiratory infections
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) were previously detected at high prevalence by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the upper respiratory tract of residents of two Kenyan refugee camps under surveillance for acute respiratory infection (ARI) between October 2006 and April 2008. We sought to confirm this finding and characterize the HAdVs detected. Of 2148 respiratory specimens originally tested, 511 (23.8%) screened positive for HAdV and 510 were available for retesting. Of these, 421 (82.4%) were confirmed positive by repeat rRT-PCR or PCR and sequencing. Other respiratory viruses were codetected in 55.8% of confirmed HAdV-positive specimens. Species B and C viruses predominated at 82.8%, and HAdV-C1, -C2, and -B3 were the most commonly identified types. Species A, D, and F HAdVs, which are rarely associated with ARI, comprised the remainder. Viral loads were highest among species B HAdVs, particularly HAdV-B3. Species C showed the widest range of viral loads, and species A, D, and F were most often present at low loads and more often with codetections. These findings suggest that many HAdV detections were incidental and not a primary cause of ARI among camp patients. Species/type, codetections, and viral load determinations may permit more accurate HAdV disease burden estimates in these populations.

TI  - Study of the desertification index based on the albedo-MSAVI feature space for semi-arid steppe region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification has been listed as the top of ten major problems affecting global environmental changes, and represents one of the important reasons of semi-arid grassland degradation. It is therefore crucial to understand ecological environment of semi-arid grasslands and temporal and spatial changes in real time for regional and local environmental protection and management. At present, remote sensing technology is being widely used in monitoring and evaluation of land desertification due to its wide observation range, large amount of information, fast data updating and high accuracy. It represents an advanced method for remote sensing monitoring of desertification by extracting various indicators and constructing feature space. Based on this, this study used Landsat images and field survey data to establish a desertification index (SASDI) model based on the albedo-MSAVI (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) feature space and analyze the relationship between desertification and surface quantitative parameters in semi-arid grassland area. Results show that the SASDI model has a high correlation (R-2=0.7585) with the organic matter in the soil surface and makes full use of multi-dimensional remote sensing information. The index reflects the surface cover, water, and heat combination as well as changes of the desertification land, with a clear biophysical significance. Moreover, the index is simple and easy to obtain, facilitating to quantitative analysis and continuous monitoring of desertification in semi-arid grasslands.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of the biomass of floating <i>Ulva prolifera</i> and analysis of the main factors driving the interannual variability of the biomass in the Yellow Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, green tide blooms with Ulva prolifera as the dominant species have occurred every summer in the Yellow Sea. Biomass is a critical parameter used to describe the severity of green tide blooms. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between several indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), floating algae index (FM), ratio vegetation index (RVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), ocean surface algal bloom index (OSABI), Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) approach) and the biomass per unit area of Ulva prolifera by using the in situ measurements from a water tank experiment. EVI, NDVI, and FM showed strong exponential relationships with Ulva prolifera biomass per unit area. In order to apply the relationships to satellite remote sensing data, the impacts of the atmosphere (different aerosol optical depth at 550 nm) and mixed pixels to the relationships were analyzed. The results show that atmosphere has little effect on the relationship between EVI and Ulva prolifera biomass per unit area with R-2 = 0.94 and APD (the average percentage deviation) = 19.55% when EVI is calculated from Rr, (Rayleigh-corrected reflectance), and R-2 = 0.95 and APD = 17.53% when EVI is calculated from Rm. (top-of-atmosphere reflectance). Due to the low sensitivity to the atmosphere, the EVI relationship can be directly utilized in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance without atmospheric correction. In addition, the EVI was slightly affected by mixed pixels with the APD only increased by similar to 10%. The EVI relationship was then applied to a long MODIS image time series to obtain the maximal total biomass of floating Ulva prolifera in the Yellow Sea from 2007 to 2016. The results showed that the maximum and minimum total biomass occurred in 2016 (similar to 1.17 million tons) and 2012 (similar to 0.074 million tons), respectively. The main factors that caused the inter-annual biomass variability were analyzed. The total amount of nutrients from Sheyang River which was the largest river on the northern coast of Jiangsu Province, and Porphyra cultivation in the Radial Sand Ridges of Jiangsu Province had both strong correlation with Ulva prolifera total biomass.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Based Method to Detect Soil Erosion in Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainwater-induced soil erosion occurring in the forest is a special phenomenon of soil erosion in many red soil areas. Detection of such soil erosion is essential for developing land management to reduce soil loss in areas including southern China and other red soil regions of the world. Remotely sensed canopy cover is often used to determine the potential of soil erosion over a large spatial scale, which, however, becomes less useful in forest areas. This study proposes a new remote sensing method to detect soil erosion under forest canopy and presents a case study in a forest area in southern China. Five factors that are closely related to soil erosion in forest were used as discriminators to develop the model. These factors include fractional vegetation coverage, nitrogen reflectance index, yellow leaf index, bare soil index and slope. They quantitatively represent vegetation density, vegetation health status, soil exposure intensity and terrain steepness that are considered relevant to forest soil erosion. These five factors can all be derived from remote sensing imagery based on related thematic indices or algorithms. The five factors were integrated to create the soil erosion under forest model (SEUFM) through Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or a multiplication method. The case study in the forest area in Changting County of southern China with a Landsat 8 image shows that the first principal component-based SEUFM achieves an overall accuracy close to 90%, while the multiplication-based model reaches 81%. The detected locations of soil erosion in forest provide the target areas to be managed from further soil loss. The proposed method provides a tool to understand more about soil erosion in forested areas where soil erosion is usually not considered an issue. Therefore, the method is useful for soil conservation in forest.

TI  - Trans-pacific aerosol vertical structure revealed by spaceborne lidar CALIOP
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 5-year (2011-2015) spaceborne lidar CALIOP (cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarization) data were aggregated to obtain a seasonal three-dimensional (3-D) distribution of aerosols over the Northern Pacific (NP). Superior to the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product, which provided only the bulk Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), the vertical high-resolution Aerosol Extinction Coefficient (AEC) obtained from the CALIOP product enabled us to determine the AOD for the prescribed layers. By integrating the AEC at the prescribed height interval, the AOD beneath and above 2 km was obtained to characterize the aerosol loading in the surface layer (SL) and the free troposphere (FT), respectively. The AOD in the SL and FT present different seasonal variation patterns over the NP. The SL AOD exhibited the highest level in the winter, which was caused by sea salt emissions driven by the strongest winds. However, a much higher FT AOD occurred over the NP in the springtime compared with that of other seasons, indicating that the most significant transpacific transport occurred in the springtime, mainly in the FT. Fine resolution aerosol distributions in cross section along a transpacific direction were extracted from the CALIOP product as well. Along the cross section, aerosol loading was most abundant below 2 km for all the seasons. However, the detectable aerosol layer may extend to 10 kin high in the springtime, which is much higher than that in the other seasons, and the aerosol layers below and above 2 km were separated over the remote NP. The CALIOP data demonstrated that dust plays a role in aloft aerosol transport. In terms of aerosol transport in the FT, an 8-fold decrease in the FT AOD occurred during the journey from East Asia to the Eastern Pacific in the summer, which was the sharpest decrease compared with the smallest one, which has 3-fold decrease occurred in the spring. Aerosol transport in the FT contributed 19% of the AOD over western North America (NA) in the spring, which was much higher than that in other seasons, and the aloft aerosol transport between 2 and 4 kin high corresponded to a fine PM concentration of 1-2 mu g m(-3) as a contributor to air quality over western NA.

TI  - Thin cloud removal from optical remote sensing images using the noise adjusted principal components transform
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover is a common problem in optical remote sensing images due to its contamination of the reflectance from the Earth's surface. Cloud removal has become a necessary preprocessing step for most applications. In this paper, we develop an effective thin cloud removal method with the help of a noise-adjusted principal components transform model (CR-NAPCT). We discover that cloud-contaminated data has the highest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) due to its high spatial correlation, and are shown in the first NAPCT component (NAPC1) in the NAPCT data. Image restoration is achieved by performing an inverse NAPCT after removing the cloud component in NAPC1. In the experiments, both simulated and real images from Landsat 8 were used to assess the performance of the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively. The results show that the CR-NAPCT method is effective in eliminating thin cloud effects and performs better than the existing similar approaches tested.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Aerosol Optical Depth and Its Relationship with Urbanization in Shandong Province
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of rapid urbanization, air environment quality has become a hot issue. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can be used to monitor air pollution effectively. In this paper, the Spearman coefficient is used to analyze the correlations between AOD and urban development, construction factors, and geographical environment factors in Shandong Province. The correlation between AOD and local climatic conditions in Shandong Province is analyzed by geographic weight regression (GWR). The results show that in the time period from 2007 to 2017, the AOD first rose and then fell, reaching its highest level in 2012, which is basically consistent with the time when the national environmental protection decree was issued. In terms of quarterly and monthly changes, AOD also rose first and then fell, the highest level in summer, with the highest monthly value occurring in June. In term of the spatial distribution, the high-value area is located in the northwestern part of Shandong Province, and the low-value area is located in the eastern coastal area. In terms of social factors, the correlation between pollutant emissions and AOD is much greater the correlations between AOD and population, economy, and construction indicators. In terms of environmental factors, the relationship between digital elevation model (DEM), temperature, precipitation, and AOD is significant, but the regulation of air in coastal areas is even greater. Finally, it was found that there are no obvious differences in AOD among cities with different development levels, which indicates that urban development does not inevitably lead to air pollution. Reasonable development planning and the introduction of targeted environmental protection policies can effectively alleviate pollution-related problems in the process of urbanization.

TI  - Simulation of land-use changes in relation to changes of groundwater level in arid rangeland in western Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing and predating changes of the natural ecosystems are required for the management and sustainable usage of land and water resources in arid and semiarid regions in which, the exploitation of land is rapidly changing. This research is mainly aimed to detect and simulate the changes of land use/cover changes in relation to groundwater levels. For this purpose, Markov chain model and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to predict land-use and groundwater level changes, respectively. Moreover, TM and EMT+Landsat satellite images of 1988, 2001, and 2014 were utilized as one of the data sources of this study. Supervised classification methods were used for change detection analysis. Subsequently, Markov chain model was applied to predict the land-use changes in 2027 after finding an acceptable accuracy of about 82%. The results of change detection show that agricultural lands and artificial forests have increased during 1988-2014, while rangeland and residential and barren lands have decreased in area. It is predicted that the region will experience an increasing trend in terms of artificial forest and agricultural lands, while rangeland, residential and barren lands will continue to follow a decreasing trend in 2027. Furthermore, the groundwater levels have dropped down about 6.1m during the period of 2000-2014. The results of prediction analysis by ANNs show that the groundwater level will continue decreasing about 16.8m during 2014-2027. These changes could be related to conversion of rangelands to agricultural lands and artificial forests, which needs more water for irrigation.

TI  - Tracking the spatio-temporal change of cropping intensity in China during 2000-2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvement in the efficiency of farmland utilization and multiple cropping systems are of prime importance for achieving food security in China. Therefore, spatially-explicit analysis detecting trends of cropping intensity are important preconditions for sustainable agricultural development. However, knowledge about the spatiotemporal dynamics of cropping intensity in China remains limited. In this study, we generated annual cropping intensity maps in China during 2000-2015 using a rule-based algorithm and MODO9A1 time series imagery. We then analyzed the spatio-temporal changes of cropping intensity. The results showed single-cropping and double-cropping areas were about 1.28 +/- 0.027 X 10(6)km(2) and 0.52 +/- 0.027 X 10(6)km(2) in China in 2015 and their areas were relatively stable from 2000-2015. However, cropping intensity had substantial spatial changes during 2000-2015. About 0.164 +/- 0.026 x 10(6)km(2) of single-cropping area was converted to doublecropping area, which mainly occurred in the Huang-Huai-Hai Region. About 0.193 +/- 0.028 x 10(6)km(2) of double-cropping area was converted to single-cropping area, which mainly occurred in the southern part of China. About 85% of croplands with decreases in cropping intensity were located in the southern part of China, and about 80% of croplands with increases in cropping intensity was distributed in the Huang-Huai-Hai Region and the northern part of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River region (p < 0.05). The landscapes of different cropping systems tended to be homogenized in major agricultural production regions.

TI  - An improved algorithm for retrieving the fine-mode fraction of aerosol optical thickness. Part 2: Application and validation in Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since small aerosol particles are mostly anthropogenic, the fine-mode aerosol optical thickness (fAOT) can be used to infer PM2.5 amounts. However, satellite-based fAOT products such as those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are highly uncertain over land. An improved fAOT retrieval method called the look-up table spectral deconvolution algorithm (LUT-SDA) was tested and improved using data from Asia. The improvement is achieved by accounting for seasonal changes instead of using constant annual mean values of the aerosol parameters used in the LUT-SDA derived from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data from 2010 to 2014. Compared with the previous version of the LUT-SDA developed for Beijing, Hong Kong, and Osaka, the updated LUT-SDA generates more accurate fine-mode fractions (FMFs) with the total mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreasing from 0.24 to 0.18. The updated LUT-SDA was then applied to retrieve fAOT and was validated by retrievals from 45 AERONET sites over the period 2015 to 2016. A good accuracy was achieved by this method with 31% of the validation sites having > 50% of retrievals falling within the estimated error (EE) envelope +/- (0.05 + 0.15 x AERONET fAOT) and 42% of the validation sites having 40-50% of retrievals falling within the RE envelope. In the total validation and comparison with the MODIS Collection 6 fAOT, the fAOT retrievals from the LUT-SDA agreed more closely with AERONET retrievals, showing a low bias. About 48% of the LUT-SDA-based fAOT retrievals fell within the EE envelope (RMSE = 0.29), while similar to 22% of the MODIS-based fAOT retrievals fell within the EE envelope (RMSE = 0.42). The fAOT was significantly underestimated by the MODIS algorithm in most areas of Asia with many values of zero. This study demonstrates that the refined LUT-SDA method is valid for the large-scale estimation of fAOT from satellite images.

AB  - Introduction: Several studies warn that overweight and obesity have become an epidemic with severe consequences in the population's health. The objetive of the present study is to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Castile and Leon in a sample of children at 6, 11 and 14 years of age, to describe its evolution and its association with Life habits and antecedents.Material and methods: Observational study, retrospective cohort, performed by the pediatricians of the Health Sentinel Network. The study is part of a joint Project with the National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH) in Burgos to know the pattern of growth and development of the child population of Castile and Leon. In 2012, a health examination and a retrospective collection were carried out based on the clinical history of a simple of 326 children, from the cohort was born in 1998.Results: Following the WHO references, at age 14 there was 25.3% of boys and 18.5% of girls with overweight. Obesity was estimated to affect the 8.2% and 4.8% of them respectively. At 11 years of age there was the maximum of overweight in girls and of obesity in boys. At the urban-non urban environment, quantity and quality of sleep and the parents' BMI have been some of the associated factors to weight level of the children.Discussion: In Castile and Leon, as in other populations of our environment, there is a severe problema of overweight and obesity. For their control it is necesary to deepen understanding of lifestyles and antecedents related to the birth as well as to calculate the growth rate in the pediatric age. (C) 2018 SEEN y SED.

TI  - Satellite-augmented diffuse solar radiation separation models
T2  - JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Separation models predict diffuse horizontal irradiance from other meteorological parameters such as the global horizontal irradiance or zenith angle. From a mathematical point of view, the separation modeling problem is a regression, where the regressors are observed or computed variables and the regressand is the unobserved diffuse fraction. The most successful minute-resolution separation model prior to 2016 was proposed by Engerer, which is constructed using a trend component (cloud enhancement) and a main effect (logistic function). Subsequently, the Starke model published in 2018 further improved the Engerer model. It is herein shown that the logistic-function type of model, and many other separation models, can be transformed into a (condition-based) multiple linear regression problem. Under this transformation framework, two new models are proposed, which strictly dominate the performance of the Engerer model and the Starke model, at all 7 test sites across the continental United States, making them probably the most accurate separation models to date. The new models are also tested at 5 European sites with unseen data (i.e., not involved during model parameter fitting); their performance again dominates all benchmarking models. The new separation models leverage half-hourly satellite-derived diffuse fraction. Since satellite data are available globally, the satellite-augmented separation models have universal applicability. However, despite their good performance, empirical separation models suffer from a series of issues. Hence, models driven by atmospheric physics are the "true gems" that one should pursue.

TI  - An Integrated Method for Reconstructing Daily MODIS Land Surface Temperature Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter in land surface process. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can be used to generate various LST data products, and these data have been widely applied in many studies. Unfortunately, cloud contamination brings about numerous missing or abnormal values, which negatively affect the application of LST data. To reconstruct missing values and improve data quality, this paper proposes an integrated method for reconstructing LST data under two conditions: Clear sky and cloudy sky. For the clear-sky condition, the MODIS eight-day LST (MOD11A2) product is used to be interpolated into the low-quality daily LST dataset using the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm. And then the linear regression algorithm is implemented on the original good-quality pixels of the MODIS daily LST (MOD11A1) product. After that, seamless processing on the reconstructed low-quality daily LST dataset is carried using the Poisson image editing method, and finally the high-quality daily LST dataset under clear-sky condition are then obtained. For the cloudy-sky conditions, the revised neighboring-pixel (NP) algorithm that originates from the surface energy balance theory is used to reconstruct the real LST data. To evaluate the reconstruction performance under clear-sky condition, a simulated dataset is generated from simulated missing pixels with good quality that are randomly chosen from 98 available LST images in the year 2010. Meanwhile, the real LST measurements collected from ground sites are used to assess the reconstructed results under cloudy-sky condition. Satisfactory validation results show that the proposed integrated method effectively reconstructs the missing information and low-quality pixels caused by cloud cover and other factors. The filled data can seamlessly preserve the temporal and spatial consistence of the daily LST data, which do promote the practical utility of the MODIS LST product.

AB  - The assay was used in HIV/AIDS surveillance sentinel sites to identify recent HIV-1 infection, to estimate HIV-1 incidence and understand the epidemic trends among men who have sex with men during 2011-2015. During 2011-2015, the HIV-1 incidence of men who have sex with men was 5.16% (95%CI: 4.65%-5.66%) in Sichuan Province. According to<Pilot study on classification criteria of AIDS epidemic in China>, a total of 9 cities had been divided into two type of regions: the first type (the proportion of live HIV/AIDS accounts for more than 0.1% of the permanent population, and the number of live HIV/AIDS has reached 500 cases and above) and the second type (the proportion of live HIV/AIDS accounts for 0.03% to 0.100% of the permanent population, and the number of live HIV/AIDS has reached 100-500 cases). During 2011-2015, the HIV-1 incidence of the second type was 4.24% (95%CI: 3.72%-4.76%). The HIV-1 incidence of men who have sex with men was at a high level. The spread of HIV-1 to the second region was possible.

TI  - Optimal Segmentation Scale Parameter, Feature Subset and Classification Algorithm for Geographic Object-Based Crop Recognition Using Multisource Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) has been widely used in the remote sensing of agricultural crops. However, issues related to image segmentation, data redundancy and performance of different classification algorithms with GEOBIA have not been properly addressed in previous studies, thereby compromising the accuracy of subsequent thematic products. It is in this regard that the current study investigates the optimal scale parameter (SP) in multi-resolution segmentation, feature subset, and classification algorithm for use in GEOBIA based on multisource satellite imagery. For this purpose, a novel supervised optimal SP selection method was proposed based on information gain ratio, and was then compared with a preexisting unsupervised optimal SP selection method. Additionally, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) and enhanced RFE (EnRFE) algorithms were modified to generate an improved EnRFE (iEnRFE) algorithm, which was then compared with its precursors in the selection of optimal classification features. Based on the above, random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to segmented objects for crop classification. The results indicated that the supervised optimal SP selection method is more suitable for application in heterogeneous land cover, whereas the unsupervised method proved more efficient as it does not require reference segmentation objects. The proposed iEnRFE method outperformed the preexisting EnRFE and RFE methods in optimal feature subset selection as it recorded the highest accuracy and less processing time. The RF, GBDT, and SVM algorithms achieved overall classification accuracies of 91.8%, 92.4%, and 90.5%, respectively. GBDT and RF recorded higher classification accuracies and utilized much less computational time than SVM and are, therefore, considered more suitable for crop classification requiring large numbers of image features. These results have shown that the proposed object-based crop classification scheme could provide a valuable reference for relevant applications of GEOBIA in crop recognition using multisource satellite imagery.

TI  - Assessment of two-stream approximations in a climate model
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracies of the two-stream discrete-ordinate-method (DOM) and Eddington approximation schemes are systematically compared using the BCC_RAD radiative transfer scheme used in a general circulation model (GCM). It is found that the two-stream DOM produces more accurate results for the upward radiative flux, downward radiative flux and heating rate under clear-sky conditions in an offline radiation model, whereas the Eddington approximation is more accurate under all-sky conditions. An experiment using satellite data as the approximation of cloud properties confirms the superiority of the Eddington approximation under cloudy-sky conditions. Experiments using the GCM of the Beijing Climate Center (BCC_AGCM2.0.1) show that, compared to the two-stream DOM, the Eddington approximation can enhance the fraction of low cloud, and this increased cloud fraction can affect the differences in radiative fluxes between these schemes. This study suggests that the more suitable approach in GCMs is to use the Eddington approximation. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Changes in Snow Phenology from 1979 to 2016 over the Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt from the Tianshan Mountains (TS) is a major contributor to the water resources of the Central Asian region. Thus, changes in snow phenology over the TS have significant implications for regional water supplies and ecosystem services. However, the characteristics of changes in snow phenology and their influences on the climate are poorly understood throughout the entire TS due to the lack of in situ observations, limitations of optical remote sensing due to clouds, and decentralized political landscapes. Using passive microwave remote sensing snow data from 1979 to 2016 across the TS, this study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of snow phenology and their attributes and implications. The results show that the mean snow onset day (D-o), snow end day (D-e), snow cover duration days (D-d), and maximum snow depth (SDmax) from 1979 to 2016 were the 78.2nd day of hydrological year (DOY), 222.4th DOY, 146.2 days, and 16.1 cm over the TS, respectively. D-d exhibited a spatial distribution of days with a temperature of <0 degrees C derived from meteorological station observations. Anomalies of snow phenology displayed the regional diversities over the TS, with shortened D-d in high-altitude regions and the Fergana Valley but increased D-d in the Ili Valley and upper reaches of the Chu and Aksu Rivers. Increased SDmax was exhibited in the central part of the TS, and decreased SDmax was observed in the western and eastern parts of the TS. Changes in D-d were dominated by earlier D-e, which was caused by increased melt-season temperatures (T-m). Earlier D-e with increased accumulation of seasonal precipitation (P-a) influenced the hydrological processes in the snowmelt recharge basin, increasing runoff and earlier peak runoff in the spring, which intensified the regional water crisis.

TI  - Population Mapping with Multisensor Remote Sensing Images and Point-Of-Interest Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-resolution population distribution mapping is necessary for many purposes, which cannot be met by aggregated census data due to privacy. Many approaches utilize ancillary data that are related to population density, such as nighttime light imagery and land use, to redistribute the population from census to finer-scale units. However, most of the ancillary data used in the previous studies of population modeling are environmental data, which can only provide a limited capacity to aid population redistribution. Social sensing data with geographic information, such as point-of-interest (POI), are emerging as a new type of ancillary data for urban studies. This study, as a nascent attempt, combined POI and multisensor remote sensing data into new ancillary data to aid population redistribution from census to grid cells at a resolution of 250 m in Zhejiang, China. The accuracy of the results was assessed by comparing them with WorldPop. Results showed that our approach redistributed the population with fewer errors than WorldPop, especially at the extremes of population density. The approach developed in this studyincorporating POI with multisensor remotely sensed data in redistributing the population onto finer-scale spatial unitspossessed considerable potential in the era of big data, where a substantial volume of social sensing data is increasingly being collected and becoming available.

TI  - Source model and Coulomb stress change of the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake determined from improved inversion of geodetic surface deformation observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake produced a approximate to 140km rupture on the Main Himalaya Thrust (MHT) fault at the convergence zone of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The coseismic surface deformation, fault slip model and induced stress change are comprehensively investigated with the geodetic observations in this study. The surface deformation is mapped by the combination of the GPS observations with the descending and ascending track ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 SAR images. An improved forward modeling of the surface displacement considering the effect of topographic variation on the geodetic data inversion is developed, and applied to determine the fault geometry and slip distribution associated with the event. The derived faulting model shows that the thrusting motion occurs on a fault plane with a low dip of approximate to 6.2 degrees, and the significant slip concentrates at depths of 5-13km. More than 90% of the seismic moment is released on the middle fault segment with a maximum slip of approximate to 6.7m. Two significant slip deficit zones located on the northwest and southeast of the fault are recognized from the source model. The shallow portion of the Main Frontal Thrust fault with little slip during the event is considered as the lower edge of the locked zone, which plays an important role in accommodating the convergence between the Eurasia and India plates. The change in Coulomb failure stress shows a significant increase for the slip deficits and the locked zone on the Himalayan front, which indicates that the accumulated strain on the MHT fault has been partially alleviated by the major quake and the aftershock sequence, but will continue to balance the slip deficit and high stress regimes, and drive the seismicity in the Himalayan front.

TI  - Isolation of Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease Virus Serotype 7 Strain in China for the First Time.
T2  - Acta Veterinaria et Zootechnica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an infectious, non contagious insect transmitted disease of ruminants. To investigate the infection of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) among ruminants in Yunnan Province of China and study the virus genetic characteristics, monitoring points were set up in Shizong. Virus isolation was carried out through the inoculating BHK-21 cells with EHDV nucleic acid positive blood samples collected from the sentinel herds. Serotype of the isolated virus was identified by serum neutralization test; ORF of Seg-2 and Seg-3 of the virus were amplified with specific primers, then cloned and sequenced; antibody levels and viral nucleic acid in the EHDV infected animals throughout the year were tested by C-ELISA and qRT-PCR. Results were as follows : In August 2013, an EHDV strain (YNSZ/V269/2013) was isolated from Sentinel Cattle in Shizong, Yunnan. The serum neutralization test showed that the YNSZ/V269/2013 was an EHDV-7 virus. Sequence analysis of Seg-2 and Seg-3 showed that the isolated virus belonged to EHDV-7 Eastern type and had the closest genetic relationship with the Serotype 7 strain in Japan or Australia. The animal serum antibody increased rapidly after being infected by EHDV-7 and the antibody reached the highest point after 3 weeks and lasted for a longer time; meanwhile the nucleic acid content of the virus declined rapidly, 7 weeks later could not be detected in blood samples. This study reported the first isolation of EHDV serotype 7 in China and the virus sequence characterization of Seg-2 and Seg-3. The research results provide the basis for further development of the whole genome sequencing of Chinese EHDV-7 virus, epidemiological investigation, establishment of diagnostic methods and pathogenicity research.

TI  - Surface deformation monitoring of Shanghai based on ENVISAT ASAR and Sentinel-1A data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - During urbanization, different dimensions of the expansion of construction land causes different degrees of surface deformation. Based on the C-band ENVISAT ASAR data (December 2004 to September 2010) and Sentinel-1A data (March 2015 to April 2017), the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS InSAR)method was used to monitor the spatial and temporal variations of surface deformation in Shanghai, China. The results showed that widespread uneven subsidence occurred in Shanghai from December 2004 to April 2017. A transition from urban areas toward the suburbs appeared in the spatial distribution, in which the cumulative deformation in the urban areas has the characteristics of seasonal fluctuation, which shows the alternation of subsidence and rebound. In addition, the deformation characteristics of different types of construction land with the same geological conditions were compared, which showed that residential land had the least cumulative subsidence and clear seasonal fluctuations, industrial land had the greatest cumulative subsidence, and transportation land had greater subsidence during the construction period but tended to become stable after being put into use. This suggests that the deformation characteristics of Shanghai are changing, and the type of construction land is also an important factor in the deformation process.

TI  - Urbanization effects on vegetation cover in major African cities during 2001-2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization effects on vegetation cover (VC) have been analyzed in many regions. However, little attention has been paid to Africa, which has undergone rapid urbanization in recent decades. In this study, MODIS land cover and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data were used to examine urbanization efects on VC in 59 large cities in Africa during 2001-2017. The AEVI (urban EVI minus rural Delta EVI) was used to represent urbanization effects on VC. Major findings include: (1) for 59 cities averaged, annual Delta EVI averaged from 2015 to 2017 was -0.116. Negative annual Delta EVI (i.e. urban EVI lower than rural) were observed in 56 of 59 cities. (2) For 59 cities averaged, urban area increased 17.9% from 2001 (262.8 km(2)) to 2016 (309.8 km(2)). (3) Annual Delta EVI decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in 44 of 59 cities for the period 2001-2017, and annual average area of urbanization effects on VC increased significantly in 40 of 59 cities. For 59 cities averaged, the percentage of urban area with significant decreasing trends of annual Delta EVI was 60.0%. Spatially, cities near the Gulf of Guinea showed more significant decreasing Delta EVI than cities in other regions. In addition, the trends and spatial distributions of urbanization effects on VC differed little by seasons. These results suggested that urbanization and its effects on VC in Africa should arouse more attentions.

TI  - Monitoring of long-term land subsidence from 2003 to 2017 in coastal area of Semarang, Indonesia by SBAS DInSAR analyses using Envisat-ASAR, ALOS-PALSAR, and Sentinel-1A SAR data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a critical issue that large cities located in coastal areas, such as Semarang, Indonesia, must address. The monitoring of land subsidence is vital for predicting and mitigating the disasters that such subsidence may cause. Therefore, an economical and effective monitoring method, which can continuously provide accurate measurements over extensive areas, is highly required. Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) has the potential to be a powerful technique that can meet the above demands. Actually, DInSAR has been applied to monitor the subsidence in Semarang, but it was for a limited period before 2012.In order to clarify the transition of the long-term subsidence behavior in Semarang, the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method, which is one type of time-series DInSAR, is employed in this research. The sets of data of Envisat-ASAR (2003-2007), ALOS-PALSAR (2007-2011), and Sentinel-1A (2015-2017) are employed for the analyses. Then, the validity of the SBAS results is discussed from the viewpoints of both spatial distribution and temporal transition using GPS displacement measurement results and the geological conditions of the ground.On the other hand, as the lifespan of SAR satellites is commonly designed to be around 5-7 years, an appropriate method, which can connect the subsidence provided independently by the unlinked time-series data sets of the three different SAR satellite data, is required. This study uses the Hyperbolic Method (HM) to connect the above unlinked SBAS results. The HM is often used to fit the monitored subsidence in practice as a geotechnical engineering tool. Using this method, 14 years of the temporal behavior of the subsidence in Semarang is evaluated.It is found that the transition of the subsidence is different depending on the location, and that the subsidence rate is still increasing in the north and northeast parts of the coastal area. This study shows that SBAS DInSAR can be a useful tool for long-term continuous subsidence monitoring. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is compromising the treatment of gonorrhea globally. Recent AMR data are extremely limited in Africa, and mainly totally lacking in Western Africa, including Cote d'Ivoire. This study (i) established a quality-assured gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance program, according to World Health Organization quality criteria, (ii) investigated the AMR to 8 therapeutic antimicrobials in gonococcal isolates from 2014 to 2017, and (iii) provided evidence for updating the National Sexually Transmitted Disease Syndromic Management Guidelines in Cote d'Ivoire.Methods During 2014 to 2017, gonococcal isolates were obtained from sexually active symptomatic or asymptomatic males and females in 14 sites in Cote d'Ivoire. It was a special focus on symptomatic males, and their sexual partners, due to the higher culture positivity rates in symptomatic males. Patient metadata were collected, including age, gender, sexual orientation, and symptoms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 8 antimicrobials were determined by Etest and interpreted using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints. -lactamase production was detected using cefinase disks.Results The level of resistance, examining 212 gonococcal isolates, was as follows: 84.9% to tetracycline, 68.9% to benzylpenicillin, 62.7% to ciprofloxacin, 6.1% to azithromycin, and 1.4% to gentamicin. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefixime and spectinomycin.Conclusions We provide the first gonococcal AMR data, quality assured according to World Health Organization standards, from Cote d'Ivoire since more than 20 years. The high ciprofloxacin resistance, which informed a revision of the national syndromic management guideline during study, and relatively high resistance to azithromycin demand an improved gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance program and increased awareness when prescribing treatment in Cote d'Ivoire.

TI  - Multiple Remotely Sensed Lines of Evidence for a Depleting Seasonal Snowpack in the Near East
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow-fed river basins of the Near East region are facing an urgent threat in the form of declining water resources. In this study, we analyzed several remote sensing products (optical, passive microwave, and gravimetric) and outputs of a meteorological reanalysis data set to understand the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies and the mountain snowpack. The results from different satellite retrievals show a clear signal of a depletion of both water storage and the seasonal snowpack in four basins in the region. We find a strong reduction in terrestrial water storage over the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observational period, particularly over the higher elevations. Snow-cover duration estimates from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products point towards negative and significant trends up to one month per decade in the current era. These numbers are a clear indicator of the partial disappearance of the seasonal snow-cover in the region which has been projected to occur by the end of the century. The spatial patterns of changes in the snow-cover duration are positively correlated with both GRACE terrestrial water storage decline and peak snow water equivalent (SWE) depletion from the ERA5 reanalysis. Possible drivers of the snowpack depletion are a significant reduction in the snowfall ratio and an earlier snowmelt. A continued depletion of the montane snowpack in the Near East paints a bleak picture for future water availability in this water-stressed region.

TI  - Study of the Seasonal Effect of Building Shadows on Urban Land Surface Temperatures Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building shadows (BSs) frequently occur in urban areas, and their area and distribution display strong seasonal variations that significantly influence the urban land surface temperature (LST). However, it remains unclear how BSs affect the LST at the city scale because it is difficult to extract the shaded area at the subpixel scale and to connect such areas with the LST at the pixel scale. In this study, we combined the sun angle, building height, building footprint and building occlusion to extract the seasonal spatial distribution of BSs in the central area of Beijing. The effect of BSs on the LST was analyzed using LST retrieved from Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor data. First, the relationship between the LST patch fragmentation and proportion of BSs in the sample areas was modeled without vegetation. Then, we quantitatively studied the mitigated intensity of the LST in pure impervious surfaces (IS) and vegetation pixels covered by BSs; next, we analyzed the LST sensitivity of these pixels to BSs. The results showed that the existence of BSs influences the fragmentation of the low LST patches strongly from summer to winter. On the other hand, pure IS pixels totally covered by BSs experienced a greater cooling effect, with 3.16 K on 10 July, and the lowest cooling occurred between 14 and 25 December, with a mean of 1.24 K. Without considering the relationship in winter, the LST is nonlinearly correlated to the building shadows ratio (BSR) in pixels, and an approximate 10% increase in the BSR resulted in decreases in the LST of approximately 0.33 K (mean of 16 April and 10 May), 0.37 K (10 July) and 0.24 K (28 September) for pure IS pixels, and 0.18 K, 0.20 K and 0.15 K, respectively, for pure vegetation pixels. Further analysis indicates that the LST of pure IS pixels is more sensitive to BSs than that of vegetation because the self-regulation mechanism of vegetation reduces the cooling effect of BSs. These findings can help urban planners understand the cooling characteristics of BSs and design suitable urban forms to resist urban heat islands (UHIs).

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Short-Term Cloud Feedback on Global and Local Interannual Climate Fluctuations from A-Train Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations from multiple sensors on the NASA Aqua satellite are used to estimate the temporal and spatial variability of short-term cloud responses (CR) and cloud feedbacks lambda for different cloud types, with respect to the interannual variability within the A-Train era (July 2002-June 2017). Short-term cloud feedbacks by cloud type are investigated both globally and locally by three different definitions in the literature: 1) the global-mean cloud feedback parameter lambda(GG) from regressing the global-mean cloud-induced TOA radiation anomaly Delta R-G with the global-mean surface temperature change Delta T-GS; 2) the local feedback parameter lambda(LL) from regressing the local Delta R with the local surface temperature change Delta T-S; and 3) the local feedback parameter lambda(GL) from regressing global Delta R-G with local Delta T-S. Observations show significant temporal variability in the magnitudes and spatial patterns in lambda(GG) and lambda(GL), whereas lambda(LL) remains essentially time invariant for different cloud types. The global-mean net lambda(GG) exhibits a gradual transition from negative to positive in the A-Train era due to a less negative lambda(GG) from low clouds and an increased positive lambda(GG) from high clouds over the warm pool region associated with the 2015/16 strong El Nino event. Strong temporal variability in lambda(GL) is intrinsically linked to its dependence on global Delta R-G, and the scaling of lambda(GL) with surface temperature change patterns to obtain global feedback lambda(GG) does not hold. Despite the shortness of the A-Train record, statistically robust signals can be obtained for different cloud types and regions of interest.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of a Random Forest Kernel for Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of land cover maps through satellite image classification is a frequent task in remote sensing. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are the two most well-known and recurrently used methods for this task. In this paper, we evaluate the pros and cons of using an RF-based kernel (RFK) in an SVM compared to using the conventional Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and standard RF classifier. A time series of seven multispectral WorldView-2 images acquired over Sukumba (Mali) and a single hyperspectral AVIRIS image acquired over Salinas Valley (CA, USA) are used to illustrate the analyses. For each study area, SVM-RFK, RF, and SVM-RBF were trained and tested under different conditions over ten subsets. The spectral features for Sukumba were extended by obtaining vegetation indices (VIs) and grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), the Salinas dataset is used as benchmarking with its original number of features. In Sukumba, the overall accuracies (OAs) based on the spectral features only are of . These results show that SVM-RFK yields slightly higher OAs than RF in high dimensional and noisy experiments, and it provides competitive results in the rest of the experiments. They also show that SVM-RFK generates highly competitive results when compared to SVM-RBF while substantially reducing the time and computational cost associated with parametrizing the kernel. Moreover, SVM-RFK outperforms SVM-RBF in high dimensional and noisy problems. RF was also used to select the most important features for the extended dataset of Sukumba; the SVM-RFK derived from these features improved the OA of the previous SVM-RFK by 2%. Thus, the proposed SVM-RFK classifier is as at least as good as RF and SVM-RBF and can achieve considerable improvements when applied to high dimensional data and when combined with RF-based feature selection methods.

TI  - Seroconversion of 1-year-old Mice to Murine Norovirus
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rodent sentinel screening for adventitious pathogens is an integral part of many biomedical research institutes and universities that use rodents in research. Typical screening programs involving live sentinel animals typically purchase young SPF sentinel animals that are sampled and replaced quarterly. Previous reports suggest that mice as old as 6 mo are effective sentinels for various agents. In efforts to reduce the number of animals used in our sentinel program, we wanted to investigate the possibility of keeping sentinel animals inhouse for 12 mo at a time. We exposed mice (age, 40 to 48 wk) to murine norovirus (MNV) to test whether they could reliably produce detectable levels of antibodies (similar to younger mice) to this adventitious pathogen. Mice first exposed to MNV at 40 to 48 wk of age seroconverted to MNV after both direct inoculation (through gavage) and indirect exposure (from soiled-bedding transfer) at the same or greater frequency than mice first exposed at 8 to 12 wk of age. These findings indicate that, at least for MNV, sentinel residence time can be extended from 3 to 12 mo without compromising the reliability of seroconversion, thus ultimately reducing sentinel animal numbers. This practice, combined with nonanimal testing modalities (for example, exhaust duct sampling), can increase the sensitivity and specificity of rodent surveillance programs and minimize the use of live animals.

TI  - Fundamental Social Motives Mediate the Associations that Dangerous and Competitive Social Worldviews Have with Ideological Attitudes
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the connections that dangerous and competitive social worldviews had with the ideological attitudes of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). More specifically, the focus was on the possibility that the associations that these social worldviews had with ideological attitudes may be mediated by the fundamental social motives in a sample of undergraduates (N =485; 79% female). The results revealed partial support for the hypotheses such that the association that the competitive social worldview had with RWA was mediated by the status seeking motive, the affiliation motive, and the kin care motive, whereas the association that the competitive social worldview had with SDO was mediated only by the status seeking motive. In contrast, the fundamental social motives did not mediate the association that the dangerous social worldview had with RWA. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the role that motivation may play in the connections between social worldviews and ideological attitudes.

TI  - Intensity Estimation of Tropical Cyclones Using the Relevance Vector Machine From Infrared Satellite Image Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, tropical cyclone (TC) infrared geostationary satellite images obtained by FY-2 satellite scanning are used as reference points in the overall infrared geostationary satellite image, the deviation angle gradient co-occurrence matrix is constructed, and the statistical parameters of the co-occurrence matrix are extracted. Combined with the best track data of tropical cyclones provided by the China Meteorological Administration, the TC center is used as the origin point, and the satellite image is divided into nine 50 km scales, from the origin to a range of 450 km. Relevance vector machines are then used to construct the TC intensity estimation model for each scale. The experimental results show that the optimal radial scale is approximately 250 km. Based on these results, the proposed TC intensity estimation technique can be used for TC intensity prediction. This technique has the potential to improve the accuracy of TC intensity prediction and to provide technical support for disaster reduction.

TI  - Developing a Subswath-Based Wind Speed Retrieval Model for Sentinel-1 VH-Polarized SAR Data Over the Ocean Surface
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the capability of Sentinel-1 VH-polarized synthetic aperture radar signals, involving 738 scenes in the interferometric wide swath (IW) mode, for ocean surface wind speed retrieval using a novel subswath-based C-band cross-polarized ocean model. When compared with in situ measurements, it is observed that wind speed retrieval accuracy varies progressively along swath, with the most accurate wind speed retrievals being derived from subswath 3 [root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.82 m.s(-1)], followed by subswath 2 (RMSE of 1.92 m.s(-1)), while subswath 1 showed the lowest retrieval accuracy (RMSE of 2.37 m.s(-1)). The average RMSE of wind speeds retrieved from all the three subswaths is 2.08 m.s(-1) under low-to-high wind speed regimes (wind speeds < 25 m.s(-1)). We further observed that the dependence of VH-polarized normalized radar cross section (NRCS) on incidence angle is attributable to the high and changing noise equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) with incidence angle under low-to-moderate wind speed regimes. And that strong VH-polarized radar signals could overcome the NESZ effect, thereby eliminating the dependence of VH-polarized NRCS on incidence angle under strong wind conditions. For Sentinel-1 IW mode VH-polarized data, the effect of NESZ could be ignored when wind speeds are greater than 15 m.s(-1), as a better wind speed retrieval performance of these data has been recorded in this paper at wind speeds greater than 10 m.s(-1), owing to an RMSE below 1.6 m.s(-1) and biases ranging from -0.5 to 0.5 m.s(-1).

TI  - Thermal Stability Optimization of the Luojia 1-01 Nighttime Light Remote-Sensing Camera's Principal Distance
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The instability of the principal distance of the nighttime light remote-sensing camera of the Luojia 1-01 satellite directly affects the geometric accuracy of images, consequently affecting the results of analysis of nighttime light remote-sensing data. Based on the theory of optical passive athermal design, a mathematical model of optical-passive athermal design for principal distance stabilization is established. Positive and negative lenses of different materials and the mechanical structures of different materials are matched to optimize the optical system. According to the index requirements of the Luojia 1-01 camera, an image-telecentric optical system was designed under the guidance of the established mathematical model. In the temperature range of -20 degrees C to +60 degrees C, the principal distance of the system changes from -0.01 m to +0.28 m. After on-orbit testing, the geometric accuracy of the designed nighttime light remote-sensing camera is better than 0.20 pixels and less than index requirement of 0.3 pixels, which indicating that the principal distance maintains good stability on-orbit and meets the application requirements of nighttime light remote sensing.

TI  - Parameter Analysis and Estimates for the MODIS Evapotranspiration Algorithm and Multiscale Verification
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of terrestrial evapotranspiration (E) is critical to understand the world's energy and water cycles. MOD16 is the core algorithm of the widely used global E data set (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS] E product). However, it exhibits considerable uncertainties in some regions. Based on the data from 175 flux towers, we identified the key parameters of the MOD16 algorithm using the Sobol' sensitivity analysis method across biomes. The output of the MOD16 algorithm was sensitive to eight parameters. Among them, beta, which is treated as a constant (0.2 kPa) across biomes in the original MOD16 algorithm, was identified as the parameter to which the algorithm was most sensitive. We used the differential-evolution Markov chain method to obtain the proper posterior distributions for each key parameter across a range of biomes. The values of the key parameters for the different biomes were accurately estimated by differential-evolution Markov chain in comparison with data from the flux towers. We then evaluated the performances of the original MOD16 and the optimized MOD16 and compared them at multiple spatial scales (i.e., site, catchment, and global). We obtained relatively consistent and more reliable E simulations using the optimized MOD16 at all three scales. In the future, more attention should be paid to uncertainties in the algorithm's structure and its parameterizations of soil moisture constraint, canopy resistance, and energy partitioning.

TI  - Improvement of MODIS cloud mask over severe polluted eastern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have proved that in the regions with severe air pollution, MODIS cloud mask product (MYD35) tends to overestimate the cloud cover largely. An important reason is that the dense aerosols could be misclassified as clouds. Identification of the misdetected "clouds" of passive remote sensing satellites remains challenging. In this study, we built an algorithm combining screening method and adjusted Fisher Discriminant Analysis (AFDA) to rectify the cloud free pixels misclassified as cloudy in the MYD35 product over the eastern China (EC), where heavy haze pollution occurs frequently in fall and winter. The CALIPSO vertical feature mask (VFM) product was used as an accurate reference. The results showed that our algorithm performs well in the discrimination of the true clouds and misdetected clouds, including the ones caused by the misjudgment of near surface aerosols in heavy haze. The average accuracy reached 96.72%. In EC, fogs ought to be classified as clouds often mixed with haze, resulting difficulty to distinguish fogs and haze. Compared with surface observed fogs, our algorithm also has a good effect on identification of the surface fog in EC with an accuracy of 81.53%. Mean values of a series of cloud properties showed great changes after filtering the misclassified MYD35 cloudy pixels. Thereinto, cloud cover decreased by 0.13, other parameters, including cloud top height, cloud optical thickness, cloud effective radius and cloud water path, also changed significantly.

TI  - Spatial-temporal impacts of urban land use land cover on land surface temperature: Case studies of two Canadian urban areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface fabric of urbanized areas, (i.e. its constituent land covers and land uses) plays an essential role in the generation of the urban/rural temperature differences, i.e. the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Land surface information, derived from satellite imagery, and complementary information such as demographics can be used as the basis for an understanding of the atmospheric and surface thermal variations within cities. The results of comprehensive land surface characterizations of two major Canadian urban areas, the Greater Toronto Area and Ottawa-Gatineau, are described. Spatial information, including land cover fraction maps, land use and its historic changes, population density maps are compared with infra-urban surface temperature variations derived from satellite thermal imagery. Three aspects of the impacts of land cover and land use on urban land thermal characteristics are addressed, namely, (a) the relationships between surface temperature and subpixel land cover and population density (b) infra-city seasonal temperature variations and (c) the intensification of the urban heat island effect due to urban built-up land growth.

TI  - Coupled estimation of 500 m and 8-day resolution global evapotranspiration and gross primary production in 2002-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understand the Earth's energy and water budgets under climate change. However, despite water and carbon cycle coupling, there are few diagnostic global evapotranspiration models that have complete carbon constraint on water flux run at a high spatial resolution. Here we estimate 8-day global ET and gross primary production (GPP) at 500 m resolution from July 2002 to December 2017 using a coupled diagnostic biophysical model (called PML-V2) that, built using Google Earth Engine, takes MODIS data (leaf area index, albedo, and emissivity) together with GLDAS meteorological forcing data as model inputs. PML-V2 is well calibrated against 8-day measurements at 95 widely-distributed flux towers for 10 plant functional types, indicated by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Bias being 0.69 min d(-1) and -1.8% for ET respectively, and being 1.99 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 4.2% for GPP. Compared to that performance, the cross-validation results are slightly degraded, with RMSE and Bias being 0.73 mm d(-1) and -3% for ET, and 2.13 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 3.3% for GPP, which indicates robust model performance. The PML-V2 products are noticeably better than most GPP and ET products that have a similar spatial resolution, and suitable for assessing the influence of carbon-induced impacts on ET. Our estimates show that global ET and GPP both significantly (p < 0.05) increased over the past 15 years. Our results demonstrate it is very promising to use the coupled PML-V2 model to improve estimates of GPP, ET and water use efficiency, and its uncertainty can be further reduced by improving model inputs, model structure and parameterisation schemes.

TI  - Urban agglomeration of Kunming and Yuxi cities in Yunnan, China: the relative importance of government policy drivers and environmental constraints
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Political decisions and policies, as well as bio-physical factors are very important drivers of urban agglomeration, yet studies researching links between those factors, decision-making and landscape change associated with these processes are lacking.Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the urban agglomeration pattern and process of Kunming-Yuxi driven by recent political and economic decisions, as well as topographic factors.Methods We used multi-temporal Landsat imagery to create land cover maps and detect land cover changes from 2000 to 2015. The spatial trend surface analysis and lacunarity index were used to quantify the homogenization process of urbanization between Kunming and Yuxi.Results Land cover maps showed that built-up area increased remarkably reaching about 13% of the total area in 2015, and agricultural land declined from 12.2% in 2000 to 6.7% in 2015. Moreover, more than 90% of urban areas are located in flat areas. Spatial trends revealed the agglomeration of Kunming and Yuxi city. The lacunarity analysis also indicated that the homogeneity of built-up space increased resulting in increased connectivity of the cities.Conclusions Spatial trends and lacunarity analyses support the finding that moderate urban homogenization and agglomeration formation took place during the past 15 years. The "Integration of urban agglomeration of Kunming and Yuxi cities" agreement signed by the governments of the two cities in 2011, along with other similar policies, has contributed to the urban expansion. Moreover, because of the rough topography of Yunnan Plateau, the urban growth has also been shaped by topographic patterns.

In the present study, we evaluated the clinical significance of skip LN metastasis in GC patients.Methods: According to the anatomical location of positive lymph nodes (LNs), the patients who underwent curative gastrectomy in our institute were classified in three groups: only perigastric involvement (PG group), only extraperigastric involvement (SK group) and both perigastric and extraperigastric involvement (PG+EP group). The clinicopathologic features and prognostic differences between the different groups were compared.Results: The incidence of skip metastasis was 3.9% in all GC patients and the most common location of skip metastasis was No.7 and No.8a node station. The proportion of only one involved station accounted for 83.0% of all cases. In addition, the SK group had fewer numbers of retrieved LNs than the PG and the PG+EP group, especially in the perigastric area. There were significant differences between different groups in the baseline characteristics. After clinicopathologic factors were adjusted and matched, we found that the prognosis of skip metastasis was poorer than that of only perigastric involvement, but was similar to that of both perigastric and extraperigastric involvement.Conclusion: The patients with skip metastasis had a poorer prognosis than those with only perigastric involvement. Anatomical location of metastatic LNs may be not ignored, and adequate lymphadenectomy should be indispensable for node-positive patients.

T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban and vegetation morphology profiles are important factors in local climate-related studies, but they are not as easily measured as land cover information to study urban landscape at metropolitan area. This study aims to develop a GIS-based Local Climate Zones (LCZs) mapping scheme to map and compare the LCZs for three major metropolitans in Texas: Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), Austin, and San Antonio. Based on an analysis of the land cover and urban morphology, variables including land cover, height of roughness elements, building surface fraction, pervious surface fraction (PSF), and land use planning codes were generated and selected as LCZs classification properties. Then we designed the LCZs mapping scheme with decision-making algorithm was built for LCZs mapping. The key findings of LCZs of our study areas are that: 1) Most of the urbanized area are categorized into LCZ "open" types (characterized by building surface fraction of 15-40% and pervious surface fraction of 30-60%) for all three metropolitan areas with different proportions and spatial diversity; 2) LCZ D Low plants is dominant in areas surrounding DFW, while LCZ A Dense trees and LCZ D Low plants are dominant in Austin and San Antonio with clear regional contrast; 3) LCZs maps are in accordance with the underlying regional environment of the areas. Our study indicated that LiDAR-derived products can support LCZs mapping to identify urban morphological information and standardize the mapping scheme for further comparative studies of metropolitan areas.

TI  - Simultaneous Retrieval of Atmospheric Profiles, Surface Temperature and Surface Emissivity in Different Types of Earth Surface Using Hyperspectral Infrared Satellite Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric temperature, water vapor, surface skin temperature and surface emissivity are the intrinsic information of the atmosphere and surface of earth. Retrieval of atmospheric temperature profile and water vapour profile is important for accurate weather forecasting and climate change research by using satellite infrared data, at the same time, the retrieved surface skin temperature and surface emissivity spectra were used to study the growth of plant and crop yield, evaporation and circulation of surface water, energy balance, surface composition and physical properties, climate change and global environment. In this paper, considering the atmosphere and the ground as a whole system, the retrieval method for simultaneous retrieval of atmospheric temperature profiles, water vapour profiles, surface emissivity, and surface skin temperature was established, simultaneous retrieval were performed by using hyperspectral infrared satellite Atmospheric Infrared Sounder data (AIRS) in China's Xinjiang region for two typical desert and snow features. Firstly, infrared radiation transmission equation of earth-atmosphere system was linearized. Then, it was proposed that atmospheric profile and surface emissivity can be structured by Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) to effectively reduce the inversion variables. The physical simultaneous retrieval algorithm could be developed finally. In the retrieval process, the first guess values were obtained through National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and the optimum solution could be obtained by Newton iteration method. The observation area covered the Taklamakan desert and Junggar basin in Xinjiang, China. The latitude of the Tazhong observation station is 38.98 degrees and the longitude is 83.64 degrees, which is located in the hinterland of the Taklimakan desert in central tarimbas in. The latitude of National field science observation station of fukang desert ecosystem is 44.2 degrees and the longitude is 87.9 degrees, which is located in Junggar basin. The Tazhong observation station and National field science observation station of Fukang desert ecosystem were selected to be the retrieval of the ground verification point. These stations were selected to be the retrieval of the ground verification point. The results showed that the surface temperature in the Taklamakan desert is significantly higher than that in Junggar basin, which is consistent with the actual situation. According to the retrieval of the surface emissivity distribution at 8.6 and 13.4 mu m, it could be seen that the desert surface emissivity is significantly lower than the emissivity of snow at 8.6 mu m, and retrieval of the two kinds of ground infrared emissivity spectrum is consistent with the laboratory measurement of emissivity spectra by comparing the retrieved surface emissivity and the jet propulsion laboratory measurement of desert and snow emissivity data between 6 similar to 15 mu m. The atmosphere and ground were considered as a whole system, the surface emissivity was added in the retrieval in this paper. Through comparison and analysis of retrieved two kinds of ground atmospheric profile with the local meteorological sounding values and traditional method retrieval, the research showed that the retrieval accuracy of atmospheric temperature and water vapour profile is improved, especially the improvement is obvious in the boundary layer.At the same time, the analysis showed that the improvement of the retrieval precision of the atmospheric profile in the desert region is higher than that in the snow region. Because the surface emissivity changes within the spectrum is larger in the desert area, while the surface emissivity changes within the spectrum is smaller in the snow area. It is important that using the proposed approach can simultaneously retrieve atmospheric temperature profiles, water vapour profiles, surface emissivity and surface skin temperature. The retrieval precision of the atmospheric temperature profile and water vapour profile in the desert area can be improved more effectively compared with snow region, This paper can provide the service and support for the numerical weather forecast and the future hyperspectral infrared satellite application in China, which is of great significance.

TI  - An improved method for assessing vegetation cooling service in regulating thermal environment: A case study in Xiamen, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitatively evaluating vegetation cooling service has become an important issue in current ecosystem service assessment, especially for urban area. Based on a previous method proposed on the energy exchanging theory, this study developed an improved method to generate a spatially explicit evaluation of the vegetation cooling service by introducing fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and the daily length of vegetation cooling service provision. Using remote sensing data from Landsat-8 and MODIS-Terra observations and field measurements from local meteorological stations, the method was successfully applied in Xiamen, a city located on the southeastern coast of China. The results showed that surface elevation and FVC had profound impacts on the length of vegetation cooling service provision and the vegetation cooling ability, respectively. For the vegetation surfaces of total 799.48 km(2) in Xiamen, the annual heat absorption was 2.73 x 10(9) MJ/a in 2015 with an average length of cooling service provision of 1954.04 h. A more reasonable spatial distribution of vegetation heat absorbing capacity can be found with the differences not only among different vegetation types but also within the same vegetation type. Thus, this study emphasized the impacts of vegetation coverage and cooling length on providing cooling service, which has practical implications for vegetation planning in urban areas.

TI  - Retrieval of Soil Organic Carbon in Cinnamon Mining Belt Subsidence Area Based on OLI and 6SV
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing retrieval has been widely used for dynamic monitoring of the physical and chemical properties of regional soil, but there are few studies on the areas with low organic carbon content and uneven underlying surface which have unremarkable soil spectral characteristics. The cinnamon soil belt in Loess Plateau has multiplicity topography, widely distributed hills and low organic matter content. Large areas soil degradation caused by mining activities has resulted in the fact that soil spectroscopy characteristics are strongly disturbed, which has some inhibiting effect on the remote sensing retrieval accuracy of soil organic carbon content at the regional scale. Based on cinnamon soil belt with typical coal mining subsidence area in Shanxi Province as an example, this research used the surface reflectance and outdoor sample data from the field of coal mining subsidence area to retrieve soil organic carbon content. Conducting comparative experiments on the atmospheric correction methods of the Landsat8 OLI image in the study area by the FLAASH model and the 6SV model combined with high spatial and temporal resolution aided meteorological data to analyze the effect on soil spectral curve and organic carbon content in the mining subsidence area of the cinnamon soil belt and recognize sensitive bands. Multiple linear regression(MLR), BP neural network(BP) and partialleas squares regression(PLSR) model were established to retrieve soil organic carbon content by using the original spectral reflectance R and mathematical transformation forms such as root R, log (1/R) and R'. The results showed that the atmospheric correction effect of the 6SV model was better than that of the FLAASH model which could effectively eliminate the interference of atmosphere and topography to reflectance. The reflectance of visible light decreased and the near-infrared rose obviously. The soil reflectance spectra of different organic matter content was clear. The bands of 640 similar to 670, 850 similar to 880, 1 570 similar to 1 600, 2 110 similar to 2 290 nm were highly indicative of soil organic carbon content. Compared with multiple linear regression (Coefficient of determination R-2 was 0.765) and BP neural network (R-2 was 0.767), the partial least-squares regression model had the highest retrieval accuracy (R-2 was 0.778). It was found that the 6SV atmospheric correction model and partial least squares regression modeling combined with aided meteorological data which had high spatial and temporal resolution could significantly improve the retrieval accuracy of soil organic carbon in the mining subsidence area of the cinnamon belt. The soil organic carbon content in the study area from 2013 to 2015 was retrieved based on this model. Results showed that the soil organic carbon content in the middle of the study area was higher than that in both sides, and the soil organic carbon content was restored by reclamation. The results can be used to reveal the spatial-temporal distribution of soil organic carbon in the mining subsidence area of the cinnamon belt in the Loess Plateau, providing theoretical and technical support for improving regional soil spectral analysis, land reclamation evaluation, establishment of carbon flux observation network in mining subsidence area of the cinnamon belt and estimation of soil carbon pool, which provides the basis for the ecological sustainable development of the cinnamon belt in the regional and global scales.

TI  - Long-Term Land Cover Dynamics (1986-2016) of Northeast China Derived from a Multi-Temporal Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeast China is a major grain production area, an ecological important forest area, and the largest old industrial base which is now suffering from economic growth slowdown and brain drain. Accurate and long-term dynamic land cover maps are highly demanded for many regional applications. In this study, we developed a set of continuous annual land cover mapping product at 30 m resolution using multi-temporal Landsat images. The maps in year 2000 and 2015 were tested using another independent validation dataset and the overall accuracies were 80.69% and 88.38%, respectively. The accuracies of the maps were improved by the integration of multi-temporal Landsat images and post-classification strategies. We found a general trend that the total area of land that experienced a change in land cover each year increased over time. The area change of each land cover type is also detected. The area of forests was 3.92x105 km2 in 1986, fluctuated under fire disturbance, but declined in a quite high rate over the period of 1989 to 2006, and finally stayed relatively stable in area around 3.58x105 km2. The expansion of croplands was the leading land cover change from 1986 to 2000, and then the total area of croplands slightly declined under the Grain to Green Project of China, while shrublands, grasslands and wetlands began to increase. The area of impervious surfaces increased by more than 502% during the last three decades, and about 73% of the new built-up area was converted from croplands. We also demonstrated the our maps could capture the important land cover conversion processes, such as urbanization, forest logging activities, and agricultural expansion.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of mining 3D deformation by multi-platform SAR images with the probability integral method
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Only one-dimensional (1D) deformation along the radar line of sight (LOS) can be obtained using differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR), and D-InSAR observation is insensitive to deformation in the north direction. This study inferred three-dimensional (3D) deformation of a mining subsidence basin by combining the north-south deformation predicted by a probability integral method with the LOS deformation obtained by D-InSAR. The 15235 working face in Fengfeng mining area (Hebei Province, China) was used as the object of study. The north-south horizontal movement was predicted by the probability integral method according to the site's geological and mining conditions. Then, the vertical and east-west deformation fields were solved by merging ascend-orbit RadarSAT-2, descend-orbit TerraSAR, and predicted north-south deformation based on a least squares method. Comparing with the leveling data, the results show that the vertical deformation accuracy of the experimental method is better than the inversed vertical deformation neglecting the horizontal deformation. Finally, the impact of the relationship between the azimuth of the working face and the SAR imaging geometry on the monitoring of the mining subsidence basin was analyzed. The results can be utilized in monitoring mining subsidence basins by single SAR image sources.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multipronged statistical approaches were applied to give spatiotemporal insight into the long-term patterns of vegetative drought over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from a weekly NOAA/AVHRR VHI product of 1981-2017. Based on the analysis results, the following characteristics have been found: First, the category of the most frequently occurring drought is the moderate drought (D1), and the drought frequency successively decreases from abnormally dry conditions (D0) to exceptional drought (D4). The frequencies of moderate drought (D1), severe drought (D2), and extreme drought (D3) in the West Mountains region are consistently higher than the frequency of the corresponding severity levels in other regions, while the frequency of exceptional drought (D4) in the Great Plains is the highest. The frequencies of three worst drought levels (D2, D3, and D4) in the East region are consistently the lowest in the CONUS. Second, there are gradual changes in the trends of vegetative drought from March to October and the change patterns are significantly different for newly identified four vegetation classes (evergreen forest, deciduous forest, grass, and crop). There is more increase in VHI values in March-May and less in June-October for deciduous forest and grass. Evergreen forest presents similar results except more in October. There are obviously more pixels with significant increase in VHI values in March, April and July, August for crop. Third, the trajectories of the centroids of vegetative drought have significantly moved southwestward in the past 37 years. With drought severity levels increasing, the centroid movement got larger and there were regular translations toward southwest.

TI  - Evaluating the Spatial Representativeness of the MODerate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer Albedo Product (MCD43) at AmeriFlux Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is a key parameter in regulating surface radiation budgets. The gridded remote sensing albedo product often represents information concerning an area larger than the nominal spatial resolution because of the large viewing angles of the observations. It is essential to quantify the spatial representativeness of remote sensing products to better guide the sampling strategy in field experiments and match products from different sources. This study quantifies the spatial representativeness of the MODerate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (collection V006) 500 m daily albedo product (MCD43A3) using the high-resolution product as intermediate data for different land cover types. A total of 1820 paired high-resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and coarse-resolution (MODIS) albedo data from five land cover types were used. The TM albedo data was used as the spatial-complete high resolution data to evaluate the spatial representativeness of the MODIS albedo product. Semivarioagrams were estimated from 30 m Landsat data at different spatial scales. Surface heterogeneity was evaluated with sill value and relative coefficient of variation. The 30 m Landsat albedo data was aggregated to 450 m-1800 m using two different methods and compared with MODIS albedo product. The spatial representativeness of MODIS albedo product was determined according to the surface heterogeneity and the consistency of MODIS data and the aggregated TM value. Results indicated that for evergreen broadleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, open shrub lands, woody savannas and grasslands, the MODIS 500 m daily albedo product represents a spatial scale of approximately 630 m. For mixed forests and croplands, the representative spatial scale was approximately 690 m. The difference obtained was primarily because of the complexity of the landscape structure. For mixed forests and croplands, the structure of the landscape was relatively complex due to the presence of different forest and plant types in the pixel area, whereas the other landscape structures were considerably simpler.

TI  - Vegetation coverage change and its response to topography in a typical karst region: the Lianjiang River Basin in Southwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst areas are usually ecologically fragile complex terrains, where the topography considerably affects vegetation coverage. Although the relationship between vegetation and topography has been studied extensively, this relationship is not well understood in the karst areas. In this study, vegetation coverage was estimated in a typical karst basin for the years 1995, 2005, and 2016, using remote sensing data and the dimidiate pixel model. The spatial-temporal variation in vegetation coverage and its response to topography were quantitatively analyzed. Overall, the results showed that the vegetation coverage in this region increased from 1995 to 2016. The area under extremely high vegetation coverage increased from 26.6 to 56.0%, while vegetation coverage levels decreased in all other areas. Moreover, vegetation coverage varied with topography. It first increased with elevation but then continuously decreased, and the decrease in vegetation coverage was the most obvious on the steeper slopes. Vegetation coverage was higher with sunny aspects than with shady ones. The effects of ecological restoration were apparent in the Lianjiang River Basin from 1995 to 2016, especially on the sunny aspects at elevations between 650 and 1100m and with a slope steepness <30 degrees. The results will help us identify the influencing factors and build models to predict soil loss from forests with little understory vegetation in the red soil region of China. They also improve our understanding of the effect of topography on vegetation coverage in the karst areas. Accordingly, appropriate vegetation restoration measures can be taken for varied terrains.

In this study, we first investigated the glacier mass balance of 2000-2015/16 for seven major glacier clusters by utilizing high-resolution SPOT-6/7 stereo imagery and the SRTM DEM. The final results revealed an overall mass balance of - 0.16 +/- 0.05 m w.e./a. for the study region (with a total glacier area of 967 km(2)). Secondly, ICESat/GLAS altimetry data were used to quantify the water-level change of 2003-2008/09 for the two largest glacier-fed closed lakes (i.e., LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake) in this region. Based on this, we applied a strategy which establishes the statistical relationship between the lake area change and the lake water-level change for 2003-2008/09 to estimate the specific water level using the corresponding lake area. We then further calculated the variation in lake water storage between 2000 and 2015. The results showed that the water storage of LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake increased by 1.82 +/- 0.14 km(3) and 1.90 +/- 0.38 km(3), respectively. For each lake basin, meanwhile, the glaciers lost - 0.18 +/- 0.03 km(3) and - 0.21 +/- 0.04 km(3) of water, accounting for 9.9% and 11.1% of the increase in lake water storage for LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake, respectively. Our results not only demonstrate that glacier meltwater has only a limited impact on the lake expansion in this region, but they also provide new evidence for the warming and wetting process of the climate in the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Integrating UAV optical imagery and LiDAR data for assessing the spatial relationship between mangrove and inundation across a subtropical estuarine wetland
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove-inundation patterns have been examined in many field studies, but spatially explicit quantitative analyses are still lacked. A better understanding of how mangrove species responds to the inundation gradient will facilitate mangrove conservation and management. In this study, we integrated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) camera imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data for exploring mangrove-inundation spatial patterns over the intertidal zone in a subtropical estuarine wetland (Zhangjiang estuarine wetland, Fujian, China). Our results indicated that > 90% of mangrove forests (mainly Kandelia obovate, Avicennia marina, and Aegiceras corniculatum) were situated within a one-meter elevation range between local mean sea level and higher high water, and the spatial distribution of mangrove forests showed hump-shaped patterns along the inundation gradient with favorable inundation periods of 2 similar to 5 h per day. Our analyses further indicated that there was a weak mangrove zonation pattern with overlaps between species zones along the elevation gradient, and that mangrove species had differential inundation sensitivities with Avicennia marina being most sensitive to the inundation stress. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first spatially explicit quantitative study to examine the influences of inundation regime on both spatial distribution and canopy height of different mangrove species over the intertidal zone at the landscape scale. This study highlights the practicability and necessity of UAV LiDAR in interpreting mangrove-inundation spatial patterns, and confirms the importance of inundation regime as a key driver in regulating the spatial patterns of mangrove forests. The determination of appropriate elevation ranges and inundation periods provides some important knowledge to guide mangrove restoration practices and to assess the vulnerability of mangrove forests in response to future sea level rise.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Surface Deformation in the 2016 M<sub>W</sub> 7.8 Kaikura, New Zealand, Earthquake From Optical Image Correlation: Implications for Strain Localization and Long-Term Evolution of the Pacific-Australian Plate Boundary
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We generated dense, high-resolution 3-D ground displacement maps for the 2016 M-W 7.8 Kaikura, New Zealand earthquake-the most geometrically and kinematically complex rupture yet recordedfrom stereo WorldView optical satellite imagery using a new methodology that combines subpixel image correlation with a ray-tracing approach. Our analysis reveals fundamental new details of near-field displacement patterns, which cannot easily be obtained through other methods. From our detailed correlation maps, we measured fault slip in 3-D along 19 faults at 500-m spacing. Minimum resolvable horizontal slip is similar to 0.1 m, and vertical is similar to 0.5 m. Net slip measurements range from <1 to similar to 12 m. System-level kinematic analysis shows that slip on faults north of the Hope fault was oriented primarily subparallel to the Pacific-Australian plate motion direction. In contrast, slip on faults to the south was primarily at high angle to the plate motion and secondarily parallel to plate motion. Fault kinematics are in some locations consistent with long-term uplift patterns, but inconsistent in others. Deformation within the Seaward Kaikura Range may indicate an attempt by the plate boundary fault system to geometrically simplify. Comparison of published field measurements along the Kekerengu fault with our correlation-derived measurements reveals that similar to 36% of surface displacement was accommodated as distributed off-fault deformation when considering only field measurements of discrete slip. Comparatively, field measurements that project previously linear features (e.g., fence lines) into the fault over apertures >5-100 m capture nearly all (similar to 90%) of the surface deformation.

TI  - Time-Series Evolution Patterns of Land Subsidence in the Eastern Beijing Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence in the Eastern Beijing Plain has a long history and is always serious. In this paper, we consider the time-series evolution patterns of the eastern of Beijing Plain. First, we use the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI) technique, with Envisat and Radarsat-2 data, to monitor the deformation of Beijing Plain from 2007 to 2015. Second, we adopt the standard deviation ellipse (SDE) method, combined with hydrogeological data, to analyze the spatial evolution patterns of land subsidence. The results suggest that land subsidence developed mainly in the northwest-southeast direction until 2012 and then expanded in all directions. This process corresponds to the expansion of the groundwater cone of depression range after 2012, although subsidence is restricted by geological conditions. Then, we use the permutation entropy (PE) algorithm to reverse the temporal evolution pattern of land subsidence, and interpret the causes of the phenomenon in combination with groundwater level change data. The results show that the time-series evolution pattern of the land subsidence funnel edge can be divided into three stages. From 2009 to 2010, the land subsidence development was uneven. From 2010 to 2012, the land subsidence development was relatively even. From 2012 to 2013, the development of land subsidence became uneven. However, subsidence within the land subsidence funnel is divided into two stages. From 2009 to 2012, the land subsidence tended to be even, and from 2012 to 2015, the land subsidence was relatively more even. The main reason for the different time-series evolution patterns at these two locations is the annual groundwater level variations. The larger the variation range of groundwater is, the higher the corresponding PE value, which means the development of the land subsidence tends to be uneven.

TI  - Improving Permafrost Modeling by Assimilating Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of soil moisture conditions is important for modeling soil temperatures, as soil moisture influences the thermal dynamics in multiple ways. However, in permafrost regions, soil moisture is highly heterogeneous and difficult to model. Satellite soil moisture data may fill this gap, but the degree to which they can improve permafrost modeling is unknown. To explore their added value for modeling soil temperatures, we assimilate fine-scale satellite surface soil moisture into the CryoGrid-3 permafrost model, which accounts for the soil moisture's influence on the soil thermal properties and the surface energy balance. At our study site in the Canadian Arctic, the assimilation improves the estimates of deeper (>10cm) soil temperatures during summer but not consistently those of the near-surface temperatures. The improvements in the deeper temperatures are strongly contingent on soil type: They are largest for porous organic soils (30%), smaller for thin organic soil covers (20%), and they essentially vanish for mineral soils (only synthetic data available). That the improvements are greatest over organic soils reflects the strong coupling between soil moisture and deeper temperatures. The coupling arises largely from the diminishing soil thermal conductivity with increasing desiccation thanks to which the deeper soil is kept cool. It is this association of dry organic soils being cool at depth that lets the assimilation revise the simulated soil temperatures toward the actually measured ones. In the future, the increasing availability of satellite soil moisture data holds promise for the operational monitoring of soil temperatures, hydrology, and biogeochemistry.Plain Language Summary We explore whether soil moisture data improve the accuracy with which we can predict the soil temperature profile in cold regions. Knowledge of the temperature conditions is important for monitoring the stability of the terrain, for understanding the response of vegetation and microorganisms, and many other applications. Soil moisture data may be useful in this context because soil moisture influences the thermal dynamics of the soil, but so far, such data have been in short supply. Using novel satellite soil moisture data, we show that soil moisture information does indeed help to improve the estimates of deeper temperatures, at least in organic soils. In the future, the increasing availability of satellite soil moisture data holds promise for the operational monitoring of soil temperatures, hydrology, and biogeochemistry.

TI  - Mapping floristic gradients of forest composition using an ordination-regression approach with landsat OLI and terrain data in the Central Hardwoods region
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest properties with supervised remote sensing has historically and increasingly remained vital to research and management efforts, and the demand for such products will only increase as better tools and data increase the usability of such maps. Multispectral imagery by the Landsat program has been an invaluable resource for forest type characterization for several decades. As an alternative to traditional classification approaches dominating these efforts, we instead employed an ordination-regression approach to mapping forest composition as floristic gradients across a similar to 5000-km(2) forestland in southeastern Ohio's Central Hardwoods. Plot data (n = 699 plots; 99 species/genera) from a comprehensive sample of both overstory and understory woody plants across structurally- (open to closed canopy) and topographically-variable forest conditions were projected onto a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination solution. Floristic gradients, via their ordination scores, were related to spectral reflectance provided by a multitemporal Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (011) image and various terrain variables using Random Forests models. Approximately 61%, 49%, and 25% of the floristic variation among the three axes of the NMDS ordination were related to the remotely-sensed variables during regression modeling. The axes were predicted onto three images and merged to a RGB color composite for the final floristic gradient map, displaying multivariate vegetation variation across the landscape in terms of variation in color. The color values, by referencing ordination space position within the original solution, provide a statistical approximation of the taxonomic composition of individual forest stands in relation to the plot data. We found this approach highly effective and an attractive alternative to traditional classifications. It is time-efficient, more realistic in that compositional turnover is expressed in continuous fields rather than arbitrary breaks, and less subjective, overcoming the generalization problem inherent in categorizing vegetation assemblages a priori. Moving forward, our model will be a valuable tool in developing suitable management options on individual forest stands for the restoration of desired species, adapting to a changing climate, and improving wildlife habitat in forestlands across the Central Hardwoods.

TI  - The relationship between <i>Sardinella aurita</i> landings and the environmental factors in Moroccan waters (21°-26°N)
T2  - CYBIUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the effects of environmental variations on the abundance of the round sardinella (Sardinella aurita, Valenciennes, 1847) in Moroccan waters (21 degrees-26 degrees N) using generalized additive models. The monthly variability of Sardinella aurita abundance in the south of Morocco is investigated using sea surface temperature (SST), upwelling index (UI) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration from Global ARMOR3D L4 product, ESA Ocean Colour CCI and AquaMODIS satellite data between 2009 and 2016. The results show that there is a significant correlation between fish landings, SST and Chl-a, especially at latitude 22 N. Concerning the UI, the correlation is positive and not significant at latitudes 21 and 22 degrees N. The relationship between the environmental parameters indicate that there is a high and significant correlation between the SST and Chl-a at latitude 22 degrees N. Using generalized additive models, it was found that environmental parameters (SST, Chl-a, and UI) in the latitude 22 degrees N played a major role in explaining differences in monthly landings for S. aurita (65.1% deviance explained). The high abundance of S. aurita, observed in autumn, is due to the adequate environmental condition in the south of Morocco, which leads to the migration of this species from Mauritanian to Moroccan waters.

TI  - Arctic-Boreal Lake Dynamics Revealed Using CubeSat Imagery
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale, subseasonal fluctuations in Arctic-Boreal surface water reflect regional water balance and modulate trace gas emissions to the atmosphere but have eluded detection using traditional satellite remote sensing. We use high-resolution (similar to 3-5 m), high-frequency CubeSat sensors to measure near-daily changes in lake surface area through an object-based tracking method that incorporates machine learning to overcome notable limitations of CubeSat imagery. From similar to 76,000 images we obtain >2.2 million individual observations of changing surface areas for 85,358 lakes in Northern Canada and Alaska between 1 May and 1 October 2017. We find broad-scale lake area declines across diverse climatic, hydrologic, and physiographic terrains. Localized exceptions reveal lowland flooding and aquatic vegetation phenology cycles. Cumulative small shoreline changes of abundant lakes on the Canadian Shield exceed total inundation variations of better-studied lowland environments, revealing a surprisingly dynamic landscape with respect to subseasonal variations in surface water extent and trace gas emissions.

TI  - Predicting and mapping human risk of exposure to <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> nymphs using climatic and environmental data, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tick-borne diseases have become increasingly common in recent decades and present a health problem in many parts of Europe. Control and prevention of these diseases require a better understanding of vector distribution. Aim: Our aim was to create a model able to predict the distribution of Ixodes ricinus nymphs in southern Scandinavia and to assess how this relates to risk of human exposure. Methods: We measured the presence of I. ricinus tick nymphs at 159 stratified random lowland forest and meadow sites in Denmark, Norway and Sweden by dragging 400 m transects from August to September 2016, representing a total distance of 63.6 km. Using climate and remote sensing environmental data and boosted regression tree modelling, we predicted the overall spatial distribution of I. ricinus nymphs in Scandinavia. To assess the potential public health impact, we combined the predicted tick distribution with human density maps to determine the proportion of people at risk. Results: Our model predicted the spatial distribution of I. ricinus nymphs with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 60%. Temperature was one of the main drivers in the model followed by vegetation cover. Nymphs were restricted to only 17.5% of the modelled area but, respectively, 73.5%, 67.1% and 78.8% of the human populations lived within 5 km of these areas in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Conclusion: The model suggests that increasing temperatures in the future may expand tick distribution geographically in northern Europe, but this may only affect a small additional proportion of the human population.

TI  - A data science challenge for converting airborne remote sensing data into ecological information
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecology has reached the point where data science competitions, in which multiple groups solve the same problem using the same data by different methods, will be productive for advancing quantitative methods for tasks such as species identification from remote sensing images. We ran a competition to help improve three tasks that are central to converting images into information on individual trees: (1) crown segmentation, for identifying the location and size of individual trees; (2) alignment, to match ground truthed trees with remote sensing; and (3) species classification of individual trees. Six teams (composed of 16 individual participants) submitted predictions for one or more tasks. The crown segmentation task proved to be the most challenging, with the highest-performing algorithm yielding only 34% overlap between remotely sensed crowns and the ground truthed trees. However, most algorithms performed better on large trees. For the alignment task, an algorithm based on minimizing the difference, in terms of both position and tree size, between ground truthed and remotely sensed crowns yielded a perfect alignment. In hindsight, this task was over simplified by only including targeted trees instead of all possible remotely sensed crowns. Several algorithms performed well for species classification, with the highest-performing algorithm correctly classifying 92% of individuals and performing well on both common and rare species. Comparisons of results across algorithms provided a number of insights for improving the overall accuracy in extracting ecological information from remote sensing. Our experience suggests that this kind of competition can benefit methods development in ecology and biology more broadly.

TI  - Remote sensing pipeline for tree segmentation and classification in a mixed softwood and hardwood system
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Institute of Standards and Technology data science evaluation plant identification challenge is a new periodic competition focused on improving and generalizing remote sensing processing methods for forest landscapes. I created a pipeline to perform three remote sensing tasks. First, a marker-controlled watershed segmentation thresholded by vegetation index and height was performed to identify individual tree crowns within the canopy height model. Second, remote sensing data for segmented crowns was aligned with ground measurements by choosing the set of pairings which minimized error in position and in crown area as predicted by stem height. Third, species classification was performed by reducing the dataset's dimensionality through principle component analysis and then constructing a set of maximum likelihood classifiers to estimate species likelihoods for each tree. Of the three algorithms, the classification routine exhibited the strongest relative performance, with the segmentation algorithm performing the least well.

AB  - In the World Health Organization European Region, the 2018/19 influenza season started in week 49 2018, crossing 10% virus-positivity in sentinel surveillance specimens. At week 5 2019, activity remained elevated with positivity rates at 55%. Both A(H1N1) pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses circulated widely and detection levels in primary care and hospital settings were similar to past seasons. Hospitalisation data may suggest an increased susceptibility to A(H1N1) pdm09 virus in older age groups.

TI  - Sexual attitudes, sexual behaviors, and use of HIV prevention services among male undergraduate students in Hunan, China: a cross-sectional survey
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The dramatic increase in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among undergraduate students in China, especially among the male students, is alarming. This study aimed to describe sexual attitudes and behaviours and to examine the use of HIV prevention services and related factors among male undergraduate students in Hunan, China.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from November 2017 to January 2018 among male students from three universities in Hunan, China. Self-administered questionnaires were uploaded online to collect data anonymously. HIV-related knowledge and sexual attitudes were assessed with the unified National AIDS Sentinel Surveillance Questionnaire and Sexual Attitude Scale, whereas sexual behaviours and use of HIV prevention services were examined with researcher-created questionnaires. HIV-related knowledge, sexual attitudes and behaviours, and use of HIV prevention services were described. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to analyse the factors associated with the use of HIV prevention education services. P values <= 0.05 were considered significant.Results: Of the 1431 respondents, 1068 (74.6%; 95% CI: 72.4-76.0%) used HIV prevention education services and 105 (7.3%) took HIV testing. The openness of sexual attitudes was moderate overall. About 299 (20.9%) of this sample had active sex partners, and 49 (16.4%) of them had sex with males. The consistent use of condoms was unsatisfactory among the sexually active students, especially among those with homosexual behaviours. Participants who were older in age (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.86), who were university seniors (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70-0.91), who drank alcohol (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.93), and who had open attitude towards paid sex (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95), were less likely to use HIV prevention education services.Conclusions: Although male undergraduate students show open attitude to premarital sex and engage in risky sexual behaviours, their use of HIV prevention education services is unsatisfactory, particularly in terms of HIV testing. More comprehensive and specific education on HIV prevention and testing services should be designed and offered on campus.

TI  - Greening in Rural Areas Increases the Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover, land surface temperature (LST), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data were used to investigate the trends of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII, urban LST minus rural LST) and their relations with vegetation in 397 global big cities during 2001-2017. Major findings include the following: (1) Annual daytime and nighttime SUHII increased significantly (p < 0.05, Mann-Kendall trend test) in 42.1% and 30.5% cities, respectively. (2) The daytime SUHII in the growing season was significantly and positively correlated with rural EVI in 58.9% cities. This is because high rural EVI can increase the EVI difference between urban and rural areas. (3) Rural greening contributed 22.5% of the increased daytime SUHII in the growing season at the global scale. This study highlights that the effect of greening in rural areas was a significant and widespread driver for the increased daytime SUHII.Plain Language Summary Surface urban heat island (SUHI) refers to higher land surface temperature (LST) in urban than in rural areas. The increased SUHI intensity (urban LST minus rural) was mainly attributed to increased anthropogenic heat emission and built-up areas and reductions in vegetation in urban areas in the literature. However, this study showed that the increased vegetation (i.e., greening) in rural areas was a significant and widespread driver for the increased daytime SUHI intensity around the world during 2001-2017. The implication of this study is that urban LST may increase much faster than rural LST in future global warming.

TI  - Plasmonic Nanoprobes for in Vivo Multimodal Sensing and Bioimaging of MicroRNA within Plants
T2  - ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring gene expression within whole plants is critical for many applications ranging from plant biology to agricultural biotechnology and biofuel development; however, no method currently exists for in vivo monitoring of genomic targets in plant systems without requiring sample extraction. Herein, we report a unique multimodal method based on plasmonic nanoprobes capable of in vivo imaging and biosensing of microRNA biotargets within whole plant leaves by integrating three different and complementary techniques: surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and plasmonics-enhanced two-photon luminescence (TPL). The method developed uses plasmonic nanostars, which not only provide large Raman signal enhancement but also allow for localization and quantification by XRF and plasmonics-enhanced TPL, owing to gold content and high two-photon luminescence cross sections. Our method uses inverse molecular sentinel nanoprobes for SERS bioimaging of microRNA within Arabidopsis thaliana leaves to provide a dynamic SERS map of detected microRNA targets while also quantifying nanoprobe concentrations using XRF and TPL. The nanoprobes were observed to occupy the intercellular spaces upon infiltration into the leaf tissues. This report lays the foundation for the use of plasmonic nanoprobes for in vivo functional imaging of nucleic acid biotargets in whole plants, a tool that will revolutionize bioengineering research by allowing the study of these biotargets with previously unmet spatial and temporal resolution, 200 mu m and 30 min, respectively.

TI  - Trends in fragmentation and connectivity of <i>Paspalum quadrifarium</i> grasslands in the Buenos Aires province, Argentina
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Despite its wide distribution worldwide, only 4.6% of temperate grasslands are included within systems of protected areas. In Argentina, this situation is even more alarming: only 1.05% is protected. The study area (central area of the southern Salado River basin) has a large extent of grasslands of Paspalum quadrifarium (Pq) which has been target since the middle of the last century of a variety of agricultural management practices including fire burning for cattle grazing.Methods. Five binary images of presence-absence data of Pq from a 42-year range (1974-2016) derived from a land cover change study were used as base data. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA), Morphological Change Detection (MCD) and Network Connectivity Analysis (NCA) were performed to the data using Guidos Toolbox (GTB) for the estimation of habitat and connectivity dynamics of the Pq patches (fragments).Results. A loss of the coverage area and habitat nuclei of this grassland was observed during the study period, with some temporal oscillation but no recovery to initial states. Additional drastic reduction in connectivity was also evident in resulting maps. The number of large Pq grassland fragments (>50 ha) decreased at beginning of the study period. Also, fragmentation measured as number of components (patches) was higher at the end of the study period. The Pq pajonal nuclei had their minimum representativeness in 2000, and recovered slightly in area in 2011, but with a significant percentage increase of smaller patches (=islets) and linear elements as bridges and branches. Large corridors (mainly edge of roads) could be observed at the end of the study period, while the total connectivity of the landscape pattern drops continuously. Statistics of links shows mean values decreasing from 1974 to 2016. On the other hand, maximum values of links decreased up to 19% in 2011, and recovered to a 54% of their original value in 2016.Discussion. Pq fragmentation and habitat reduction could have an impact on the ecosystem functioning and the mobility of some species of native fauna. The connecting elements of the landscape were maintained and/or recovered in percentage in 2011 and 2016. This fact, although favoring the dispersion of the present diversity in the habitat nuclei could cause degradation by an edge effect. Part of the area has the potential to be taken as an area of research and as an example of livestock management, since it is the one that would most preserve the biodiversity of the Pq environment. On the methodological side, the use of a proved tool as GTB is useful for monitoring dynamics of a grassland-habitat fragmentation.

TI  - Recent Trends in Stratospheric Chlorine From Very Short-Lived Substances
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Very short-lived substances (VSLS), including dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), perchloroethylene (C2Cl4), and 1,2-dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2), are a stratospheric chlorine source and therefore contribute to ozone depletion. We quantify stratospheric chlorine trends from these VSLS (VSLCltot) using a chemical transport model and atmospheric measurements, including novel high-altitude aircraft data from the NASA VIRGAS (2015) and POSIDON (2016) missions. We estimate VSLCltot increased from 69 (14) parts per trillion (ppt) Cl in 2000 to 111 (22)ppt Cl in 2017, with >80% delivered to the stratosphere through source gas injection, and the remainder from product gases. The modeled evolution of chlorine source gas injection agrees well with historical aircraft data, which corroborate reported surface CH2Cl2 increases since the mid-2000s. The relative contribution of VSLS to total stratospheric chlorine increased from 2% in 2000 to 3.4% in 2017, reflecting both VSLS growth and decreases in long-lived halocarbons. We derive a mean VSLCltot growth rate of 3.8 (0.3)ppt Cl/year between 2004 and 2017, though year-to-year growth rates are variable and were small or negative in the period 2015-2017. Whether this is a transient effect, or longer-term stabilization, requires monitoring. In the upper stratosphere, the modeled rate of HCl decline (2004-2017) is -5.2% per decade with VSLS included, in good agreement to ACE satellite data (-4.8% per decade), and 15% slower than a model simulation without VSLS. Thus, VSLS have offset a portion of stratospheric chlorine reductions since the mid-2000s.Plain Language Summary It is well established that long-lived halogen-containing compounds of anthropogenic origin, such as chlorofluorocarbons, have led to depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. As production of these compounds is now controlled by the Montreal Protocol, the atmospheric abundance of chlorine/bromine is in decline, and the ozone layer should recover in coming decades. Here we consider the contribution of Very Short-Lived Substances to stratospheric chlorine. These compounds also have anthropogenic sources, though are much less efficient at destroying ozone compared to, for example, most chlorofluorocarbons (per molecule emitted) as they break down more readily close to Earth's surface. Using surface observations and atmospheric model simulations, we show that stratospheric chlorine from short-lived substances has increased since the early 2000s. This increase is also apparent from airborne measurements of their atmospheric abundance over the same period. Using the model in conjunction with satellite estimates of stratospheric chlorine, we show rising levels of short-lived substances may be causing upper stratospheric chlorine to decline at a slower rate relative to what would be expected in their absence. While this offset in the rate of chlorine decline is modest (15%), it is nonnegligible and should be considered in the analysis of stratospheric composition trends.

TI  - Potential of soil moisture retrieval for tropical peatlands in Indonesia using ALOS-2 L-band full-polarimetric SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a soil moisture retrieval from full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is investigated for sparsely vegetated soil surfaces. An improved retrieval method adapting the variations in vegetation is proposed by incorporating the generalized volume model into the polarimetric two-scale two-component model (PTSTCM). The feasibility of the method, termed as the adaptive PTSTCM, has been tested for tropical peatland sites in Indonesia which exhibit a variety of sparse vegetation cover on soil after land clearing activities. The data were collected in March and August 2017 with the time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe for a total of 18 sample points over 11 regions. The method was applied to ALOS-2 L-band quad-pol SAR data that were acquired simultaneously with field measurements. We compared the results between the proposed adaptive PTSTCM and the original PTSTCM that utilizes specific types of volume model (i.e., randomly, horizontally, and vertically oriented volume models). Scatterplots of estimated versus measured results reveal that the adaptive PTSTCM yields a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.1vol. and inversion rate of 35.0 and 58.5 for March and August data, respectively, which are found to be superior to those of the original PTSTCM.

TI  - Merits of Level III Axillary Dissection in Node-Positive Breast Cancer: A Prospective, Single-Institution Study From India
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE A complete axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection is therapeutic in node-positive breast cancer. Presently, there is no international consensus regarding anatomic levels to be addressed in complete axillary dissection. We assessed the burden of disease in level III axilla.MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospectively maintained database was assessed for 1,591 consecutive patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer registered at Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, between January 2009 and December 2014.RESULTS A median of four (zero to 20) level III ALNs were dissected and a median of two (one to 17) nodes were positive. A total of 27.3% (434 of 1,591) patients had level III ALN metastasis, and 4.7% of patients had positive interpectoral nodes. Some 53.2% of patients had level III metastases in the presence of four or more positive level I and II ALNs. A total of 9.4% of patients had level III involvement when one to three ALNs were positive in level I and II (P < .001). Some 53.2% of patients had level III metastases in the presence of four or more positive level I and II ALNs. On logistic regression analysis, four or more positive ALNs in level I or II (P < .001), inner/central quadrant tumor location (P = .013), and perinodal extension (P < .001) were associated with level III ALN involvement. At a median follow-up of 36 months, the disease-free survival was significantly worse for level III ALN metastases on univariate analysis (P < .001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, histologic grade (P = .006), four or more positive ALNs (P < .001), hormone receptor status (P < .001), and tumor size (P = .037) were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival.CONCLUSION The axillary nodal burden is high in patients with breast cancer in developing countries like India. One of two women with four or more positive level I and II ALNs may have residual disease in level III if it is not cleared during surgery. Intraoperative interpectoral space clearance should be considered in the presence of either palpable interpectoral lymph nodes or multiple positive ALNs.

TI  - Global burden of maternal and congenital syphilis and associated adverse birth outcomes-Estimates for 2016 and progress since 2012
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn 2007 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the global initiative to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis (congenital syphilis, or CS). To assess progress towards the goal of <50 CS cases per 100,000 live births, we generated regional and global estimates of maternal and congenital syphilis for 2016 and updated the 2012 estimates.MethodsMaternal syphilis estimates were generated using the Spectrum-STI model, fitted to sentinel surveys and routine testing of pregnant women during antenatal care (ANC) and other representative population data. Global and regional estimates of CS used the same approach as previous WHO estimates.ResultsThe estimated global maternal syphilis prevalence in 2016 was 0.69% (95% confidence interval: 0.57-0.81%) resulting in a global CS rate of 473 (385-561) per 100,000 live births and 661,000 (538,000-784,000) total CS cases, including 355,000 (290,000-419,000) adverse birth outcomes (ABO) and 306,000 (249,000-363,000) non-clinical CS cases (infants without clinical signs born to un-treated mothers). The ABOs included 143,000 early fetal deaths and stillbirths, 61,000 neonatal deaths, 41,000 preterm or low-birth weight births, and 109,000 infants with clinical CS. Of these ABOs-203,000 (57%) occurred in pregnant women attending ANC but not screened for syphilis; 74,000 (21%) in mothers not enrolled in ANC, 55,000 (16%) in mothers screened but not treated, and 23,000 (6%) in mothers enrolled, screened and treated. The revised 2012 estimates were 0.70% (95% CI: 0.63-0.77%) maternal prevalence, and 748,000 CS cases (539 per 100,000 live births) including 397,000 (361,000-432,000) ABOs. The estimated decrease in CS case rates between 2012 and 2016 reflected increased access to ANC and to syphilis screening and treatment.ConclusionsCongenital syphilis decreased worldwide between 2012 and 2016, although maternal prevalence was stable. Achieving global CS elimination, however, will require improving access to early syphilis screening and treatment in ANC, clinically monitoring all women diagnosed with syphilis and their infants, improving partner management, and reducing syphilis prevalence in the general population by expanding testing, treatment and partner referral beyond ANC.

TI  - Assimilating INSAT-3D Thermal Infrared Window Imager Observation With the Particle Filter: A Case Study for Vardah Cyclone
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A big challenge in the satellite data assimilation is the effective use of InfraRed (IR) window channel radiances in the high-resolution weather model. A hybrid data-assimilation method is used in this study for very severe cyclonic storm Vardah, in which three-dimensional variational method is used to assimilate control observations, and particle filter method is used to assimilate Indian geostationary satellite INSAT-3D data. In the context of imperfect weather model, various particles (or ensembles) are prepared with different combinations of model physics. To implement particle filter, INSAT-3D thermal IR window channel 1 (TIR-1; center wavelength 11m) measured brightness temperature (BT) and cloud mask product are used to assign appropriate weights to different particles to reduce model uncertainties. This step is followed by resampling step in which new particles are generated from high weight particles using stochastic kinetic-energy backscatter scheme method and dynamical variables are perturbed into the model physics. Results suggest that simulated TIR-1 BT analysis and forecasts from WPF (with INSAT-3D data using particle filter experiments) are closer to INSAT-3D measured TIR-1 BT in comparison to WCNT (without INSAT-3D data using particle filter) experiments. Furthermore, approximately 10% to 50% improvements are found in mean track error forecasts in WPF experiments. An improvement of 10% is noticed in cyclone center position in analysis. Prediction of storm intensity is also improved after assimilation. Results also suggest that vertical structure of WPF simulated humidity, temperature, wind speed, and surface pressure is improved over WCNT runs.

TI  - Mapping Canopy Heights of Poplar Plantations in Plain Areas Using ZY3-02 Stereo and Multispectral Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height plays an important role in forest management and ecosystem modeling. There are a variety of techniques employed to map forest height using remote sensing data but it is still necessary to explore the use of new data and methods. In this study, we demonstrate an approach for mapping canopy heights of poplar plantations in plain areas through a combination of stereo and multispectral data from China's latest civilian stereo mapping satellite ZY3-02. First, a digital surface model (DSM) was extracted using photogrammetry methods. Then, canopy samples and ground samples were selected through manual interpretation. Canopy height samples were obtained by calculating the DSM elevation differences between the canopy samples and ground samples. A regression model was used to correlate the reflectance of a ZY3-02 multispectral image with the canopy height samples, in which the red band and green band reflectance were selected as predictors. Finally, the model was extrapolated to the entire study area and a wall-to-wall forest canopy height map was obtained. The validation of the predicted canopy height map reported a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.72 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.58 m. This study demonstrates the capacity of ZY3-02 data for mapping the canopy height of pure plantations in plain areas.

TI  - Estimating daily average net radiation in Northern Mongolia
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Net radiation is a key component of surface radiation balance and has a strong influence on hydrological processes via evapotranspiration. In this study, daily average net radiation (Rn-mean) for all-sky conditions was investigated as a function of the estimated daily average global radiation (GR(mean)) during the summers of 2011 and 2012 (128 days total) in the Sugnugur Valley of Northern Mongolia. We present a simple alternative remote sensing approach that considers factors such as topography, cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness and surface albedo. First, a geometric model for the simulation of daily average global radiation (GR(CS:mean)) for clear-sky conditions was applied on a daily basis. It considers topographical effects, such as slope, azimuth and elevation. GR(mean) was then derived for all-sky conditions by coupling the averaged atmospheric products of MODIS. Finally, Rn-mean was obtained as a function of the simulated GR(mean) using the linear regression parameters found at a permanent observation site. The results were validated with the data from a nearby temporary observation site. The root mean square errors (RMSE) were 44 and 52 Wm(-2) for GR(mean) and 18 and 25 Wm(-2) for Rn-mean at the two different sites. This methodology requires few observations and offers a simple means for estimating GR(mean) with high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolution under any sky conditions in the absence of ground measurements. Furthermore, Rn-mean can be modeled from the simulated GR(mean) at regional or watershed scales where ground observations exist at one site at least.

TI  - An Efficient Method for Microphysical Property Retrievals in Vertically Inhomogeneous Marine Water Clouds Using MODIS-CloudSat Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient method is developed to infer cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud droplet effective radius (CDER) of marine water clouds from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and CloudSat measurements, incorporating droplet size vertical inhomogeneity. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is employed to reduce the degrees of freedom of the droplet size profile. The first two EOFs can explain 94% of the variability in the droplet size profile. Compared to the existing bispectral CDER retrieval from MODIS assuming plane parallel vertically homogeneous clouds, the new retrieval produces smaller CDER values in clouds in which the adiabatic growth process is dominant and larger CDER values in clouds in which the collision-coalescence process is dominant. To evaluate the performance of the retrieval algorithm, we compare retrieved COT and CDER in this study with their MODIS and CloudSat counterparts on a pixel-by-pixel basis. CDER retrieval based on the vertically homogeneous assumption may be underestimated by 30% due to droplet size vertical inhomogeneity when COT is large and the collision-coalescence process is dominant in the cloud. Retrieved CDER in conjunction with the two scores for EOFs can reconstruct the vertical profile of CDER, which is useful for cloud microphysical process studies. Furthermore, potential expansion of this algorithm to MODIS pixels without CloudSat collocations is discussed.

TI  - Bovine leukemia virus DNA associated with breast cancer in women from South Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is a neoplastic condition with a high morbidity and mortality amongst women worldwide. Recent data linking bovine leukemia virus (BLV) with breast cancer has been contested already. Our study investigated the presence of BLV genome in healthy (n = 72) and cancerous (n = 72) paraffin-embedded samples of breast tissues from women in south Brazil. BLV DNA was found most frequently (30.5%) in breast cancer tissue than in healthy breast (13.9%) (Odds ratio = 2.73; confidence interval = 1.18-6.29; p = 0.027). In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women.

TI  - Exploring Aerosols Near Clouds With High-Spatial-Resolution Aircraft Remote Sensing During SEAC<SUP>4</SUP>RS
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since aerosols are important to our climate system, we seek to observe the variability of aerosol properties within cloud systems. When applied to the satellite-borne Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Dark Target retrieval algorithm provides global aerosol optical depth (AOD; at 0.55m) in cloud-free scenes. Since MODIS' resolution (500-m pixels, 3- or 10-km product) is too coarse for studying near-cloud aerosol, we ported the Dark Target algorithm to the high-resolution (50-m pixels) enhanced-MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS), which flew on the high-altitude ER-2 during the Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys Airborne Science Campaign over the United States in 2013. We find that even with aggressive cloud screening, the 0.5-km eMAS retrievals show enhanced AOD, especially within 6km of a detected cloud. To determine the cause of the enhanced AOD, we analyze additional eMAS products (cloud retrievals and degraded-resolution AOD), coregistered Cloud Physics Lidar profiles, MODIS aerosol retrievals, and ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network observations. We also define spatial metrics to indicate local cloud distributions near each retrieval and then separate into near-cloud and far-from-cloud environments. The comparisons show that low cloud masking is robust, and unscreened thin cirrus would have only a small impact on retrieved AOD. Some of the enhancement is consistent with clear-cloud transition zone microphysics such as aerosol swelling. However, 3-D radiation interaction between clouds and the surrounding clear air appears to be the primary cause of the high AOD near clouds.Plain Language Summary Since aerosols are important components of our climate system, we seek to use observations to quantify aerosol properties and their interactions with clouds. To study aerosols close to clouds, we adapt a well-known aerosol retrieval algorithm used for satellite remote sensing (lower spatial resolution) and port to airborne remote sensing (higher spatial resolution). We apply the retrieval to observations collected over the southeastern United States during late summer 2013. The resulting product suggests that total aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be greatly enhanced near clouds. To validate, we compare this retrieved AOD to other data sets and find that the enhanced AOD near clouds is only partially observed by other sensors. This suggests that the enhanced AOD is primarily a cloud adjacency or 3-dimensional radiative effect. High-resolution, passive remote sensing measurements can characterize aerosol/cloud environments, thus helping to interpret global AOD data sets from more comprehensive but coarser-resolution satellite retrievals.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability in Land Surface Temperature Over the Mountainous Region Affected by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake From 2000 to 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous region affected by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake was frequently analyzed to assess its vegetation recovery. However, the dynamic of surface thermal environment was rarely investigated but directly influenced local geophysical and biophysical processes. Under this background, this research aimed to analyze the trend of surface temperature based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer daily land surface temperature product from 2000 to 2017 and understand its change mechanism. An annual temperature cycle model was applied to obtain the daytime and nighttime annual cycle parameters (ACPs), including mean annual surface temperature (MAST), yearly amplitude of surface temperature, and phase shift. The trend analysis with the Mann-Kendall test illustrated the strong inverse relationship between the two ACPs (MAST and yearly amplitude of surface temperature) and elevation, and the nighttime terms showed a stronger connection than those of the daytime. The areas with significant decreases in vegetation coverage induced by the earthquake exhibited an obvious upward trend in daytime MAST and annual maximum temperature, while the vegetation improved areas presented a cooling effect. Comparatively, the nighttime ACPs was little sensitive to vegetation change and the change magnitude was relatively small. For the high mountain area, with the shrinkage of snow cover duration, the global warming effect resulted in a warming trend by increasing the annual minimum temperature at both the daytime and nighttime. Overall, this study provided insights to the impact of the earthquake to mountain thermal environment and its different responses to changes in vegetation cover and climatic environment.

TI  - Urbanization in India: Population and Urban Classification Grids for 2011
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - India is the world's most populous country, yet also one of the least urban. It has long been known that India's official estimates of urban percentages conflict with estimates derived from alternative conceptions of urbanization. To date, however, the detailed spatial and settlement boundary data needed to analyze and reconcile these differences have not been available. This paper presents gridded estimates of population at a resolution of 1 km along with two spatial renderings of urban areas-one based on the official tabulations of population and settlement types (i.e., statutory towns, outgrowths, and census towns) and the other on remotely-sensed measures of built-up land derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. We also cross-classified the census data and the remotely-sensed data to construct a hybrid representation of the continuum of urban settlement. In their spatial detail, these materials go well beyond what has previously been available in the public domain, and thereby provide an empirical basis for comparison among competing conceptual models of urbanization.

TI  - Measuring Coseismic Deformation With Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar: A Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the past 25 years, space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery has become an increasingly available data source for the study of crustal deformation associated with moderate to large earthquakes (M > 4.0). Coseismic surface deformation can be measured with several well-established techniques, the applicability of which depends on the ground displacement pattern, on several radar parameters, and on the surface properties at the time of the radar acquisitions. The state-of-the-art concerning the measurement techniques is reviewed, and their application to over 100 case-studies since the launch of the Sentinel-1a satellite is discussed, including the performance of the different methods and the data processing aspects, which still constitute topics of ongoing research.

TI  - Exploring Uncertainty in Canine Cancer Data Sources Through Dasymetric Refinement
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of the potentially groundbreaking environmental sentinel applications, studies of canine cancer data sources are often limited due to undercounting of cancer cases. This source of uncertainty might be further amplified through the process of spatial data aggregation, manifested as part of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). In this study, we explore potential explanatory factors for canine cancer incidence retrieved from the Swiss Canine Cancer Registry (SCCR) in a regression modeling framework. In doing so, we also evaluate differences in statistical performance and associations resulting from a dasymetric refinement of municipal units to their portion of residential land. Our findings document severe underascertainment of cancer cases in the SCCR, which we linked to specific demographic characteristics and reduced use of veterinary care. These explanatory factors result in improved statistical performance when computed using dasymetrically refined units. This suggests that dasymetric mapping should be further tested in geographic correlation studies of canine cancer incidence and in future comparative studies involving human cancers.

TI  - Drought-Induced Carbon and Water Use Efficiency Responses in Dryland Vegetation of Northern China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the context of global warming and the increasing frequency of extreme climate events, concerns have been raised by scientists, government, and the public regarding drought occurrence and its impacts, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. In this paper, the drought conditions for the forest and grassland areas in the northern region of China were identified based on 12 years of satellite-based Drought Severity Index (DSI) data. The impact of drought on dryland vegetation in terms of carbon use efficiency (CUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) were also investigated by exploring their correlations with DSI. Results indicated that 49.90% of forest and grassland experienced a dry trend over this period. The most severe drought occurred in 2001. In general, most forests in the study regions experienced near normal and wet conditions during the 12 year period. However, grasslands experienced a widespread drought after 2006. The forest CUE values showed a fluctuation increase from 2000 to 2011, whereas the grassland CUE remained steady over this period. In contrast, WUE increased in both forest and grassland areas due to the increasing net primary productivity (NPP) and descending evapotranspiration (ET). The CUE and WUE values of forest areas were more sensitive to droughts when compared to the values for grassland areas. The correlation analysis demonstrated that areas of DSI that showed significant correlations with CUE and WUE were 17.24 and 10.37% of the vegetated areas, respectively. Overall, the carbon and water use of dryland forests was more affected by drought than that of dryland grasslands.

TI  - Successional and seasonal changes of leaf beetles and their indicator value in a fragmented low thorn forest of northeastern Mexico (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae)
T2  - ZOOKEYS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) constitute a highly diverse family of phytophagous insects with high ecological relevance, due to their host plant specificity and their close association to vegetation variables. Therefore, secondary succession and seasonal changes after loss of vegetal cover will have a significant influence on their community patterns. Accordingly, responses of leaf beetles to such environmental heterogeneity make them a suitable taxon for monitoring disturbance, which is more important for endangered habitats such as the low thorn forests (LTF) in northeastern Mexico. We conducted a study in a LTF fragment in order to assess the effects of secondary succession and seasonality on leaf beetle communities, as well as to quantify the importance of Chrysomelidae as an indicator taxon. Landsat scenes were used for delimiting a successional gradient, in which four succession categories were selected: four years, 17 years, and 31 years since loss of vegetal cover, and conserved areas. Eight plots of 100 m(2) were randomly delimited in each category; plots were sampled monthly, using an entomological sweep net, from May 2016 to April 2017. In total, 384 samples were collected by the end of study, from which 6978 specimens, six subfamilies, 57 genera, and 85 species were obtained. Species richness was higher in early succession areas. Abundance declined significantly from early successional to conserved areas, but the conserved areas had the higher diversity. Furthermore, differences in abundance were significant between rainy and dry seasons in areas of four, 17, and 31 years of succession, but not in conserved areas; also, all categories had a similar abundance during the dry season. Intermediate (17 and 31 years) and conserved areas differed in the season of higher diversity. Regarding inventory completeness, it was close to or above 70 % for all comparisons, although it was very low for the 17-year category during the rainy season. Faunistic similarity was higher between intermediate categories. A total of 24 species had a significant indicator value. Effects of succession time and seasonality on leaf beetle communities are here quantified for first time in LTF forests. Influences of environmental heterogeneity and intermediate disturbance are disciicsed as main drivers of the results obtained. Several leaf beetle species are proposed that could be useful for monitoring succession time and secondary LTF vegetation in northeastern Mexico. However, studies must be replicated at other regions, in order to obtain a better characterization of disturbance influence on leaf beetles.

TI  - Multi-year Satellite Observations of Sulfur Dioxide Gas Emissions and Lava Extrusion at Bagana Volcano, Papua New Guinea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bagana, arguably the most active volcano in Papua New Guinea, has been in a state of near-continuous eruption for over 150 years, with activity dominated by sluggish extrusion of thick blocky lava flows. If current extrusion rates are representative, the entire edifice may have been constructed in only 300-500 years. Bagana exhibits a remarkably high gas flux to the atmosphere, with persistent sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions of several thousand tons per day. This combination of apparent youth and high outgassing fluxes is considered unusual among persistently active volcanoes worldwide. We have used satellite observations of SO2 emissions and thermal infrared radiant flux to explore the coupling of lava extrusion and gas emission at Bagana. The highest gas emissions (up to 10 kt/day) occur during co-extrusive intervals, suggesting a degree of coupling between lava and gas, but gas emissions remain relatively high (similar to 2,500 t/d) during inter-eruptive pauses. These passive emissions, which clearly persist for decades if not centuries, require a large volume of degassing but non-erupting magma beneath the volcano with a substantial exsolved volatile phase to feed the remarkable SO2 outgassing: an additional similar to 1.7-2 km(3) basaltic andesite would be required to supply the excess SO2 emissions we observe in our study interval (2005 to present). That this volatile phase can ascend freely to the surface under most conditions is likely to be key to Bagana's largely effusive style of activity, in contrast with other persistently active silicic volcanoes where explosive and effusive eruptive styles alternate.

TI  - Cloud Cover in the Australian Region: Development and Validation of a Cloud Masking, Classification and Optical Depth Retrieval Algorithm for the Advanced Himawari Imager
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a cloud masking, cloud classification and optical depth retrieval algorithmand its application to the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on the Himawari-8/9 satellites using visible, near infrared and thermal infrared bands. A time-series-based approach was developed for cloud masking which was visually assessed and quantitatively validated over 1 year of daytime data for both land and ocean against the level 2 Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 1 km cloud layer product (version 4.10). An overall hit rate (the proportion of pixels identified by both sensors as either clear or cloudy) of 87% was found. However, analysis revealed that, when partially cloudy conditions were experienced, the small footprint of the CALIOP sensor (70 meters beam size sampling every 330 meters along the ground track) had a major impact on the hit rate. When partially cloudy pixels are excluded a hit rate of similar to 98% was found, even for thin clouds with optical depth less than 0.25. A two-way confidence index for the cloud mask was developed which could be used to reclassify the pixels depending on applications, either biasing toward clearness or cloudiness. On the basis of the cloud masking, classification and optical depth retrieval was performed based on radiative transfer modeling. Small modeling error was found, and inspection of typical cloud classification examples showed that the results were consistent with cloud texture and cloud top temperatures. While difficult to validate retrieved cloud properties directly, an indirect quantitative validation was performed by comparing surface-level solar flux computed from the retrieved cloud properties with in-situ measurements at 11 sites across Australia for up to 3 years. Excellent agreement between calculated and measured solar flux was found, with a mean monthly bias of 2.96 W/m(2) and RMSE of 8.91 W/m(2), and the correlation coefficient exceeding 0.98 at all sites. Further assessment was conducted by comparing seasonal and annual cloud fraction with that of ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) over Australia and surrounding region. It showed high degree of resemblance between the two datasets in their total cloud fraction. The geographical distribution of cloud classes also showed broad resemblance, though detailed differences exist, especially for high clouds, which is probably due to the use of different cloud classification systems in the two datasets. The products generated from this study are being used in several applications including ocean color remote sensing, solar energy, vegetation monitoring and detection of smoke for the study of their health impacts, and aerosol and land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) retrieval. The method developed herein can be applied to other geostationary sensors.

TI  - Mortality and Air Pollution Effects of Air Quality Interventions in Delhi and Beijing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambient air pollution alone accounts for more than 3 million premature deaths worldwide. Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) account for most (similar to 87%) of this disease burden. Air pollution in the megacities of these countries has risen to the levels of public health hazards forcing the cities to take emergency measures, such as issuing red alerts and vehicle-rationing interventions (VRI). Using in-situ and high-resolution satellite data, this research examines the efficacy of VRI in Delhi and Beijing, two of the most polluted cities of LMIC. This research shows that VRI reduced particulate matter (PM) <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) in Beijing during the 2008 Summer Olympics. However, such interventions implemented in 2015 and 2016 in Beijing and in 2016 in Delhi were ineffective in improving air quality. Moreover, the effects of such interventions were short lived, for example 54% of the cleaning in Beijing disappeared within 2 weeks after the Olympics, and Delhi witnessed a 34% increase in PM2.5 during the 2 weeks after the interventions. Both cities observed excess cardiopulmonary mortality even during the interventions. Short-and long-term preventive and mitigation strategies are needed to manage the air pollution disease burden.

TI  - First detection of the samurai wasp, <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i> (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera, Scelionidae), in Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the first detection of Trissolcus japonicas, an exotic Asian egg parasitoid and the primary candidate for classical biological control of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, in Canada. Twenty-eight Trissolcus japonicus emerged from an H. halys egg mass from a site heavily infested by H. halys in Chilliwack, British Columbia, in 2018. This egg mass was deployed and retrieved as part of ongoing sentinel egg mass surveys for natural enemies of H. halys from 2017-2018 in coastal and interior British Columbia (total of 1,496 egg clusters at 16 sites). The identification of T. japonicus was based on biology (high levels of successful emergence from H. halys eggs), morphology, and mitochondrial DNA sequences. Trissolcus japonicus was not detected at any other survey sites in 2017-2018; however, three species of indigenous egg parasitoids were found attending or emerging from H. halys egg masses at low levels (<4%) at several sites. The origin of the detected T. japonicus, the extent of its establishment in British Columbia, and its ultimate impact on H. halys populations remain to be determined. Nonetheless, the detection of this exotic biological control agent in Canada concurrently with regulatory review of its intentional importation and release is emblematic of the current uncertainty around regulatory control on the movement of biological control agents across borders.

TI  - Assimilating MODIS data-derived minimum input data set and water stress factors into CERES-Maize model improves regional corn yield predictions
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth models and remote sensing are useful tools for predicting crop growth and yield, but each tool has inherent drawbacks when predicting crop growth and yield at a regional scale. To improve the accuracy and precision of regional corn yield predictions, a simple approach for assimilating Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products into a crop growth model was developed, and regional yield prediction performance was evaluated in a major corn-producing state, Illinois, USA. Corn growth and yield were simulated for each grid using the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Maize model with minimum inputs comprising planting date, fertilizer amount, genetic coefficients, soil, and weather data. Planting date was estimated using a phenology model with a leaf area duration (LAD)-logistic function that describes the seasonal evolution of MODIS-derived leaf area index (LAI). Genetic coefficients of the corn cultivar were determined to be the genetic coefficients of the maturity group [included in Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) 4.6], which shows the minimum difference between the maximum LAI derived from the LAD-logistic function and that simulated by the CERES-Maize model. In addition, the daily water stress factors were estimated from the ratio between daily leaf area/weight growth rates estimated from the LAD-logistic function and that simulated by the CERES-Maize model under the rain-fed and auto-irrigation conditions. The additional assimilation of MODIS data-derived water stress factors and LAI under the auto-irrigation condition showed the highest prediction accuracy and precision for the yearly corn yield prediction (R-2 is 0.78 and the root mean square error is 0.75 t ha(-1)). The present strategy for assimilating MODIS data into a crop growth model using minimum inputs was successful for predicting regional yields, and it should be examined for spatial portability to diverse agro-climatic and agro-technology regions.

TI  - Satellite data indicates multidimensional variation of agricultural production in land consolidation area
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land consolidation (LC) is an innovative way to improve agricultural production. Spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural production in land consolidation area (LCA) is difficult to quantify with limited field observations and survey data. Satellite data has advantages on recording vegetation status changes frequently, which is very supportive of estimating variation of agricultural production. In this paper, we used Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Multiple Band Drought Index (MBDI) from satellite data, to examine five attributes (irrigation capacity, multiple cropping index, crop phenology, farmland productivity, and production stability) of agricultural production after land consolidation (LC) at a site in China. Results show that there were no significant spatial differences in irrigation capacity for farmland in few years after LC due to consistent climatic conditions and uniform irrigation and drainage system. Multiple cropping index shows a pattern of "first reducing, then growing, last reducing", which may result from the disturbed "water-soil" environment and weak farmers' intention. Interannual variation of spatial distribution of phenology for the second-season crop is larger than that for the first-season crop since LC implementation adjusts short-term land use and management. With the improvement of production conditions and balanced distribution of production elements, farmland productivity has been improved and its differences among various farmland patches imply a reducing trend. Production in LCA is slightly less stable than that in the control area (TCA) where LC is not carried out because of limited and short-term effect from LC. We concluded that satellite data presents variation of agricultural production in LCA from different dimensions of time, space and attributes. Multidimensional variation of agricultural production is decided by several factors, including climate condition, LC activity, and farmers' intention. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - <i>In vivo</i> detection of sentinel lymph nodes with PEGylated crushed gold shell @ radioactive core nanoballs
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Positron-emitting radioactive isotope-labeled gold nanomaterials are suitable imaging agents in biomedical imaging owing to their high sensitivity, straightforward clinical translation, adequate information regarding clinical safety, and their application in another new imaging modality, Cerenkov luminescent imaging. This study aimed to investigate the potential application of PEGylated crushed gold shell @ radioiodine-labeled core nanoparticles (PEG-I-124-Au@AuCBs) in detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in mice in vivo, using the dual imaging modality of positron emission tomography and Cerenkov luminescence imaging (PET/CLI). PEG-I-124-Au@AuCBs were non-toxic and did not affect cellular function in normal and immune cells. In vivo PET imaging revealed the selective accumulation of PEG-I-124-Au@AuCBs in SLNs proximal to the site of injection 1 h after injection and radioactivity was detected from the SLN until 24 h. Consistently, the SLNs were also visualized using in vivo CLI at 24 h, consistent with the findings of ex vivo bio-distribution and histological analyses. Therefore, PEG-I-124-Au@AuCBs are suitable multimodal contrast agents for in vivo SLN mapping in pre- or intraoperative guidance.

TI  - Evaluation of long-term estuarine vegetation changes through Landsat imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes support estuarine biodiversity and provide ecosystem services; however, their general decay is being observedworldwide, in large part due to land reclamation. Accordingly, there is a growing concern about saltmarsh preservation status having in mind the promotion of effective management decisions towards their conservation and restoration. Satellite imagery offers the opportunity tomonitor land surface dynamics, constituting a fundamental information source for wetland monitoring. This study analyses spatial and temporal vegetation changes within Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon between 1984 and 2017, by processing and analyzing TM and ETM+ Landsat imagery. A database consisting of 264 cloud-free images was collected and analyzed. The Normalized DifferenceWater Index was computed using the remote surface reflectance and was then used to distinguish land from water and to estimate the flooded lagoon area. Moreover, the tidal statewas determined for each image froma tidal elevation record monitored at the lagoon entrance. Subsequently, four vegetation indices (VI) were computed and their spatial variability in the lagoon area uncovered by waterwas assessed. Spatially averaged spectral indiceswere also statistically analyzed and seasonal variations and interannual trends evaluated. Results show that the intertidal area increased, and VI values decreased indicating a possible reduction in the Chlorophyll content and suggesting that the new intertidal regions are mostly covered by mud. The spatially averaged VI values show seasonal patterns, with peaks in spring and summer, coinciding with high biomass productivity periods. The largest flooded area and VI modifications occurred after 1999, suggesting that changes are associated with dredging activities performed in themain lagoon channels. This study reinforced the potential of Landsat archives tomonitor coastalwetlands, highlighting their importance for coastal managers of threatened systems, and therefore helping to define management strategies about the ecological conservation of estuarine systems.

TI  - Decadal scale geomorphic changes and tributary confluences within the Ganga River valley in Varanasi region, Ganga Plain, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Allahabad to Buxar, the Ganga River shows distorted menders, huge meander cut-offs, ox-bow lakes, scroll bars and abandoned linear channel belts, all suggesting to a fault system-related tectonic control on the river. The confluence dynamics of northern tributaries Gomati and Varuna Rivers which have shifted progressively from north to south, and confluences of southern tributary Jirgo which shifted from south to north, further corroborate the view and also suggest that the presence of a NE-SW trending dextral strike slip fault having a gravity component.The Ganga River came close to Varanasi around 40 ka ago following a tectonic event that caused extensive liquefaction of the sediments due to a seismic pulse and upheaval in the area. Between 40 to 7ka, the Ganga River was freely oscillating within its valley when another tectonic event took place and the Ramnagar cliff was raised due to upheaval and channel incision along NE-SW trending fault. After 7ka, the Ramnagar cliff was degraded before it was inhabited by man at around 3800 years BP, which have been contemporaneous to antiquity of Varanasi.Based on available remote sensing data, the morphometry has shown that in 1972 active channel covered 12% area in Ganga River Valley and aerial extent remained 8% in 2010. The decrease of sand bar areas (14%-11%) in the studied stretch reflects the decrease in monsoon strength over the last four decades. However, the decline in the aerial extent of relict valley features, viz. meander scars, meander cut-offs and alluvial islands, is quite characteristic and may be related to sediment recycling by migrating channels present within the active channel belt and floodplain areas of the Ganga River.

TI  - Tectono-climatic influence on landscape changes in the glaciated Durung Drung basin, Zanskar Himalaya, India: A geospatial approach
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at assessing the tectonic and climatic responses to landscape changes transpired in the Durung Drung basin in the Zanskar Himalaya. We used relevant geomorphic indices interpreted from ASTER DEM satellite data and supplemented by the field observations to decipher active tectonics and resultant changes in the landscape. A N-S trending fault in the north of the basin was studied with the help of basin geometry which includes relative parameter, length area relation, form factor, shape factor ratio, elongation ratio, circulatory ratio, compactness coefficient and morphotectonic indices (e.g., drainage basin asymmetry, mountain front sinuosity, hypsometric integral, topographic symmetric factor) to comprehend the geomorphic signatures of the active tectonics. The geomorphic indices indicate upliftment and filling of the basin. The data on mountain front index and hypsometric integral reveal the uplift and high relief. We propose that the western side of the basin is tectonically more active than eastern side, suggesting active upliftment. The convex nature of hypsometric curve and strongly elongated circulatory ratio reflect competing role of deformation by tectonics. The results of mountain front index and hypsometric integral reveal high relief and uplift. Overall deglaciation of 12.91% was observed in the basin. Analysis of the meteorological data for the last century (1901-2017) indicate that increase in minimum and maximum temperature coupled with increase in liquid precipitation are probably the main drivers of glacier depletion. We conclude that the drainage system of this basin is structurally controlled and overall landscape change is significantly influenced by the ongoing perturbations in the climate system.

TI  - Microplastic in cultured oysters from different coastal areas of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics are an emerging concern in the marine environment due to their small size; they can be ingested by aquatic organisms, especially filter-feeding organisms, such as oysters. The presence of microplastics in seafood may pose a threat to food safety, and there is an urgent need to evaluate the potential risks of microplastics to human health. This study quantified the microplastics in oysters from 17 sites along the coastline of China. Qualitative attributes, such as shape and size, were also determined under a microscope. Additionally, the polymer types were identified using Fourier-Transform Infrared Micro-Spectroscopy (mu-FT-IR). The results showed that the average abundance of microplastics in oyster was 0.62 items/g (wet weight) or 2.93 items/individual. Additionally, 84% of the sampled oysters had inhaled microplastics, indicating the high prevalence of microplastic pollution in different coastal areas of China. Fibers were the most common shape (60.67%), and the most common size was <1500 mu m, accounting for 81.89% of the total microplastics. The mu-FT-IR analysis identified eight different polymers, and the main polymeric types of microplastics were cellophane (CP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Our results suggest the widespread prevalence of microplastics in cultured oysters from different coastal areas of China with similar or lower abundances than other countries. In addition, our results exhibited regional characteristics of high microplastics abundance in southern coastal area of China and low microplastics abundance in northern China. Further investigations are warranted to examine microplastics contamination in other seafood species from different geographical sites in coastal area of China. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Global monitoring of volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> degassing with unprecedented resolution from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last four decades, space-based nadir observations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) proved to be a key data source for assessing the environmental impacts of volcanic emissions, for monitoring volcanic activity and early signs of eruptions, and ultimately mitigating related hazards on local populations and aviation. Despite its importance, a detailed picture of global SO2 daily degassing is difficult to produce, notably for lower-tropospheric plumes, due largely to the limited spatial resolution and coverage or lack of sensitivity and selectivity to SO2 of current (and previous) nadir sensors. We report here the first volcanic SO2 measurements from the hyperspectral TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) launched in October 2017 onboard the ESA's Sentinel-5 Precursor platform. Using the operational processing algorithm, we explore the benefit of improved spatial resolution to the monitoring of global volcanic degassing. We find that TROPOMI surpasses any space nadir sensor in its ability to detect weak degassing signals and captures day-to-day changes in SO2 emissions. The detection limit of TROPOMI to SO2 emissions is a factor of 4 better than the heritage Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Here we show that TROPOMI SO2 daily observations carry a wealth of information on volcanic activity. Provided with adequate wind speed data, temporally resolved SO2 fluxes can be obtained at hourly time steps or shorter. We anticipate that TROPOMI SO2 data will help to monitor global volcanic daily degassing and better understand volcanic processes and impacts.

TI  - The variation of vegetation greenness and underlying mechanisms in Guangdong province of China during 2001-2013 based on MODIS data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation greenness and the mechanisms underlying this variation in the subtropical region of Guangdong in China during 2001-2013 to obtain a better understanding of vegetation response to climate and land use/cover changes inwarm-humid regions. Satellite-based vegetation indices, land use/cover data and observed weather records during 2001-2013 were used. Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were conducted to quantify the trends and variations in vegetation greenness and the relationships with climate and land use/cover changes. The results indicated that the annual mean greenness trended upward significantly in eastern and westernGuangdong and downward significantly in northern Guangdong. The patterns of significant positive or negative relationships between vegetation greenness and climatic factors were observed at the sub-regional scale. In addition, our results showed that (i) vegetation greenness in Guangdong was more sensitive to changes in temperature than in precipitation, (ii) spring temperature had an important time-lag effect on seasonal mean greenness in the following summer and autumn, and (iii) winter greenness depended largely on vegetation growth in the previous autumn. Furthermore, the conversion of grasslands and croplands to evergreen forests resulting fromafforestation increased the vegetation greenness in eastern and western Guangdong. Overall, our results suggest that afforestation plays a dominant role in increasing vegetation cover/greenness in Guangdong whereas the effects of land use/cover change on vegetation growth are subject to climatic conditions. Thus, a better understanding of terrestrial vegetation dynamics requires considering both climate and land use/cover changes. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dynamic projection of ecological risk in the Manas River basin based on terrain gradients
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With large-scale developments, the Manas River Basin (MRB) is in an extreme imbalance especially in land use, thus causing a series of ecological problems. A reliable dynamic ecological risk assessment is expected to provide useful information for the economic development. Through coupling spatial Cellular Automaton-Markov (CA-Markov) model and Landsat satellite images in 2000, 2008 and 2016, we forecasted the land use maps in 2024 and 2032. Based on the ecological risk model, we evaluated the ecological risk at landscape level from 2000 to 2032. More importantly, an improved evaluation of ecological risk was proposed based on terrain gradients and the correlation between terrain niche index (TNI) and future ecological risk was analyzed. The results showed that the artificial oases and urban are expanding, while the natural grassland is shrinking. Corresponding to the rapid development stage and stable consolidation stage, farmland will be followed by a slower increase (2016-2032) after a rapid increase (2000-2016), and water decreases first but then is projected to recover. As the overall spatial diversity increasing, the ecological risk in the whole basin is growing, especially in grassland. Compared with the stable critical state in artificial landscape, the future ecological risks in natural landscape tend to increase due to the cumulative effects of human activities. Also, we found that the great ecological risk mainly happens in "high altitude and complex terrain" or "low altitude and flat terrain" areas. The future ecological risk in medium terrain niche index (TNI) gradient will increase, while it will decrease in the lowest. Above all, the proposed framework can do well in forecasting ecological risk at landscape level, and can help simply infer the changes of ecological risk based on terrain. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping landscape-level hydrological connectivity of headwater wetlands to downstream waters: A geospatial modeling approach - Part 1
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Headwater wetlands affect ecosystem integrity of downstream waters; however, many wetlands - particularly geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) - continue to be at risk. A significant portion of US federal policy is based on the jurisdictional status of wetlands, which is partly determined by the relationship between wetlands and downstream waters, including the cumulative impact of wetlands on those waters. We present a novel multi- phase geospatial modeling method to help elucidate hydrological relationship between GIWs and downstream waters at the landscape scale. The presented approach in this study used inundation maps derived from time series remotely sensed data between 1985 and 2010, weather and hydrological records, and ancillary geospatial data including information from the US Fish and Wildlife Service NationalWetlands Inventory (NWI). The study site was a headwater catchment (292 km(2)) of the Choptank River Basin, located in the Mid- Atlantic region of USA, which contained a large number of Delmarva bays. The results showed inundation extent within GIWs varied, in aggregate, in response toweather variability (r=0.58; p-value=0.05), and waswell correlated with streamflow (r=0.81; p-value < 0.01) and base flow (r =0.57; p-value < 0.1) conditions. The relationship between inundation patterns and stream discharge also varied with NWI hydrologic modifiers. The GIWs with water regime characterized by longer durations of flooding exhibited stronger correlations with stream discharge, but those GIWs with shorter durations of flooding were less correlated with stream discharge. This analysis suggests themutual reliance (i.e., connection) of wetlands and streams on groundwater. GIWs appeared to function in aggregate, and it is likely that the combined effect of these wetlands significantly influenced the functioning of downstream waters. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

TI  - Mapping landscape-level hydrological connectivity of headwater wetlands to downstream waters: A catchment modeling approach - Part 2
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Part 1 of this two-part manuscript series, we presented an effective assessment method for mapping inundation of geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) and quantifying their cumulative landscape-scale hydrological connectivity with downstream waters using time series remotely sensed data (Yeo et al., 2018). This study suggested strong hydrological coupling between GIWs and downstream waters at the seasonal timescale via groundwater. This follow-on paper investigates the hydrological connectivity of GIWs with downstreamwaters and cumulativewatershed-scale hydrological impacts overmultiple time scales. Modificationsweremade to the representation ofwetland processes within the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT). A version ofSWATwith improved wetland function, SWAT-WET, was applied to Greensboro Watershed, which is located in the MidAtlantic Region of USA, to simulate hydrological processes over 1985-2015 under two contrasting land use scenarios (i. e., presence and absence of GIWs). Comparative analysis of simulation outputs elucidated how GIWs could influence partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration (ET) and terrestrial water storage, and affect water transport mechanisms and routing processes that generate streamflow. Model results showed that GIWs influenced the watershed water budget and stream flow generation processes over the long-term (30 year), inter-annual, andmonthly time scales. GIWs in the studywatershed increased terrestrialwater storage during the wet season, and buffered the dynamics of shallow groundwater during the dry season. The interannual modeling analysis illustrated that densely distributed GIWs can exert strong hydrological influence on downstream waters by regulating surface water runoff, while maintaining groundwater recharge and ET under changing (wetter) climate conditions. The study findings highlight the hydrological connectivity of GIWs with downstream waters and the cumulative hydrological influence of GIWs as hydrologic sources to downstream ecosystems through different runoff processes over multiple time scales.

TI  - Carbon flux phenology and net ecosystem productivity simulated by a bioclimatic index in an alpine steppe-meadow on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology is one of the main controls of variation in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Accurate representation of vegetation phenology is important for predicting ecosystem carbon budget. Although using satellite observation to determine vegetation phenology is becoming a mature option, there are still uncertainties in its application at site scales. Our purpose is to establish a more robust phenological index to accurately predict carbon uptake phenology, which detailed results can complement the shortcomings of MODIS NDVI-derived phenology. Here we used a growing season index (GSI) phenology model to simulate carbon flux phenology (CFP) including the start of carbon uptake (CUstart), the end of carbon uptake (CUend) and the length of carbon uptake period (CUP) in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau and to compare the results with those modeled from MODIS NDVI. We also further analyzed the main environmental factors in controlling CFP. The results indicated that the GSI model made substantially more precise prediction for CUstart, CUend and CUP (with higher correlation R-2 > 0.90) than that of the MODIS derived phenology. The GSI model was also superior to NDVI in predicting both seasonal and annual variations of net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Moreover, CUP played an important role in regulating ecosystem carbon balance in the study site because NEP was significantly positive correlated with the period of annual carbon uptake. NEP would increase by 1.63 g C m(-2) year(-1) if one CUP-day was extended. Further, CUP was influenced by variation in CUstart. Previously overlooked water variability (soil water content and VPD) played a significant role in controlling CUP and CUstart. In addition, temperature could enhance water stress to delay CUstart and shorten CUP. It is indicated that decrease in carbon uptake could be induced by accelerative water stress in the face of global warming in the alpine meadow. These results suggest that CFP is more sensitive to not only temperature but also water condition, and a combination of soil water and temperature could be a useful way to enhance the estimation of CFP in future ecosystem model.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon in a tropical rain forest in Gabon using remote sensing and GPS data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of biomass stocks in tropical forests is critical for climate change and ecosystem services studies. This research was conducted in a tropical rain forest located near the city of Libreville (the capital of Gabon), in the Akanda Peninsula. The forest cover was stratified in terms of mature, secondary and mangrove forests using Landsat-ETM data. A field inventory was conducted to measure the required basic forest parameters and estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon over the different forest classes. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data were used in combination with ground-based GPS measurements to derive forest heights. Finally, the relationships between the estimated heights and AGB were established and validated. Highest biomass stocks were found in the mature stands (223 +/- 37 MgC/ha), followed by the secondary forests (116 +/- 17 MgC/ha) and finally the mangrove forests (36 +/- 19 MgC/ha). Strong relationships were found between AGB and forest heights (R-2 > 0.85).

TI  - Free markets and feminism: the neo-liberal defence of the male breadwinner model in Britain, c. 1980-1997
T2  - WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Although neo-liberalism is often seen as a set of ideas that prioritises the individual, in fact, neo-liberals have always seen the traditional family as the critical social institution that is to be protected from the state and to be granted new freedoms by greater access to market opportunities. A male bread-winner model of economic life was therefore as central to the worldview of neo-liberalism as it was to post-war social democracy. How did the advocates of market liberalism on the British right conceptualise the shifts in gender norms that took place during the 1980s and 1990s? How far did they try to adapt their free market objectives to this new social reality and how far did they try to resist it? How did they react to the growing salience of feminist arguments and policies on the left of British politics, and in particular Labour's growing enthusiasm for a social democratic politics that integrated some feminist insights? This article investigates these questions through an examination of the political thought of Britain's market liberals. The picture that emerges is two-fold: in the first instance, a concerted, although unsuccessful, effort by the free market right to resist some of this social change, but secondly greater ideological success for neo-liberals with respect to the role that could legitimately be played by the state rather than the market in addressing the social challenges posed by shifting gender roles.

TI  - Minimal prognostic significance of sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with cT1-2 and cN0 breast cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe prognostic value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases may be minimized by the limited disease burden of lymph node metastases and tailoring adjuvant therapy based on breast cancer biology. The aim of this study is to assess the prognostic significance of SLN metastasis in patients with cT1-2N0M0 breast cancer.Patients and methodsBetween January 2006 and December 2015, 582 patients underwent SLN biopsy for cT1-2N0M0 breast cancers. cN0 was essentially diagnosed by ultrasound sonography. The prognostic values of SLN metastases were retrospectively evaluated.ResultsAmong 582 patients with cT1-2N0M0 breast cancer, 111 patients (19.1%) were positive for SLN metastasis, including 39 cases (6.7%) of micrometastasis and 72 cases (12.4%) of macrometastases. The median size of SLN metastasis was 3.0mm (range 0.2-16mm, mean 4.1mm). In log-rank test, presence of SLN metastasis was not associated with breast cancer recurrence (p=0.21); 5-year and 10-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 93.0% and 96.5%, and 93.0% and 90.4% in the SLN-positive and SLN-negative groups, respectively. In the propensity score matching cohort (n=178), there was no significant difference in RFS between the SLN-positive and SLN-negative groups (p=0.90). In Cox regression analysis, a continuous value of Ki67 expression was a significant prognostic factor (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p=0.017).ConclusionSLN metastasis has a minimal impact on RFS for patients with cT1-2N0M0 breast cancer in the modern medical era. A proliferation marker is a better factor for poor prognosis than the presence of SLN metastases in this population.

TI  - Rainfall retrieval and drought monitoring skill of satellite rainfall estimates in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based rainfall products are essential for retrieving rainfall, particularly in data-scarce and drought-prone countries like Ethiopia. However, their quality needs to be validated prior to their use. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations version 2.0 (CHIRPS), the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data version 3.0 (TAMSAT3), and the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) satellite rainfall estimates in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes Basin. Their skill of retrieval was evaluated against ground-measured rainfall at dekadal, monthly, and seasonal scales across agroclimatic zones over 2001 to 2017. Finally, these satellite products have demonstrated different levels of agreement with the reference data, being the highest for CHIRPS and the lowest for ARC2. At all timescales and agroclimatic zones, ARC2 has severely underestimated the actual rainfall while TAMSAT3 has persistently overestimated it. However, TAMSAT3 has demonstrated better performance than ARC2. Generally, except for its slightly larger dekadal false alarm ratio, CHIRPS has achieved the highest and most consistent agreement with the reference data at all the timescales and agroclimatic classes. Consequently, CHIRPS was further assessed for its suitability of drought monitoring, and it has exhibited promising skill in detecting specific historical drought events. Therefore, to overcome the scarcity of ground-measured rainfall data in the study area, we recommend the CHIRPS rainfall estimate to be used as an alternative data source for drought monitoring. Conversely, owing to its overestimation tendency, TAMSAT3 could be used for flood monitoring in this region. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Combining random forest and support vector machines for object-based rural-land-cover classification using high spatial resolution imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover classification using remote sensing imagery is an important part of environmental research because it provides baseline information for ecological vulnerability and risk assessment, disaster management, landscape conservation, local and regional planning, and so on. Rural-land-cover classification is challenging for both object-based image analysis methods and classifiers. The objective of this study is to improve the object-oriented classification accuracy of rural land cover by combining two models based on high spatial resolution imagery. We apply the C5.0 algorithm in R to combine support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RF) to create the model RS_C5.0. The effectiveness of the model combination is assessed by comparing the classification results with the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The comparisons are done based on the classification results of both the study area and the case area. Results show that in the classification of the study area, RF performs slightly better than SVM, and XGBoost performs worse than RF but better than SVM. However, in the classification of the case area, SVM performs slightly better than RF and both SVM and RF perform better than XGBoost. Furthermore, RS_C5.0 obtains the highest overall accuracies and kappa coefficients in the classifications of both the study area and the case area. In terms of training time, XGBoost runs the slowest in the classifications of both the study area and the case area. SVM and RF as well as the combined model (RS_C5.0) run much faster than XGBoost classifier. To summarize, the combination of SVM and RF classifiers using C5.0 algorithm is found to be a fast and effective way to improve rural-land-cover classification.

TI  - A 16-year record (2002-2017) of permafrost, active-layer, and meteorological conditions at the Samoylov Island Arctic permafrost research site, Lena River delta, northern Siberia: an opportunity to validate remote-sensing data and land surface, snow, and permafrost models
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the world's permafrost is located in the Arctic, where its frozen organic carbon content makes it a potentially important influence on the global climate system. The Arctic climate appears to be changing more rapidly than the lower latitudes, but observational data density in the region is low. Permafrost thaw and carbon release into the atmosphere, as well as snow cover changes, are positive feedback mechanisms that have the potential for climate warming. It is therefore particularly important to understand the links between the energy balance, which can vary rapidly over hourly to annual timescales, and permafrost conditions, which changes slowly on decadal to centennial timescales. This requires long-term observational data such as that available from the Samoylov research site in northern Siberia, where meteorological parameters, energy balance, and subsurface observations have been recorded since 1998. This paper presents the temporal data set produced between 2002 and 2017, explaining the instrumentation, calibration, processing, and data quality control. Furthermore, we present a merged data set of the parameters, which were measured from 1998 onwards. Additional data include a high-resolution digital terrain model (DTM) obtained from terrestrial lidar laser scanning. Since the data provide observations of temporally variable parameters that influence energy fluxes between permafrost, active-layer soils, and the atmosphere (such as snow depth and soil moisture content), they are suitable for calibrating and quantifying the dynamics of permafrost as a component in earth system models. The data also include soil properties beneath different microtopographic features (a polygon centre, a rim, a slope, and a trough), yielding much-needed information on landscape heterogeneity for use in land surface modelling.For the record from 1998 to 2017, the average mean annual air temperature was -12.3 degrees C, with mean monthly temperature of the warmest month (July) recorded as 9.5 degrees C and for the coldest month (February) -32.7 degrees C. The average annual rainfall was 169 mm. The depth of zero annual amplitude is at 20.75 m. At this depth, the temperature has increased from -9.1 degrees C in 2006 to -7.7 degrees C in 2017.The presented data are freely available through the PANGAEA (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.891142) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/2223709, last access: 6 February 2019) websites.

TI  - The Cloud_cci simulator v1.0 for the Cloud_cci climate data record and its application to a global and a regional climate model
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud Climate Change Initiative (Cloud_cci) satellite simulator has been developed to enable comparisons between the Cloud_cci climate data record (CDR) and climate models. The Cloud_cci simulator is applied here to the EC-Earth global climate model as well as the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) regional climate model. We demonstrate the importance of using a satellite simulator that emulates the retrieval process underlying the CDR as opposed to taking the model output directly. The impact of not sampling the model at the local overpass time of the polar-orbiting satellites used to make the dataset was shown to be large, yielding up to 100% error in liquid water path (LWP) simulations in certain regions. The simulator removes all clouds with optical thickness smaller than 0.2 to emulate the Cloud_cci CDR's lack of sensitivity to very thin clouds. This reduces total cloud fraction (TCF) globally by about 10% for EC-Earth and by a few percent for RACMO over Europe. Globally, compared to the Cloud_cci CDR, EC-Earth is shown to be mostly in agreement on the distribution of clouds and their height, but it generally underestimates the high cloud fraction associated with tropical convection regions, and overestimates the occurrence and height of clouds over the Sahara and the Arabian subcontinent. In RACMO, TCF is higher than retrieved over the northern Atlantic Ocean but lower than retrieved over the European continent, where in addition the cloud top pressure (CTP) is underestimated. The results shown here demonstrate again that a simulator is needed to make meaningful comparisons between modeled and retrieved cloud properties. It is promising to see that for (nearly) all cloud properties the simulator improves the agreement of the model with the satellite data.

TI  - Improving estimates of district HIV prevalence and burden in South Africa using small area estimation techniques
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries, including South Africa, have implemented population-based household surveys to estimate HIV prevalence and the burden of HIV infection. Most household HIV surveys are designed to provide reliable estimates down to only the first subnational geopolitical level which, in South Africa, is composed of nine provinces. However HIV prevalence estimates are needed down to at least the second subnational level in order to better target the delivery of HIV care, treatment and prevention services. The second subnational level in South Africa is composed of 52 districts. Achieving adequate precision at the second subnational level therefore requires either a substantial increase in survey sample size or use of model-based estimation capable of incorporating other pre-existing data. Our purpose is demonstration of the efficacy of relatively simple small-area estimation of HIV prevalence in the 52 districts of South Africa using data from the South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Behavior Survey, 2012, district-level HIV prevalence estimates obtained from testing of pregnant women who attended antenatal care (ANC) clinics in 2012, and 2012 demographic data. The best-fitting model included only ANC prevalence and dependency ratio as out-of-survey predictors. Our key finding is that ANC prevalence was the superior auxiliary covariate, and provided substantially improved precision in many district-level estimates of HIV prevalence in the general population. Inclusion of a district-level spatial simultaneously autoregressive covariance structure did not result in improved estimation.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-2 MSI in Arctic Research: Evaluating the Performance of Atmospheric Correction Approaches Over Arctic Sea Ice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing may be a powerful tool for areal retrieval of biogeophysical parameters in the Arctic sea ice. The MultiSpectral Instrument on board the Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites of the European Space Agency offers new possibilities for Arctic research; S-2A and S-2B provide 13 spectral bands between 443 and 2,202 nm and spatial resolutions between 10 and 60 m, which may enable the monitoring of large areas of Arctic sea ice. For an accurate retrieval of parameters such as surface albedo, the elimination of atmospheric influences in the data is essential. We therefore provide an evaluation of five currently available atmospheric correction processors for S-2 (ACOLITE, ATCOR, iCOR, Polymer, and Sen2Cor). We evaluate the results of the different processors using in situ spectral measurements of ice and snow and open water gathered north of Svalbard during RV Polarstern cruise PS106.1 in summer 2017. We used spectral shapes to assess performance for ice and snow surfaces. For open water, we additionally evaluated intensities. ACOLITE, ATCOR, and iCOR performed well over sea ice and Polymer generated the best results over open water. ATCOR, iCOR and Sen2Cor failed in the image-based retrieval of atmospheric parameters (aerosol optical thickness, water vapor). ACOLITE estimated AOT within the uncertainty range of AERONET measurements. Parameterization based on external data, therefore, was necessary to obtain reliable results. To illustrate consequences of processor selection on secondary products we computed average surface reflectance of six bands and normalized difference melt index (NDMI) on an image subset. Medians of average reflectance and NDMI range from 0.80-0.97 to 0.12-0.18 while medians for TOA are 0.75 and 0.06, respectively.

TI  - Assessment of the effectiveness of BG-Sentinel traps baited with CO<sub>2</sub> and BG-Lure for the surveillance of vector mosquitoes in Miami-Dade County, Florida
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are an increasing issue to public health, endangering billions of people worldwide. Controlling vector mosquitoes is widely accepted as the most effective way to prevent vector-borne disease outbreaks. Mosquito surveillance is critical for the development of control strategies under the integrated vector management framework. We hypothesize that the effectiveness and reliability of using BG-Sentinel traps for the surveillance strongly depend on the bait used to attract mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of BG-Sentinel traps baited with CO2 and BG-Lure. A total of 72 traps were deployed for 48 hours once a week for four weeks. For the initial 24-hour period, the traps were baited with CO2, and then for an additional 24 hours using the BG-Lure. Collected mosquitoes were analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation for repeated measures analysis. Biodiversity was assessed by the Shannon and Simpson indices and by individual rarefaction curves and SHE profiles. A total of 5,154 mosquitoes were collected, from which 3,514 by traps baited with CO2 and 1,640 mosquitoes by traps baited with BG-Lure. Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were the most abundant and dominant species. Results from the Generalized Estimating Equation models indicated that more than twice as many mosquitoes were attracted CO2 than to the BG-Lure. The comparison of attractiveness of CO2 and BG-Lure to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus was non-significant, suggesting that both species were equally attracted by the baits. The individual rarefaction curves for Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus imply that traps baited with BG-Lure underestimated mosquito species richness compared to those baited with CO2. BG-Lure were less effective in attracting mosquitoes with low abundances and failed to collect Cx. coronator and Cx. nigripalpus, which were consistently collected by traps baited with CO2. According to our results, CO2 significantly (P< 0.05) attracted more mosquitoes (2.67 adjusted odds ratios) than the BG-Lure when adjusted for time and species, being more effective in assessing the relative abundance of vector mosquitoes and yielding more trustworthy results. Traps baited with CO2 collected not only more specimens, but also more species in a more consistent pattern.

TI  - Estimation of the effective reproduction number of influenza based on weekly reports in Miyazaki Prefecture
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Japan, as part of surveillance for seasonal influenza, the number of patients per influenza sentinel site is counted on a weekly basis. Currently, reference values are set for the weekly reported number of influenza cases per sentinel, and pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are issued based on these values. In this study, we examined the association between these reference values and the effective reproduction number (R-t) using surveillance data for Miyazaki Prefecture collected from 2010 to 2011. There are nine public health centre jurisdictions in this prefecture, and R-t exceeded 1.0 at the time when pre-epidemic warnings were issued in almost all the jurisdictions. Thus, it was indicated that the validity of the reference value was also high for influenza transmission. However, our results indicated the presence of secondary epidemic caused by infections originating both from other jurisdictions and inner jurisdictions, and it is occasionally not possible to evaluate the end of an epidemic in a jurisdiction using only the reference value of termination. It is necessary to establish new methods after considering the situation in the surrounding jurisdictions for more detailed epidemic predictions.

TI  - Complex networks reveal global pattern of extreme-rainfall teleconnections
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic observables are often correlated across long spatial distances, and extreme events, such as heatwaves or floods, are typically assumed to be related to such teleconnections(1,2). Revealing atmospheric teleconnection patterns and understanding their underlying mechanisms is of great importance for weather forecasting in general and extreme-event prediction in particular(3,4), especially considering that the characteristics of extreme events have been suggested to change under ongoing anthropogenic climate change(5-8). Here we reveal the global coupling pattern of extreme-rainfall events by applying complex-network methodology to high-resolution satellite data and introducing a technique that corrects for multiple-comparison bias in functional networks. We find that the distance distribution of significant connections (P < 0.005) around the globe decays according to a power law up to distances of about 2,500 kilometres. For longer distances, the probability of significant connections is much higher than expected from the scaling of the power law. We attribute the shorter, power-law-distributed connections to regional weather systems. The longer, super-power-law-distributed connections form a global rainfall teleconnection pattern that is probably controlled by upper-level Rossby waves. We show that extreme-rainfall events in the monsoon systems of south-central Asia, east Asia and Africa are significantly synchronized. Moreover, we uncover concise links between south-central Asia and the European and North American extratropics, as well as the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Analysis of the atmospheric conditions that lead to these teleconnections confirms Rossby waves as the physical mechanism underlying these global teleconnection patterns and emphasizes their crucial role in dynamical tropical-extratropical couplings. Our results provide insights into the function of Rossby waves in creating stable, global-scale dependencies of extreme-rainfall events, and into the potential predictability of associated natural hazards.

TI  - A benchmark for testing the accuracy and computational cost of shortwave top-of-atmosphere reflectance calculations in clear-sky aerosol-laden atmospheres
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate calculations of shortwave reflectances in clear-sky aerosol-laden atmospheres are necessary for various applications in atmospheric sciences. However, computational cost becomes increasingly important for some applications such as data assimilation of top-of-atmosphere reflectances in models of atmospheric composition. This study aims to provide a benchmark that can help in assessing these two requirements in combination. We describe a protocol and input data for 44 080 cases involving various solar and viewing geometries, four different surfaces (one oceanic bidirectional reflectance function and three albedo values for a Lambertian surface), eight aerosol optical depths, five wavelengths, and four aerosol types. We first consider two models relying on the discrete ordinate method: VLIDORT (in vector and scalar configurations) and DISORT (scalar configuration only). We use VLIDORT in its vector configuration as a reference model and quantify the loss of accuracy due to (i) neglecting the effect of polarization in DISORT and VLIDORT (scalar) models and (ii) decreasing the number of streams in DISORT. We further test two other models: the 6SV2 model, relying on the successive orders of scattering method, and Forward-Lobe Two-Stream Radiance Model (FLOTSAM), a new model under development by two of the authors. Typical mean fractional errors of 2.8% and 2.4% for 6SV2 and FLOTSAM are found, respectively. Computational cost depends on the input parameters but also on the code implementation and application as some models solve the radiative transfer equations for a range of geometries while others do not. All necessary input and output data are provided as a Supplement as a potential resource for interested developers and users of radiative transfer models.

TI  - Delineating Site-Specific Management Zones and Evaluating Soil Water Temporal Dynamics in a Farmer's Field in Kentucky
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to spatial variability of soil genesis, topography, and resulting soil properties in farmers' fields, soil and crop processes vary in space and time. Therefore, optimum rates and timing of resource applications, such as nutrients and irrigation water, may vary as well. It remains a challenge to quantify the spatial variability of a field and to identify effective ways to manage fields in a site-specific manner. The objective of this study was to delineate management zones within a farmer's field based on relatively easily obtainable information that is statistically integrated. Moreover, soil water temporal dynamics should be evaluated regarding their spatial differences in different zones. The set of direct and indirect observations included clay and silt content, apparent electrical conductivity, soil chemical properties (pH; organic matter; and total N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn), satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and lidar-based topographic variables in a western Kentucky field. Several key variables and their capability to describe spatial crop yield variability were identified by using principal component analysis: soil clay content, slope, soil organic matter content, topographic wetness index, and NDVI. Two types of cluster analysis were applied to delineate management zones. The cluster analyses revealed that two to three zones was the optimal number of classes based on different criteria. Delineated zones were evaluated and revealed significant differences in corn (Zea mays L.) yield and temporally different soil moisture dynamics. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed procedure to delineate a farmer's field into zones based on spatially varying soil and crop properties that should be considered for irrigation management.

TI  - Tracking Rift Valley fever: From Mali to Europe and other countries, 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On 16 September 2016, the World Health Organization confirmed a Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Niger. Epidemiological surveillance was reinforced among the French Armed Forces deployed in Niger and bordering countries: Chad, Mali and Burkina Faso. On 26 October, a probable case of RVF was reported in a service member sampled in Mali 3 weeks earlier. At the time the result was reported, the patient was on vacation on Martinique. An epidemiological investigation was conducted to confirm this case and identify other cases. Finally, the case was not confirmed, but three suspected cases of RVF were confirmed using serological and molecular testing. RVF viral RNA was detectable in whole blood for 57 and 67 days after onset of symptoms for two cases, although it was absent from plasma and serum. At the time of diagnosis, these cases had already returned from Mali to Europe. The infectivity of other arboviruses in whole blood has already been highlighted. That RVF virus has been detected in whole blood that long after the onset of symptoms (67 days) raises the question of its potential prolonged infectivity. Because of exposure to tropical infectious diseases during deployment, military populations could import emerging pathogens to Europe.

TI  - A maximum curvature method for estimating epidemic onset of seasonal influenza in Japan
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDetecting the onset of influenza epidemic is important for epidemiological surveillance and for investigating the factors driving spatiotemporal transmission patterns. Most approaches define the epidemic onset based on thresholds, which use subjective criteria and are specific to individual surveillance systems.MethodsWe applied the empirical threshold method (ETM), together with two non-thresholding methods, including the maximum curvature method (MCM) that we proposed and the segmented regression method (SRM), to determine onsets of influenza epidemics in each prefecture of Japan, using sentinel surveillance data of influenza-like illness (ILI) from 2012/2013 through 2017/2018. Performance of the MCM and SRM was evaluated, in terms of epidemic onset, end, and duration, with those derived from the ETM using the nationwide epidemic onset indicator of 1.0 ILI case per sentinel per week.ResultsThe MCM and SRM yielded complete estimates for each of Japan's 47 prefectures. In contrast, ETM estimates for Kagoshima during 2012/2013 and for Okinawa during all six influenza seasons, except 2013/2014, were invalid. The MCM showed better agreement in all estimates with the ETM than the SRM (R-2=0.82, p<0.001 vs. R-2=0.34, p<0.001 for epidemic onset; R-2=0.18, p<0.001 vs. R-2=0.05, p<0.001 for epidemic end; R-2=0.28, p<0.001 vs. R-2<0.01, p=0.35 for epidemic duration). Prefecture-specific thresholds for epidemic onset and end were established using the MCM.ConclusionsThe Japanese national epidemic onset threshold is not applicable to all prefectures, particularly Okinawa. The MCM could be used to establish prefecture-specific epidemic thresholds that faithfully characterize influenza activity, serving as useful complements to the influenza surveillance system in Japan.

TI  - Grass and tree cover responses to intra-seasonal rainfall variability vary along a rainfall gradient in African tropical grassy biomes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although it is well known that mean annual rainfall (MAR) and rainfall seasonality have a key role in influencing the distribution of tree and grass cover in African tropical grassy biomes (TGBs), the impact of intra-seasonal rainfall variability on these distributions is less agreed upon. Since the prevalent mechanisms determining biome occurrence and distribution change with MAR, this research investigates the role of intra-seasonal rainfall variability for three different MAR ranges, assessing satellite data on grass and tree cover, rainfall and fire intervals at a sub-continental scale in sub-Saharan Africa. For MAR below 630 mm y(-1), rainfall frequency had a positive relationship with grass cover; this relationship however became mostly negative at intermediate MAR (630-1200 mm y(-1)), where tree cover correspondingly mostly increased with rainfall frequency. In humid TGBs, tree cover decreased with rainfall intensity. Overall, intra-seasonal rainfall variability plays a role in determining vegetation cover, especially in mesic TGBs, where the relative dominance of trees and grasses has previously been largely unexplained. Importantly, the direction of the effect of intra-seasonal variability changes with MAR. Given the predicted increases in rainfall intensity in Africa as a consequence of climate change, the effects on TGBs are thus likely to vary depending on the MAR levels.

TI  - Leads and ridges in Arctic sea ice from RGPS data and a new tracking algorithm
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leads and pressure ridges are dominant features of the Arctic sea ice cover. Not only do they affect heat loss and surface drag, but they also provide insight into the underlying physics of sea ice deformation. Due to their elongated shape they are referred to as linear kinematic features (LKFs). This paper introduces two methods that detect and track LKFs in sea ice deformation data and establish an LKF data set for the entire observing period of the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). Both algorithms are available as open-source code and applicable to any gridded sea ice drift and deformation data. The LKF detection algorithm classifies pixels with higher deformation rates compared to the immediate environment as LKF pixels, divides the binary LKF map into small segments, and reconnects multiple segments into individual LKFs based on their distance and orientation relative to each other. The tracking algorithm uses sea ice drift information to estimate a first guess of LKF distribution and identifies tracked features by the degree of overlap between detected features and the first guess. An optimization of the parameters of both algorithms, as well as an extensive evaluation of both algorithms against handpicked features in a reference data set, is presented. A LKF data set is derived from RGPS deformation data for the years from 1996 to 2008 that enables a comprehensive description of LKFs. LKF densities and LKF intersection angles derived from this data set agree well with previous estimates. Further, a stretched exponential distribution of LKF length, an exponential tail in the distribution of LKF lifetimes, and a strong link to atmospheric drivers, here Arctic cyclones, are derived from the data set. Both algorithms are applied to output of a numerical sea ice model to compare the LKF intersection angles in a high-resolution Arctic sea ice simulation with the LKF data set.

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer patients with suspicious axillary lymph node (ALN) at ultrasound and positive fine-needle aspiration (FNA) results were required to receive ALN dissection (ALND), which was not certain in the post-ACOSOG Z0011 era. We aim to evaluate the ALN metastasis burden in these patients, thus to illustrate whether they can follow the ACOSOG Z0011 trial procedure.MethodsClinically, T1-2N0 breast cancer patients with positive preoperative ALN biopsy (FNA group) or 1-2 positive sentinel nodes (SLNB group) were retrospectively analyzed. ALN metastasis burden was compared between the two groups, which were further analyzed in certain subtypes. An association between clinicopathological factors and 3 ALN metastasis was also analyzed.ResultsA total of 388 patients were included: 202 in the FNA group and 186 in the SLNB group. The FNA group had a significantly higher number of positive ALN (5.18 vs. 1.77, P<0.001) and a larger proportion of patients with 3 ALN metastasis (58.42% vs. 11.83%, P<0.001) than the SLNB group, which was not influenced by different tumor size stage and molecular subtypes. ALN metastasis identified by FNA was independently associated with a high rate of 3 ALN metastasis (OR=6.98, 95% CI 1.95-25.02, P=0.003).ConclusionsPatients with positive preoperative ALN biopsy had a higher ALN metastasis burden than patients with 1-2 positive SLNs, which was also the strongest factor associated with 3 ALN metastasis, indicating that these patients are not appropriate to receive SLNB in the post-ACOSOG Z0011 trial era.

However, despite yearly application of hundreds of approved pesticides in agricultural fields, only a minor fraction of these organic compounds were actually detected in honey and beeswax samples. This observation has led us to question the general suitability of beehive products as a sentinel for synthetic organic pesticides applied in the field. The aim of the present study was to experimentally determine the distribution (logarithmic ratio of beeswax to honey pesticide concentration, LogD) and depletion kinetics (half-life) of selected pesticides in honey and beeswax as a measure of the latter matrixes to serve as a pesticide sentinel. The obtained parameters were used to extrapolate to pesticide burden in honey and beeswax samples collected from German and Israeli apiaries. In addition, we aimed to establish a mathematical model, enabling us to predict distribution of selected pesticides between honey to beeswax, by utilizing simple substance descriptors, namely, octanol/water partitioning coefficient, molar weight and Henry coefficient. Based on the present results, it appears that pesticides with LogD values > 1 and half-life in beeswax > 1 day, were likely to accumulate and detected in beeswax samples, and less likely to be found in honey. On the other hand, pesticides with negative LogD values were highly likely to be found in honey and less so in beeswax samples. Finally, pesticides with LogD values between 0-1 were expected to be found in both matrixes. The developed model was successfully applied to predict LogD values, thereby identifying octanol/water partitioning and molar weight as the most prominent substance descriptors, which affect pesticide distribution between honey and beeswax.

TI  - Multiple drivers of plant diversity in coastal dunes: A Mediterranean experience
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the global biodiversity loss, syntheses of the available knowledge about drivers of biodiversity are becoming increasingly important. However, despite the high number of studies analyzing patterns of plant species diversity, few attempts have been made to synthesize findings within different ecosystems. In this work, the relative role of a wide set of predictors imputable to three conceptual-methodological domains (abiotic, human-mediated disturbance and landscape domain, hereafter AD, DD and LD) was simultaneously analyzed in 644 random plots distributed along the coastal dunes of Central Italy. Native species richness and focal species cover, both field-recorded, were used as response variables. Predictors pertaining to the three domains were derived from both field surveys and high-resolution remotely sensed imagery (LiDAR and orthophotos). To test how AD, DD and LD affect native species richness and focal species cover, a GLM and a linear model were fitted respectively. The three domains were then ranked according to their relative importance.Although the role of the three domains was always significant, they turned out to unequally contribute to the explanation of native species richness and focal species cover patterns. For Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems, AD appears to be the key biodiversity driver, followed by DD and LD. Our results suggest that as long as human disturbance is limited, plant diversity will distribute according to species abiotic tolerances, regardless of habitat loss and fragmentation per se. Representing a first effort towards a synthesis of plant diversity drivers in coastal dunes, this work points to the importance, in Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems, of zonation dynamics, whose occurrence should be addressed as a priority issue by efficient conservations strategies.

TI  - Optimal estimation retrieval for directional polarimetric camera onboard Chinese Gaofen-5 satellite: an analysis on multi-angle dependence and a posteriori error
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the directional polarimetric camera (DPC) instrument onboard Chinese Gaofen-5 satellite dedicated to aerosol monitoring have been available recently. By measuring the spectral, angular and polarization properties of the radiance at the top of atmosphere (TOA), a DPC provides the aerosol optical depths (AODs) as well as partial microphysical aerosol properties. In order to evaluate the capability and the retrieval uncertainty of DPC sensor systematically, the information content and a posteriori error analysis are applied to the synthetic data of DPC multi-angle observation in this paper, which inherits from the optimal estimate theoretical framework. The forward simulation is conducted by the unified linearized vector radiative transfer model (UNL-VRTM), and the Jacobians of four Stokes elements with respect to aerosol and surface model parameters can be obtained simultaneously. Firstly, the error influences of surface parameter on the TOA measurements are simulated. The results indicate that a 10% relative error of parameter k(1) in the improved BRDF model results in about 4.65% error of the TOA reflectance, while the error of TOA polarized reflectance caused by the same error of parameter C in BPDF model is negligibly small. Secondly, the multi-angle dependence of total information content in DPC measurements is investigated. It is shown that the information content increases significantly with the number of viewing angles, especially for the measurements of the first 9 angles. The DPC multi-angle observation can provide extra 5 degrees of freedom for signal (DFS) for the retrieval of aerosol and surface parameters, in which the retrieval of aerosol parameters is more sensitive to observation geometries than the retrieval of surface parameters in most cases. In addition, the total aerosol DFS increases with the range extension of scattering angle under the same number of viewing angles. After that, the DFS of each retrieved aerosol and surface parameter are given. For the aerosols, the volume concentration, real-part refractive index and effective radius show a high DFS (greater than 0.8). For the surfaces, the mean DFS of each parameter is greater than 0.5, which indicates the well capability of DPC in the surface retrieval. Finally, the a posteriori error of each aerosol, surface parameter and corresponding vary with the number of viewing angles, and the observation error and aerosol model error are discussed. The a posteriori error decrease significantly with the number of viewing angles, and the influence of the aerosol model error on the a posteriori error is not remarkable. In general, the observation error is the main influence factor on the uncertainty of the inversion results.

TI  - Accurate Clinical Diagnosis of Liver Cancer Based on Simultaneous Detection of Ternary Specific Antigens by Magnetic Induced Mixing Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Emissions
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing an accurate, simple, and rapid serodiagnosis method aiming for specific cancer antigens is critically important for the clinical diagnosis, therapy, and prognostication of cancer. Currently, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) readout techniques challenge fluorescent-based detection methods in terms of both optical stability and more importantly multiple detection capability, which become more desirable for clinical diagnostics. We thus started using an interference-free mixing SERS emission (m-SERS) readout to simultaneously indicate, for the first time, three specific liver cancer antigens, including a-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and ferritin (FER), even in one clinical serum sample. Here, three triple bonds (C  N and C  C) coded SERS tags contribute separate SERS emissions located at 2105, 2159, and 2227 cm(-1), respectively; must have one-to-one correspondence from AFP, to FER, to CEA, In the process of detection, the mature double antibody sandwich allows the formation of microscale core-satellite assembly structure between a magnetic bead (MB) and single SERS tags, and therefore a pure and single SERS emission can be observed under the routine excitation laser spot. Because of the action of magnetic force, the uniform 3D packing of SERS tags absorbed MBs will in contrast generate a so-called m-SERS signals. With the help of enrichment and separation by MBs, the proposed m-SERS immunoassay provides an extremely rapid, sensitive, and accurate solution for multiplex detection of antigens or other biomarkers. Herein, the limit of detection (LOD) for simultaneous m-SERS detection of AFP, CEA, and FER was 0.15, 20, and 4 pg/mL, respectively. As expected for 39 clinical serum samples, simultaneous detection of ternary specific antigens can significantly improve the accuracy of liver cancer diagnosis.

TI  - Preoperative Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer using Radiomics Features of DCE-MRI
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and noninvasive preoperative prediction of the state of the axillary lymph nodes is significant for breast cancer staging, therapy and the prognosis of patients. In this study, we analyzed the possibility of axillary lymph node metastasis directly based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast in cancer patients. After mass segmentation and feature analysis, the SVM, KNN, and LDA three classifiers were used to distinguish the axillary lymph node state in 5-fold cross-validation. The results showed that the effect of the SVM classifier in predicting breast axillary lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than that of the KNN classifier and LDA classifier. The SVM classifier performed best, with the highest accuracy of 89.54%, and obtained an AUC of 0.8615 for identifying the lymph node status. Each feature was analyzed separately and the results showed that the effect of feature combination was obviously better than that of any individual feature on its own.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present numerical simulations and analysis of atmospheric effects of a beam of 1 MeV electrons precipitating in the upper atmosphere from above. Beam parameters of 100 J or 1 kJ injected in 100 ms or 1 s were chosen to reflect the current design requirements for a realistic mission. We calculate ionization signatures and optical emissions in the atmosphere, and estimate the detectability of optical signatures using photometers and cameras on the ground. Results show that both instruments should be able to detect the beam spot. Chemical simulations show that the production of odd nitrogen and odd hydrogen are minimal. We use electrostatic field simulations to show that the beam-induced electron density column can enhance thunderstorm electric fields at high altitudes enough to facilitate sprite triggering. Finally, we calculate signatures that would be observed by incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and subionospheric VLF remote sensing techniques, although the latter is hindered by the limitations of 2D simulations.

TI  - Employment of GIS techniques to assess the long-term impact of tillage on the soil organic carbon of agricultural fields under hyper-arid conditions
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A study on six 50 ha agricultural fields was conducted to investigate the effect of conservation tillage practices on the long-term (1990-2016) changes in the soil organic carbon (SOC) content of the topsoil layers (0-10 cm) of agricultural fields. The experimental fields were selected from the 49 fields of the Tawdeehiya Arable Farm (TAF), located 200 kilometers southeast of Riyadh, the capital city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data sets from laboratory determined SOC and the corresponding Landsat images generated vegetation indices, namely, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Bare Soil Index (BSI), were utilized for the prediction of SOC using multivariate regression techniques. Long-term changes in the SOC content of the experimental fields, as a result of different tillage practices, were also studied. The developed SOC prediction models exhibited high accuracy indicated by R-2 values ranging from 0.73 to 0.85, RMSE values of 0.34 to 0.85 g kg(-1) and P-values of less than 0.0001. The cross-validation results (R-2 of 0.61-0.70, RMSE value of 0.34-0.85 g kg(-1) and P-values of less than 0.0001) confirmed the high accuracy of the developed SOC prediction models. Results also revealed that the change in the SOC content was clearly associated with soil tillage practices. On the average, 76% of the all agricultural fields in the experimental farm showed a decrease of up to 24 g kg(-1) in their SOC content after 10 years (1990-2000) of continuous conventional tillage practices. On the other hand, an average increase of up to 37 g kg(-1) in the SOC content was observed in 88% of the studied fields at the end of the study period (2016), where conservation tillage was a continous and consistent practice in the experimental farm.

TI  - Mapping pan-Arctic landfast sea ice stability using Sentinel-1 interferometry
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic landfast sea ice has undergone substantial changes in recent decades, affecting ice stability and including potential impacts on ice travel by coastal populations and on industry ice roads. We present a novel approach for evaluating landfast sea ice stability on a pan-Arctic scale using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR). Using Sentinel-1 images from spring 2017, we discriminate between bottomfast, stabilized, and nonstabilized landfast ice over the main marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean (Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara seas). This approach draws on the evaluation of relative changes in interferometric fringe patterns. This first comprehensive assessment of Arctic bottomfast sea ice extent has revealed that most of the bottomfast sea ice is situated around river mouths and coastal shallows. The Laptev and East Siberian seas dominate the aerial extent, covering roughly 4100 and 5100 km(2), respectively. These seas also contain the largest extent of stabilized and nonstabilized landfast ice, but are subject to the largest uncertainties surrounding the mapping scheme. Even so, we demonstrate the potential for using InSAR for assessing the stability of landfast ice in several key regions around the Arctic, providing a new understanding of how stability may vary between regions. InSAR-derived stability may serve for strategic planning and tactical decision support for different uses of coastal ice. In a case study of the Nares Strait, we demonstrate that interferograms may reveal early-warning signals for the breakup of stationary sea ice.

TI  - A cloud identification algorithm over the Arctic for use with AATSR-SLSTR measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification of the presence of cloud in the ground scenes observed by remote-sensing satellites is an end in itself. The lack of knowledge of cloud at high latitudes increases the error and uncertainty in the evaluation and assessment of the changing impact of aerosol and cloud in a warming climate. A prerequisite for the accurate retrieval of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is the knowledge of the presence of cloud in a ground scene.In our study, observations of the upwelling radiance in the visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) and the thermal infrared (TIR), coupled with solar extraterrestrial irradiance, are used to determine the reflectance. We have developed a new cloud identification algorithm for application to the reflectance observations of the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) on European Space Agency (ESA)-Envisat and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-3A and -3B. The resultant AATSR-SLSTR cloud identification algorithm (ASCIA) addresses the requirements for the study AOT at high latitudes and utilizes time-series measurements. It is assumed that cloud-free surfaces have unchanged or little changed patterns for a given sampling period, whereas cloudy or partly cloudy scenes show much higher variability in space and time. In this method, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) parameter is used to measure the "stability" of the atmosphere-surface system observed by satellites. The cloud-free surface is classified by analysing the PCC values on the block scale 25 x 25 km(2). Subsequently, the reflection at 3.7 mu m is used for accurate cloud identification at scene level: with areas of either 1 x 1 or 0.5 x 0.5 km(2). The ASCIA data product has been validated by comparison with independent observations, e.g. surface synoptic observations (SYNOP), the data from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and the following satellite products: (i) the ESA standard cloud product from AATSR L2 nadir cloud flag; (ii) the product from a method based on a clear-snow spectral shape developed at IUP Bremen (Istomina et al., 2010), which we call ISTO; and (iii) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) products. In comparison to ground-based SYNOP measurements, we achieved a promising agreement better than 95% and 83% within +/- 2 and +/- 1 okta respectively. In general, ASCIA shows an improved performance in comparison to other algorithms applied to AATSR measurements for the identification of clouds in a ground scene observed at high latitudes.

TI  - Analysis of Landsat-derived multitemporal vegetation cover to understand drivers of oasis agroecosystems change
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oasis agroecosystems monitoring plays a significant role in the economic development, sustainable management, and policy-making of arid and Saharan regions. The aims of this study are to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of oasis vegetation and discuss possible driving forces of changes. This analysis employed field and ancillary data, geographic information system, Landsat imagery, and remote-sensing techniques. Minimum noise fraction is used for endmembers extraction, and spectral mixture analysis is applied to each image to extract vegetation fraction, which is used as an indicator of change. Change detection is performed in six oases in south-eastern Morocco over eight separate periods from 1984 to 2017 using Landsat data. The pattern of the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation cover is analyzed using time-and space-oriented change detection algorithms. Results indicate that the Mezguita, Tinzouline, and Ternata oases had an evenly distributed and constant expansion during the last three decades (of similar to 41.35%), whereas the oases of Fezouata and Ktaoua presented low expansion and randomly distributed change (similar to 29%). However, the vegetation cover of M'Hamid oasis decreased by 23% over the studied period. The results show that spectral mixture analysis yields high accuracies for oasis vegetation extraction in arid areas and accounts for mixed pixel issues. The results are discussed considering also climate and socioeconomic factors, showing that the driving forces of these dynamics are primarily anthropogenic.

TI  - Estimating daily evapotranspiration based on a model of evaporative fraction (EF) for mixed pixels
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, applications of remote sensing evapotranspiration (ET) products are limited by the coarse resolution of satellite remote sensing data caused by land surface heterogeneities and the temporal-scale extrapolation of the instantaneous latent heat flux (LE) based on satellite overpass time. This study proposes a simple but efficient model (EFAF) for estimating the daily ET of remotely sensed mixed pixels using a model of the evaporative fraction (EF) and area fraction (AF) to increase the accuracy of ET estimate over heterogeneous land surfaces. To accomplish this goal, we derive an equation for calculating the EF of mixed pixels based on two key hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 states that the available energy (AE) of each sub-pixel is approximately equal to that of any other sub-pixels in the same mixed pixel within an acceptable margin of error and is equivalent to the AE of the mixed pixel. This approach simplifies the equation, and uncertainties and errors related to the estimated ET values are minor. Hypothesis 2 states that the EF of each sub-pixel is equal to that of the nearest pure pixel(s) of the same land cover type. This equation is designed to correct spatial-scale errors for the EF of mixed pixels; it can be used to calculate daily ET from daily AE data. The model was applied to an artificial oasis located in the midstream area of the Heihe River using HJ-1B satellite data with a 300m resolution. The results generated before and after making corrections were compared and validated using site data from eddy covariance systems. The results show that the new model can significantly improve the accuracy of daily ET estimates relative to the lumped method; the coefficient of determination (R-2) increased to 0.82 from 0.62, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased to 1.60 from 2.47 MJm(-2)(decreased approximately to 0.64 from 0.99 mm) and the mean bias error (MBE) decreased from 1.92 to 1.18 MJm(-2) (decreased from approximately 0.77 to 0.47 mm). It is concluded that EFAF can reproduce daily ET with reasonable accuracy; can be used to produce the ET product; and can be applied to hydrology research, precision agricultural management and monitoring natural ecosystems in the future.

TI  - Geographical heterogeneity in prevalence of subclinical malaria infections at sentinel endemic sites of Myanmar
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The malaria burden of Myanmar still remains high within the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia. An important indicator of progress towards malaria elimination is the prevalence of parasite infections in endemic populations. Information about malaria epidemiology is mostly derived from reports of confirmed acute malaria cases through passive case detection, whereas the prevalence of baseline subclinical malaria infections is much less known.Methods: In this study, cross-sectional surveys were conducted during the rainy season of 2017 in four townships (Bilin, Thabeikkyin, Banmauk and Paletwa) of Myanmar with divergent annual malaria incidences. A total of 1991 volunteers were recruited from local villages and Plasmodium subclinical infections were estimated by light microscopy (LM), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and nested PCR. The nested PCR analysis was performed with a modified pooling strategy that was optimized based on an initial estimate the infection prevalence.Results: The overall malaria infection prevalence based on all methods was 13.9% (277/1991) and it differed drastically among the townships, with Paletwa in the western border having the highest infection rate (22.9%) and Thabeikkyin in central Myanmar having the lowest (3.9%). As expected, nested PCR was the most sensitive and identified 226 (11.4%) individuals with parasite infections. Among the parasite species, Plasmodium vivax was the most prevalent in all locations, while Plasmodium falciparum also accounted for 32% of infections in the western township Paletwa. Two RDTs based on the detection of the hrp2 antigen detected a total of 103 P. falciparum infections, and the ultrasensitive RDT detected 20% more P. falciparum infections than the conventional RDT. In contrast, LM missed the majority of the subclinical infections and only identified 14 Plasmodium infections.Conclusions: Cross-sectional surveys identified considerable levels of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections in endemic populations of Myanmar with P. vivax becoming the predominant parasite species. Geographical heterogeneity of subclinical infections calls for active surveillance of parasite infections in endemic areas. The pooling scheme designed for nested PCR analysis offers a more practical strategy for large-scale epidemiological studies of parasite prevalence. Such information is important for decision-makers to put forward a more realistic action plan for malaria elimination.

AB  - Both Richard Dawkins's book The God Delusion and Philip Kennedy's book A Modern Introduction to Theology: New Questions for Old Beliefs were published in 2006. This article aims to compare the two books and to argue that Kennedy does not oppose Dawkins's views but, in fact, debates along similar lines. Kennedy is adamant that the Augustinian paradigm of Christianity no longer makes sense, because it is based on an outdated cosmology and anthropology. He firmly maintains that Christianity requires a new paradigm, which is informed by our current knowledge and worldview. Thomas Kuhn's ideas of paradigm and paradigm changes in the history of natural sciences are utilised in comparing the books, seeing that Dawkins accepts and works within the Darwinian paradigm of evolutionary biology, and Kennedy argues that Christians and Christian theologians adhere to the Augustinian paradigm of Fall-Redemption-Judgement. It is argued that Dawkins should have referred to the paradigm change in the study of the Bible, which occurred towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, and the plea of theologians, like Kennedy, for a paradigm change in theology. The article concludes that only a paradigm change in Christianity, which is in line with the modern worldview, will enable Christians to keep the tradition alive.

TI  - Examining Interactions Between and Among Predictors of Net Ecosystem Exchange: A Machine Learning Approach in a Semi-arid Landscape
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is an essential climate indicator of the direction and magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2) transfer between land surfaces and the atmosphere. Improved estimates of NEE can serve to better constrain spatiotemporal characteristics of terrestrial carbon fluxes, improve verification of land models, and advance monitoring of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. Spatiotemporal NEE information developed by combining ground-based flux tower observations and spatiotemporal remote sensing datasets are of potential value in benchmarking land models. We apply a machine learning approach (Random Forest (RF)) to develop spatiotemporally varying NEE estimates using observations from a flux tower and several variables that can potentially be retrieved from satellite data and are related to ecosystem dynamics. Specific variables in model development include a mixture of remotely sensed (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI)) and ground-based data (soil moisture, downward solar radiation, precipitation and mean air temperature) in a complex landscape of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwest Idaho, USA. Predicted results show good agreement with the observed data for the NEE (r(2) = 0.87). We then validate the temporal pattern of the NEE generated by the RF model for two independent years at the two sites not used in the development of the model. The model development process revealed that the most important predictors include LAI, downward solar radiation, and soil moisture. This work provides a demonstration of the potential power of machine learning methods for combining a variety of observational datasets to create spatiotemporally extensive datasets for land model verification and benchmarking.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Status is a Main Prognostic Parameter Needful for the Correct Staging of Patients with Melanoma Thicker than 4 mm: Single-Institution Experience and Literature Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the study: The usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy in thick melanomas is debated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible prognostic significance of sentinel lymph node biopsy in T4 melanoma patients and to verify whether this was a homogeneous group of patients with similar poor behavior. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed. Data were extracted from the Tuscan Regional Referral Center database. The outcome of sentinel lymph node-negative and sentinel lymph node-positive T4 melanomas were compared. A systematic review of published series on this issue and a meta-analysis were performed. Results: Among 125 T4 melanoma patients, 53 patients (42.4%) were sentinel lymph node-positive and 72 (57.6%) patients were sentinel lymph node-negative. The 5-year and the 10-year melanoma specific survival were 81.9% and 72.3% for sentinel lymph node-negative patients and 42.4% and 17.9% (P < 0.001) for sentinel lymph node-positive patients. A positive sentinel lymph node showed an HR of 3.08. The meta-analysis confirmed that there was a significantly greater risk of death for patients with thick melanoma and positive sentinel lymph node (RR 1.75). Conclusions: The results of the study point out that the sentinel lymph node biopsy is required for the correct staging of patients with melanoma thicker than 4 mm and that the status of sentinel lymph node is a significant predictor of melanoma specific survival. This knowledge allows early surgical and adjuvant treatment as well as appropriate trial enrollment and tailored follow-up.

TI  - Examining deforestation and agropasture dynamics along the Brazilian TransAmazon Highway using multitemporal Landsat imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to understand the difference of major land-cover change results caused in various time periods and to examine the impacts of human-induced factors on land-cover changes along the TransAmazon Highway region. The Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager data from 2011, 2014, and 2017 and our previous land-cover classification results in 1991, 2000, and 2008 were used to examine land-cover dynamics. A classification system consisting of five land-cover classes - primary forest (PF), secondary forest (SF), agropasture (AP), urban area, and water - were chosen. The hierarchical-based classification method was used to generate land-cover classification results, and the post-classification comparison approach was used to produce detailed "from-to" conversions for each detection period. The emphasis was on deforestation of PF, dynamic change of SF and AP, and urbanization over time. The impacts of human-induced factors such as population and economic conditions on urban expansion, AP expansion, and deforestation were examined. This research indicated that selection of a suitable time period was critical for effectively detecting land-cover changes; that is, too long time period (i.e., 9 years) cannot accurately capture some land-cover changes such as the AP and SF in this research. Although deforestation - the conversion from PF to SF and AP - accounted for a large proportion of land-cover changes, the changes between SF and AP became more important than PF conversion, and required a short time period (i.e., 3 years here) for effectively reflecting their dynamics. Human-induced factors play important roles in deforestation, dynamic changes between AP and SF, and urbanization.

TI  - River centerline extraction using the multiple direction integration algorithm for mixed and pure water pixels
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The river centerline is a basic hydrological characteristic. Most prior studies have used remote sensing data to extract the river centerline from the open water region in a pure water pixel region. Extracting this type of river is relatively easy. However, extracting the centerline of a micro-river, which is mainly composed of mixed water pixels, is challenging. This paper presents a novel method, called the Multiple Direction Integration Algorithm (MDIA), to extract the river centerline using an image-enhancing method combined with river morphology. MDIA can be applied to regions mainly composed of pure water pixels, as well as to regions consisting of mixed water pixels in the index image. The method first calculates the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhances the river linear structure using a Hessian matrix. Second, a small window is constructed as a circular structural element. In the window region, the local threshold is automatically obtained using water-oriented clustering segmentation and prior river knowledge to judge the pixel type. After completing the river centerline extraction in the current window, the next detecting window is generated to continue judgment. The structural element automatically executes river centerline judgment until the entire river centerline is extracted. The Landsat 8 images of six regions with different geomorphologies were chosen to analyze the method's performance. The test sites include high mountain region, low mountain region, plains region with farmland and a residential region. The experimental results show that the optimal threshold of the processing results ranged from 0.2 to 0.3. In this range, the user's accuracy is 0.813 to 0.997, and the producer's accuracy is 0.981 to 1. The MDIA effectively and correctly extracts the river network in mixed-pixel regions. The presented method provides an effective algorithm for river centerline extraction that can be used to expand and update river datasets and provide reliable river centerline data for relevant hydrology studies.

TI  - Vegetation species mapping in a coastal-dune ecosystem using high resolution satellite imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation mapping is a priority when managing natural protected areas. In this context, very high resolution satellite remote sensing data can be fundamental in providing accurate vegetation cartography at species level. In this work, a complete processing methodology has been developed and validated in a complex vulnerable coastal-dune ecosystem. Specifically, the analysis has been carried out using WorldView-2 imagery, which offers spatial and spectral resolutions. A thorough assessment of 5 atmospheric correction models has been performed using real reflectance measures from a field radiometry campaign. To select the classification methodology, different strategies have been evaluated, including additional spectral (23 vegetation indices) and spatial (4 texture parameters) information to the multispectral bands. Likewise, the application of linear unmixing techniques has been tested and abundance maps of each plant species have been generated using the library of spectral signatures recorded during the campaign. After the analysis conducted, a new methodology has been proposed based on the use of the 6S atmospheric model and the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm applied to a combination of different spectral and spatial input data. Specifically, an overall accuracy of 88,03% was achieved combining the corrected multispectral bands plus a vegetation index (MSAVI2) and texture information (variance of the first principal component). Furthermore, the methodology has been validated by photointerpretation and 3 plant species achieve significant accuracy: Tamarix canariensis (94,9%), Juncus acutus (85,7%) and Launaea arborescens (62,4%). Finally, the classified procedure comparing maps for different seasons has also shown robustness to changes in the phenological state of the vegetation.

TI  - Self-adaptive segmentation of satellite images based on a weighted aggregation approach
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation is a decisive process in object-based image analysis, while the uncertainty of segmentation scales can significantly influence the results. To resolve this issue, this study proposes a Self-Adaptive Segmentation (SAS) method which bridges the gap between the inherent scale and segmentation scale of each object. Firstly, SAS is defined as a variable-scale segmentation approach, aiming at generating local optimum results. It is then implemented based on Segmentation by Weighted Aggregation (SWA) method and optimized by selfhood scale estimation technique. Secondly, two images derived from WorldView-2 (an urban area) and Landsat-8 (a farmland area) are employed to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of this method. Thirdly, it is further compared with SWA and mean shift method by reference to two evaluations, including an unsupervised evaluation, i.e., Global Score (GS), and a supervised one named Geometry-based comparison. The experimental results indicate the SAS method presented in this study is effective in solving the scale issues in multiscale segmentations. It shows higher accuracy than SWA through assigning an appropriate segmentation scale for each object. Moreover, the segmentation results achieved by SAS method in both study areas are more accurate than those by mean shift method, which demonstrates the stable performance of SAS method across diverse scenes and data sets. This advantage is more obvious in farmland area than in urban scene, according to the accuracy assessment results.

TI  - Classification accuracy and trend assessments of land cover- land use changes from principal components of land satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper evaluated the accuracy of classifying Land Cover-Land Use (LCLU) types and assessed the trends of their changes from Principal Components (PC) of Land satellite (Landsat) images. The accuracy of the image classification of LCLU was evaluated using the confusion matrices and assessed with cross-referencing of samples of LCLU types interpreted and classified from System Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) images and topographical map. LCLU changes were detected, quantified, and statistically analysed. The interpretation error of the composite image of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat ETM+) (2006) was high compared with that from the PC image of Landsat ETM+ (2006). From 1986 - 2006 the area covered by settlements increased by 0.8% (230,380.00 km(2)), agricultural land decreased by 7.5% (1009.40 km(2)), vegetation cover decreased by 0.9% (114.00 km(2)) while waterbody increased by 0.2% (25.91 km(2)). Also, from 1986 - 2006 the average annual rates of change in the area of settlements was 6.7%. Agricultural land and bare land showed fluctuations of change rates from 6.7% and 5.0% annually in 1986 and 2006 respectively. The quantitative evidences of LCLU changes revealed the growth of settlements. The conversions of land from agriculture to urban land represent the most significant land cover changes. The rate of change was as high as 4.8% for settlements while agricultural lands were converted at 5.0% per year. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the Landsat images and supervised classification method used made it possible to classify and determine the area of LCLU classes from the set of Landsat images without prior depiction and delimitation of individual LCLU type. It permitted the measurement of area of each LCLU class at a high accuracy level and kept the level of error relatively constant. The PCA analysis in this study affirms the previous research findings. Future research works should focus on the use of remotely sensed images with high temporal and spatial resolutions such as Quick Bird and SPOT 6 to develop effective and accurate LCLU change mapping and monitoring at the local scale. The PCA technique has been used quite widely to study changes in land cover and land use in many 'developed' countries but much still needs to be done in developing and undeveloped countries where land cover and land use change is poorly mapped and knowledge of such changes is very important for planning development of the country.

TI  - An evaluation of satellite dust-detection algorithms in the Middle East region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last 15 years, the frequency, spatial extent, and intensity of dust storms have increased and it is one of the main continuously occurring environmental hazard in the Middle East region. Since dust storms generally cover a large spatial extent and are highly dynamic, satellite Earth Observation (EO) is a key tool for detecting their occurrence, identifying their origin, and monitoring their transport and state. A variety of satellite dust detection algorithms have been developed to identify dust emissions sources and dust plumes once entrained in the atmosphere. This paper evaluates the performance of five widely applied dust detection algorithms: the Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD), D-parameter, Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI), Thermal-Infrared Dust Index (TDI) and the Middle East Dust Index (MEDI). These algorithms are applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to detect dust-contaminated pixels during three significant dust events in 2007 in the Middle East region that originated from sources in Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia. The results indicate that all methods have a comparable performance in detecting dust-contaminated pixels during the three dust events with an average detection rate (between all algorithms) of 85%. However, substantial differences exist in their ability to distinguish dust from clouds and the land surface, which resulted in large errors of commission. Direct validation of these algorithms with observations from seven Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations in the region found an average false detection rate (between all algorithms) of 89.6%. Although the algorithms performed well in detecting the dust-contaminated pixels their high false detection rate means it is challenging to apply these algorithms in operational context.

TI  - Landsat 8 OLI satellite data for mapping of the <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> and benthic habitats of coastal ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The benthic seabeds and seagrass ecosystems, in particular the vulnerable Posidonia oceanica (PO), are increasingly threatened by climate change and other anthropogenic pressures. Along the 8000 km coastline of Italy, they are often poorly mapped and monitored to properly evaluate their health status. Thus to support these monitoring needs, the improved capabilities of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Earth Observation (EO) satellite system were tested for PO mapping by coupling its atmospherically corrected multispectral data with near-synchronous sea truth information. Two different approaches for the necessary atmospheric correction were exploited focusing on the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and adjacency noise effects, which typically occur at land-sea interfaces. The general achievements demonstrated the effectiveness of High Resolution (HR) spectral responses captured by OLI sensor, for monitoring seagrass and sea beds in the optically complex Tyrrhenian shallow waters, with performance level dependent on the type of applied atmospheric pre-processing. The distribution of the PO leaf area index (LAI) on different substrates has been most effectively modelled using on purpose developed spectral indices. They were based on the coastal and blue-green OLI bands, atmospherically corrected using a recently introduced method for AOD retrieval, based on the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) reflectance. The alternative correction method including a less effective AOD assessment but the removal of adjacency effects has proven its efficacy for improving the thematic discriminability of the seabed types characterized by different PO cover-substrate combinations.

TI  - Non-stationarity in MODIS fAPAR time-series and its impact on operational drought detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A time-series of fAPAR (fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) data collected by the MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra satellite between 2001 and 2016 has been analysed at global scale in order to identify possible areas interested by a linear temporal trend. The main scope of this study is to quantify how the possible trend may affect estimates of drought events based on 10-day fAPAR standardized anomalies (z values). The trend analysis, performed according to the Theil-Sen approach, highlighted that about 10% of the globe shows a statistically significant trend (following the Mann-Kendall test at p = 0.05), mostly being positive (increasing fAPAR). The impact of such a trend on standardized anomalies has been formally expressed as a linear function of two quantities: 1) the z value itself, and 2) the year under investigation. This approach allows summarising the variations in z into just two parameters. In the case of negative anomalies (of greater interest for drought analyses) and the most recent years on the time-series (of greater interest for operational monitoring systems), the use of a stationary (no trend) reference tends to underestimate both severity and extension of the areas interested by drought compared to the non-stationary (or trend stationary) reference. The areas mostly interested by significant differences in the outputs of stationary and non-stationary analyses are the Indian subcontinent, eastern China and the Mediterranean countries. As an example of the impacts of the choice of one of the two frameworks on drought monitoring, the results for the recent summer drought in Italy in 2017 have been reported. This example demonstrates how the non-stationary approach tends to be conservative compared to the stationary one, with the former detecting larger affected areas and higher average severity compared to the latter.

TI  - Identification of deformation pattern changes caused by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using InSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous hydrocarbon production and steam/water injection cause compaction and expansion of the reservoir rock, leading to irregular downward and upward ground movements. Detecting such anthropogenic ground movements is of importance, as they may significantly influence the safety and sustainability of hydrocarbon production activities, in particular, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and even lead to local hazards, e.g. earthquakes and sinkholes. As InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) can routinely deliver global ground deformation observations on a weekly basis, with millimetre-level precision, it can be a cost-effective, and less labour intensive tool to monitor surface deformation changes due to hydrocarbon production activities. Aimed at identifying the associated deformation pattern changes, this study focuses on InSAR deformation model optimization, in order to automatically detect irregularities, both spatially and temporally. We apply multiple hypothesis testing to determine the best model based on a library of physically realistic canonical deformation models. We develop a cluster-wise constrained least-squares estimation method for parameter estimation, in order to directly introduce contextual information, such as spatio-temporal correlation, into the mathematical model. Here a cluster represents a group of spatially correlated InSAR measurement points. Our approach is demonstrated over an enhanced oil recovery site using a stack of TerraSAR-X images.

TI  - An improved cluster-based snake model for automatic agricultural field boundary extraction from high spatial resolution imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural field boundary information is important and often required for the geosciences and the agricultural sector. In this paper, a novel method is developed to extract sub-boundaries within the permanent boundaries of agricultural land parcels from high-resolution optical satellite imagery using an improved cluster-based snake model. The method takes the advantage of the results of an automatic fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and edge detection to compute external forces for an improved gradient vector flow (GVF) snake model. The GVF snake algorithm is improved by using an automatic seeding model based on clustering results and image moment functions. To seed the improved GVF algorithm, an ellipse is automatically delineated for each cluster within agricultural parcel by utilizing image moment functions (in particular silhouette moments). The GVF snake model is then implemented for each seed, one seed at a time. Active contours tend to have curve shapes rather than straight lines due to their structure that consists of several connected nodes within each contour. Therefore, the final accurate results are obtained after performing a three-stage line simplification operation. The experiments of the method were conducted on 20 test fields in a study area located near to the town of Karacabey, Turkey, using the 4-m resolution IKONOS multispectral (xs) image, the 2.44-m resolution QuickBird xs image, and the 0.61-m resolution QuickBird pan-sharpened (PS) image. Experimental results demonstrate that using both the clustering and edge detection results as external forces for the improved GVF snake model increases the accuracy of the results. In addition, the developed method showed a fairly good performance in extracting sub-boundaries for the fields comprising crops with an inherent high inner heterogeneity, such as rice and corn. The method can potentially be applied in the extraction of within-field sub-boundaries from high-resolution satellite imagery in agricultural areas.

TI  - INSAT-3D cloud microphysical product: retrieval and validation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 6-channel Imager onboard the Indian geostationary satellite Indian National Satellite-3D (INSAT-3D) provides half-hourly multispectral images over the Indian monsoon region. The availability of shortwave infrared (SWIR) (1.6 mu m) channel along with visible (0.6 mu m) channel observations provide an opportunity to estimate cloud microphysical parameters (CMP) over the India and surrounding regions with high temporal frequency. In this paper, we describe the retrieval and validation of two important CMPs, i.e. cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER) over the ocean from INSAT-3D. This is the first time; a CMP product has been made available for INSAT-3D. We describe here the development of the forward model, based on a look-up-table (LUT) approach using Radiative transfer simulations. The inversion is carried out by selecting the vector (CMP) which provides the best match between the observed and simulated radiances. The present retrieval is limited to water clouds over ocean only. The retrieved INSAT-3D CMP were then compared with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product for the months of January and July 2016. For cloudy month (July), the mean correlation between INSAT-3D and MODIS was 0.73 and 0.47 for COT and CER, respectively. Similarly, for the month of January with less cloud cover, the mean correlation was 0.60 and 0.40 for COT and CER, respectively. INSAT-3D products are available every half hourly in real time through web portal and will be valuable for studying short-term variation in cloud-microphysics over the equatorial Indian Ocean.

TI  - Mapping aerosol optical thickness and water-leaving signals using an improved NIR/SWIR switching atmospheric correction model: A case study in the Bohai Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the performance of the near-infrared & short wave infrared switching atmospheric correction (NSSAC) model in estimating remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) and aerosol optical thickness at 869 nm (tau(a)(869)) were assessed by field measurements taken in the Bohai Sea. It was found that the NSSAC model had approximately 30% uncertainty for retrievals of R-rs(lambda) in the green regions but provided approximately 50% uncertainty for estimations of tau(a)(869) and R-rs(lambda) at all other moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) visible wavelengths. Therefore, an optimised method is proposed for optimizing the retrieval results of the NSSAC model; it was validated using the field measurements collected from the Oujiang River estuary. The results show that the performance of the NSSAC model for tau(a)(869) and R-rs(lambda) at the blue, red, and near-infrared bands was greatly improved by using the optimised NSSAC model. Moreover, the study also finds that the tau(a)(869) shows a large variation in the Bohai Sea, decreasing from coastal to offshore regions. The monthly average tau(a)(869) has a maximum at February and August. Due to the imperfect atmospheric correction procedure, the NSSAC model-derived R-rs(lambda) is always larger than those of the field measurements. Future work is needed to minimise the detected water-leaving signals in the short wave infrared (SWIR) images.

TI  - Spatiotemporal pattern analysis of potential light seine fishing areas in the East China sea using VIIRS day/night band imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light seine fishing, one of the most efficient methods used in modern fisheries, is performed based on fish phototaxis. In this study, the East China Sea was selected as the study area, and fishing vessel pixels (pixels representing light seine fishing vessels) were detected in five years of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day/night band (DNB) imagery according to three indicators: the Spike Median Index (SMI), Sharpness Index (SI), and Spike Height Index (SHI). Subsequently, cluster, barycenter, range and direction, and density analyses were conducted to comprehensively evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of potential light seine fishing areas in the East China Sea. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) the number of fishing vessel pixels exhibited obvious monthly characteristics that are consistent with the fishing moratorium that has been enforced in this region; (2) at the study area scale, light seine fishing occurred in one cluster, and the pattern in the interior of the cluster exhibited spatiotemporal periodicity; (3) the barycenter of the fishing areas displayed opposing movement trends in the first half and the second half of the year, and the movements were closely linked to water temperature changes. In addition, seasonally concentrated fishing areas were observed in winter, spring and summer; (4) the peak fishing month advanced from September to August beginning in 2014, and the fishing areas displayed a strong tendency in orientation that was highly consistent with the distribution of the Kuroshio Front in the East China Sea; and (5) light seine fishing activities were mainly concentrated in the second half of the year, especially in summer, but the intensity has declined in recent years. Our results are in good agreement with the results of other scholars and provide reliable information concerning where and when light seine fishing occurs. These results also suggest that VIIRS DNB imagery can be effectively used to detect light seine fishing areas.

TI  - A New Parameterization of Volcanic Ash Complex Refractive Index Based on NBO/T and SiO<sub>2</sub> Content
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative transfer models used in remote sensing and hazard assessment of volcanic ash require knowledge of ash optical parameters. Here we characterize the bulk and glass compositions of a representative suite of volcanic ash samples with known complex refractive indices (n+ik, where n is the real part and k is the imaginary part). Using a linear regression model, we develop a new parameterization allowing the complex refractive index of volcanic ash to be estimated from ash SiO2 content or ratio of nonbridging oxygens to tetrahedrally coordinated cations (NBO/T). At visible wavelengths, n correlates better with bulk than with glass composition (both SiO2 and NBO/T), and k correlates better with SiO2 content than with NBO/T. Over a broader spectral range (0.4-19m), bulk correlates better than glass composition, and NBO/T generally correlates better than SiO2 content for both parts of the refractive index. In order to understand the impacts of our new parameterization on satellite retrievals, we compared Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer satellite (wavelengths 3.62-15.5m) mass loading retrievals using our new approach with retrievals that assumed a generic (Eyjafjallajokull) ash refractive index. There are significant differences in mass loading using our calculated indices specific to ash type rather than a generic index. Where mass loadings increase, there is often improvement in retrieval quality (corresponding to cost function decrease). This new parameterization of refractive index variation with ash composition will help to improve remote-sensing retrievals for the rapid identification of ash and quantitative analysis of mass loadings from satellite data on operational timescales.

TI  - Guidance on and comparison of machine learning classifiers for Landsat-based land cover and land use mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing scientists are increasingly adopting machine learning classifiers for land cover and land use (LCLU) mapping, but model selection, a critical step of the machine learning classification, has usually been ignored in the past research. In this paper, step-by-step guidance (for classifier training, model selection, and map production) with supervised learning model selection is first provided. Then, model selection is exhaustively applied to different machine learning (e.g. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) classifiers to identify optimal polynomial degree of input features (d) and hyperparameters with Landsat imagery of a study region in China and Ghana. We evaluated the map accuracy and computing time associated with different versions of machine learning classification software (i.e. ArcMap, ENVI, TerrSet, and R). The optimal classifiers and their associated polynomial degree of input features and hyperparameters vary for the two image datasets that were tested. The optimum combination of d and hyperparameters for each type of classifier was used across software packages, but some classifiers (i.e. ENVI and TerrSet ANN) were customized due to the constraints of software packages. The LCLU map derived from ENVI SVM has the highest overall accuracy (72.6%) for the Ghana dataset, while the LCLU map derived from R DT has the highest overall accuracy (48.0%) for the FNNR dataset. All LCLU maps for the Ghana dataset are more accurate compared to those from the China dataset, likely due to more limited and uncertain training data for the China (FNNR) dataset. For the Ghana dataset, LCLU maps derived from tree-based classifiers (ArcMap RF, TerrSet DT, and R RF) routines are accurate, but these maps have artefacts resulting from model overfitting problems.

TI  - Estimating River Discharge With Swath Altimetry: A Proof of Concept Using AirSWOT Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will provide global measurements of the free surface of large rivers, providing new opportunities for remote sensing-derived estimates of river discharge in gaged and ungaged basins. SWOT discharge algorithms have been developed and benchmarked using synthetic data but remain untested on real-world swath altimetry observations. We present the first discharge estimates from AirSWOT, a SWOT-like airborne Ka-band radar, using 6 days of measurements over a 40-km segment of the Willamette River in Oregon, USA. The three evaluated discharge algorithms estimated discharge with normalized root-mean-square errors of 10-31% when compared with in situ gage data but were sensitive to an initial estimate of mean annual discharge. Our results show that these discharge algorithms provide reliable discharge estimates on remotely sensed data at SWOT-like spatial scales while highlighting the need for further algorithm sensitivity tests.Plain Language Summary River discharge is a key element of the water cycle, but river gaging networks have significant gaps at the global scale. In 2021, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will be launched to collect high-accuracy measurements of the world's surface waters, including all global rivers wider than 100 m. In anticipation of SWOT, methods to estimate discharge from its measurements have been developed but have yet to be tested on real-world data at the spatial scales and accuracies expected of SWOT. We test three such discharge algorithms on data collected by AirSWOT, an airborne variant of SWOT, as it flew over the Willamette River in Oregon, USA. We show that river discharge can be estimated by these algorithms with encouraging accuracy (10-31%) using only airborne measurements and a model-derived estimate of the mean annual discharge. We stress the need for further testing of these algorithms to determine their sensitivities to the initial estimate of flow and the hydraulic character of the river reach but suggest that these results are encouraging for future global-scale deployment of SWOT discharge algorithms.

TI  - Resolving Seasonal Ice Velocity of 45 Greenlandic Glaciers With Very High Temporal Details
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal glacier ice velocities are important for understanding controlling mechanisms of ice flow. For many Greenlandic glaciers, however, these measurements are limited by low temporal resolution. We present seasonal ice velocity changes, melt season onset and extent, and ice front positions for 45 Greenlandic glaciers using 2015-2017 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. Seasonal velocity fluctuations of roughly half of the glaciers appear to be primarily controlled by surface melt-induced changes in the subglacial hydrology. This includes (1) glaciers that speed up with the onset of surface melt and (2) glaciers with comparable late winter and early melt season velocities that show significant slowdown during most of the melt season and speedup during winter. In contrast, less than a quarter of the study glaciers show strong correspondence between seasonal ice speed and terminus changes. Our results pinpoint seasonal variations across Greenland, highlighting the variable influence of meltwater on year-round ice velocities.

TI  - An Assessment of the Impacts of Cloud Vertical Heterogeneity on Global Ice Cloud Data Records From Passive Satellite Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne passive instruments are widely used to infer long-term ice cloud properties due to their large temporal and spatial coverage. Although observations from active instruments demonstrate ice particle variability in the vertical dimension, a pragmatic assumption made in passive cloud retrieval algorithms is that the observed scene consists of a plane-parallel cloud. In this study, a theoretical exploration on how ice cloud vertical heterogeneity (ICVH) influences passive retrievals (i.e., cloud optical thickness, cloud effective radius, and ice water path, IWP) is implemented at the pixel scale. Specifically, with an established ice cloud profile database inferred from 1-year Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation/CloudSat, we quantitatively estimate ICVH-induced biases on monthly averaged cloud macrophysical and radiative properties. Results show an average underestimation (-35%) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly IWP due to the ICVH for global ice clouds over ocean. The ICVH impacts are enhanced at large IWPs (e.g., > 500g/m(2)) and solar zenith angles, resulting in a profound underestimation of MODIS IWP (up to -50%) in deep convective regions and middle to high-latitude regions in the winter hemisphere. The global-averaged ice cloudy-sky reflected solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation derived from MODIS retrievals are slightly overestimated, suggesting that the ICVH has little impact on cloud radiative properties. Relatively large reflected solar radiation (0.3W/m(2)) and outgoing longwave radiation (0.1W/m(2)) flux differences occur at high and low IWPs, respectively. The largest total flux difference (similar to 2W/m(2)), mainly contributed by shortwave part, is associated with deep convection where the typical IWP is greater than 2,000g/m(2).

TI  - Estimation of Evapotranspiration of Amazon Rainforest Using the Maximum Entropy Production Method
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy budget of Amazonian forests has a large influence on regional and global climate, but relevant data are scarce. A novel energy partition method based on the maximum entropy production (MEP) theory is applied to simulate evapotranspiration in Amazonia. Using site-level eddy flux data, the MEP method shows high skill at the hourly, daily, and monthly scales. Consistent performance under different levels of land surface dryness is revealed, hinting that drought signal is appropriately resolved. The site-level MEP-based estimates outperform the estimates of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer evapotranspiration product, which is commonly used for large-scale assessments. At the Amazon basin scale, the two series yield similar averages but exhibit spatial differences. The parameter parsimony and demonstrated skill of the MEP method make it an attractive approach for environments with diverse strategies of water flux control.Plain Language Summary Classical methods for estimating vapor flow from vegetated surfaces, known as the process of evapotranspiration, require input data on water vapor gradient, wind speed, and surface roughness as well as model parameters that are often difficult to obtain from in situ and remote sensing observations. The uncertainty of these variables can be especially large for the Amazon rainforest with high biodiversity, making it challenging to evaluate evapotranspiration in space and time. In this study, we assess the performance of a novel model that needs fewer input data and model parameters than classical methods. The model performance is validated through comparison with observations from nine sites across the Amazon basin and shows a better skill as compared to a commonly used evapotranspiration product. We also show that the model has a satisfactory performance in estimating evapotranspiration when satellite data are used, providing reasonable estimates at the scale of the entire Amazon basin.

TI  - Investigation of the effect of the incidence angle on land cover classification using fully polarimetric SAR images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incidence angle is one of the most important imaging parameters that affect polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image classification. Several studies have examined the land cover classification capability of PolSAR images with different incidence angles. However, most of these studies provide limited physical insights into the mechanism how the variation of incidence angle affects PolSAR image classification. In the present study, land cover classification was conducted by using RADARSAT-2 Wide Fine Quad-Pol (FQ) images acquired at different incidence angles, namely, FQ8 (27.75 degrees), FQ14 (34.20 degrees), and FQ20 (39.95 degrees). Land cover classification capability was examined for each single-incidence angle image and a multi-incidence angle image (i.e., the combination of single-incidence angle images). The multi-incidence angle image produced better classification results than any of the single-incidence angle images, and the different incidence angles exhibited different superiorities in land cover classification. The effect mechanisms of incidence angle variation on land cover classification were investigated by using the polarimetric decomposition theorem that decomposes radar backscatter into single-bounce scattering, double-bounce scattering and volume scattering. Impinging SAR easily penetrated crops to interact with the soil at a small incidence angle. Therefore, the difference in single-bounce scattering between trees and crops was evident in the FQ8 image, which was determined to be suitable for distinguishing between croplands and forests. The single-bounce scattering from bare lands increased with the decrease in incidence angles, whereas that from water changed slightly with the incidence angle variation. Consequently, the FQ8 image exhibited the largest difference in single-bounce scattering between bare lands and water and produced the fewest confusion between them among all the images. The single- and double-bounce scattering from urban areas and forests increased with the decrease in incidence angles. The increase in single- and double-bounce scattering from urban areas was more significant than that from forests because C-band SAR could not easily penetrate the crown layer of forests to interact with the trunks and ground. Therefore, the FQ8 image showed a slightly better performance than the other images in discriminating between urban areas and forests. Compared with other crops and trees, banana trees caused stronger single- and double-bounce scattering because of their large leaves. As a large incidence angle resulted in a long penetration path of radar waves in the crown layer of vegetation, the FQ20 image enhanced the single- and double-bounce scattering differences between banana trees and other vegetation. Thus, the FQ20 image outperformed the other images in identifying banana trees.

TI  - Drought monitoring of the wetland in the Tumen River Basin between 1991 and 2016 using Landsat TM/ETM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland areas are known as 'the kidneys of the Earth' because they provide important functions towards stabilizing the environment, long-term protection of water sources, effectively minimizing sediment loss, purifying surface water from industrial and agricultural pollutants, and enhancing aquifer recharge. The condition of water supply in wetlands directly affects the growth of wetland plants and local biodiversity. Therefore, drought monitoring is vital in wetlands. In this study, Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) is used to observe the drought status of the wetland in the cross-border (China and North Korea) Tumen River Basin from 1991 to 2016. For this purpose, the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data for six periods were used for the analysis. Soil moisture maps acquired from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System Version 1.0 (CLDAS-V1.0) were then introduced for validating the reliability of the drought monitoring method. The results showed that most areas with a normal moisture level (decreased 25.8%) began experiencing slight drought (increased 29.7%). The coefficient of determination (R-2) between VTCI and soil moisture showed values of 0.69, 0.32, and 0.2 for 0-5 cm, 0-10 cm, and 10-20 cm thicknesses, respectively. Although climate change probably contributes to the formation of drought by decreasing precipitation (50 mm decrease in Chinese section) and increasing temperature (0.5 degrees C increase in North Korean section), human activities such as surges in daily water consumption appear as the main threats that leading to droughts in this wetland.

TI  - High-Resolution Global Contiguous SIF of OCO-2
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) collects solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) at high spatial resolution along orbits ((SIF) over bar oco(2_orbit)), but its discontinuous spatial coverage precludes its full potential for understanding the mechanistic SIF-photosynthesis relationship. This study developed a spatially contiguous global OCO-2 SIF product at 0.05 degrees and 16-day resolutions ((SIF) over bar (oco2_005)) using machine learning constrained by physiological understandings. This was achieved by stratifying biomes and times for training and predictions, which accounts for varying plant physiological properties in space and time. (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) accurately preserved the spatiotemporal variations of SIFoco2_orbit across the globe. Validation of (SIf) over bar (oco2_005) with Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer airborne measurements revealed striking consistency (R-2 = 0.72; regression slope = 0.96). Further, without time and biome stratification, (1) (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) of croplands, deciduous temperate, and needleleaf forests would be underestimated during the peak season, (2) (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) of needleleaf forests would be overestimated during autumn, and (3) the capability of (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) to detect drought would be diminished.Plain Language Summary Newly available observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from satellite sensors represent a major step toward quantifying photosynthesis globally in real time. However, existing satellite SIF records are restricted to low spatial resolutions, sparse data acquisition, or both. These limitations impede the full capability of SIF for improving our understanding of dynamics of photosynthesis and its response to environmental changes (particularly in heterogeneous landscapes) to better support carbon source/sink attribution and verification. This study developed a novel high-resolution time series of spatially contiguous SIF for the globe, leveraging NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 measurements. We combined machine learning algorithms with known physiological constraints for this effort. Comparison with independent airborne SIF measurements revealed strong consistency, confirming the high quality of this new SIF data set. The high-resolution and global contiguous coverage of this data set will greatly enhance the synergy between satellite SIF and photosynthesis measured on the ground at consistent spatial scales. Potential applications with this data set include advancing dynamic drought monitoring and mitigation, informing agricultural planning and yield estimation in a more spatially explicit way, and providing a benchmark for upcoming satellite missions with SIF capabilities at higher spatial resolutions.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of mining 3D time-series deformation based on multi-track SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of the developing process of a surface subsidence basin is the basis of building damage assessment and surface deformation prediction. In this paper, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of three different imaging geometries, TerraSAR, Radarsat-2, and Sentinel-1A, were exploited. Firstly, two-dimensional (2D) time-series deformation of the surface subsidence basin caused by 15,235 working face mining was obtained based on Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) technology from 19 December 2015 to 5 March 2016. By comparing vertical deformation with levelling data, it is shown that the root-mean-square error of vertical deformation is 3.2 mm and the standard deviation is 1.9 mm when the ascending-descending track SAR data is available. Otherwise, the root-mean-square error of vertical deformation is 18.1 mm and the standard deviation is 11.6 mm. Because of the low precision of the north-south horizontal movement monitored by the SAR sensor, the vertical deformation acquired by MSBAS technology and the rules of the mining subsidence (horizontal movement is proportional to tilt) were combined to obtain the north-south horizontal movement which was proven to be reliable by comparing the 2D time-series deformation obtained by MSBAS technology. Then, the deformation of the railway in the surface subsidence basin was analysed based on the three-dimensional (3D) time-series deformation. The results show that the subsidence, tilt, and horizontal movement strongly influence the railway in the monitoring period, but will not affect the normal traffic. This experiment lays a technical foundation for preventing the occurrence of mining disasters and verifies the ability to monitor the deformation of buildings and structures by interferometry synthetic aperture radar technology.

TI  - Occurrence of winter phytoplankton bloom in the open southern Adriatic: Relationship with hydroclimatic events in the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics and intensity of winter phytoplankton blooms in the Open Southern Adriatic (OSA) were investigated from 1994 to 2012 by combining available unpublished and literature data on phytoplankton abundance, in situ chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and satellite-derived Chl-a surface data. We used original data from Februaries 1994 and 1995 (phytoplankton, physico-chemical and meteorological data), the years affected by East Mediterranean Transient (EMT), and analysed them in relation to data available from literature for winters of 1997 and from 2007 to 2012. Chl-a satellite data from 1998 to 2012 was used to get insight into large scale bloom dynamics with fine temporal and spatial resolution. Particular attention was paid to the different circulation regimes in the Ionian Sea, namely to the anticyclonic and cyclonic phases of the Northern Ionian Gyre (NIG), both of which influence the physical and biochemical properties of the Southern Adriatic. The presented data demonstrate that winter blooms are persistent features of the OSA and they can occur during both anticyclonic and cyclonic phases of the Northern Ionian Gyre, but by different mechanisms. Moreover, intense blooms have occurred under certain hydroclimatic conditions such as the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT) and extremely cold winter years. This was also confirmed by cluster analysis based on satellite Chl-a distribution.

TI  - The use of terrestrial laser scanning for the characterization of a cliff-talus system in the Thompson River Valley, British Columbia, Canada
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A postglacial river terrace along the Thompson River in Interior British Columbia, Canada has been monitored using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and high-resolution photography for almost a 3-year study to observe the deformation and failure processes, which result in changes in the slope morphology. Change detection using Multiscale Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M3C2) and a multi-scale dimensionality analysis (CANUPO) were performed on the 3-dimensional point cloud data to track the deposition patterns occurring in this active cliff talus system. Changes documented in the analysis of TLS data were verified using the high-resolution photography. Over 1.5 m of valley parallel retreat was captured in a section of the cliff face related to instability of a cobble and boulder horizon beneath a thick fluvial gravel unit. Because of the high-resolution remote sensing data, it was possible to observe a longitudinal sorting of grain sizes (i.e. fall sorting) in this cliff-talus system, whereby the size of individual particles controls the position on the slope. The overall mapped distribution of particle sizes on the slope remained constant for the almost 3-year study period. Flows of granular debris were observed in TLS change detection and the CANUPO analysis was able to display the longitudinal and lateral sorting of grain sizes that occurs during flow. This case history demonstrates that high resolution remote sensing data of large slopes permits us to link the geomorphic processes occurring in the cliff face with mass movement and deposition occurring on the talus slope below.

TI  - Mapping estuarine vegetation using satellite imagery: The case of the invasive species <i>Baccharis halimifolia</i> at a Natura 2000 site
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive shrub Baccharis halimifolia is a threat to the environmental health of many estuarine protected areas throughout Europe. It displaces saltmarsh vegetation and creates monospecific stands that diminish the natural diversity. This work aims to develop a procedure to map this invasive species using satellite imagery. Landsat-8 and Sentinel 2A images are compared, along with three classification approaches (pixel-based, object-based, a mixture of both), to determine which combination yields the best B. halimifolia mapping results. All calculations were made using open-source software, including the ORFEO toolbox for the segmentations in the object-based approach, and the Scikit-leam package for the Support Vector Machines classification algorithm. The pixel-based classifications mapped the invasive species with an accuracy of 70% or higher for both images. The Landsat image had higher accuracy in the overall classification of the vegetation, but the Sentinel image proved better suited for mapping B. halimifolia specifically, due to its higher spatial and spectral resolution. In addition, the procedure was implemented using a Landsat image from 2005, and mapped the invasive species with an accuracy of 72% and 88% for producers and users accuracy respectively. The developed procedure represents a valuable tool for restoration projects, allowing for retrospective analyses or relatively low-cost monitoring of B. haiimifolia's current distribution.

TI  - Coupling multitemporal remote sensing with geomorphology and hydrological modeling for post flood recovery in the Strymonas dammed river basin (Greece)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a case study of a long-term integrated monitoring of a flood event which affected part of the Strymonas dammed river basin, a transboundary river with source in Bulgaria, which flows then through Greece to the Aegean Sea. The event, which affected the floodplain downstream the Kerkini dam, started at the beginning of April 2015, due to heavy rain upstream of the monitored area, and lasted for several months, with some water pools still present at the beginning of September, due to the peculiar geomorphological conditions of the watershed. We collected a multi-temporal dataset consisting of a high-resolution, X-band COSMO-SkyMed, and several C-band Sentinel-1 SAR and optical Landsat-8 images of the area. The results allow following the event in time, sketching a multi-temporal map of the post-flood evolution, with relatively high temporal resolution. We then use hydrological modeling to mimic the dynamics of the flooded area against post event weather patterns and thus explain the observed flood extent evolution. We show how integrating remote sensing-derived maps of flooded areas, geomorphological analyses of the landscape and simplified hydrological modeling allows accurate inference about long-term dynamics of flooded areas, very important in the post event in anthropogenic highly modified areas, where recovery time after the flood event is considerable, and long term water persistence may lead to large consequences, carrying economic damages and medical emergencies.

M3  - Review
AB  - Molecular imaging plays a critical role in biomedical research. The combination of different modalities can generate complementary information and provide synergistic advantages over single modality alone. Noninvasive and nonradioactive fluorescent imaging (FI)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dualmodality probes fuse the high sensitivity of FI and the high temporal and spatial resolution and deep-tissue penetration of MRI, and their increasing applications have been reported in biomedical research and clinical practices, including cell labeling, enzyme activity measurement, tumor diagnosis and therapy, and anatomical localization and real-time assessment during surgery.

TI  - Efficiency of remote sensing tools for post-fire management along a climatic gradient
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest managers require reliable tools to evaluate post-fire recovery across different geographic/climatic contexts and define management actions at the landscape scale, which might be highly resource-consuming in terms of data collection. In this sense, remote sensing techniques allow for gathering environmental data over large areas with low collection effort. We aim to assess the applicability of remote sensing tools in post-fire management within and across three mega-fires that occurred in pine fire-prone ecosystems located along an Atlantic-Transition-Mediterranean climatic gradient. Four years after the wildfires, we established 120 2x2m plots in each mega-fire site, where we evaluated: (1) density of pine seedlings, (2) percentage of woody species cover and (3) percentage of dead plant material cover. These variables were modeled following a Bayesian Model Averaging approach on the basis of spectral indices and texture features derived from WorldView-2 satellite imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. We assessed model interpolation and transferability within each mega-fire, as well as model extrapolation between mega-fires along the climatic gradient. Texture features were the predictors that contributed most in all cases. The woody species cover model had the best performance regarding spatial interpolation and transferability within the three study sites, with predictive errors lower than 25% for the two approaches. Model extrapolation between the Transition and Mediterranean sites had low levels of error (from 6% to 19%) for the three field variables, because the landscape in these areas is similar in structure and function and, therefore, in spectral characteristics. However, model extrapolation from the Atlantic site achieved the weakest results (error higher than 30%), due to the large ecological differences between this particular site and the others. This study demonstrates the potential of fine-grained satellite imagery for land managers to conduct post-fire recovery studies with a high degree of generality across different geographic/climatic contexts.

TI  - Environmental drivers of fire severity in extreme fire events that affect Mediterranean pine forest ecosystems
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing occurrence of large and severe fires in Mediterranean forest ecosystems produces major ecological and socio-economic damage. In this study, we aim to identify the main environmental factors driving fire severity in extreme fire events in Pinus fire prone ecosystems, providing management recommendations for reducing fire effects. The study case was a megafire (11,891 ha) that occurred in a Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by Pinus pinaster Aiton in NW Spain. Fire severity was estimated on the basis of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio from Landsat 7 ETM +, validated by the field Composite Bum Index. Model predictors included pre-fire vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index), pre-fire vegetation structure (canopy cover and vertical complexity estimated from LiDAR), weather conditions (spring cumulative rainfall and mean temperature in August), fire history (fire-free interval) and physical variables (topographic complexity, actual evapotranspiration and water deficit). We applied the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to assess the influence of these environmental factors on fire severity. Models explained 42% of the variance using a parsimonious set of five predictors: NDWI, NDVI, time since the last fire, spring cumulative rainfall, and pre-fire vegetation vertical complexity. The results indicated that fire severity was mostly influenced by pre-fire vegetation greenness. Nevertheless, the effect of pre-fire vegetation greenness was strongly dependent on interactions with the pre-fire vertical structural arrangement of vegetation, fire history and weather conditions (i.e. cumulative rainfall over spring season). Models using only physical variables exhibited a notable association with fire severity. However, results suggested that the control exerted by the physical properties may be partially overcome by the availability and structural characteristics of fuel biomass. Furthermore, our findings highlighted the potential of low-density LiDAR for evaluating fuel structure throughout the coefficient of variation of heights. This study provides relevant keys for decision-making on pre-fire management such as fuel treatment, which help to reduce fire severity.

TI  - Using gap-filled MAIAC AOD and WRF-Chem to estimate daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at 1 km resolution in the Eastern United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To link short-term exposures of air pollutants to health outcomes, scientists must use high temporal and spatial resolution estimates of PM2.5 concentrations. In this work, we develop a daily PM2.5 product at 1 x 1 km(2) spatial resolution across the eastern United States (east of 90 degrees W) with the aid of 1 x 1 km(2) MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, 36 x 36 km(2) WRF-Chem output, 1 x 1 km(2) land-use type from the National Land Cover Database, and 0.125 degrees x 0.125 degrees ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorology. A gap-filling technique is applied to MAIAC AOD data to construct robust daily estimates of AOD when the satellite data are missing (e.g., areas obstructed by clouds or snow cover). The input data are incorporated into a multiple-linear regression model trained to surface observations of PM2.5 from the EPA Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring network. The model generates a high-fidelity estimate (r(2) = 0.75 using a 10-fold random cross-validation) of daily PM2.5 throughout the eastern United States. Of the inputs to the statistical model, WRF-Chem output (r(2) = 0.66) is the most important contributor to the skill of the model. MAIAC AOD is also a strong contributor (r(2) = 0.52). Daily PM2.5 output from our statistical model can be easily integrated into county-level epidemiological studies. The novelty of this project is that we are able to simulate PM2.5 in a computationally efficient manner that is constrained to ground monitors, satellite data, and chemical transport model output at high spatial resolution (1 x 1 km(2)) without sacrificing the temporal resolution (daily) or spatial coverage ( > 2,000,000 km(2)).

TI  - Effect of Zeolite-Fe on graphite anode in electroactive biofilm development for application in microbial fuel cells
T2  - APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is highly dependent on the electrode materials. The electrode surface can be modified to provide a favorable environment for biofilms to enhance electron transfer from the bacteria to the anode. In this work, Faujasite zeolite-Y (ZY) was exchanged with iron (Fe) and was used to modify glassy carbon/graphite electrodes (GC/gr-ZY(Fe)) evaluating its effect in electroactive biofilm development for application in microbial fuel cells. The novel material was evaluated as an anode in MFCs by comparing its performance with GC/gr and GC/gr-ZY electrodes. The results show that when using a GC/gr-ZY(Fe) electrode, an electroactive biofilm with good electrochemical activity for acetate degradation can be generated on the electrode surface. The maximum current density obtained with a GC/gr-ZY(Fe)-BF electrode (where BF is biofilm) was 7.7 times higher than that of a GC/gr anode. The modification generates a less hydrophobic electrode surface that facilitates microbial cell attachment, thereby improving bioelectricity production. By using scanning electron microscopy, a homogeneous microbial community with bacteria that had a similar short rod-shaped morphology was observed. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) decreased as the biofilm grew, revealing that the presence of the biofilm facilitated the electrochemical reaction. After 7 days of MFC operation, the GC/gr-ZY(Fe) bioanode showed a reduction in R-ct from 212.9 +/- 1.81 Omega to 151.5 +/- 1.46 Omega, which was 2.4 times lower than that achieved with GC/gr. The biofilm on GC/gr-ZY Fe was characterized using cyclic voltammetry, and the results showed a larger oxidation peak (169.8 mu A cm(-2)) than that of the GC/gr electrode (36.5 mu A cm(-2)), further supporting the better electron-transfer properties of the modified electrode. Additionally, this result confirms the capability of biofilms to act as bioelectrocatalysts under acetate-oxidizing conditions.

TI  - Relation of El Nino and La Nina phenomena to precipitation, evapotranspiration and temperature in the Amazon basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather phenomena El Nino and La Nina are observed by meteorological variables, which allows you to track climate change and its possible effects in certain regions. The objective of this study was to analyze the behavior of rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration in the Amazon river basin (Latitudes 5 degrees N to 20 degrees S and Longitudes 50 degrees W to 80 degrees W), comparing themwith the occurrence of El Nino and La Nina phenomena, fromJanuary 2000 to December 2016. The values referring to the meteorological variables were obtained from the TRMM and MODIS orbital sensors. After data pre-processing, the datawere separated intomonthly and annual scales and per period according to the presence or absence of El Nino and La Nina phenomena. Based on the results obtained, it was observed that the studied variables were affected by modification of both phenomena. The modifications are more noticeable in the distinction between the more and less rainy periods. Among the variables studied, the evapotranspiration was severely affected in the rainiest months, the La Nina phenomenon, and the least rainy months, El Nino. Thus, itwas possible to conclude that, in general, the presence of La Nina increased precipitation values in comparison to the Neutral period, but the inverse occurs in the presence of El Nino. The methodology applied in the present study was adequate for the analysis of the modifications of the meteorological variables coming from the El Nino and La Nina phenomena, being able to be adapted to other variables and regions.

Good understanding of the drivers of NDVI patterns is hindered by the difficulties in disentangling the effects of environmental factors from anthropogenic changes, by the limited number of environmental predictors studied, and by the diversity of responses according to periods and land covers. This study aims to improve our understanding of the different environmental drivers of NDVI spatial variations for different stand type characteristics of mountain and Mediterranean biomes. Using NDVI values extracted from MODES Terra time series, we calculated Spring Greenness (SG) and annual Relative Greenness (RGRE) to depict spring and summer vegetation activity, respectively, in a contrasted area of 10,255 km(2) located in the south of France. We modeled SG and RGRE at different scales. using 20 environmental predictors characterizing available energy, water supply, and nutrient supply calculated for different periods of the year. In spring, high minimum temperatures, good nitrogen availability, and acidic or neutral pH turned out to be determining for greenness, particularly for stand types located in altitude. In summer, an important soil water reserve and low temperatures promoted vegetation dynamics, particularly for stands located in areas with a Mediterranean climate. Our results show that NDVI dynamics was not only driven by climatic variability, and should not be studied using only mean temperature and rainfall. They highlight that different environmental factors act complementarily, and that soil parameters characterizing water stress and soil nutrition should be taken into account. While the factors limiting NDVI values varied according to the season and the position of the stands along the ecological gradients, we identified a global temperature and water-stress threshold when considering the whole vegetation.

TI  - Phytoplankton blooms associated with upwelling at Cabo Catoche
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the spatial and temporal implications of the Non-Eastern Boundary Upwelling (Non-EBUS) on the bio-productivity from coastal shallow waters have been studied. At the coast of Cabo Catoche, on the Yucatan shelf, two 12-day field campaigns (April and July) were conducted. Cross-shore CTD-fluorescence profiles, water samples, and plankton were collected each day. Nutrients, ocean temperature and currents times series from two moorings (8 and 12 m depth) were analyzed, as were temperature and chlorophyll (Chl-a) from satellite data. The water masses from the Yucatan channel reached the coast of Cabo Catoche in both study periods. The Yucatan Upwelling Water (YUW, similar to 19.6-22.5 degrees C) supplied the surface and subsurface water, up to 6 km offshore, with nutrients during the upwelling pulses from 2 to 5 days. Nutrients were higher in April (nitrate, ammonium < 5, 18 mu mol L-1), but the phytoplankton bloom was more consistent in July (Chl-a mean, 1.45 mg m(-3)) showing greater distribution across the coast. The steady upwelling plume (cold water, high nutrients) recorded in Cabo Catoche and observed on the north shelf, could have been the result of dynamic uplift in the Yucatan Channel prior to the field campaign. Through the way to the shelf, the plankton increased, explaining the high temporal association between low temperatures and the phytoplankton bloom at the coast. The Non-EBUS has strong implications for the pelagic ecosystem from Cabo Catoche, enhancing productivity and triggering energy flow by the physical process.

TI  - Annual dynamics of carbon dioxide fluxes over a rainfed alfalfa field in the US Southern Great Plains
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A thorough investigation of annual dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes with respect to major controlling factors and harvest management is lacking for rainfed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a high quality perennial legume forage. To address this knowledge gap, this study reports two years (April 2016 - March 2018) of eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes over a rainfed alfalfa field in central Oklahoma, USA. Alfalfa yields were strongly regulated by amount and timing of rainfall. As a result, cumulative dry forage yield was similar to 7.5 t ha(-1) (four harvests) in 2016 (dry year) and similar to 10t ha(-1) (five harvests) in 2017 (wet year). An optimum air temperature (TO and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was approximately 25 degrees C and 2.2 kPa, respectively. The response of gross primary production (GPP) to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) varied with growth stage of alfalfa and climatic conditions (i.e., dry or normal/wet periods). Daily (8-day averages) NEE and gross primary production (GPP) reached -8.17 and 16.69 g C m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Magnitudes of GPP (GPP(MOD)) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were < 50% of tower-derived GPP, most likely due to a smaller value (0.15 g C mol(-1) PAR) for light use efficiency in the GPP(MOD) algorithm. The observed 8-day composite ecosystem light use efficiency (ELUE) was up to 0.36 g C mol(-1) PAR in this study. The rainfed alfalfa field with 4-5 hay harvests per year showed large carbon uptake potential (e.g., cumulative NEE of -454 g C m(-2) in 2017) at an annual scale. The GPP and ELUE showed a strong correspondence with MODIS-derived vegetation indices, indicating the potential of applying satellite remote sensing to upscale site-level observations of CO2 fluxes for alfalfa to larger spatial scales.

TI  - Long-term and inter-monthly dynamics of aquatic vegetation and its relation with environmental factors in Taihu Lake, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discussed the long-term and inter-monthly variation in the distribution area of aquatic macrophytes in Taihu Lake, as well as the relationship between these variations and environmental factors. The findings were of great significance to the protection and environmental remediation of lake ecosystems. This paper presented data from 92 periods during 1980 to 2017 on the distribution area of aquatic macrophytes (including submerged macrophytes and floating-leaved macrophytes, but excluding emergent macrophytes) in Taihu Lake. Data were acquired by remote-sensing and subsequent image interpretation. The analysis of the inter-monthly variation indicated that the area occupied by aquatic macrophytes first increased and then decreased from January to December. Specifically, the distribution area was very small from January to March, began to increase gradually from April to August, reached its maximum in September, and decreased gradually from October to December. The analysis of the long-term variation showed that the distribution and area of aquatic macrophytes experienced two stages during the years 1980 to 2017:1) gradual increase, 2) sharp decrease. In the first stage (1980 to 2014), the area occupied by aquatic macrophytes increased by 9 times, the maximum distribution area was 206.27 km(2) (in May), 307.92 km2 (in September) and 277.33 km(2) (in October). In the second stage (2015 to 2017), the distribution area of aquatic macrophytes decreased sharply to 50 km(2) or less. The distribution area of aquatic macrophytes during the months of January to December had a significant positive correlation with monthly average temperature, CODMn value, secchi disk depth(SDD), area of cyanobacteria and chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) concentration, a significant negative correlation with water quality indices such as dissolved oxygen (DO) value and NH3-N concentration, but no significant correlation with water quality indices such as pH values and total suspended matter (TSM) concentration. The distribution area of aquatic macrophytes from 1980 to 2017 had a significant positive correlation with annual average temperature, annual minimum water level, pH value, SDD, area of cyanobacteria and Chl-alpha concentration, but no significant correlation with water quality indices such as DO value, CODMn value, NH3-N concentration and TSM concentration. The sharp decrease in the distribution area of aquatic macrophytes in 2015 and subsequent years was primarily due to the mechanized salvage of aquatic plants. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Do pro-environmental values, beliefs and norms drive farmers' interest in novel practices fostering the Bioeconomy?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A transition towards a bio-based economy is accompanied by a growing demand for biomass resources as fossil fuels need to be replaced for the more sustainable production of consumer goods, chemicals and energy. To increase the supply of renewable biomass and avoid a conflict with food production, currently underutilized by-products (i.e. leaves, stems) from horticultural production could be valorised as feedstock. The success of this approach depends on farmers' willingness to adopt novel practices like the collection and treatment of plant leaves. However, literature on factors influencing farmers' decisions to adopt novel practices aimed to foster the Bioeconomy is limited. This paper addresses this gap by exploring drivers of farmers' interest in the valorisation of by-products. To this aim, the Value-Belief-Norm theory was used and expanded by contextual factors, such as the perceived market demand for biomass and future environmental policies. A survey with German fruit and vegetable farmers (N = 96) has been carried out and data have been analysed with a Structural Equation Model. Findings suggest that the Value-Belief-Norm theory is a relevant framework for the agricultural domain to predict farmers' interest in the valorisation of horticultural by-products. Results further indicate that an internal ecological worldview is potentially relevant for farmers' perception of contextual conditions aimed to foster the Bioeconomy. These outcomes could have managerial and policy implications associated with the identification of potential lead users to trigger the diffusion of innovative sustainable practices and generally foster the Bioeconomy.

TI  - Exploring the effects of crop residue burning on local haze pollution in Northeast China using ground and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used ground-measured air pollutants and various remote sensing and meteorological datasets to explore the possible causes of the severe particulate matter (PM) pollution episodes of October and November 2015 in Northeast China. The three pollution episodes in different regions were elaborately characterized by analyzing the time variation of PM2.5 and other pollutants, e.g., CO, NO2, and SO2. The results from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) revealed that during the study period, dramatic crop residue burning occurred in Northeast China. Combining its time variation and spatial distribution with air pollutants, the crop residue burning was inferred to have a direct influence on the first and second pollution episodes, especially in Heilongjiang Province. Since a cold wave swept Northeast China beginning on 4th November, the PM pollutants were assumed to be transported southward. This assumption was further verified by the backward and forward trajectory models. Additionally, the suddenly increased relative humidity beginning on 7th November and the week of no wind after the cold wave also greatly contributed to the most severe pollution of Liaoning and Jilin on approximately 8th November. Lastly, we compared air quality indexes and pollutants from remote sensing with ground-measured datasets; the results indicated that there were certain correlations and spatial consistency between the two types of datasets, except for UVAI, which is meaningful to the area without an effective ground monitoring network.

TI  - Ground-based evaluation of MODIS snow cover product V6 across China: Implications for the selection of NDSI threshold
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The new MODIS daily NDSI snow cover product version 6 (V6) is released to replace V5 with significant revisions. This study evaluates, for the first time, the accuracy of product V6 across China based on daily snow-depth measurements during 2003-2013 from 279 and 252 stations for Terra and Aqua, respectively. Three schemes of selecting NDSI thresholds for Terra and Aqua were tested and compared including: (1) the locally optimal NDSI threshold, (2) the minimum valid NDSI of 0.1, and (3) the global reference NDSI threshold of 0.4. The mean Cohen's Kappa (CK) of the optimal, minimum and global reference thresholds for Terra (Aqua) are 0.80 (0.60), 0.77 (0.58), 0.72 (0.51), respectively, while snow depth 1 cm. The NDSI threshold of 0.1 is demonstrated to be more reasonable than the threshold of 0.4 for use in China This is also supported by the accuracy comparison conducted for the dear-day snow-cover day calculation. Terra V6 and Terra V5 have comparable accuracies whereas Aqua V6 shows better accuracy than Aqua V5 does. The revised temperature screen algorithm employed in V6 is found to be problematic with large snow commission errors in high altitude stations. Regionally, product V6 presents low CKs of 0.61 and 0.35 for the optimal thresholds of Terra and Aqua in the Tibetan Plateau, which are attributed to its high elevation and relatively small snow depth. This study provides practical implications for use of MODIS snow cover production V6 in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validation of Himawari-8 aerosol optical depth retrievals over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution (every 10 min) aerosol observations are rarely provided by satellite sensors. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8 can provide aerosol optical depth (AOD) over China with this frequency. The sensor provides great opportunity to retrieve the particle matter near the ground and improve air quality modeling using the aerosol products. However, there is still lack of quality validation about AHI AOD. A comprehensive research was conducted to evaluate the performance of AHI aerosol products based on sixteen sun-photometers stations in AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network (SONET) over China. The overall comparison of AHI AOD and ground AOD shows a high correlation (R-2 = 0.67). However, there is only 55% of AHI AOD falling in the expected error envelops ( +/- 0.05 +/- 0.2*AOD( ground)). AOD bias between AHI AOD and ground AOD increases with the AOD magnitude. The accuracy of AHI AOD is also highly depend on seasons and surface land cover types. Best performance of AHI aerosol retrievals is shown in summer and for urban region. The diurnal variability validation shows that AHI AOD catch the diurnal AOD variations well, especially for summer. Large differences between AHI AOD and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) aerosol products are shown, especially for northwest China. The analysis indicates that the uncertainties of AHI aerosol retrievals are induced by large errors of aerosol models and surface reflectance estimation in the algorithm.

TI  - Seasonal and diurnal variability in O<sub>3</sub>, black carbon, and CO measured at the Rwanda Climate Observatory
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is understudied in sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in a gap in the scientific understanding of emissions, atmospheric processes, and impacts of air pollutants in this region. The Rwanda Climate Observatory, a joint partnership between MIT and the government of Rwanda, has been measuring ambient concentrations of key long-lived greenhouse gases and the short-lived climate-forcing pollutants CO2, CO, CH4, black carbon (BC), and O-3 with state-of-the-art instruments on the summit of Mt. Mugogo (1.586 degrees S, 29.566 degrees E; 2590 m above sea level) since May 2015. Rwanda is a small, mountainous, and densely populated country in equatorial East Africa, currently undergoing rapid development but still at less than 20 % urbanization. Black carbon concentrations during Rwanda's two dry seasons (December-January-February, DJF, and June-July- August, JJA), which coincide with the two regional biomass burning seasons, are higher at Mt. Mugogo than in major European cities with daily values (24 h) during the dry season of around 5 mu g M-3 (daily average concentrations ranging from less than 0.1 to over 17 mu g m(-3) for the entire measurement period). BC baseline concentrations during biomass burning seasons are loosely correlated with fire radiative power data for the region acquired with a MODIS satellite instrument. The position and meteorology of Rwanda is such that the emissions transported from both the northern and southern African biomass burning seasons affect BC, CO, and O-3 concentrations in Rwanda. Spectral aerosol absorption measured with a dual-spot Aethalometer varies seasonally due to changes in types of fuel burned and the direction of pollution transport to the site. Ozone concentrations peaked during Rwanda's dry seasons (daily measured maximum of 70 ppbv). The understanding and quantification of the percent contributions of regional and local (beyond large-scale biomass) emissions is essential to guide policy in the region. During the rainy seasons, local emitting activities (e.g., cooking, transportation, trash burning) remain steady, regional biomass burning is low, and transport distances are shorter as rainout of pollution occurs regularly. Thus, local pollution at Mugogo can be estimated during this time period and was found to account for up to 35 % of annual average BC measured. Our measurements indicate that air pollution is a current and growing problem in equatorial East Africa.

TI  - The use of QBO, ENSO, and NAO perturbations in the evaluation of GOME-2 MetOp A total ozone measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we present evidence that quasi cyclical perturbations in total ozone (quasi-biennial oscillation QBO, El Nifio Southern Oscillation ENSO, and North Atlantic Oscillation NAO) can be used as independent proxies in evaluating Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) 2 aboard MetOp A (GOME-2A) satellite total ozone data, using ground-based (GB) measurements, other satellite data, and chemical transport model calculations. The analysis is performed in the frame of the validation strategy on longer time scales within the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility on Atmospheric Composition Monitoring (AC SAF) project, covering the period 2007-2016. Comparison of GOME-2A total ozone with ground observations shows mean differences of about 0.7 +/- 1.4 % in the tropics (0-30), about +0.1 +/- 2.1 % in the mid-latitudes (30-60), and about +2.5 +/- 3.2 % and 0.0 +/- 4.3 % over the northern and southern high latitudes (6080), respectively. In general, we find that GOME-2A total ozone data depict the QBO ENSO NAO natural fluctuations in concurrence with the co-located solar backscatter ultraviolet radiometer (SBUV), GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV; composed of total ozone observations from GOME, SCIAMACHY SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY, GOME-2A, and OMI ozone monitoring instrument, combined into one homogeneous time series), and ground based observations. Total ozone from GOME-2A is well correlated with the QBO (highest correlation in the tropics of +0.8) in agreement with SBUV, GTO-ECV, and GB data which also give the highest correlation in the tropics. The differences between deseazonalized GOME-2A and GB total ozone in the tropics are within +/- 1 %. These differences were tested further as to their correlations with the QBO. The differences had practically no QBO signal, providing an independent test of the stability of the long-term variability of the satellite data. Correlations between GOME-2A total ozone and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were studied over the tropical Pacific Ocean after removing seasonal, QBO, and solar-cycle-related variability. Correlations between ozone and the SOI are on the order of +0.5, consistent with SBUV and GB observations. Differences between GOME-2A and GB measurements at the station of Samoa (American Samoa; 14.25 degrees S, 170.6 degrees W) are within 1.9 %. We also studied the impact of the NAO on total ozone in the northern mid-latitudes in winter. We find very good agreement between GOME-2A and GB observations over Canada and Europe as to their NAO-related variability, with mean differences reaching the +/- 1 % levels. The agreement and small differences which were found between the independently produced total ozone datasets as to the influence of the QBO, ENSO, and NAO show the importance of these climatological proxies as additional tool for monitoring the long-term stability of satellite ground-truth biases.

TI  - Tree-ring isotopes capture interannual vegetation productivity dynamics at the biome scale
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical and future trends in net primary productivity (NPP) and its sensitivity to global change are largely unknown because of the lack of long-term, high-resolution data. Here we test whether annually resolved tree-ring stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopes can be used as proxies for reconstructing past NPP. Stable isotope chronologies from four sites within three distinct hydroclimatic environments in the eastern United States (US) were compared in time and space against satellite-derived NPP products, including the long-term Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) NPP (1982-2011), the newest high-resolution Landsat NPP (1986-2015), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS, 2001-2015) NPP. We show that tree-ring isotopes, in particular delta O-18, correlate strongly with satellite NPP estimates at both local and large geographical scales in the eastern US. These findings represent an important breakthrough for estimating interannual variability and long-term changes in terrestrial productivity at the biome scale.

TI  - Evidence of sustained reductions in the relative risk of acute hepatitis B and C virus infections, and the increasing burden of hepatitis a virus infection in Egypt: comparison of sentinel acute viral hepatitis surveillance results, 2001-17
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Egypt ranks fifth for the burden of viral hepatitis worldwide. As part of Egypt's renewed national strategy for the elimination of viral hepatitis, surveillance for acute viral hepatitis (AVH) was re-established during 2014-2017 to describe the current epidemiology and associated risk factors, and changes from surveillance conducted during 2001-2004.Patients with suspected AVH were enrolled, completed a questionnaire, and provided blood for testing for hepatitis viruses A (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), D, and E (HEV) infections by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Odds ratios and Chi(2) were used to detect differences between hepatitis types by patient characteristics and exposures. Newcombe-Wilson method was used to compare results between surveillance periods 2001-2004 and 2014-2017.Between 2014 and 2017, among 9321 patients enrolled, 8362 (89.7%) had one or more markers of AVH including 7806 (93.4%) HAV, 252 (3.0%) HCV, 238 (2.8%) HBV, and 31 (0.4%) HEV infection. HAV infection occurred most commonly among children < 16 years age, while HBV infection occurred among ages 16-35 years and HCV infection in ages greater than 45 years. Healthcare-associated exposures were significantly associated with HBV and HCV infections compared to HAV infection including receiving therapeutic injections, surgery, wound suture, or urinary catheter and IV line insertions, while significant lifestyle exposures included exposure to blood outside the healthcare system, IV drug use, or incarceration. Exposures significantly associated with HAV infection were attending nursery or pre-school, contact with person attending nursery or pre-school, having meals outside the home, or contact with HAV case. Compared with AVH surveillance during 2001-2004, there was a significant increase in the proportion of HAV infections from 40.2 to 89.7% (RR = 2.3) with corresponding reductions in the proportions of HBV and HCV infections from 30.0 to 2.8% (RR = 0.1) and 29.8 to 3.0% (RR = 0.1), respectively.Healthcare-associated exposures were significantly association with and remain the greatest risk for HBV and HCV infections in Egypt. Additional studies to evaluate factors associated with the reductions in HBV and HCV infections, and cost effectiveness of routine HAV immunization might help Egypt guide and evaluate control measures.

TI  - Landscape and local site variables differentially influence pollinators and pollination services in urban agricultural sites
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as agricultural and semi-natural habitats are converted into landscapes dominated by built features. Urban agricultural sites are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for smaller bee species. Local site design coupled with regional urban planning can advance the success of urban agriculture, while benefiting biodiversity by creating opportunities for pollinator conservation in urban landscapes.

TI  - Estimating vegetation water content during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation water content (VWC) is an important land surface parameter that is used in retrieving surface soil moisture from microwave satellite platforms. Operational approaches utilize relationships between VWC and satellite vegetation indices for broad categories of vegetation, i.e., "agricultural crops," based on climatological databases. Determining crop type-specific equations for water content could lead to improvements in the soil moisture retrievals. Data to address this issue are lacking, and as a part of the calibration and validation program for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission, field experiments are conducted in northern central Iowa and southern Manitoba to investigate the performance of the SMAP soil moisture products for these intensive agricultural regions. Both sites are monitored for soil moisture, and the calibration and validation assessments had indicated performance issues in both domains. One possible source could be the characterization of the vegetation. In this investigation, Landsat 8 data are used to compute a normalized difference water index for the entire summer of 2016 that is then integrated with extensive VWC sampling to determine how to best characterize daily estimates of VWC for improved algorithm implementation. In Iowa, regression equations for corn and soybean are developed that provided VWC with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 1.37 and 1.10 kg/m(2), respectively. In Manitoba, corn and soybean equations are developed with RMSE values of 0.55 and 0.25 kg/m(2). Additional crop-specific equations are developed for winter wheat (RMSE of 0.07 kg/m(2)), canola (RMSE of 0.90 kg/m(2)), oats (RMSE of 0.74 kg/m(2)), and black beans (RMSE of 0.31 kg/m(2)). Overall, the conditions are judged to be typical with the exception of soybeans, which had an exceptionally high biomass as a result of significant rainfall as compared to previous studies in this region. Future implementation of these equations into algorithm development for satellite and airborne radiative transfer modeling will improve the overall performance in agricultural domains.

TI  - Field evaluation of seasonal trends in relative population sizes and dispersal pattern of Aedes albopictus males in support of the design of a sterile male release strategy
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTo develop an efficient sterile insect technique (SIT) programme, the number of sterile males to release, along with the spatial and temporal pattern of their release, has to be determined. Such parameters could be estimated from a reliable estimation of the wild population density (and its temporal variation) in the area to treat. Here, a series of mark-release-recapture experiments using laboratory-reared and field-derived Aedes albopictus males were carried out in Duparc, a selected pilot site for the future application of SIT in the north of La Reunion Island.MethodsThe dispersal, longevity of marked males and seasonal fluctuations in the population size of native mosquitoes were determined from the ratio of marked to unmarked males caught in mice-baited BG-Sentinel traps. The study was conducted during periods of declining population abundance (April), lowest abundance (September) and highest abundance (December).ResultsAccording to data collected in the first 4 days post-release, the Lincoln index estimated population size as quite variable, ranging from 5817 in April, to 639 in September and 5915 in December. Calculations of daily survival probability to 4 days after release for field and laboratory males were 0.91 and 0.98 in April, respectively, and 0.88 and 0.84 in September, respectively. The mean distance travelled (MDT) of released field males were 46 m, 67 m and 37 m for December, April and September experiments, respectively. For released laboratory males, the MDT was 65 m and 42 m in April and September, respectively.ConclusionsTheoretically, the most efficient release programme should be started in July/August when the mosquito population size is the lowest (c.600 wild males/ha relative to 5000 wild males estimated for December and April), with a weekly release of 6000 males/ha. The limited dispersal of Ae. albopictus males highlights the nessecity for the widespread release of sterile males over multiple sites and in a field setting to avoid topographical barriers and anthropogenic features that may block the migration of the released sterile male mosquitoes.

TI  - Earth observations and integrative models in support of food and water security.
T2  - Remote sensing in earth systems sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Global food production depends upon many factors that Earth observing satellites routinely measure about water, energy, weather, and ecosystems. Increasingly sophisticated, publicly-available satellite data products can improve efficiencies in resource management and provide earlier indication of environmental disruption. Satellite remote sensing provides a consistent, long-term record that can be used effectively to detect large-scale features over time, such as a developing drought. Accuracy and capabilities have increased along with the range of Earth observations and derived products that can support food security decisions with actionable information. This paper highlights major capabilities facilitated by satellite observations and physical models that have been developed and validated using remotely-sensed observations. Although we primarily focus on variables relevant to agriculture, we also include a brief description of the growing use of Earth observations in support of aquaculture and fisheries.

TI  - Wildfires as a major challenge for natural regeneration in Atlantic Forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural regeneration management is a good strategy of ecological restoration of the Atlantic Forest, one of the most devastated biomes on the planet. However, the frequent occurrence of wildfires is one of the challenges to the success of this method. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of wildfires on forest dynamics in Atlantic Forest. The studied area was explored during the coffee cycle when plantations replaced primary forests. We used remote sensing data to analyze the forest dynamics over a period of 50 years (1966-2016). We used the INPE burn database to find the occurrence of hot spots from 1998 to 2016. During this period, we selected the years most affected by the fires for the identification of fire scars using the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. From this set of information, we used the methodology of weights of evidence to relate forest dynamics and wildfire events with biophysical and anthropic variables. The results showed that in 1966 the forest area accounted for 8.01% of the land cover, and in 2016 this number rose to 18.55% due to the spontaneous natural regeneration process. The regenerating areas were mainly related to the proximity of the remaining fragments and the portions of the landscape receiving the least amount of global solar radiation. The proximity to urban areas, roads and highways, damaged regeneration and favored both deforestation and wildfire events. Fire scars preferentially occur where there is greater sun exposure. It is possible to observe a negative correlation between the natural regeneration process and the fire scars. We concluded that fire severity is one of the factors that shape the landscape of the region while slowing the regeneration process in preferential areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Conjunctive use of <i>in situ</i> gas sampling and chromatography with geospatial analysis to estimate greenhouse gas emissions of a large Amazonian hydroelectric reservoir
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydroelectric power reservoirs are considered potential contributors to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere through the emittance of methane and carbon dioxide. We combined in situ sampling and gas chromatography with geostatistical and remote sensing approaches to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a large hydropower reservoir. We used remote sensing data to estimate the water surface and geospatial interpolation to calculate total emissions as a function of reservoir surface area. The CH4 and CO2 gas concentrations were linearly correlated to sampling time, confirming the adequacy of the in situ sampling method to measure GHG diffusive fluxes fromreservoirwater surfaces. The combination of high purity (99.99%) ISO-normgas standardswith a gas chromatograph, enabled us to achieve low measurement detection limits of 0.16 and 0.60 mu mol mol-1, respectively, for CH4 (using a flame ionization or FID detector) and CO2 (using a thermal conductivity or TCD detector). Our results show that CO2 emissions are significantly (an order of 5.10(2) - 10(3)) higher than those of CH4 in both the spatial and temporal domain for this reservoir. The total diffusive GHG emissions over a year (June 2011 to May 2012) of the Tucurui hydropower reservoir being in operation, in units of tons of carbon, added up to 6.82 x 10(3) for CH4 and 1.19 x 10(6) for CO2. We show that in situ GHG sampling using small floating gas chambers and high precision gas chromatography can be combined with geospatial interpolation techniques and remote sensing data to obtain estimates of diffusive GHG emissions from large water bodies with fluctuating water surfaces such as hydropower reservoirs. We recommend that more measurements and observations on these emissions are pursued in order to support and better quantify the ongoing discussions on estimates and mitigation of GHG emissions from reservoirs in the Amazon region and elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of aeolian desertification based on multiple indicators in Horqin Sandy Land, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian desertification has become one of the most serious environmental and socioeconomic problems facing the world today. Quantitative remote sensing technology is an important means to achieve the development trends of aeolian desertified land (ADL). To compensate for the shortcomings in the time scale of Landsat The matic Mapper and other high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data, this study introduces Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer time series data and products to invert the monitoring indicators of ADL. The QUEST (quick, unbiased, and efficient statistical tree) classification method was used to establish the extraction model of ADL based on multiple indicators. The ADL time series dataset was extracted from 2000 to 2015, and the characteristics of ADL and its spatial-temporal dynamics were analyzed. These results were combined with meteorological data and socioeconomic statistics to discuss the main factors influencing ADL. The results showed that, by the end of 2015, the total area of ADL was 32,633 km(2), accounting for 26.02% of the study area. The slight, moderate, severe, and extremely severe ADL accounted for 51.39%, 34.11%, 10.31%, and 4.20%, respectively. The total area of ADL decreased significantly at a rate of 2388.60 km(2) y(-1) from 2000 to 2015. The decreasing area was dominated by the slight and moderate ADL. The reversal of ADL exhibited significant correlations with an increase of annual precipitation and a decrease of annual maximum wind velocity (p < 0.01). The impact of annual maximum wind velocity on ADL is more important than annual precipitation. Increases in population density and the number of livestock did not promote the development of ADL. A series of ecological protection projects and policies created advantageous conditions for the reversal of ADL. This research provides a new method for monitoring ADL and useful information for controlling and managing aeolian desertification in this region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the pathogenic surveillance programs and related factors on bacillary dysentery in Beijing, 2008-2017, to provide evidence for the practices of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the disease. Methods: Analysis was conducted on surveillance data of bacillary dysentery, collected from the surveillance areas of national bacillary dysentery in Beijing. Shigella positive rate of stool samples were used as the gold standard while detection rate of Shigella, diagnostic accordance rate and resistance were computed on data from the surveillance programs. Chi-square test was used to compare the rates and unconditional logistic regression was used to analyze the related factors of Shigella infection. Results: Both the reported incidence rate on bacillary dysentery and detection rate of Shigella in diarrhea patients showed significantly decreasing trend, from 2008 to 2017. The accordance rate of bacillary dysentery was only 7.80% (111/1 423). Shigella sonnei was the most frequently isolated strain (73.95%, 159/215) followed by Shigella flexnery. Results from the multivariate logistic regression of Shigella positive rate revealed that among those patients who were routine test of stool positive vs. routine test of stool positive (OR=1.863, 95%CI: 1.402-2.475), onset from July to October vs. other months'time (OR=7.271, 95%CI: 4.514-11.709) temperature ≥38 ℃vs. temperature <38 ℃(OR=4.516, 95%CI: 3.369-6.053) and age from 6 to 59 years old vs. other ages (OR=1.617, 95%CI: 1.085-2.410), presenting higher positive detection rates of Shigella from the stool tests. The resistant rates on ampicillin and nalidixic acid were 97.57% (201/206) and 94.90% (186/196), both higher than on other antibiotics. The resistant rates on ciprofloxacin (16.33%, 32/196), ofloxacin (9.57%, 11/115) and on amoxilin (15.05%, 31/206) were relatively low. The resistant rate appeared higher on Shigella flexnery than on Shigella sonnei. The proportion of strains with resistance on 3 more drugs, was 30.00%(21/70). Conclusions: The diagnostic accordance rate of bacillary dysentery in Beijing was low, with severe resistance of Shigella. Our findings suggested that clinicians should take multiple factors into account in their practices about epidemiological history, clinical symptom and testing results for diarrhea patients.

TI  - Quantifying urban heat island intensity and its physical mechanism using WRF/UCM
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable quantification of urban heat island intensity (UHII) is crucial for the evaluation of extreme heat waves and the related heat stress. As a powerful approach for the study of urban climate, numericalmodels can simulate urban heat island (UHI) in both high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, accurate quantification of UHII using modelling grid data is still a challenge at present, due to the different criterions for the selection of urban/rural grids. This study simulates the high-resolution UHI in the city of Berlin using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Urban Canopy Module. A new method to quantify UHII, which is based on the fitted linear functions of simulated 2-m air temperature (T-2m) using the impervious surface area inWRF grids (ISA(WRF)), was adopted and evaluated. The simulated T-2m matches the observations well, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 (P < 0.01) and RMSE of 1.76 degrees C. The study area shows a strong UHI at nighttime. The simulated nighttime T-2m increases with the increase in the ISAWRF. The linear functions of simulated nighttime T-2m against ISAWRF are well fitted. The UHII is calculated as the products of the slopes of fitted functions and the largest ISAWRF. The derived UHII shows U-shaped diurnal variations, with high values at nighttime. The difference of simulated surface temperature and sensible heat flux between the impervious surface and the vegetation surface jointly determines the derived UHII. The large difference of surface temperature and the small difference of sensible heat flux between the impervious and the vegetation surface generate the high UHII at nighttime and vice versa during the daytime. The method of ISA(WRF)-based function of T-2m overcomes the problems of traditional methods in arbitrary selecting urban/rural grids. It can be used easily to quantify UHII and to do the comparison study of UHII between different cities. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For effective determination of parameters, optical remote sensing data need to be acquired at high spatial and high temporal resolutions. However, this is challenging due to interference of cloud cover and rather long revisiting cycles of high resolution satellite sensors. Spatio-temporal fusion of multi-source remote sensing data may represent a feasible solution. Here, crop phenology-related parameters in the SAFY model were derived using an improved Two-Step Filtering (TSF) model from remote sensing data generated through spatio-temporal fusion of Landsat-8 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Remaining parameters were determined through an optimization procedure using the same dataset. The SAFY model was then used for dry aboveground biomass and yield estimation at a subfield scale for corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max). The results show that the improved TSF method is able to determine crop phenology stages with an error of <5 days. After calibration, the SAFY model can reproduce daily Green Leaf Area Index (GLAI) effectively throughout the growing season and estimate crop biomass and yield accurately at a subfield scale using three Landsat-8 and 10 MODIS images acquired for the season. This approach improves the accuracy of biomass estimation by about 4% in relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), compared with the SAFY model without forcing the phenology-related parameters. The RMSE of yield estimation is 146.33 g/m(2) for corn and 82.86 g/m(2) for soybean. The proposed framework is applicable for local-scale or field-scale phenology detection and yield estimation.

TI  - Implications of meteorological and physiographical parameters on dengue fever occurrences in Delhi
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue Fever has become an increasing public health concern around the world due to its serious health consequences including death, lack of effective vaccine and specific treatment. Influence of area specific meteorological and physiographical characteristics on the spread of infectious diseases need to be studied to understand spatial-temporal aspects of infectious diseases in a particular area. Mathematical relationships between various explanatory variables (causative factors) and Dengue Fever incidences have been established to quantify and prioritize the influence of various factors. So that, effective health care services could be provided in these areas. The study successfully explains the occurrences of Dengue Fever in Delhi in term of geo-spatial phenomena/variables. Meteorological data of 13 stations in Delhi at hourly temporal scale for a period 2006-2015 have been used along with multi-spectral satellite data. Data on reported cases of Dengue Fever on daily basis and for a period of ten years from 2006 to 2015 have been obtained for Delhi. Python modules have been developed to extract values of geospatial parameters and to perform Poisson regression. To assess the accuracy of developed Poisson regression based equations, r-squared and error statistics have been calculated. Results indicate strong association of Dengue Fever incidences with temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours, built-up and vegetation density and distance from dairy locations, waterbodies and drainage network. Further, critical ranges of various parameters favouring high number of Dengue Fever incidences have been determined. These findings have significant public health implications for control and prevention of Dengue Fever incidences in Delhi city and surrounding region. Occurrences of Dengue Fever incidences are found to be highest in the month of September and October. These months represent transition period from rainy season to winter season. It is recommended that further study should focus on detailed analysis of causative factors in this period. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Experimental tests for improving buildability of construction methods for high-strength concrete columns in high-rise buildings
T2  - STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF TALL AND SPECIAL BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-strength concrete columns have the advantage of increasing the amount of usable area in the building because the cross-section of the columns takes up less space compared with columns using normal strength concrete. However, it is difficult to weld the steel reinforcement and steel members because of the narrow column width due to a decrease in the cross-section of the column, thereby causing construction delay in many cases. In this paper, five construction methods with different details for high-strength reinforced concrete columns are tested to improve the buildability of the columns. Five specimens with different construction details were tested and analyzed based on four aspects: (a) the relationship between load and displacements, (b) strain distributions, (c) axial stiffness, and (d) crack patterns. Specimens were constructed using concrete with a compressive strength of 55 MPa, and the design strength of all five specimens were set to about 10,740 kN. From results of the experiment, the specimen with a reduced number of vertical reinforcements from 24 of HD22 (SD400, Fy = 400 MPa) to 16 of UD22 (SD600, Fy = 600 MPa) was the most effective specimen to improve the buildability of the column without deteriorating the structural performance of the reference specimen.

TI  - Characterization of vertical distribution and radiative forcing of ambient aerosol over the Yangtze River Delta during 2013-2015
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the central part of eastern China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, with its rapid economic growth and industrial expansion, has experienced severe air quality issues. In this study, the monthly variation and interaction between aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) and aerosol vertical structure during 2013-2015 over the YRD were investigated using ground-based observations from a Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) and a CE-318 sun-photometer. Combining satellite products from MODIS and CALIPSO, and reanalysis wind fields, an integrated discussion of a biomass burning episode in Hangzhou during August 2015 was conducted by applying analysis of optical properties, planetary boundary layer (PBL), spatial-temporal and vertical distributions, backward trajectories, Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF), and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT). The results reveal that a shallower PBL coincides with higher scattering extinction at low altitude, resulting in less heating to the atmosphere and radiative forcing to the surface, which in turn further depresses the PBL. In months with a deeper PBL, the extinction coefficient decreases rapidly with altitude, showing stronger atmospheric heating effects and ADRF to the surface, facilitating the turbulence and vertical diffusion of aerosol particles, which further reduces the extinction and raises the PBL. Because of the hygroscopic growth facilitated by high relative humidity, June stands out for its high scattering extinction coefficient and relatively low PBL, and the reduced ADRF at the surface and the enhanced cooling effect on near-surface layer in turn depresses the PBL. Absorptive aerosols transported from biomass burning events located in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Taiwan provinces at 1.5 km, result in high ADRF efficiency for atmospheric heating. And the enhanced heating effect on near-surface layer caused by absorptive particles facilitates PBL development in August over the YRD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The exposure of slums to high temperature: Morphology-based local scale thermal patterns
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat exposure has become a global threat to human health and life with increasing temperatures and frequency of extreme heat events. Considering risk as a function of both heat vulnerability and hazard intensity, this study examines whether poor urban dwellers residing in slums are exposed to higher temperature, adding to their vulnerable demographic and health conditions. Instead of being restricted by sampling size of pixels or other land surface zones, this study follows the intrinsic latent patterns of the heat phenomenon to examine the association between small clusters of slums and heat patterns. Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) datasets of moderate resolution are employed to derive the morphological features of the temperature patterns in the city of Ahmedabad, India at the local scale. The optimal representations of temperature pattern morphology are learnt automatically from temporally adjacent images without manually choosing model hyper-parameters. The morphological features are then evaluated to identify the local scale temperature pattern at slum locations. Results show that in particular locations with slums are exposed to a locally high temperature. More specifically, larger slums tend to be exposed to a more intense locally high temperature compared to smaller slums. Due to the small size of slums in Ahmedabad, it is hard to conclude whether slums are impacting the locally high temperature, or slums are more likely to be located in poorly built places already with a locally high temperature. This study complements the missing dimension of hazard investigation to heat-related risk analysis of slums. The study developed a workflow of exploring the temperature patterns at the local scale and examination of heat exposure of slums. It extends the conventional city scale urban temperature analysis into local scales and introduces morphological measurements as new parameters to quantify temperature patterns at a more detailed level.

TI  - Effects of urban growth spatial pattern (UGSP) on the land surface temperature (LST): A study in the Po Valley (Italy)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sealed surfaces greatly influence Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. In this respect, both the composition and spatial patterns of anthropogenic land use play an important role in local thermal pattern. The urban environments' climate change adaptation strategy needs adequate knowledge systems urban planners can use to organise and design more resistant and resilient urban spaces. This study examined the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations and increasing urbanised areas during the period 2001-2011 in the Po Valley, utilising different urban growth spatial patterns (UGSP). Remotely sensed LST data was obtained from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) at a resolution of 1 km/pixel for an 11 year-period, from 2001 to 2011, with urbanisation data from the ISTAT map (nominal scale 1:10,000) respectively for the 2001 and 2011 time sections. The relationship between dependent (mean annual daytime, nighttime and daily values) and independent (urbanised areas) variables were investigated through ANOVA test and post-hoc analysis (p < 0.01) for all defined UGSP. Results showed that there is a decreasing LST range (in all conditions) associated with progressive increase of urbanised areas. Furthermore, clustered patterns urban growth have a statistically significant relationship with daytime, nighttime and daily conditions while dispersed pattern urban growth have the same with nighttime only. The outcomes are helpful for understanding the effects of different UGSP, which have significant implications for urban planning, and identifying the critical territorial sectors in need of sustainable mitigation actions.

TI  - Rule-based classification framework for remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land cover classification is an important task in geoscience applications. Many methods and implementations are based on multispectral data processing. The presented work aims to benefit from the nonlinear source separation process to enhance land cover identification. The source separation technique aims to provide underlying images and to compensate the mixing process. Nonlinear separation is more realistic due to multiple distortions occurring on the radiance path from soil to sensors. The presented paper addresses pattern recognition for remote sensing and proposes a framework based on feature extraction and decisional fusion. The first stage performs a nonlinear separation model based on Bayesian inferences. Non-linearity is approximated by a multilayer neuron network. The separation process updates knowledge about unknown sources and model parameters iteratively. The second stage performs feature extraction. Based on a decisional fusion, the third stage realizes a classification process. This fusion scheme assigns, first, a suitable feature to each source/pattern based on the learning data set. Second, a majority vote determines the final label. Experimentation results demonstrate that the proposed fusion method enhances the recognition accuracy and represents a powerful tool for land identification.

TI  - An Overview of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells as a Model for Immunological Research of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and Other Apicomplexan Parasites
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In biology, models are experimental systems meant to recreate aspects of diseases or human tissue with the goal of generating inferences and approximations that can contribute to the resolution of specific biological problems. Although there are many models for studying intracellular parasites, their data have produced critical contradictions, especially in immunological assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an attractive tissue source in pharmacogenomics and in molecular and immunologic studies, as these cells are easily collected from patients and can serve as sentinel tissue for monitoring physiological perturbations due to disease. However, these cells are a very sensitive model due to variables such as temperature, type of stimulus and time of collection as part of posterior processes. PBMCs have been used to study Toxoplasma gondii and other apicomplexan parasites. For instance, this model is frequently used in new therapies or vaccines that use peptides or recombinant proteins derived from the parasite. The immune response to T. gondii is highly variable, so it may be necessary to re fine this cellular model. This mini review highlights the major approaches in which PBMCs are used as a model of study for T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites. The variables related to this model have significant implications for data interpretation and conclusions related to host-parasite interaction.

TI  - Photoacoustic Imaging: Contrast Agents and Their Biomedical Applications
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging as a fast-developing imaging technique has great potential in biomedical and clinical applications. It is a noninvasive imaging modality that depends on the light-absorption coefficient of the imaged tissue and the injected PA-imaging contrast agents. Furthermore, PA imaging provides superb contrast, super spatial resolution, and high penetrability and sensitivity to tissue functional characteristics by detecting the acoustic wave to construct PA images. In recent years, a series of PA-imaging contrast agents are developed to improve the PA-imaging performance in biomedical applications. Here, recent progress of PA contrast agents and their biomedical applications are outlined. PA contrast agents are classified according to their components and function, and gold nanocrystals, gold-nanocrystal assembly, transition-metal chalcogenides/MXene-based nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials, other inorganic imaging agents, small organic molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and nonlinear PA-imaging contrast agents are discussed. The applications of PA contrast agents as biosensors (in the sensing of metal ions, pH, enzymes, temperature, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species) and in bioimaging (lymph nodes, vasculature, tumors, and brain tissue) are discussed in detail. Finally, an outlook on the future research and investigation of PA-imaging contrast agents and their significance in biomedical research is presented.

TI  - Biomass-burning smoke heights over the Amazon observed from space
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterise the vertical distribution of biomass-burning emissions across the Amazon during the biomass-burning season (July-November) with an extensive climatology of smoke plumes derived from MISR and MODIS (2005-2012) and CALIOP (2006-2012) observations. Smoke plume heights exhibit substantial variability, spanning a few hundred metres up to 6 km above the terrain. However, the majority of the smoke is located at altitudes below 2.5 km. About 60% of smoke plumes are observed in drought years, 40 %-50 % at the peak month of the burning season (September) and 94% over tropical forest and savanna regions, with respect to the total number of smoke plume observations. At the time of the MISR observations (10:00-11:00 LT), the highest plumes are detected over grassland fires (with an averaged maximum plume height of similar to 1100 m) and the lowest plumes occur over tropical forest fires (similar to 800 m). A similar pattern is found later in the day (14:00-15:00 LT) with CALIOP, although at higher altitudes (2300 m grassland vs. 2000 m tropical forest), as CALIOP typically detects smoke at higher altitudes due to its later overpass time, associated with a deeper planetary boundary layer, possibly more energetic fires, and greater sensitivity to thin aerosol layers. On average, 3 %-20 % of the fires inject smoke into the free troposphere; this percentage tends to increase toward the end of the burning season (November: 15 %-40 %). We find a well-defined seasonal cycle between MISR plume heights, MODIS fire radiative power and atmospheric stability across the main biomes of the Amazon, with higher smoke plumes, more intense fires and reduced atmospheric stability conditions toward the end of the burning season. Lower smoke plume heights are detected during drought 800 m) compared to non-drought (1100 m) conditions, in particular over tropical forest and savanna fires. Drought conditions favour understory fires over tropical forest, which tend to produce smouldering combustion and low smoke injection heights. Droughts also seem to favour deeper boundary layers and the percentage of smoke plumes that reach the free troposphere is lower during these dry conditions. Consistent with previous studies, the MISR mid-visible aerosol optical depth demonstrates that smoke makes a significant contribution to the total aerosol loading over the Amazon, which in combination with lower injection heights in drought periods has important implications for air quality. This work highlights the importance of biome type, fire properties and atmospheric and drought conditions for plume dynamics and smoke loading. In addition, our study demonstrates the value of combining observations of MISR and CALIOP constraints on the vertical distribution of smoke from biomass burning over the Amazon.

TI  - Tumor metastasis to lymph nodes requires YAP-dependent metabolic adaptation
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In cancer patients, metastasis of tumors to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying tumor LN metastasis are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic tumors in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that tumor cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic tumors, leading to the up-regulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in tumor cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating tumor metastasis to LNs.

TI  - Detecting and mapping <i>Gonipterus scutellatus</i> induced vegetation defoliation using WorldView-2 pan-sharpened image texture combinations and an artificial neural network
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Defoliation induced by the weevil Gonipterus scutellatus is causing significant damage to South Africa's eucalyptus plantations. Therefore, the ability of remote sensing to detect and map G. scutellatus defoliation is essential for monitoring the spread of the weevil so that precautionary measures are set in place. In our study, an integrated approach using image texture in various processing combinations and an artificial neural network (ANN) were developed to detect and map G. scutellatus induced vegetation defoliation. A 0.5-m WorldView-2 pansharpened image was used to compute texture parameters from the gray-level occurrence matrix and gray-level co-occurrence matrix, using optimal moving windows for specific levels of G. scutellatus induced vegetation defoliation. In order to improve the accuracy of detecting and mapping G. scutellatus induced vegetation defoliation, a method involving a three-band texture processing combination was proposed and tested. Using a sequential forward selection algorithm allowed for the selection of optimal texture combinations, which were subsequently input into a backpropagation ANN. The results showed an improvement in detecting vegetation defoliation using single texture bands [R-2 = 0.82, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.95 (1.82% of the mean measured defoliation)] when compared to single spectral reflectance bands [R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 1.79 (3.43% of the mean measured defoliation)], two-band spectral reflectance combination model [R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.48 (2.83% of the mean measured defoliation)], and the three-band spectral reflectance combination model [R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 1.35 (2.59% of the mean measured defoliation)]. Further improvements were obtained using the two-band texture combination model [R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 1.05 (2.01% of the mean measured defoliation)] and the most promising result was obtained using the proposed three-band texture combination model [R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.85 (1.63% of the mean measured defoliation)]. Overall, our study highlights the potential of image texture combinations in improving the detection and mapping of vegetation defoliation.

TI  - Kinetic mass-transfer calculation of water isotope fractionation due to cloud microphysics in a regional meteorological model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In conventional atmospheric models, isotope exchange between liquid, gas, and solid phases is usually assumed to be in equilibrium, and the highly kinetic phase transformation processes inferred in clouds are yet to be fully investigated. In this study, a two-moment microphysical scheme in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was modified to allow kinetic calculation of isotope fractionation due to various cloud microphysical phase-change processes. A case of a moving cold front is selected for quantifying the effect of different factors controlling isotopic composition, including water vapor sources, atmospheric transport, phase transition pathways of water in clouds, and kinetic-versus-equilibrium mass transfer. A base-run simulation was able to reproduce the similar to 50 parts per thousand decrease in delta D that was observed during the frontal passage. Sensitivity tests suggest that all the above factors contributed significantly to the variations in isotope composition. The thermal equilibrium assumption commonly used in earlier studies may cause an overestimate of mean vapor-phase delta D by 11 parts per thousand, and the maximum difference can be more than 20 parts per thousand. Using initial vertical distribution and lower boundary conditions of water stable isotopes from satellite data is critical to obtain successful isotope simulations, without which the delta D in water vapor can be off by about 34 parts per thousand and 28 parts per thousand, respectively. Without microphysical fractionation, the delta D in water vapor can be off by about 25 parts per thousand.

TI  - Ecosystem structural changes controlled by altered rainfall climatology in tropical savannas
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical savannas comprise mixed woodland grassland ecosystems in which trees and grasses compete for water resources thereby maintaining the spatial structuring of this ecosystem. A global change in rainfall climatology may impact the structure of tropical savanna ecosystems by favouring woody plants, relative to herbaceous vegetation. Here we analysed satellite data and observed a relatively higher increase in woody vegetation (5%) as compared to the increase in annual maximum leaf area index (LAI(max), an indicator of the total green vegetation production) (3%) in arid and semi-arid savannas over recent decades. We further observed a declining sensitivity of LAI(max) to annual rainfall over 56% of the tropical savannas, spatially overlapping with areas of increased woody cover and altered rainfall climatology. This suggests a climate-induced shift in the coexistence of woody and herbaceous vegetation in savanna ecosystems, possibly caused by altered hydrological conditions with significance for land cover and associated biophysical effects such as surface albedo and evapotranspiration.

TI  - Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) inhibits HIV-1 production by degrading Gag via activity of the ubiquitin ligase TRC8
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) regulates sterol synthesis by mediating the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and the degradation of the HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). INSIG1 is up-regulated during HIV-1 infection, but its role in HIV-1 infection is unknown. In this report, using pseudovirus production, protein overexpression, and gene knockouts, we found that INSIG1 inhibits HIV-1 production by accelerating the degradation of the HIV-1 Gag protein. Unlike the degradation of HMGCR via the E3 ubiquitin ligase autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), a process that depends on the proteasome, INSIG1 coordinated with another ligase, translocation in renal carcinoma chromosome 8 (TRC8), and promoted Gag degradation through the lysosome pathway. We conclude that INSIG1 functions as a sentinel responsive to HIV-1 production and inhibits HIV-1 replication by degrading Gag, a process occurring at intracellular membrane sites such as the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes where both INSIG1 and Gag may be located.

TI  - Terra and Aqua MODIS TEB intercomparison using Himawari-8/AHI as reference
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercomparison between the two MODIS instruments is very useful for both the instrument calibration and its uncertainty assessment. Terra and Aqua MODIS have almost identical relative spectral response, spatial resolution, and dynamic range for each band, so the site-dependent effect from spectral mismatch for their comparison is negligible. Major challenges in cross-sensor comparison of instruments on different satellites include differences in observation time and view angle over selected pseudoinvariant sites. The simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNO) between the two satellites are mostly applied for comparison and the scene under SNO varies. However, there is a dearth of SNO between the Terra and Aqua. This work focuses on an intercomparison method for MODIS thermal emissive bands using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) as a reference. Eleven thermal emissive bands on MODIS are at least to some degree spectrally matched to the AHI bands. The sites selected for the comparison are an ocean area around the Himawari-8 suborbital point and the Strzelecki Desert located south of the Himawari-8 suborbital point. The time difference between the measurements from AHI and MODIS is <5 min. The comparison is performed using 2017 collection 6.1 L1B data for MODIS. The MODIS-AHI difference is corrected to remove the view angle dependence. The Terra-Aqua MODIS difference for the selected TEB is up to 0.6 K with the exception of band 30. Band 30 has the largest difference, which is site dependent, most likely due to a crosstalk effect. Over the ocean, the band 30 difference between the two MODIS instruments is around 1.75 K, while over the desert; the difference is around 0.68 K. The MODIS precision is also compared from the Gaussian regression of the double difference. Terra bands 27 to 30 have significant extra noise due to crosstalk effects on these bands. These Terra-Aqua comparison results are used for MODIS calibration assessments and are beneficial for future calibration algorithm improvement. The impact of daytime measurements and the scene dependence are also discussed. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Impact of "The Blob" and "El Nino" in the SW Baja California Peninsula: Plankton and Environmental Variability of Bahia Magdalena
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bahia Magdalena is a coastal lagoon with an enormous biological and fishing wealth; it is located in the Pacific coast of Baja California (Mexico), a transitional zone between tropical and temperate regions which is strongly affected by the global-scale climate phenomena. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of the unusual and consecutive warming events known as The Blob (TB2013-2015) and the 2015-2016 El Nino on the hydrological characteristics and plankton communities, the lower levels of the trophic web, from January 2015 to December 2017. This coastal lagoon lacks river runoff and primary producers depend on the upwelling's nutrient supply. The environmental variables analyzed were the upwelling index (PFEL-NOAA), the air and sea temperature, salinity, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. The species composition, species richness and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were used to describe some aspects of the phytoplankton community structure and its phenology. The biomass and mortality of zooplankton also were analyzed. The seasonal pattern of hydrology was described with data collected in nine sampling stations. An alternative approach used with both biological and environmental datasets was to select representative sampling stations located in the vicinity of the inlet and in the interior of the lagoon. Chla-fluorescence imagery collected by the MODIS-Aqua satellite was used as an indicator of phytoplankton abundance. Statistical analyses included bi- and multivariate parametric and non-parametric tests. Principal component analysis was used to describe the seasonality of hydrological data and the canonical correlation analysis to relate environmental and biological datasets. The increase of temperature at a global and local scale in 2015 had as consequence an atypical increase in the water temperature in the fall of 2015, coincident with the abrupt diminishing of upwelling strength and input of nutrients advected from the ocean. A recovery of these two variables was recorded in 2016 at the end of the El Nino. The most abundant group of phytoplankton species were diatoms. Algal blooms were composed by species adapted to high temperatures and nutrients depletion in 2015, while in 2016 and 2017 were composed by ruderal-strategist species and they were boosted by the nutrient pulses associated with the spring upwellings. The fall algal bloom, typical of subtropical coastal lagoons, was observed only in 2016 and it was confined to the interior of the lagoon where there are local inputs of nutrients. In 2015 and 2016 there was a succession of diatoms and dinoflagellates related to the rising of temperature while in 2017 this pattern changed because of the strong upwellings. The relationships of water temperature and silicate with a ratio of diatoms' cell abundance, was analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs), showing significant correlations but different trends in some years. The species richness of diatom blooms was high; on the other hand, species diversity increased at the end of spring and early summer. The seasonal pattern of zooplankton biomass showed changes along the 3 years, but the most noticeable was an increase during winter and early spring 2015 and the lack of the usual high values of June-July in 2017. The seasonal pattern of the phytoplankton abundance was different in comparison with the 1982-1983 El Nino while the zooplankton was similar among the three strongest El Nino.The changes we observed strongly suggest that the warming caused by those phenomena highly affected the upwelling strength, the length of the temperate and warm seasons and the hydrology. Phenology of phytoplankton and zooplankton changed after the strong perturbation under the El Nino, and possibly The Blob. The recovery of phytoplankton biomass began in 2017, but its taxonomic composition was not adequate to support the zooplankton recovery.

TI  - Why do scientists disagree? Explaining and improving measures of the perceived causes of scientific disputes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been increasing attention to understanding how laypeople explain disagreements among scientists. In this article, we evaluate the factorial validity and scale/item functioning of a Science Dispute Reasons scale (Study 1) and test specific hypotheses about demographic, individual difference, and topic-related variables that may explain why some reasons are perceived to be more likely than others (Study 2). The final scale included 17 items grouped into three reason factors (Process/Competence, Interests/Values, and Complexity/Uncertainty), which is largely consistent with previous research. We find a mixed pattern of global and specific impacts on reason likelihood ratings from a range of variables including political ideology and conspiracist ideation (primary mediated through perceived credibility of science), science knowledge, and topic-related variables such as knowledge of and care about the dispute in question. Overall, science dispute reasons appear to be more strongly driven by attitudes and worldviews as opposed to objective knowledge and skills. These findings represent progress in understanding lay perceptions of the causes of scientific disputes, although much work remains. We discuss the implications of this work and directions for future research.

TI  - Comparison of altered mineral information extracted from ETM plus , ASTER and Hyperion data in aguas Claras iron ore, Brazil
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Locations used to validate extraction results from remote sensing images are typically ground rock samples. However, remotely sensed image pixels are 30 m(2) with mixing spectra. Rock samples cannot fully represent extraction results on an image. Here, alteration information associated with the aguas Claras, Brazil iron deposit was analysed using a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+), a Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Hyperion data, all with 30 m resolution. With improvements in spectral resolution, extracted results have changed from the alteration information to altered rocks and minerals. The accuracy of alteration information has improved continuously as data extracted from these sources verify one another. Minerals extracted using Hyperion corresponded to altered assemblages identified from ASTER. Both were consistent with alteration information extracted from ETM+ at the same location. Alteration information extracted from three remote images were located within ore formations, and controlled by the north-east trending faults and matched well with known deposits. Information extraction based on the integrated application of multi-source remote sensing data could compensate for deficiencies in using single data. These results can verify one another to improve data reliability particularly in the areas inaccessible and lacking sufficient field confirmation.

TI  - A spatio temporal spectral framework for plant stress phenotyping
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in high throughput phenotyping have made it possible to collect large datasets following plant growth and development over time, and those in machine learning have made inferring phenotypic plant traits from such datasets possible. However, there remains a dirth of datasets following plant growth under stress conditions along with methods for inferring them using only remotely sensed data, especially under a combination of multiple stress factors such as drought, weeds and nutrient deficiency. Such stress factors and their combinations are commonly encountered during crop production and being able to accurately detect and treat such stress conditions in an automated and timely manner can provide a major boost to farm yields with minimal resource input.We present a generic framework for remote plant stress phenotyping that consists of a dataset with spatio-temporal-spectral data following sugarbeet crop growth under optimal, drought, low and surplus nitrogen fertilization, and weed stress conditions, along with a machine learning based methodology for systematically inferring these stress conditions from the remotely measured data. The dataset contains biweekly color images, infra-red stereo image pairs and hyperspectral camera images along with applied treatment parameters and environmental factors like temperature and humidity, collected over two months. We present a plant agnostic methodology for deriving plant trait indicators such as canopy cover, height, hyperspectral reflectance and vegetation indices along with a spectral 3D reconstruction of the plants from the raw data to serve as a benchmark. Additionally, we provide fresh and dry weight measurements for both the above (canopy) and below (beet) ground biomass at the end of the growing period to serve as indicators of expected yield. We further describe a data driven, machine learning based method to infer water, Nitrogen and weed stress using the derived plant trait indicators. We use the plant trait indicators to evaluate 8 different classification approaches from which the best classifier achieved a mean cross validation accuracy of 93, 76 and 83% for drought, nitrogen and weed stress severity classification respectively. We also show that our multi-modal approach significantly improves classifier performance over using any single modality.The presented framework and dataset can serve as a valuable reference for creating and comparing processing pipelines which extract plant trait indicators and infer prevalent stress factors from remote sensing data under a variety of environments and cropping conditions. These techniques can then be deployed on farm machinery or robots enabling automated, precise and timely corrective interventions for maximising yield.

TI  - An algorithm applied to national surveillance data for the early detection of major dengue outbreaks in Cambodia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue is a national priority disease in Cambodia. The Cambodian National Dengue Surveillance System is based on passive surveillance of dengue-like inpatients reported by public hospitals and on a sentinel, pediatric hospital-based active surveillance system. This system works well to assess trends but the sensitivity of the early warning and time-lag to usefully inform hospitals can be improved. During The ECOnomic development, ECOsystem MOdifications, and emerging infectious diseases Risk Evaluation (ECOMORE) project's knowledge translation platforms, Cambodian hospital staff requested an early warning tool to prepare for major outbreaks. Our objective was therefore to find adapted tools to improve the early warning system and preparedness. Dengue data was provided by the National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) and are routinely obtained through passive surveillance. The data were analyzed at the provincial level for eight Cambodian provinces during 2008-2015. The R surveillance package was used for the analysis. We evaluated the effectiveness of Bayesian algorithms to detect outbreaks using count data series, comparing the current count to an expected distribution obtained from observations of past years. The analyses bore on 78,759 patients with dengue-like syndromes. The algorithm maximizing sensitivity and specificity for the detection of major dengue outbreaks was selected in each province. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 73% and 97%, respectively, for the detection of significant outbreaks during 2008-2015. Depending on the province, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 50% to 100% and 75% to 100%, respectively. The final algorithm meets clinicians' and decisionmakers' needs, is cost-free and is easy to implement at the provincial level.

TI  - Bilinear normal mixing model for spectral unmixing
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral unmixing (SU) is a useful tool for hyperspectral remote sensing image analysis. However, due to the interference of spectral variance and non-linearity caused by photon multiple-scattering, the result might be an inaccuracy. In addition, the unmixing performance of typically relies on the prior knowledge of endmembers. Although many classical endmember extraction algorithms have been presented, it is hard to obtain accurate endmembers in practical applications. This study presents a bilinear normal mixing model named as BNMM to tackle these issues. In fact, BNMM employs the polynomial post-non-linear mixing model to alleviate the effect of non-linearity and uses a normal distribution model to reduce the influence of endmembers variability. Based on the BNMM, the authors develop a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for SU. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other classical unmixing algorithms in the case of simulated and benchmark datasets.

TI  - Modelling the current fractional cover of an invasive alien plant and drivers of its invasion in a dryland ecosystem
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of spatially differentiated management strategies against invasive alien plant species requires a detailed understanding of their current distribution and of the level of invasion across the invaded range. The objectives of this study were to estimate the current fractional cover gradient of invasive trees of the genus Prosopis in the Afar Region, Ethiopia, and to identify drivers of its invasion. We used seventeen explanatory variables describing Landsat 8 image reflectance, topography, climate and landscape structures to model the current cover of Prosopis across the invaded range using the random forest (RF) algorithm. Validation of the RF algorithm confirmed high model performance with an accuracy of 92% and a Kappa-coefficient of 0.8. We found that, within 35 years after its introduction, Prosopis has invaded approximately 1.17 million ha at different cover levels in the Afar Region (12.3% of the surface). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation showed the highest explanatory power among the 17 variables, in terms of both the invader's overall distribution as well as areas with high cover. Villages and linear landscape structures (rivers and roads) were found to be more important drivers of future Prosopis invasion than environmental variables, such as climate and topography, suggesting that Prosopis is likely to continue spreading and increasing in abundance in the case study area if left uncontrolled. We discuss how information on the fractional cover and the drivers of invasion can help in developing spatially-explicit management recommendations against a target invasive plant species.

TI  - Detailed urban surface characterization using spectra from enhanced spatial resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and a hierarchical multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed mapping of urban surfaces is one of the most challenging tasks in remote sensing due to the three-dimensional structure of cities, spatial diversity, and material spectral variability. Satellite urban applications demand better spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, although there are strict technical constraints among them. Therefore, the development of sophisticated methods that exploit both high spectral and spatial data sources becomes necessary. A hierarchical multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) approach is developed and applied on Sentinel-2 imagery for the detailed quantification of the urban land cover, taking advantage of Worldview-2 high spatial resolution. The case study is the urban and peri-urban area of Heraklion, Greece. The area to point regression kriging (ATPRK) method is applied to downscale Sentinel-2 bands from 10 and 20 m to 2 m (WorldView-2 spatial resolution) and create a spectral library (SL) of urban materials, which contain 180 separate spectra. The urban SL is then used in the developed hierarchical MESMA approach to estimate the abundances of 11 urban land cover classes based on the original Sentinel-2 image. The estimated land cover fractions validate against a very high-resolution (1 m) land cover map of the area. It is proved that the complexity of the urban land cover can be efficiently investigated by the proposed methodology. Error analysis shows good accuracy of the results in all estimated class fractions. Moreover, the good validation results lead to the conclusion that ATPRK fusion algorithm between Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 bands produced reliable urban material spectra, capable for advanced spectral analysis on Sentinel-2 imagery. The developed methodology is easily transferable to other cities since it is based exclusively on earth observation data and is suitable for multiple urban applications related to urban climate, urban sprawl, and urban regeneration.

TI  - Memory effects of climate and vegetation affecting net ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in global forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a crucial role in the global carbon (C) cycle by storing and sequestering a substantial amount of C in the terrestrial biosphere. Due to temporal dynamics in climate and vegetation activity, there are significant regional variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere in forests that are affecting the global C cycle. Current forest CO2 flux dynamics are controlled by instantaneous climate, soil, and vegetation conditions, which carry legacy effects from disturbances and extreme climate events. Our level of understanding from the legacies of these processes on net CO2 fluxes is still limited due to their complexities and their long-term effects. Here, we combined remote sensing, climate, and eddy-covariance flux data to study net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) at 185 forest sites globally. Instead of commonly used non-dynamic statistical methods, we employed a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that captures information from the vegetation and climate's temporal dynamics. The resulting data-driven model integrates interannual and seasonal variations of climate and vegetation by using Landsat and climate data at each site. The presented LSTM algorithm was able to effectively describe the overall seasonal variability (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.66) and across-site (NSE = 0.42) variations in NEE, while it had less success in predicting specific seasonal and interannual anomalies (NSE = 0.07). This analysis demonstrated that an LSTM approach with embedded climate and vegetation memory effects outperformed a non-dynamic statistical model (i.e. Random Forest) for estimating NEE. Additionally, it is shown that the vegetation mean seasonal cycle embeds most of the information content to realistically explain the spatial and seasonal variations in NEE. These findings show the relevance of capturing memory effects from both climate and vegetation in quantifying spatio-temporal variations in forest NEE.

TI  - A global lake and reservoir volume analysis using a surface water dataset and satellite altimetry
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and reservoirs are crucial elements of the hydrological and biochemical cycle and are a valuable resource for hydropower, domestic and industrial water use, and irrigation. Although their monitoring is crucial in times of increased pressure on water resources by both climate change and human interventions, publically available datasets of lake and reservoir levels and volumes are scarce. Within this study, a time series of variation in lake and reservoir volume between 1984 and 2015 were analysed for 137 lakes over all continents by combining the JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset and the satellite altimetry database DAHITI. The GSW dataset is a highly accurate surface water dataset at 30 m resolution compromising the whole L1T Landsat 5, 7 and 8 archive, which allowed for detailed lake area calculations globally over a very long time period using Google Earth Engine. Therefore, the estimates in water volume fluctuations using the GSW dataset are expected to improve compared to current techniques as they are not constrained by complex and computationally intensive classification procedures. Lake areas and water levels were combined in a regression to derive the hypsometry relationship (dh/dA) for all lakes. Nearly all lakes showed a linear regression, and 42% of the lakes showed a strong linear relationship with a R-2>0.8, an average R-2 of 0.91 and a standard deviation of 0.05. For these lakes and for lakes with a nearly constant lake area (coefficient of variation <0.008), volume variations were calculated. Lakes with a poor linear relationship were not considered. Reasons for low R-2 values were found to be (1) a nearly constant lake area, (2) winter ice coverage and (3) a predominant lack of data within the GSW dataset for those lakes. Lake volume estimates were validated for 18 lakes in the US, Spain, Australia and Africa using in situ volume time series, and gave an excellent Pearson correlation coefficient of on average 0.97 with a standard deviation of 0.041, and a normalized RMSE of 7.42%. These results show a high potential for measuring lake volume dynamics using a pre-classified GSW dataset, which easily allows the method to be scaled up to an extensive global volumetric dataset. This dataset will not only provide a historical lake and reservoir volume variation record, but will also help to improve our understanding of the behaviour of lakes and reservoirs and their representation in (large-scale) hydrological models.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing and geographic information systems for geological fault detection on the island of Crete, Greece
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fracture systems are of great importance in the field of structural geology. Faults commonly afford easy passage to groundwater and fluids such as hydrothermal fluids and magmas or even contribute to earthquake hazard monitoring. For a geologist, it is not always easy to discern such morphotectonic structures at close range. Both remote sensing techniques and spatial modeling permit the recognition and better understanding of the brittle tectonics in an area. This study was an effort to delineate the tectonic structures on Crete by combining Sentinel-2 satellite data and spatial data. For the enhancement and better discrimination of photolineaments primarily recognized on satellite imagery, a variety of enhancement techniques has been applied. The evaluation of a photolineament as a potential fracture zone was based on several factors: the DEM of the study area, the shaded relief, the slopes and corresponding aspects, the drainage network, the geology and general observations on vegetative coverage appearance. The application of these methods revealed several fracture zones, which we recommend be certified by field investigations. Fault-mapping results may be used for a variety of geological and hydrogeological studies. Indicative places of a large concentration of groundwater are of vital importance for subsequent exploitation by areas of need. The present work may provide useful information for further analysis by geophysicists and seismologists.

TI  - Analysis and Predictability of Drought In Northwest Africa Using Optical and Microwave Satellite Remote Sensing Products
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a context of high stress on water resources and agricultural production at the global level, together with climate change marked by an increase in the frequency of these events, drought is considered to be a strong threat both socially and economically. The Mediterranean region is a hot spot of climate change; it is also characterized by a scarcity of water resources that places intense pressure on agricultural productivity. This article analyzes the potential for using multiple remote sensing tools in the quantification and predictability of drought in Northwest Africa. Three satellite products are considered: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Moisture Index (SWI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST). A discussion of the variability of these products and their inter-correlation is presented, illustrating a generally high consistency between them. Statistical anomaly indices are then computed and a drought severity mapping is presented. The results illustrate in particular a high percentage of dry conditions in the region studied during the last ten years (2007-2017). Finally, we propose the use of the analog statistical approach to identify similar evolutions of the three variables in the past. Although this technique is not a forecast, it provides a strong indication of the plausible future trajectory of a given hydrological season.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol optical thickness and surface properties from the CISAR algorithm applied both to geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite observations. The theoretical concepts of the CISAR algorithm have been described in Govaerts and Luffarelli (2018). CISAR has been applied to SEVIRI and PROBA-V observations acquired over 20 AERONET stations during the year 2015. The CISAR retrieval from the two sets of observations is evaluated against independent data sets such as the MODIS land product and AERONET data. The performance differences resulting from the two types of orbit are discussed, and the information content of SEVIRI and PROBA-V observations is analysed and compared.

TI  - Clinical Reasoning: Leg weakness and stiffness at the emergency room
T2  - NEUROLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - A 48-year-old woman from the Maghreb came to the emergency department with insidious gait difficulties, urgency, and constipation starting 6 months prior to the visit. The patient's complaints consisted of weakness, stiffness, and pain in her legs. Her medical history consisted of Hashimoto thyroiditis and breast cancer, with the latter having motivated surgery 4 months prior to admission. Histopathologic examination had demonstrated ductal cancer sensitive to estrogen and mapping with sentinel node biopsy ruled out metastasis. For that reason, the patient was treated with local radiation given weekly over 1 month and treatment with tamoxifen was started. Physical examination upon admission demonstrated weakness and spasticity in both legs. Reflexes were brisk; bilateral nonsustained foot clonus and Babinski sign were also present. Bilateral dorsal flexion was reduced, but vibration and sensation to touch and pinprick were normal. Sphincter tonus was reduced; systemic manifestations such as myalgias, fever, skin rashes, uveitis, sicca, and arthritic joints were absent.

TI  - Coastline information extraction based on the tasseled cap transformation of Landsat-8 OLI images
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a dynamic belt between land and oceans, coastline provides rich information on land-ocean interactions. Sensitive to climate and anthropogenic influences, the changing coastline affects intertidal mudflat resources and the coastal environment. In this study, the greenness and wetness components of the tasseled cap transformation (TCT) were used to extract coastline information. Due to the high total suspended sediment content that leads to the failure of traditional method, sea-waterbody information extraction was initially carried out by TCT. After considering the characteristics of coastline in remote sensing images and coastline morphology in the natural world, the coastline with shorter length was eliminated and the intermittent coastline was connected based on the coordinate geometry description (such as length, distance, and direction). Finally, the results of the coastline information extraction were superimposed on the original images to evaluate accuracy. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method was more effective in clearly delineating the land-ocean boundary, The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy were 0.95 and 0.91, respectively, and the length extraction error was -2.16%. Therefore, the proposed method was more successful for coastline information extraction in the area with high sediment concentration.

TI  - Addressing the imagination gap through STEAMM plus D and indigenous knowledge
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Alex Manu describes an "imagination gap," that is, "the gap between current capability and future possibility" [Manu A (2006) The Imagination Challenge: Strategic Foresight and Innovation in the Global Economy]. Merriam-Webster defines imagination as "the act of forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never before wholly perceived in reality"; imagination combines "creative ability" and "resourcefulness" [MerriamWebster (2018) Imagination. Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online. Available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imagination]. This paper considers two interdisciplinary fields in which distinct approaches have sought a solution to the "imagination gap" and have resulted in new research questions, methods, outcomes, and even philosophies. These are science, technology, engineering, arts, math, medicine, and design (STEAMM+ D) and Indigenous research that establishes questions and methods from an integrated interdisciplinary worldview and the individual's responsibilities toward community and land. By intertwining these approaches, it is possible for science and society to apply creative problem solving in addressing complex challenges, thereby fostering sustainable innovation.

TI  - Low efficiency of large volcanic eruptions in transporting very fine ash into the atmosphere
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic ash clouds are common, often unpredictable, phenomena generated during explosive eruptions. Mainly composed of very fine ash particles, they can be transported in the atmosphere at great distances from the source, having detrimental socio-economic impacts. However, proximal settling processes controlling the proportion (epsilon) of the very fine ash fraction distally transported in the atmosphere are still poorly understood. Yet, for the past two decades, some operational meteorological agencies have used a default value of epsilon = 5% as input for forecast models of atmospheric ash cloud concentration. Here we show from combined satellite and field data of sustained eruptions that e actually varies by two orders of magnitude with respect to the mass eruption rate. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the most intense eruptions are in fact the least efficient (with epsilon = 0.1%) in transporting very fine ash through the atmosphere. This implies that the amount of very fine ash distally transported in the atmosphere is up to 50 times lower than previously anticipated. We explain this finding by the efficiency of collective particle settling in ash-rich clouds which enhance early and en masse fallout of very fine ash. This suggests that proximal sedimentation during powerful eruptions is more controlled by the concentration of ash than by the grain size. This has major consequences for decision-makers in charge of air traffic safety regulation, as well as for the understanding of proximal settling processes. Finally, we propose a new statistical model for predicting the source mass eruption rate with an unprecedentedly low level of uncertainty.

TI  - Wetland biomass inversion and space differentiation: A case study of the Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - With wetlands categorized as one of the three major ecosystems, the study of wetland health has global environmental implications. Multiple regression models were employed to establish relationships between Landsat-8 images, vegetation indices and field measured biomass in the Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve. These models were then used to estimate the spatial distribution of wetland vegetative biomass. The relationships between wetland vegetative biomass and soil factors (organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, water soluble salt, pH and moisture) were modeled. We were able to achieve higher correlations and improved model fits using vegetative indices and spectral bands 1-5 as independent variables. Several important soil factors were isolated, including soil moisture and salt concentrations, which affect wetland biomass spatial distributions. Overall, wetland biomass decreased from land to the ocean and from the river courses outward.

T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. ASPIICS is a novel externally occulted solar coronagraph, which will be launched onboard the PROBA-3 mission of the European Space Agency. The external occulter will be placed on the first satellite similar to 150 m ahead of the second satellite that will carry an optical instrument. For 6 h per orbit, the satellites will fly in a precise formation, constituting a giant externally occulted coronagraph. The large distance between the external occulter and the primary objective will allow observations of the white-light solar corona starting from extremely low heights similar to 1.1 R-circle dot.Aims. We aim to analyze the possible influence of optical ghost images formed inside the telescope and to develop an algorithm for their removal.Methods. We implement the optical layout of ASPIICS in Zemax and study the ghost behavior in sequential and nonsequential regimes. We identify sources of the ghost contributions and analyze their geometrical behavior. Finally we develop a mathematical model and software to calculate ghost images for any given input image.Results. We show that ghost light can be important in the outer part of the field of view, where the coronal signal is weak, since the energy of bright inner corona is redistributed to the outer corona. However, the model allows for the ghost contribution to be removed. Due to the large distance between the external occulter and the primary objective, the primary objective does not produce a significant ghost. The use of the Lyot spot in ASPIICS is not necessary.

TI  - Multi-Scale Phenology of Temperate Grasslands: Improving Monitoring and Management With Near-Surface Phenocams
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands of the Australian Southern Tablelands represent a patchwork of native and exotic systems, occupying a continuum of C-3-dominated to C-4-dominated grasslands where composition depends on disturbance factors (e.g., grazing) and climate. Managing these complex landscapes is both challenging and critical for maintaining the security of Australia's pasture industries, and for protecting the biodiversity of native remnants. Differentiating C-3 from C-4 vegetation has been a prominent theme in remote sensing research due to distinct C-3/C-4 seasonal productivity patterns (phenology) and high uncertainty about how C-3/C-4 vegetation will respond to a changing climate. Phenology is used in northern hemisphere ecosystems for a range of purposes but has not been widely adopted in Australia, where dynamic climate often results in non-repetitive seasonal vegetation patterns. We employed time-lapse cameras (phenocams) to study the phenology of twelve grassland areas dominated by cool season (C-3) and warm season (C-4), native or exotic grasses near Canberra, Australia. Our aims were to assess phenological characteristics of the functional types and to determine the drivers of phenological variability. We compared the fine-scale phenocam seasonal profiles with field sampling and MODIS/Landsat satellite products to assess paddock-to-landscape functioning. We found C-3/C-4 species dominance to be the primary driver of phenological differences among grassland types, with C-3 grasslands demonstrating peak greenness in spring, and senescing rapidly in response to high summer temperatures. In contrast, C-4 grasslands showed peak activity in Austral summer and autumn (January-March). Some sites displayed primary and secondary peaks dependent on rainfall and species composition. We found that the proportion of dead vegetation is an important biophysical driver of grassland phenology, as were grazing pressures and species-dependent responses to rainfall and temperature. The satellite and field datasets were in general agreement with the phenocam results. However, the higher temporal fidelity of the cameras captured changes in vegetation not observed in the coarser satellite or field results. Our phenocam data shows consistent periods of increasing and decreasing greenness over as little as 5 days. Applications for management of grasslands in temperate Australia include the identification of remnant native grasslands, tracking biosecurity issues, and assessing productivity responses to climate variability.

TI  - Effects of Land cover change on Great Apes distribution at the Lobeke National Park and its surrounding Forest Management Units, South-East Cameroon. A 13 year time series analysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of land cover change on wildlife distribution is very important for resource management and conservation planning. This paper aimed at detecting the effects of land cover change on great apes distribution at the Lobeke National Park and its bounded forest management units (FMUs). Data on great ape nests were collected in the field for the years 2001 and 2014 through distance sampling with line transects. Landsat TM images of South-East Cameroon for the years 2001 and 2014 were acquired from earth explorer and corrected atmospherically for proper visualization. An area of interest comprising the Lobeke National Park and its FMUs was extracted for classification and change detection. A comparison in great apes nest distribution and change per land cover change category was done for both years through point pattern analysis, whereas a time series analysis of the detected land cover change impacts on great apes nest distribution for a period of 13 years was modeled using logistic growth and regression equations in Vensim 7.2. The results could illustrate that, as land cover changes from one cover type in 2001 to another in 2014, increases or decreases in great apes nests were observed within each changed area.

TI  - Lithologic classification using multilevel spectral characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological maps are commonly used to investigate the distribution of geological natural resources, such as minerals. However, the existing 1:200,000 geological map created in the 1990s for Guangxi, China, cannot support efficient investigation and interpretation of the geological surface changes. Therefore, we propose the application of remotely sensed multispectral imagery to update the existing 1:200,000 geological map at a scale of 1:100,000. To this end, the analysis of the spectral characteristics of six types of lithologies from the USGS spectral library and from actual measurements by Field Spec (R) 4, ASD Inc. is conducted first. With the analyzed results of the spectral characteristics, the carbonate rock is separated from the other rocks using band ratios, and then the study area is separated carbonate and non-carbonate areas. In the noncarbonate area, five types of rocks, named, shale, marble, sandstone, granite, and basalt, are classified using supervised classification, in which the training data sets are from the 1:200,000 geographic map. The field verification of the classified results shows that a classification accuracy of 66% is reached, which meets the accuracy requirement for the creation of 1:100,000 geological maps on that basis of the standard formulated by China Geological Map Remote Sensing Interpretation technology. The 1:100,000 geological map created will be delivered to the Guangxi Geological Bureau, China, for applications by the geological and remote sensing communities. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Uncovering regional variability in disturbance trends between parks and greater park ecosystems across Canada (1985-2015)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We assess the protective function of Canada's parks and protected areas (PPAs) by analyzing three decades of stand-replacing disturbance derived from Landsat time series data (1985-2015). Specifically, we compared rates of wildfire and harvest within 1,415 PPAs against rates of disturbance in surrounding greater park ecosystems (GPEs). We found that disturbance rates in GPEs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in corresponding PPAs in southern managed forests (six of Canada's 12 forested ecozones). Higher disturbance rates in GPEs were attributed to harvesting activities, as the area impacted by wildfire was not significantly different between GPEs and PPAs in any ecozone. The area burned within PPAs and corresponding GPEs was highly correlated (r = 0.90), whereas the area harvested was weakly correlated (r = 0.19). The average area burned in PPAs/GPEs below 55 degrees N was low (0.05% yr(-1)) largely due to fire suppression aimed at protecting communities, timber, and recreational values, while the average burn rate was higher in northern PPAs/GPEs where fire suppression is uncommon (0.40% yr(-1) in PPAs/GPEs above 55 degrees N). Assessing regional variability in disturbance patterns and the pressures faced by PPAs can better inform policy and protection goals across Canada and the globe.

TI  - Moisture transport in observations and reanalyses as a proxy for snow accumulation in East Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric moisture convergence on ice sheets provides an estimate of snow accumulation, which is critical to quantifying sea-level changes. In the case of East Antarctica, we computed moisture transport from 1980 to 2016 in five reanalyses and in radiosonde observations. Moisture convergence in reanalyses is more consistent than net precipitation but still ranges from 72 to 96 mm yr(-1) in the four most recent reanalyses, ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, JRA 55 and MERR Lambda 2. The representation of long-term variability in reanalyses is also inconsistent, which justified resorting to observations.Moisture fluxes are measured on a daily basis via radiosondes launched from a network of stations surrounding East Antarctica. Observations agree with reanalyses on the major role of extreme advection events and transient eddy fluxes. Although assimilated, the observations reveal processes that reanalyses cannot model, some due to a lack of horizontal and vertical resolution, especially the oldest, NCEP DOE R2. Additionally, the observational time series are not affected by new satellite data unlike the reanalyses. We formed pan-continental estimates of convergence by aggregating anomalies from all available stations. We found statistically significant trends neither in moisture convergence nor in precipitable water.

TI  - Modeling maize above-ground biomass based on machine learning approaches using UAV remote-sensing data
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAbove-ground biomass (AGB) is a basic agronomic parameter for field investigation and is frequently used to indicate crop growth status, the effects of agricultural management practices, and the ability to sequester carbon above and below ground. The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas.ResultsIn this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors.ConclusionsThese results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.

TI  - Spatial and spectral pattern identification for the automatic selection of high-quality MODIS images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is providing an increasing number of crucial data about Earth. Systematic revisitation time allows the analysis of long time series as well as imagery utilization in the most interesting moments. Nevertheless, the current huge amount of data makes essential the usage of automatic methods to select the best captures, as many of them are not useful because of clouds, shadows, etc. Because of that, one of the characteristics of the more recent missions is the distribution, along with the spectral data, of a large amount of quality ancillary datasets. These datasets can act synergistically in the aim of selecting the best quality images, but the criteria they provide are not always enough. Indeed, these datasets are often used on a per pixel basis and the spatial pattern of the different spectral bands is forgotten, so ignoring the key information they can provide for our goals. With this aim, our work takes one of the most successful instruments in remote sensing, MODIS, and demonstrates, through geostatistical techniques, that the role of the spatial patterns of the spectral bands can effectively improve image selection in a complex (for climate, relief, and vegetation and crop phenology) region of 63; 700 km(2). The results show that band 01 (red) is the preferred one, as it achieves a 13% higher success than when only using quality bands criteria: a 94% global accuracy (66 true classifications, and only four omissions and one commission error). A second, important finding, is that the geostatistical selection improves results when using any band, except for band 02 (NIR1), which makes our proposal potentially useful for most remote sensing missions. Finally, the method can be executed in a reasonable computing time due to previously developed high-performance computing techniques. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node excision with or without preoperative hybrid single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in melanoma: study protocol for a multicentric randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMelanoma has become a growing interdisciplinary problem in public health worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of melanoma is increasing faster than any other cancer in the world. Because melanoma metastasizes early into the regional lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE) is included in the current American Joint Committee of Cancer guidelines. However SLNE of melanoma has a high false-negative rate of up to 44%.MethodsThe gold standard for detection and extirpation of the sentinel lymph node is preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. SPECT/CT provides complementary information: the advantages include accurate anatomical localization, identification of false positives, reduction in the number of false negatives, and alteration of the surgical approach. Therefore, sentinel lymph node-SPECT/CT provides valuable information before sentinel lymph node excision and advocates its use in melanoma. We present a multicenter, unblinded superiority randomized controlled trial to compare SPECT/CT-aided SLNE versus standard SLNE in melanoma patients.DiscussionThe primary efficacy endpoint is distant metastasis-free survival. Secondary endpoints comprise overall survival, disease-free survival, rate of local relapses within the follow-up period (false-negative rate of sentinel lymph node), number of positive sentinel lymph nodes (sensitivity, false-positive rate), complication rate, quality of life, quality-adjusted life years, inpatient days, and overall costs during hospital stays.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03683550.

TI  - Applying time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar and the unscented Kalman filter to predict deformations in Maoxian landslide
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On June 24, 2017, a catastrophic landslide occurred in Maoxian County, Sichuan, China, burying an entire village and more than 100 people. We focused on mapping and predicting the deformation in Maoxian before the landslide based on 39 C-band synthetic aperture radar images acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite. In order to identify sufficient measurement points in rural areas, the images were first filtered with joint scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar to increase the number of measurement points 20 times. Then, the cumulative time series deformation in the landslide area from November 7, 2014, to June 12, 2017, was obtained by employing a time series InSAR technique combined with an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to predict the deformation by separating the prediction and update steps. Approximately, 30 suspected landslide points were found in the area. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the experimental results suggested that combining time series InSAR with UKF can be used to predict deformation trends with millimetric accuracy at a large scale before landslides occur.

TI  - Sensitivity of Landsat-8 OLI and TIRS Data to Foliar Properties of Early Stage Bark Beetle (Ips typographus, L.) Infestation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the early stage of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) infestation (so-called green attack) is investigated using Landsat-8 optical and thermal data. We conducted an extensive field survey in June and the beginning of July 2016, to collect field data measurements from several infested and healthy trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. In total, 157 trees were selected, and leaf traits (i.e. stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and water content) were measured. Three Landsat-8 images from May, July, and August 2016 were studied, representing an early stage, advanced stage, and post-infestation, respectively. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) sensitive to the measured traits were calculated from the optical domain (VIS, NIR, and SWIR), and canopy surface temperature (CST) was calculated from the thermal infrared band using the mono-window algorithm. The leaf traits were used to examine the impact of bark beetle infestation on the infested trees and to explore the link between these traits and remote sensing data (CST and SVIs). The differences between healthy and infested samples regarding measured leaf traits were assessed using Student's t test. The relative importance of the CST and SVIs for estimating measured leaf traits was evaluated based on the variable importance in projection (VIP) obtained from the partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis. A temporal comparison was then made for SVIs with a VIP > 1, including CST, using statistical significance tests. The clustering method using a principal components analysis (PCA) was used to examine visually how well the two groups of sample plots (healthy and infested) are separated in 2-D space based on principal component scores. Finally, linear regression (LR) was used to generate the leaf traits maps using the SVI that have highest VIP score and then used to produce a stress map for the study area. The results revealed that all measured leaf traits were significantly different (p < 0.05) between healthy versus infested samples. Moreover, the study showed that CST was superior to the SVIs in detecting subtle canopy changes due to bark beetle infestation for the three months considered in this study. The results showed that CST is an essential variable for estimating measured leaf traits with VIP > 1, improving the results of clustering when used with other SVIs. Likewise, the stress map produced by CST and leaf traits well presented the infestation areas at the green attacked stage. The new insight offered by this study is that the stress induced by the early stage of bark beetle infestation is more pronounced by Landsat-8 thermal bands than the SVIs calculated from its optical bands. The potential of CST in detecting the green attack stage would have positive implications for forest practice.

TI  - Yield Estimates by a Two-Step Approach Using Hyperspectral Methods in Grasslands at High Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ruminant fodder production in agricultural lands in latitudes above the Arctic Circle is constrained by short and hectic growing seasons with a 24-hour photoperiod and low growth temperatures. The use of remote sensing to measure crop production at high latitudes is hindered by intrinsic challenges, such as a low sun elevation angle and a coastal climate with high humidity, which influences the spectral signatures of the sampled vegetation. We used a portable spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec 3) to assess spectra of grass crops and found that when applying multivariate models to the hyperspectral datasets, results show significant predictability of yields (R-2 > 0.55, root mean squared error (RMSE) < 180), even when captured under sub-optimal conditions. These results are consistent both in the full spectral range of the spectrometer (350-2500 nm) and in the 350-900 nm spectral range, which is a region more robust against air moisture. Sentinel-2A simulations resulted in moderately robust models that could be used in qualitative assessments of field productivity. In addition, simulation of the upcoming hyperspectral EnMap satellite bands showed its potential applicability to measure yields in northern latitudes both in the full spectral range of the satellite (420-2450 nm) with similar performance as the Sentinel-2A satellite and in the 420-900 nm range with a comparable reliability to the portable spectrometer. The combination of EnMap and Sentinel-2A to detect fields with low productivity and portable spectrometers to identify the fields or specific regions of fields with the lowest production can help optimize the management of fodder production in high latitudes.

TI  - Validation of Copernicus Sentinel-2 Cloud Masks Obtained from MAJA, Sen2Cor, and FMask Processors Using Reference Cloud Masks Generated with a Supervised Active Learning Procedure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 satellite mission, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) for the Copernicus program of the European Union, provides repetitive multi-spectral observations of all Earth land surfaces at a high resolution. The Level 2A product is a basic product requested by many Sentinel-2 users: it provides surface reflectance after atmospheric correction, with a cloud and cloud shadow mask. The cloud/shadow mask is a key element to enable an automatic processing of Sentinel-2 data, and therefore, its performances must be accurately validated. To validate the Sentinel-2 operational Level 2A cloud mask, a software program named Active Learning Cloud Detection (ALCD) was developed, to produce reference cloud masks. Active learning methods allow reducing the number of necessary training samples by iteratively selecting them where the confidence of the classifier is low in the previous iterations. The ALCD method was designed to minimize human operator time thanks to a manually-supervised active learning method. The trained classifier uses a combination of spectral and multi-temporal information as input features and produces fully-classified images. The ALCD method was validated using visual criteria, consistency checks, and compared to another manually-generated cloud masks, with an overall accuracy above 98%. ALCD was used to create 32 reference cloud masks, on 10 different sites, with different seasons and cloud cover types. These masks were used to validate the cloud and shadow masks produced by three Sentinel-2 Level 2A processors: MAJA, used by the French Space Agency (CNES) to deliver Level 2A products, Sen2Cor, used by the European Space Agency (ESA), and FMask, used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The results show that MAJA and FMask perform similarly, with an overall accuracy around 90% (91% for MAJA, 90% for FMask), while Sen2Cor's overall accuracy is 84%. The reference cloud masks, as well as the ALCD software used to generate them are made available to the Sentinel-2 user community.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-1 Surface Soil Moisture Product for Detecting Heavy Rainfall in the South of France
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to present an analysis of Sentinel-1 derived surface soil moisture maps (S1-SSM) produced with high spatial resolution (at plot scale) and a revisit time of six days for the Occitanie region located in the South of France as a function of precipitation data, in order to investigate the potential of S1-SSM maps for detecting heavy rainfalls. First, the correlation between S1-SSM maps and rainfall maps provided by the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) was investigated. Then, we analyzed the effect of the S1-SSM temporal resolution on detecting heavy rainfall events and the impact of these events on S1-SSM values as a function of the number of days that separated the heavy rainfall and the S1 acquisition date (cumulative rainfall more than 60 mm in 24 hours or 80 mm in 48 hours). The results showed that the six-day temporal resolution of the S1-SSM map doesn't always permit the detection of an extreme rainfall event, because confusion will appear between high S1-SSM values due to extreme rainfall events occurring six days before the acquisition of S1-SSM, and high S1-SSM values due to light rain a few hours before the acquisition of Sentinel-1 images. Moreover, the monitoring of extreme rain events using only soil moisture maps remains difficult, since many environmental parameters could affect the value of SSM, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) doesn't allow the estimation of very high soil moistures (higher than 35 vol.%).

TI  - Information Needs of Next-Generation Forest Carbon Models: Opportunities for Remote Sensing Science
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are integral to the global carbon cycle, and as a result, the accurate estimation of forest structure, biomass, and carbon are key research priorities for remote sensing science. However, estimating and understanding forest carbon and its spatiotemporal variations requires diverse knowledge from multiple research domains, none of which currently offer a complete understanding of forest carbon dynamics. New large-area forest information products derived from remotely sensed data provide unprecedented spatial and temporal information about our forests, which is information that is currently underutilized in forest carbon models. Our goal in this communication is to articulate the information needs of next-generation forest carbon models in order to enable the remote sensing community to realize the best and most useful application of its science, and perhaps also inspire increased collaboration across these research fields. While remote sensing science currently provides important contributions to large-scale forest carbon models, more coordinated efforts to integrate remotely sensed data into carbon models can aid in alleviating some of the main limitations of these models; namely, low sample sizes and poor spatial representation of field data, incomplete population sampling (i.e., managed forests exclusively), and an inadequate understanding of the processes that influence forest carbon accumulation and fluxes across spatiotemporal scales. By articulating the information needs of next-generation forest carbon models, we hope to bridge the knowledge gap between remote sensing experts and forest carbon modelers, and enable advances in large-area forest carbon modeling that will ultimately improve estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes.

TI  - NASA's Early Adopter Program Links Satellite Data to Decision Making
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the cost of satellite missions grow, government agencies are working to increase the relevance and usefulness of the Earth science data that they produce. The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) early adopter program seeks to formalize partnerships with users of data early within the satellite planning process to ensure the greatest value of the mission. Scientists who are designing the satellite observing system, those who are developing mission data products, and the community who will use them need to work together to determine how satellite data can better inform decision making. NASA is working to initiate engagement with data users much earlier in the satellite program life so that the user needs can be prioritized, continue to engage with users throughout the development cycle, and then include analysis on societal impact after nominal mission life. The Early Adopter Program allows for broad and early engagement with decision makers by encouraging individuals and institutions with clear uses of data to engage with the mission. Early adopters facilitate feedback on mission products during pre-launch and accelerate the utilization of these products post-launch. This paper provides background and detail on how NASA is working to engage with early adopters, describes the partnership between early adopters and NASA missions, and connects the program to improved societal impacts of its satellite missions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns and Morphological Characteristics of Ulva prolifera Distribution in the Yellow Sea, China in 2016-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's largest macroalgal blooms, Ulva prolifera, have appeared in the Yellow Sea every summer on different scales since 2007, causing great harm to the regional marine economy. In this study, the Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI) index was used to extract the green tide of Ulva prolifera from MODIS images in the Yellow Sea in 2016-2018, to investigate its spatiotemporal patterns and to calculate its occurrence probability. Using the standard deviational ellipse (SDE), the morphological characteristics of the green tide, including directionality and regularity, were analyzed. The results showed that the largest distribution and coverage areas occurred in 2016, with 57,384 km(2) and 2906 km(2), respectively and that the total affected region during three years was 163,162 km(2). The green tide drifted northward and died out near Qingdao, Shandong Province, which was found to be a high-risk region. The coast of Jiangsu Province was believed to be the source of Ulva prolifera, but it was probably not the only one. The regularity of the boundary shape of the distribution showed a change that was opposite to the variation of scale. Several sharp increases were found in the parameters of the SDE in all three years. In conclusion, the overall situation of Ulva prolifera was still severe in recent years, and the sea area near Qingdao became the worst hit area of the green tide event. It was also shown that the sea surface wind played an important part in its migration and morphological changes.

TI  - Optimal Combination of Predictors and Algorithms for Forest Above-Ground Biomass Mapping from Sentinel and SRTM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forest above-ground biomass (AGB) mapping is crucial for sustaining forest management and carbon cycle tracking. The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Sentinel satellite series offer opportunities for forest AGB monitoring. In this study, predictors filtered from 121 variables from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinal-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) data were composed into four groups and evaluated for their effectiveness in prediction of AGB. Five evaluated algorithms include linear regression such as stepwise regression (SWR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR); machine learning (ML) such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine for regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The results showed that the RF model used predictors from both the Sentinel series and SRTM DEM performed the best, based on the independent validation set. The RF model achieved accuracy with the mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient in 1.39, 25.48, 61.11 Mgha(-1) and 0.9769, respectively. Texture characteristics, reflectance, vegetation indices, elevation, stream power index, topographic wetness index and surface roughness were recommended predictors for AGB prediction. Predictor variables were more important than algorithms for improving the accuracy of AGB estimates. The study demonstrated encouraging results in the optimal combination of predictors and algorithms for forest AGB mapping, using openly accessible and fine-resolution data based on RF algorithms.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An up-to-date knowledge of water depth is essential for a wide range of coastal activities, such as navigation, fishing, study of coastal erosion, or the observation of the rise of water levels due to climate change. This paper presents a coastal bathymetry estimation method that takes a single satellite acquisition as input, aimed at scenarios where in situ data are not available or would be too costly to obtain. The method uses free multispectral images that are easy to obtain for any region of the globe from sources such as the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8 satellites. In order to address the shortcomings of existing image-only approaches (low resolution, scarce spatial coverage especially in the shallow water zones, dependence on specific physical conditions) we derive a new bathymetry estimation approach that combines a physical wave model with a statistical method based on Gaussian Process Regression learned in an unsupervised way. The resulting system is able to provide a nearly complete coverage of the 2-12-m-depth zone at a resolution of 80 m. Evaluated on three sites around the Hawaiian Islands, our method obtained estimates with a correlation coefficient in the range of 0.7-0.9. Furthermore, the trained models provide equally good results in nearby zones that lack exploitable waves, extending the scope of applicability of the method.

T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Assembling Ln(3+)(HPBA(n)) (Ln = Eu or Tb, HPBA = N-(2-pyridinyl)benzoylacetamide) in the cavities of zeolite Y (ZY) via the ship-in-a-bottle strategy leads to the formation of novel luminescent composite, Ln(HPBA(n))@ZY, whose luminescence can be easily modulated by ammonia on the basis of the energy level variation of HPBA after deprotonation process. Additionally the bimetallic complex doping sample, Eu0.5Tb0.5(HPBA(n))@ZY, show great potential as self-referencing luminescent sensor for detecting low ammonia concentration of 10(-12)-0.25 wt%.

TI  - Landsat 4, 5 and 7 (1982 to 2017) Analysis Ready Data (ARD) Observation Coverage over the Conterminous United States and Implications for Terrestrial Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) are designed to make the U.S. Landsat archive straightforward to use. In this paper, the availability of the Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) ARD over the conterminous United States (CONUS) are quantified for a 36-year period (1 January 1982 to 31 December 2017). Complex patterns of ARD availability occur due to the satellite orbit and sensor geometry, cloud, sensor acquisition and health issues and because of changing relative orientation of the ARD tiles with respect to the Landsat orbit paths. Quantitative per-pixel and summary ARD tile results are reported. Within the CONUS, the average annual number of non-cloudy observations in each 150 x 150 km ARD tile varies from 0.53 to 16.80 (Landsat 4 TM), 11.08 to 22.83 (Landsat 5 TM), 9.73 to 21.72 (Landsat 7 ETM+) and 14.23 to 30.07 (all three sensors). The annual number was most frequently only 2 to 4 Landsat 4 TM observations (36% of the CONUS tiles), increasing to 14 to 16 Landsat 5 TM observations (26% of tiles), 12 to 14 Landsat 7 ETM+ observations (31% of tiles) and 18 to 20 observations (23% of tiles) when considering all three sensors. The most frequently observed ARD tiles were in the arid south-west and in certain mountain rain shadow regions and the least observed tiles were in the north-east, around the Great Lakes and along parts of the north-west coast. The quality of time series algorithm results is expected to be reduced at ARD tiles with low reported availability. The smallest annual number of cloud-free observations for the Landsat 5 TM are over ARD tile h28v04 (northern New York state), for Landsat 7 ETM+ are over tile h25v07 (Ohio and Pennsylvania) and for Landsat 4 TM are over tile h22v08 (northern Indiana). The greatest annual number of cloud-free observations for the Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+ ARD are over southern California ARD tile h04v11 and for the Landsat 4 TM are over southern Arizona tile h06v13. The reported results likely overestimate the number of good surface observations because shadows and cirrus clouds were not considered. Implications of the findings for terrestrial monitoring and future ARD research are discussed.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Air Specific Humidity and Air-Sea Latent Heat Flux Using FY-3C Microwave Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Latent heat flux (LHF) plays an important role in the global hydrological cycle and is therefore necessary to understand global climate variability. It has been reported that the near-surface specific humidity is a major source of error for satellite-derived LHF. Here, a new empirical model relating multichannel brightness temperatures (TB) obtained from the Fengyun-3 (FY-3C) microwave radiometer and sea surface air specific humidity (Qa) is proposed. It is based on the relationship between TB, Qa, sea surface temperature (SST), and water vapor scale height. Compared with in situ data, the new satellite-derived Qa and LHF both exhibit better statistical results than previous estimates. For Qa, the bias, root mean square difference (RMSD), and the correlation coefficient (R-2) between satellite and buoy in the mid-latitude region are 0.08 g/kg, 1.76 g/kg, and 0.92, respectively. For LHF, the bias, RMSD, and R-2 are 2.40 W/m(2), 34.24 W/m(2), and 0.87, respectively. The satellite-derived Qa are also compared with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) humidity datasets, with a bias, RMSD, and R-2 of 0.02 g/kg, 1.02 g/kg, and 0.98, respectively. The proposed method can also be extended in the future to observations from other space-borne microwave radiometers.

TI  - Global 15-Meter Mosaic Derived from Simulated True-Color ASTER Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work proposes a new methodology to build an Earth-wide mosaic using high-spatial resolution (15 ) Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images in pseudo-true color. As ASTER originally misses a blue visible band, we have designed a cloud of artificial neural networks to estimate the ASTER blue reflectance from Level-1 data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the same satellite Terra platform. Next, the granules are radiometrically harmonized with a novel color-balancing method and seamlessly blended into a mosaic. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are robust enough to process several thousands of scenes acquired under very different temporal, spatial, and atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the created mosaic fully preserves the ASTER fine structures across the various building steps. The proposed methodology and protocol are modular so that they can easily be adapted to similar sensors with enormous image libraries.

TI  - Changes in a Giant Iceberg Created from the Collapse of the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, Derived from Sentinel-1 and CryoSat-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The giant tabular iceberg A68 broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, in July 2017. The evolution of A68 would have been affected by both the Larsen C Ice Shelf, the surrounding sea ice, and the nearby shallow seafloor. In this study, we analyze the initial evolution of iceberg A68Athe largest originating from A68in terms of changes in its area, drift speed, rotation, and freeboard using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and CryoSat-2 SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter observations. The area of iceberg A68A sharply decreased in mid-August 2017 and mid-May 2018 via large calving events. In September 2018, its surface area increased, possibly due to its longitudinal stretching by melting of surrounding sea ice. The decrease in the area of A68A was only 2% over 1.5 years. A68A was relatively stationary until mid-July 2018, while it was surrounded by the Larsen C Ice Shelf front and a high concentration of sea ice, and when its movement was interrupted by the shallow seabed. The iceberg passed through a bay-shaped region in front of the Larsen C Ice Shelf after July 2018, showing a nearly circular motion with higher speed and greater rotation. Drift was mainly inherited from its rotation, because it was still located near the Bawden Ice Rise and could not pass through by the shallow seabed. The freeboard of iceberg A68A decreased at an average rate of -0.80 +/- 0.29 m/year during February-November 2018, which could have been due to basal melting by warm seawater in the Antarctic summer and increasing relative velocity of iceberg and ocean currents in the winter of that year. The freeboard of the iceberg measured using CryoSat-2 could represent the returned signal from the snow surface on the iceberg. Based on this, the average rate of thickness change was estimated at -12.89 +/- 3.34 m/year during the study period considering an average rate of snow accumulation of 0.82 +/- 0.06 m/year predicted by reanalysis data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The results of this study reveal the initial evolution mechanism of iceberg A68A, which cannot yet drift freely due to the surrounding terrain and sea ice.

TI  - Parallel Connected Generative Adversarial Network with Quadratic Operation for SAR Image Generation and Application for Classification
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to the availability of large-scale data, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have witnessed success in various applications of computer vision. However, the performance of CNNs on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image classification is unsatisfactory due to the lack of well-labeled SAR data, as well as the differences in imaging mechanisms between SAR images and optical images. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of SAR image classification by employing the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce more labeled SAR data. We propose special GANs for generating SAR images to be used in the training process. First, we incorporate the quadratic operation into the GAN, extending the convolution to make the discriminator better represent the SAR data; second, the statistical characteristics of SAR images are integrated into the GAN to make its value function more reasonable; finally, two types of parallel connected GANs are designed, one of which we call PWGAN, combining the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) together in the structure, and the other, which we call CNN-PGAN, applying a pre-trained CNN as a discriminator to the parallel GAN. Both PWGAN and CNN-PGAN consist of a number of discriminators and generators according to the number of target categories. Experimental results on the TerraSAR-X single polarization dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Analyzing Performances of Different Atmospheric Correction Techniques for Landsat 8: Application for Coastal Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean colour (OC) remote sensing is important for monitoring marine ecosystems. However, inverting the OC signal from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance measured by satellite sensors remains a challenge as the retrieval accuracy is highly dependent on the performance of the atmospheric correction as well as sensor calibration. In this study, the performances of four atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, the Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery (ARCSI), Atmospheric Correction for OLI lite' (ACOLITE), Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance (LSR) Climate Data Record (Landsat CDR), herein referred to as LaSRC (Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), implemented for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, were evaluated. The OLI-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) products (also known as Level-2 products) were tested against near-simultaneous in-situ data acquired from the OC component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC). Analyses of the match-ups revealed that generic atmospheric correction methods (i.e., ARCSI and LaSRC), which perform reasonably well over land, provide inaccurate Level-2 products over coastal waters, in particular, in the blue bands. Between water-specific AC methods (i.e., SeaDAS and ACOLITE), SeaDAS was found to perform better over complex waters with root-mean-square error (RMSE) varying from 0.0013 to 0.0005 sr(-1) for the 443 and 655 nm channels, respectively. An assessment of the effects of dominant environmental variables revealed AC retrieval errors were influenced by the solar zenith angle and wind speed for ACOLITE and SeaDAS in the 443 and 482 nm channels. Recognizing that the AERONET-OC sites are not representative of inland waters, extensive research and analyses are required to further evaluate the performance of various AC methods for high-resolution imagers like Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 under a broad range of aquatic/atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Improved Automated Detection of Subpixel-Scale InundationRevised Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) Partial Surface Water Tests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to produce useful hydrologic and aquatic habitat data from the Landsat system, the U.S. Geological Survey has developed the Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) Landsat Science Product. DSWE will provide long-term, high-temporal resolution data on variations in inundation extent. The model used to generate DSWE is composed of five decision-rule based tests that do not require scene-based training. To allow its general application, required inputs are limited to the Landsat at-surface reflectance product and a digital elevation model. Unlike other Landsat-based water products, DSWE includes pixels that are only partially covered by water to increase inundation dynamics information content. Previously published DSWE model development included one wetland-focused test developed through visual inspection of field-collected Everglades spectra. A comparison of that test's output against Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) in situ data confirmed the expectation that omission errors were a prime source of inaccuracy in vegetated environments. Further evaluation exposed a tendency toward commission error in coniferous forests. Improvements to the subpixel level partial surface water (PSW) component of DSWE was the focus of this research. Spectral mixture models were created from a variety of laboratory and image-derived endmembers. Based on the mixture modeling, a more aggressive PSW rule improved accuracy in herbaceous wetlands and reduced errors of commission elsewhere, while a second conservative test provides an alternative when commission errors must be minimized. Replication of the EDEN-based experiments using the revised PSW tests yielded a statistically significant increase in mean overall agreement (4%, p = 0.01, n = 50) and a statistically significant decrease (11%, p = 0.009, n = 50) in mean errors of omission. Because the developed spectral mixture models included image-derived vegetation endmembers and laboratory spectra for soil groups found across the US, simulations suggest where the revised DSWE PSW tests perform as they do in the Everglades and where they may prove problematic. Visual comparison of DSWE outputs with an unusual variety of coincidently collected images for locations spread throughout the US support conclusions drawn from Everglades quantitative analyses and highlight DSWE PSW component strengths and weaknesses.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite and UAV-Based Multispectral Imagery for Vineyard Variability Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In agriculture, remotely sensed data play a crucial role in providing valuable information on crop and soil status to perform effective management. Several spectral indices have proven to be valuable tools in describing crop spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, a detailed analysis and comparison of vineyard multispectral imagery, provided by decametric resolution satellite and low altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms, is presented. The effectiveness of Sentinel-2 imagery and of high-resolution UAV aerial images was evaluated by considering the well-known relation between the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and crop vigour. After being pre-processed, the data from UAV was compared with the satellite imagery by computing three different NDVI indices to properly analyse the unbundled spectral contribution of the different elements in the vineyard environment considering: (i) the whole cropland surface; (ii) only the vine canopies; and (iii) only the inter-row terrain. The results show that the raw s resolution satellite imagery could not be directly used to reliably describe vineyard variability. Indeed, the contribution of inter-row surfaces to the remotely sensed dataset may affect the NDVI computation, leading to biased crop descriptors. On the contrary, vigour maps computed from the UAV imagery, considering only the pixels representing crop canopies, resulted to be more related to the in-field assessment compared to the satellite imagery. The proposed method may be extended to other crop typologies grown in rows or without intensive layout, where crop canopies do not extend to the whole surface or where the presence of weeds is significant.

TI  - How Groundwater Level Fluctuations and Geotechnical Properties Lead to Asymmetric Subsidence: A PSInSAR Analysis of Land Deformation over a Transit Corridor in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Los Angeles has experienced ground deformations during the past decades. These ground displacements can be destructive for infrastructure and can reduce the land capacity for groundwater storage. Therefore, this paper seeks to evaluate the existing ground displacement patterns along a new metro tunnel in Los Angeles, known as the Sepulveda Transit Corridor. The goal is to find the most crucial areas suffering from subsidence or uplift and to enhance the previous reports in this metropolitan area. For this purpose, we applied a Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar using 29 Sentinel-1A acquisitions from June 2017 to May 2018 to estimate the deformation rate. The assessment procedure demonstrated a high rate of subsidence in the Inglewood field that is near the study area of the Sepulveda Transit Corridor with a maximum deformation rate of 30 mm/yr. Finally, data derived from in situ instruments as groundwater level variations, GPS observations, and soil properties were collected and analyzed to interpret the results. Investigation of geotechnical boreholes indicates layers of fine-grained soils in some parts of the area and this observation confirms the necessity of more detailed geotechnical investigations for future constructions in the region. Results of investigating line-of-sight displacement rates showed asymmetric subsidence along the corridor and hence we proposed a new framework to evaluate the asymmetric subsidence index that can help the designers and decision makers of the project to consider solutions to control the current subsidence.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation-Based Building Footprint Extraction Using Very High-Resolution Satellite Images and Multi-Source GIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic extraction of building footprints from high-resolution satellite imagery has become an important and challenging research issue receiving greater attention. Many recent studies have explored different deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods for improving the accuracy of building extraction. Although they record substantial land cover and land use information (e.g., buildings, roads, water, etc.), public geographic information system (GIS) map datasets have rarely been utilized to improve building extraction results in existing studies. In this research, we propose a U-Net-based semantic segmentation method for the extraction of building footprints from high-resolution multispectral satellite images using the SpaceNet building dataset provided in the DeepGlobe Satellite Challenge of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2018 (CVPR 2018). We explore the potential of multiple public GIS map datasets (OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and MapWorld) through integration with the WorldView-3 satellite datasets in four cities (Las Vegas, Paris, Shanghai, and Khartoum). Several strategies are designed and combined with the U-Net-based semantic segmentation model, including data augmentation, post-processing, and integration of the GIS map data and satellite images. The proposed method achieves a total F1-score of 0.704, which is an improvement of 1.1% to 12.5% compared with the top three solutions in the SpaceNet Building Detection Competition and 3.0% to 9.2% compared with the standard U-Net-based method. Moreover, the effect of each proposed strategy and the possible reasons for the building footprint extraction results are analyzed substantially considering the actual situation of the four cities.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Parameters to Crop Height and Canopy Coverage
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar technique has provided various opportunities and challenges in agricultural activities mainly on crop management. The aim of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of 10 parameters derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, to crop height and canopy coverage (CC) of maize, sunflower, and wheat. The correlation coefficient values indicate a high correlation for maize during the early growing stage. The coefficient determinations (R-2) of 0.82 and 0.81 indicate that there is a strong relationship between the maize height and SAR parameters including VV + VH and VV, respectively. The maize CC is well correlated with VV parameter (R-2 = 0.73), but it is observed that at the later growing stage the correlation became weaker. This means that the sensitivity decreases with increasing vegetation cover growth. Compared to maize, the sensitivity of SAR parameters to wheat variables is often good at the early stage. However, the highest correlation with wheat height represented by Alpha (alpha) decomposition parameter (R-2 = 0.67). The sunflower height has an insignificant correlation with the majority of SAR parameters and only VH polarization shows low sensitivity (R-2 = 0.31). The sunflower CC shows relatively higher correlation with VV polarization (R-2 = 0.46) at the early stage while no considerable correlation is observed at the later stage. It is found that Sentinel-1 has a high potential for estimation of crop height and CC of the maize as a broad-leaf crop. The same is not true for sunflower as another broad-leaf crop.

TI  - Integration of Landsat-8 Thermal and Visible-Short Wave Infrared Data for Improving Prediction Accuracy of Forest Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) has been investigated in multiple studies, either by means of visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared or thermal infrared remotely sensed data, with various degrees of accuracy. However, it is not yet known how the integration of visible/near and shortwave-infrared and thermal infrared data affect estimates of LAI. In this study, we examined the utility of Landsat-8 thermal infrared data together with its spectral data from the visible/near and shortwave-infrared region to quantify the LAI of a mixed temperate forest in Germany. A field campaign was carried out in August 2015, in the Bavarian Forest National Park, concurrent with the time of the Landsat-8 overpass, and a number of forest structural parameters, including LAI and proportion of vegetation cover, were measured for 37 plots. A normalised difference vegetation index threshold method was applied to calculate land surface emissivity and land surface temperature and their relations to LAI were investigated. Next, the relation between LAI and eight commonly used vegetation indices were examined using the visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared remote sensing data. Finally, the artificial neural network was used to predict the LAI using: (i) reflectance data from the Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) sensor; (ii) reflectance data from the OLI sensor and the land surface emissivity; and (iii) reflectance data from the OLI sensor and land surface temperature. A stronger relationship was observed between LAI and land surface emissivity compared to that between LAI and land surface temperature. In general, LAI was predicted with relatively low accuracy by means of the vegetation indices. Among the studied vegetation indices, the modified vegetation index had the highest accuracy for LAI prediction (R-CV(2) = 0.33, RMSECV = 1.21 m(2)m(-2)). Nevertheless, using the visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared spectral data in the artificial neural network, the prediction accuracy of LAI increased (R-CV(2) = 0.58, RMSECV = 0.83 m(2)m(-2)). The integration of reflectance and land surface emissivity significantly improved the prediction accuracy of the LAI (R-CV(2) = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.63 m(2)m(-2)). For the first time, our results demonstrate that the combination of Landsat-8 reflectance spectral data from the visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared domain and thermal infrared data can boost the estimation accuracy of the LAI in a forest ecosystem. This finding has implication for the prediction of other vegetation biophysical, or possibly biochemical variables using thermal infrared satellite remote sensing data, as well as regional mapping of LAI when coupled with a canopy radiative transfer model.

TI  - Multi-Crop Green LAI Estimation with a New Simple Sentinel-2 LAI Index (SeLI)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial quantification of green leaf area index (LAI(green)), the total green photosynthetically active leaf area per ground area, is a crucial biophysical variable for agroecosystem monitoring. The Sentinel-2 mission is with (1) a temporal resolution lower than a week, (2) a spatial resolution of up to 10 m, and (3) narrow bands in the red and red-edge region, a highly promising mission for agricultural monitoring. The aim of this work is to define an easy implementable LAI(green) index for the Sentinel-2 mission. Two large and independent multi-crop datasets of in situ collected LAI(green) measurements were used. Commonly used LAI(green) indices applied on the Sentinel-2 10 m x 10 m pixel resulted in a validation R-2 lower than 0.6. By calculating all Sentinel-2 band combinations to identify high correlation and physical basis with LAI(green), the new Sentinel-2 LAI(green) Index (SeLI) was defined. SeLI is a normalized index that uses the 705 nm and 865 nm centered bands, exploiting the red-edge region for low-saturating absorption sensitivity to photosynthetic vegetation. A R-2 of 0.708 (root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.67) and a R-2 of 0.732 (RMSE = 0.69) were obtained with a linear fitting for the calibration and validation datasets, respectively, outperforming established indices. Sentinel-2 LAI(green) maps are presented.

TI  - The Organization, Implementation, and Functioning of Dengue Surveillance in IndiaA Systematic Scoping Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Dengue ' s re-emerging epidemiology poses a major global health threat. In India, dengue contributes significantly to the global communicable disease burden, and has been declared highly endemic. This study aims to identify and critically appraise India's dengue surveillance system. We conducted a systematic literature review, searching Medline, Web of Sciences, Global Health, and Indian Journals. We conducted a narrative synthesis and thematic analysis. Eighteen studies fulfilled eligibility. Organizationally, most studies referred to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, primarily responsible for overall vector and disease control, as well as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, responsible for reporting, outbreak identification, and integration. Surveillance implementation was mostly framed as passive, sentinel, and hospital-based. Reporting varies from weekly to monthly, flowing from primary healthcare centres to district and national authorities. Dengue confirmation is only recognized if conducted with government-distributed MAC-ELISA tests. The surveillance system predominantly relies on public reporting units. In terms of functioning, current surveillance seems to have improved dengue reporting as well the system's detection capacities. Emergency and outbreak responses are often described as timely; however, they are challenged by underreporting, weak data reliability, lack of private reporting, and system fragmentation. Concluding, India's dengue surveillance structure remains weak. Efforts to create an infrastructure of communication, cooperation, and integration are evident, however, not achieved yet.

TI  - Source Parameter Estimation of the 2009 Ms6.0 Yao'an Earthquake, Southern China, Using InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 9 July 2009, an Ms6.0 earthquake occurred in mountainous area of Yao'an in Yunnan province of Southern China. Although the magnitude of the earthquake was moderate, it attracted the attention of many Earth scientists because of its threat to the safety of the population and its harm to the local economy. However, the source parameters remain poorly understood due to the sparse distribution of seismic and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) stations in this mountainous region. Therefore, in this study, the two L-band ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1) PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) images from an ascending track is used to investigate the coseismic deformation field, and further determine the location, fault geometry and slip distribution of the earthquake. The results show that the Yao'an earthquake was a strike-slip event with a down-dip slip component. The slip mainly occurred at depths of 3-8 km, with a maximum slip of approximately 70 cm at a depth of 6 km, which is shallower than the reported focal depth of 10 km. An analysis of the seismic activity and tectonics of the Yao'an area reveals that the 9 July 2009 Yao'an earthquake was the result of regional stress accumulation, which eventually led to the rupture of the northwestern most part of the Maweijing fault.

TI  - Assessing the Glacier Boundaries in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China by Multi-Temporal Coherence Estimation with Sentinel-1A InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence has been applied in delineating the boundaries of alpine glaciers because it is nearly unaffected by cloud coverage and can collect data day and night. However, very limited work with application of SAR data has been performed for the alpine glaciers in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) of China. In this study, we attempted to investigate the change of coherence level in alpine glacier zone and access the glacier boundaries in the QTP using time series of Sentinel-1A SAR images. The DaDongkemadi Glacier (DDG) in the central QTP was selected as the study area with land cover mainly classified into wet snow, ice, river outwash and soil land. We utilized 45 Sentinel-1A C-band SAR images collected during October of 2014 through January of 2018 over the DDG to generate time series of interferometric coherence maps, and to further extract the DDG boundaries. Based on the spatiotemporal analysis of coherence values in the selected sampling areas, we first determined the threshold as 0.7 for distinguishing among different ground targets and then extracted the DDG boundaries through threshold-based segmentation and edge detection. The validation was performed by comparing the DDG boundaries extracted from the coherence maps with those extracted from the Sentinel-2B optical image. The testing results show that the wet snow and ice present a relatively low level of coherence (about 0.5), while the river outwash and the soil land present a higher level of coherence (0.8-1.0). It was found that the coherence maps spanning between June and September (i.e., the glacier ablation period) are the most suitable for identifying the snow- and ice-covered areas. When compared with the boundary detected using optical image, the mean value of Jaccard similarity coefficient for the total areas within the DDG boundaries derived from the coherence maps selected around July, August and September reached up to 0.9010. In contrast, the mean value from the coherence maps selected around December was relatively lower (0.8862). However, the coherence maps around December were the most suitable for distinguishing the ice from the river outwash around the DDG terminus, as the river outwash areas could hardly be differentiated from the ice-covered areas from June through September. The correlation analysis performed by using the meteorological data (i.e., air temperature and precipitation records) suggests that the air temperature and precipitation have a more significant influence on the coherence level of the ice and river outwash than the wet snow and soil land. The proposed method, applied efficiently in this study, shows the potential of multi-temporal coherence estimation from the Sentinel-1A mission to access the boundaries of alpine glaciers on a larger scale in the QTP.

TI  - Detection and Validation of Tropical Peatland Flaming and Smouldering Using Landsat-8 SWIR and TIRS Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Tropical Peatland Combustion Algorithm (ToPeCAl) was first established from Landsat-8 images acquired in 2015, which were used to detect peatland combustion in flaming and smouldering stages. Detection of smouldering combustion from space remains a challenge due to its low temperature and generally small spatial extent. The ToPeCAl consists of the Shortwave Infrared Combustion Index based on reflectance (SICI), and Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in Shortwave Infrared band-7 (SWIR-2), TOA brightness temperature of Thermal Infrared band-10 (TIR-1), and TOA reflectance of band-1, the Landsat-8 aerosol band. The implementation of ToPeCAl was then validated using terrestrial and aerial images (helicopter and drone) collected during fieldwork in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in the 2018 fire season, on the same day as Landsat-8 overpasses. The overall accuracy of ToPeCAl was found to be 82% with omission errors in a small area (less than 30 m x 30 m) from mixtures of smouldering and vegetation pixels, and commission errors (with minimum area of 30 m x 30 m) on high reflective building rooftops in urban areas. These errors were further reduced by masking and removing urban areas prior to analysis using landuse Geographic Information System (GIS) data; improving the overall mapping accuracy to 93%. For comparison, the day and night-time VIIRS (375 m) active fire product (VNP14IMG) was utilised, obtaining a lower probability of fire detection of 71% compared to ground truth, and 57-72% agreement in a buffer distance of 375 m to 1500 m when compared to the Landsat-8 ToPeCAl results. The night-time data of VNP14IMG was found to have a better correspondence with ToPeCAl results from Landsat 8 than day-time data. This finding could lead to a potential merger of ToPeCAl with VNP14IMG to fill the temporal gaps of peatland fire information when using Landsat. However, the VNP14IMG product exhibited overestimation compared with the results of ToPeCAl applied to Landsat-8.

TI  - Mapping Winter Wheat Planting Area and Monitoring Its Phenology Using Sentinel-1 Backscatter Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop planting area mapping and phenology monitoring are of great importance to analyzing the impacts of climate change on agricultural production. In this study, crop planting area and phenology were identified based on Sentinel-1 backscatter time series in the test region of the North China Plain, East Asia, which has a stable cropping pattern and similar phenological stages across the region. Ground phenological observations acquired from a typical agro-meteorological station were used as a priori knowledge. A parallelepiped classifier processed VH (vertical transmitting, horizontal receiving) and VV (vertical transmitting, vertical receiving) backscatter signals in order to map the winter wheat planting area. An accuracy assessment showed that the total classification accuracy reached 84% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.77. Both the difference (sigma d) between VH and VV and its slope were obtained to contrast with a priori knowledge and then used to extract the phenological metrics. Our findings from the analysis of the time series showed that the seedling, tillering, overwintering, jointing, and heading of winter wheat may be closely related to sigma d and its slope. Overall, this study presents a generalizable methodology for mapping the winter wheat planting area and monitoring phenology using Sentinel-1 backscatter time series, especially in areas lacking optical remote sensing data. Our results suggest that the main change in Sentinel-1 backscatter is dominated by the vegetation canopy structure, which is different from the established methods using optical remote sensing data, and it is available for phenological metrics extraction.

TI  - High Sensitive Night-time Light Imaging Camera Design and In-orbit Test of Luojia1-01 Satellite
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Luojia1-01 satellite is the first scientific experimental satellite applied for night-time light remote sensing data acquisition, and the payload is an optical camera with high sensitivity, high radiation measurement accuracy and stable elements of interior orientation. At the same time, a special shaped hood is designed, which significantly improved the ability of the camera to suppress stray light. Camera electronics adopts the integrated design of focal plane and imaging processing, which greatly reduces the volume and weight of the system. In this paper, the design of the optical camera is summarized, and the results of in-orbit imaging performance tests are analyzed. The results show that the dynamic modulation transfer function (MTF) of the camera is better than 0.17, and the SNR is better than 35 dB under the condition of 10 lx illuminance and 0.3 reflectivity and all indicators meet the design requirements. The data obtained have been widely applied in many fields such as the process of urbanization, light pollution analysis, marine fisheries detection and military.

TI  - Boreal Forest Snow Damage Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disturbances significantly influence forest ecosystem services and biodiversity. Accurate delineation and early detection of areas affected by disturbances are critical for estimating extent of damage, assessing economical influence and guiding forest management activities. In this study we focus on snow load damage detection from C-Band SAR images. Snow damage is one of the least studied forest damages, which is getting more common due to current climate trends. The study site was located in the southern part of Northern Finland and the SAR data were represented by the time series of C-band SAR scenes acquired by the Sentinel-1 sensor. Methods used in the study included improved k nearest neighbour method, logistic regression analysis and support vector machine classification. Snow damage recordings from a large snow damage event that took place in Finland during late 2018 were used as reference data. Our results showed an overall detection accuracy of 90%, indicating potential of C-band SAR for operational use in snow damage mapping. Additionally, potential of multitemporal Sentinel-1 data in estimating growing stock volume in damaged forest areas were carried out, with obtained results indicating strong potential for estimating the overall volume of timber within the affected areas. The results and research questions for further studies are discussed.

TI  - Multi-Feature Based Ocean Oil Spill Detection for Polarimetric SAR Data Using Random Forest and the Self-Similarity Parameter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important means to detect ocean oil spills which cause serious damage to the marine ecosystem. However, the look-alikes, which have a similar behavior to oil slicks in SAR images, will reduce the oil spill detection accuracy. Therefore, a novel oil spill detection method based on multiple features of polarimetric SAR data is proposed to improve the detection accuracy in this paper. In this method, the self-similarity parameter, which is sensitive to the randomness of the scattering target, is introduced to enhance the discrimination ability between oil slicks and look-alikes. The proposed method uses the Random Forest classification combing self-similarity parameter with seven well-known features to improve oil spill detection accuracy. Evaluations and comparisons were conducted with Radarsat-2 and UAVSAR polarimetric SAR datasets, which shows that: (1) the oil spill detection accuracy of the proposed method reaches 92.99% and 82.25% in two datasets, respectively, which is higher than three well-known methods. (2) Compared with other seven polarimetric features, self-similarity parameter has the better oil spill detection capability in the scene with lower wind speed close to 2-3 m/s, while, when the wind speed is close to 9-12 m/s, it is more suitable for oil spill detection in the downwind scene where the microwave incident direction is similar to the sea surface wind direction and performs well in the scene with incidence angle range from 29.7 degrees to 43.5 degrees.

TI  - Combining Electrical Resistivity Tomography and Satellite Images for Improving Evapotranspiration Estimates of Citrus Orchards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An adjusted satellite-based model was proposed with the aim of improving spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET) estimates under plant water stress conditions. Remote sensing data and near surface geophysics information, using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), were used in a revised version of the original dual crop coefficient (K-c) FAO-56 approach. Sentinel 2-A imagery were used to compute vegetation indices (VIs) required for spatially estimating ET. The potentiality of the ERT technique was exploited for tracking the soil wetting distribution patterns during and after irrigation phases. The ERT-derived information helped to accurately estimate the wet exposed fraction (f(ew)) and therefore the water evaporated from the soil surface into the dual K-c FAO-56 approach. Results, validated by site-specific ET measurements (ETEC) obtained using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, showed that ERT-adjusted ET estimates (ETERT) were considerably reduced (15%) when compared with the original dual K-c FAO-56 approach (ETFAO), soil evaporation overestimation being the main reason for these discrepancies. Nevertheless, ETFAO and ETERT showed overestimations of 64% and 40% compared to ETEC. This is because both approaches determine ET under standard conditions without water limitation, whereas EC is able to determine ET even under soil water deficit conditions. From the comparison between ETEC and ETERT, the water stress coefficient was experimentally derived, reaching a mean value for the irrigation season of 0.74. The obtained results highlight how new technologies for soil water status monitoring can be incorporated for improving ET estimations, particularly under drip irrigation conditions.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variability of Open-Ocean Barrier Islands along the Indus Delta Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Barrier islands (BIs) have been designated as the first line of defense for coastal human assets against rising sea level. Global mean sea level may rise from 0.21 to 0.83 m by the end of 21st century as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although the Indus Delta covers an area of 41,440 km(2) surrounded by a chain of BIs, this may result in an encroachment area of 3750 km(2) in Indus Delta with each 1 m rise of sea level. This study has used a long-term (1976 to 2017) satellite data record to study the development, movement and dynamics of BIs located along the Indus Delta. For this purpose, imagery from Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors was used. From all these sensors, the Near Infrared (NIR) band (0.7-0.9 mu m) was used for the delineation and extraction of the boundaries of 18 BIs. It was found that the area and magnitude of these BIs is so dynamic, and their movement is so great that changes in their positions and land areas have continuously been changing. Among these BIs, 38% were found to be vulnerable to oceanic factors, 37% were found to be partially vulnerable, 17% remained partially sustainable, and only 8% of these BIs sustained against the ocean controlling factors. The dramatic gain and loss in area of BIs is due to variant sediment budget transportation through number of floods in the Indus Delta and sea-level rise. Coastal protection and management along the Indus Delta should be adopted to defend against the erosive action of the ocean.

TI  - Drifting Effects of NOAA Satellites on Long-Term Active Fire Records of Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Explicit knowledge of different error sources in long-term climate records from space is required to understand and mitigate their impacts on resulting time series. Imagery of the heritage Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) provides unique potential for climate research dating back to the 1980s, flying onboard a series of successive National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites. However, the NOAA satellites are affected by severe orbital drift that results in spurious trends in time series. We identified the impact and extent of the orbital drift in 1 km AVHRR long-term active fire data. This record contains data of European fire activity from 1985-2016 and was analyzed on a regional scale and extended across Europe. Inconsistent sampling of the diurnal active fire cycle due to orbital drift with a maximum delay of approximate to 5 h over NOAA-14 lifetime revealed a approximate to 90% decline in the number of observed fires. However, interregional results were less conclusive and other error sources as well as interannual variability were more pronounced. Solar illumination, measured by the sun zenith angle (SZA), related changes in background temperatures were significant for all regions and afternoon satellites with major changes in -0.03 to -0.09 K deg-1 for BT34 (p>0.001). Based on example scenes, we simulated the influence of changing temperatures related to changes in the SZA on the detection of active fires. These simulations showed a profound influence of the active fire detection capabilities dependent on biome and land cover characteristics. The strong decrease in the relative changes in the apparent number of active fires calculated over the satellites lifetime highlights that a correction of the orbital drift effect is essential even over short time periods.

As such, estimates of the building stock and the values at risk can assist in flood risk management, including determining the damage extent and severity. Unfortunately, little information about building asset value, and especially its spatial distributions, is readily available in most countries. This is certainly true in China, given that the statistical data on building floor area (BFA) is collected by administrative entities (i.e. census level). To bridge the gap between census-level BFA data and geo-coded building asset value data, this article introduces a method for building asset value mapping, using Shanghai as an example. This method consists of a census-level BFA disaggregation (downscaling) by means of a building footprint map extracted from high-resolution remote sensing data, combined with LandScan population density grid data and a financial appraisal of building asset values. Validation with statistical data and field survey data confirms that the method can produce good results, but largely constrained by the resolution of the population density grid used. However, compared with other models with no disaggregation in flood exposure assessment that involves Shanghai, the building asset value mapping method used in this study has a comparative advantage, and it will provide a quick way to produce a building asset value map for regional flood risk assessments. We argue that a sound flood risk assessment should be based on a high-resolution-individual building-based-building asset value map because of the high spatial heterogeneity of flood hazards.

TI  - Radar Interferometry Time Series to Investigate Deformation of Soft Clay Subgrade SettlementA Case Study of Lungui Highway, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring surface movement near highways over soft clay subgrades is fundamental for understanding the dynamics of the settlement process and preventing hazards. Earlier studies have demonstrated the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of using time series radar interferometry (InSAR) technique to measure the ground deformation. However, the accuracy of the advanced differential InSAR techniques, including short baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR, is limited by the temporal deformation models used. In this study, a comparison of four widely used time series deformation models in InSAR, namely Multi Velocity Model (MVM), Permanent Velocity Model (PVM), Seasonal Model (SM) and Cubic Polynomial Model (CPM), was conducted to measure the long-term ground deformation after the construction of road embankment over soft clay subgrade. SBAS-InSAR technique with TerraSAR-X satellite imagery were conducted to generate the time series deformation data over the studied highway. In the experiments, three accuracy indices were applied to show the residual phase, mean temporal coherence and the RMS of high-pass deformation, respectively. In addition, the derived time series deformation maps of the highway based on the four selected models and 17 TerraSAR-X images acquired from June 2014 to November 2015 were compared. The leveling data was also used to validate the experimental results. Our results suggested the Seasonal Model is the most suitable model for the selected study site. Consequently, we analyzed two bridges in detail and three single points distributed near the highway. Compared with the ground leveling deformation measurements and results of other models, SM showed better consistency, with the accuracy of deformation to be +/- 7 mm.

TI  - Estimating Surface Soil Heat Flux in Permafrost Regions Using Remote Sensing-Based Models on the Northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau under Clear-Sky Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground surface soil heat flux (G(0)) quantifies the energy transfer between the atmosphere and the ground through the land surface. However; it is difficult to obtain the spatial distribution of G(0) in permafrost regions because of the limitation of in situ observation and complication of ground surface conditions. This study aims at developing an improved G(0) parameterization scheme applicable to permafrost regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau under clear-sky conditions. We validated several existing remote sensing-based models to estimate G(0) by analyzing in situ measurement data. Based on the validation of previous models on G(0); we added the solar time angle to the G(0) parameterization scheme; which considered the phase difference problem. The maximum values of RMSE and MAE between measured G(0) and simulated G(0) using the improved parameterization scheme and in situ data were calculated to be 6.102 W/m(2) and 5.382 W/m(2); respectively. When the error of the remotely sensed land surface temperature is less than 1 K and the surface albedo measured is less than 0.02; the accuracy of estimates based on remote sensing data for G(0) will be less than 5%. MODIS data (surface reflectance; land surface temperature; and emissivity) were used to calculate G(0) in a 10 x 10 km region around Tanggula site; which is located in the continuous permafrost region with long-term records of meteorological and permafrost parameters. The results obtained by the improved scheme and MODIS data were consistent with the observation. This study enhances our understanding of the impacts of climate change on the ground thermal regime of permafrost and the land surface processes between atmosphere and ground surface in cold regions.

TI  - Co- and post-seismic Deformation Mechanisms of the M<sub>W</sub> 7.3 Iran Earthquake (2017) Revealed by Sentinel-1 InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of high-accuracy co- and post-seismic deformation fields and inversions of seismic slip distributions is significant in the comprehension of seismogenic mechanisms. On 12 November 2017, a M-W 7.3 earthquake occurred on the border between Iran and Iraq. To construct the co-seismic deformation field, Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from three tracks were used. Based on a prior knowledge, least-squares iterative approximation was employed to construct the three-dimensional (3D) co-seismic deformation field. to derive a time series of 2D post-seismic deformation, the multidimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) technique was use. Co-seismic deformation fields were asymmetric; the maximum relative displacement was nearly 90cm in the radar line-of-sight between two centers of co-seismic deformation. The 3D co-seismic deformation field showed southwestward horizontal motion and continuous subsidence-to-uplift variation from northeast to southwest. The two-dimensional (2D) post-seismic deformation time series showed a gradual decaying trend and good correspondence with the aftershock distribution. The main mechanism of post-seismic deformation was an afterslip of the post-seismic faults. We used the elastic half-space model to invert co-seismic deformation fields and obtain source parameters of the slip model. The maximum and average slips were 2.5 and 0.72 m, respectively. The average slip angle was 126.38 degrees and the moment magnitude was M-W 7.34. The results of this study will contribute to research on regional tectonic activities.

TI  - An Improved Parameterization for Retrieving Clear-Sky Downward Longwave Radiation from Satellite Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward longwave radiation (DLR) is a crucial component in Earth's surface energy balance. Yu et al. (2013) developed a parameterization for retrieving clear-sky DLR at high spatial resolution by combined use of satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data and column integrated water vapor (IWV). We extended the Yu2013 parameterization to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data based on atmospheric radiative simulation, and we modified the parameterization to decrease the systematic negative biases at large IWVs. The new parameterization improved DLR accuracy by 1.9 to 3.1 W/m(2) for IWV 3 cm compared to the Yu2013 algorithm. We also compared the new parameterization with four algorithms, including two based on Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance and two using near-surface meteorological parameters and water vapor. The algorithms were first evaluated using simulated data and then applied to MODIS data and validated using surface measurements at 14 stations around the globe. The results suggest that the new parameterization outperforms the TOA-radiance based algorithms in the regions where ground temperature is substantially different (enough that the difference between them is as large as 20 K) from skin air temperature. The parameterization also works well at high elevations where atmospheric parameter-based algorithms often have large biases. Furthermore, comparing different sources of atmospheric input data, we found that using the parameters interpolated from atmospheric reanalysis data improved the DLR estimation by 7.8 W/m(2) for the new parameterization and 19.1 W/m(2) for other algorithms at high-altitude sites, as compared to MODIS atmospheric products.

TI  - Estimating Ground-Level Concentrations of Multiple Air Pollutants and Their Health Impacts in the Huaihe River Basin in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollutants existing in the environment may have negative impacts on human health depending on their toxicity and concentrations. Remote sensing data enable researchers to map concentrations of various air pollutants over vast areas. By combining ground-level concentrations with population data, the spatial distribution of health impacts attributed to air pollutants can be acquired. This study took five highly populated and severely polluted provinces along the Huaihe River, China, as the research area. The ground-level concentrations of four major air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfate dioxide (SO2), particulate matters with diameter equal or less than 10 (PM10) or 2.5 micron (PM2.5) were estimated based on relevant remote sensing data using the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The health impacts of these pollutants were then assessed with the aid of co-located gridded population data. The results show that the annual average concentrations of ground-level NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 in 2016 were 31 mu g/m(3), 26 mu g/m(3), 100 mu g/m(3), and 59 mu g/m(3), respectively. In terms of the health impacts attributable to NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5, there were 546, 1788, 10,595, and 8364 respiratory deaths, and 1221, 9666, 46,954, and 39,524 cardiovascular deaths, respectively. Northern Henan, west-central Shandong, southern Jiangsu, and Wuhan City in Hubei are prone to large health risks. Meanwhile, air pollutants have an overall greater impact on cardiovascular disease than respiratory disease, which is primarily attributable to the inhalable particle matters. Our findings provide a good reference to local decision makers for the implementation of further emission control strategies and possible health impacts assessment.

TI  - A New Remote Sensing Dryness Index Based on the Near-Infrared and Red Spectral Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture, as a crucial indicator of dryness, is an important research topic for dryness monitoring. In this study, we propose a new remote sensing dryness index for measuring soil moisture from spectral space. We first established a spectral space with remote sensing reflectance data at the near-infrared (NIR) and red (R) bands. Considering the distribution regularities of soil moisture in this space, we formulated the Ratio Dryness Monitoring Index (RDMI) as a new dryness monitoring indicator. We compared RDMI values with in situ soil moisture content data measured at 0-10 cm depth. Results showed that there was a strong negative correlation (R = -0.89) between the RDMI values and in situ soil moisture content. We further compared RDMI with existing remote sensing dryness indices, and the results demonstrated the advantages of the RDMI. We applied the RDMI to the Landsat-8 imagery to map dryness distribution around the Fukang area on the Northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, and to the MODIS imagery to detect the spatial and temporal changes in dryness for the entire Xinjiang in 2013 and 2014. Overall, the RDMI index constructed, based on the NIR-Red spectral space, is simple to calculate, easy to understand, and can be applied to dryness monitoring at different scales.

TI  - Glacier Facies Mapping Using a Machine-Learning Algorithm: The Parlung Zangbo Basin Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau are an important indicator of climate change. Automatic glacier facies mapping utilizing remote sensing data is challenging due to the spectral similarity of supraglacial debris and the adjacent bedrock. Most of the available glacier datasets do not provide the boundary of clean ice and debris-covered glacier facies, while debris-covered glacier facies play a key role in mass balance research. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic algorithm to distinguish ice cover types based on multi-temporal satellite data, and the algorithm was implemented in a subregion of the Parlung Zangbo basin in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The classification method was built upon an automated machine learning approach: Random Forest in combination with the analysis of topographic and textural features based on Landsat-8 imagery and multiple digital elevation model (DEM) data. Very high spatial resolution Gao Fen-1 (GF-1) Panchromatic and Multi-Spectral (PMS) imagery was used to select training samples and validate the classification results. In this study, all of the land cover types were classified with overall good performance using the proposed method. The results indicated that fully debris-covered glaciers accounted for approximately 20.7% of the total glacier area in this region and were mainly distributed at elevations between 4600 m and 4800 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Additionally, an analysis of the results clearly revealed that the proportion of small size glaciers (<1 km(2)) were 88.3% distributed at lower elevations compared to larger size glaciers (1 km(2)). In addition, the majority of glaciers (both in terms of glacier number and area) were characterized by a mean slope ranging between 20 degrees and 30 degrees, and 42.1% of glaciers had a northeast and north orientation in the Parlung Zangbo basin.

TI  - A Set of Satellite-Based Near Real-Time Meteorological Drought Monitoring Data over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A high-resolution and near real-time drought monitoring dataset has not been made readily available in drought-prone China, except for the low-resolution global product. Here we developed a set of near real-time meteorological drought data at a 0.25 degrees spatial resolution over China, by seamlessly merging the satellite-based near real-time (RT) precipitation (3B42RTv7) into the high-quality gauge-based retrospective product (CN05.1) using the quantile-mapping (QM) bias-adjustment method. Comparing the standard precipitation index (SPI) from the satellite-gauge merged product (SGMP) with that from the retrospective ground product CN05.1 (OBS) shows that the SGMP reproduces well the observed spatial distribution of SPI and the pattern of meteorological drought across China, at both the 6-month and 12-month time scales. In contrast, the UN-SGMP generated by merging the unadjusted raw satellite precipitation into the gauging data shows systematical overestimation of the SPI, leaving less meteorological droughts to be identified. Furthermore, the SGMP is found to be able to capture the inter-annual variation of percentage area in meteorological droughts. These validation results suggest that the newly developed drought dataset is reliable for monitoring meteorological drought dynamics in near real-time. This dataset will be routinely updated as the satellite RT precipitation is made available, thus facilitating near real-time drought diagnosis in China.

TI  - Retrieving the Lake Trophic Level Index with Landsat-8 Image by Atmospheric Parameter and RBF: A Case Study of Lakes in Wuhan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of atmospheric correction is pronounced for retrieving physical parameters in aquatic systems. To improve the retrieval accuracy of trophic level index (TLI), we built eight models with 43 samples in Wuhan and proposed an improved method by taking atmospheric water vapor (AWV) information and Landsat-8 (L8) remote sensing image into the input layer of radical basis function (RBF) neural network. All image information taken in RBF have been radiometrically calibrated. Except model(a), image data used in the other seven models were not atmospherically corrected. The eight models have different inputs and the same output (TLI). The models are as follows: (1) model(a), the inputs are seven single bands; (2) model(c), besides seven single bands (b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7), we added the AWV parameter k1 to the inputs; (3) model(c1), the inputs are AWV difference coefficient k2 and the seven bands; (4) model(c2), the input layers include seven single bands, k1 and k2; (5) model(b), seven band ratios (b3/b5, b1/b2, b3/b7, b2/b5, b2/b7, b3/b6, and b3/b4) were used as input parameters; (6) model(b1), the inputs are k1 and seven band ratios; (7) model(b2), the inputs are k2 and seven band ratios; (8) model(b3), the inputs are k1, k2, and seven band ratios. We estimated models with root mean squared error (RMSE), model(a) > model(b3) > model(b1) > model(c2) > model(c) > model(b) > model(c1) > model(b2). RMSE of the eight models are 12.762, 11.274, 10.577, 8.904, 8.361, 6.396, 5.389, and 5.104, respectively. Model b2 and c1 are two best models in these experiments, which confirms both the seven single bands and band ratios with k2 are superior to other models. Results also corroborate that most lakes in Wuhan urban area are in mesotrophic and light eutrophic states.

TI  - Progradation Rates Measured at Modern River Outlets: A First-Order Constraint on the Pace of Deltaic Deposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a compilation of modern shoreline progradation rates measured close to river outlets entering deltaic coastlines, and we discuss how these observations relate to the overall evolution of both modern and ancient deltaic coastlines. We analyzed Landsat-derived satellite images to identify plan view changes in the subaerial morphology of 331 modern deltaic coastlines. Our rate compilation (km(2)/year) had a lognormal distribution with parameters =-1.85 and sigma(2)=1.01. We found that the rate data could be predicted to within an order of magnitude by an empirically derived power law using only fluvial water discharge and suspended sediment load as input parameters ( rpro=10-2.3Qw0.59Qs0.34). We justified this river-centric model of our progradation rates by assuming that delta progradation rates measured close to river outlets were more reflective of fluvial processes than of basinal processes, and preliminary tests supported this assumption. Our rate compilation and empirical model could provide useful constraints to guide stratigraphic analysis of ancient source-to-sink systems and to build analog and numerical models.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to assess the performance of some of the imaging scans recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines as part of baseline staging for cutaneous melanoma, regarding the detection of lung, brain, bone, and liver metastases. Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2010-2015) was used to extract the data, and cases with cutaneous melanoma and complete information about TN stages and sites of distant metastases were explored. Performance parameters assessed in the current study included positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, number needed to investigate (NNI), and accuracy. A total of 109 971 patients were included in the analysis. If all stage III patients in the study cohort are to be staged through routine imaging, PPV (for the recognition of lung metastases) will be 2.9% and NNI to detect one case of lung metastasis will be 34. Likewise, PPV (for the recognition of bone metastases) will be 1.8% and NNI to detect one case of bone metastasis will be 55. Moreover, PPV (for the recognition of liver metastases) will be 1.8% and NNI to detect one case of liver metastasis will be 55. Excluding stage III patients with clinically node-negative/sentinel node-positive disease would improve PPV and decrease NNI for the three metastatic sites. Adherence to current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for cutaneous melanoma imaging for baseline staging results in low rates of failure to detect asymptomatic lung, liver, brain, or bone metastases.

TI  - Clarifying the role of radiative mechanisms in the spatio-temporal changes of land surface temperature across the Horn of Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in the climate system. The extent to which vegetation impacts climate through its structure and function varies across space and time, and it is also affected by land cover changes. In areas with both multiple growing periods and significant land cover changes, such as the Horn of Africa, identifying vegetation influence on land surface temperature (LST) through radiative changes needs further investigation. In this study, we used a 13-year time series (2001 - 2013) of remotely sensed environmental data to estimate the contribution of radiative mechanism to LST change due to growing season albedo dynamics and land cover conversion. Our results revealed that in taller woody vegetation (forest and savanna), albedo increases during the growing period by up to 0.04 compared with the non-growing period, while it decreases in shorter vegetation (grassland and shrubland) by up to 0.03. The warming impact due to a decrease in albedo during the growing period in shorter vegetation is counteracted by a considerable increase in evapotranspiration, leading to net cooling. Analysis of land cover change impact on albedo showed a regional annual average instantaneous surface radiative forcing of -0.03 +/- 0.02 W m(-2). The land cover transitions from forest to cropland, and savanna to grassland, displayed the largest mean albedo increase across all seasons, causing an average instantaneous surface radiative forcing of -2.6 W m(-2) and -1.5 W m(-2) and a decrease in mean LST of 0.12 K and 0.09 K, all in dry period (December, January, February), respectively. Despite the albedo cooling effect in these conversions, an average net warming of 1.3 K and 0.23 K was observed under the dominant influence of non-radiative mechanisms. These results show that the impact of radiative mechanism was small, highlighting the importance of non-radiative processes in understanding the climatic impacts of land cover changes, as well as in delineating effective mitigation strategies.

T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Roads are important infrastructure that brings economic development in a nation by connecting different places. But, in Nepal, many roads are very vulnerable to landslides due to various reasons. Araniko Highway is one of the most landslide affected major road in Nepal lacking study in past. In this study, landslide susceptibility mapping along Dolalghat - Kodari section in Araniko Highway, Nepal, was done by integrating Relative Frequency (RF) and Predictor Rate (PR). PR was applied to the RF to quantify the prediction ability of the conditioning factors while producing Landslide Susceptibility Index (LSI). First, landslide inventory map of 314 landslides was prepared. Then, the database was divided into 70/30 ratio for the training and validating the model. After analysing thirteen landslide conditioning factors, susceptibility map produced using LSI was categorized into five classes. Finally, overall performance of the resulting map was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve technique. The success rate and prediction rate curve showed that the area under the curve for RF was 0.606 and 0.581 respectively. The result of this study showed a successful mapping of landslide susceptibility by integrating RF and PR.

AB  - Breast cancer in male is comparatively rare. We encountered a case of breast cancer in an elderly male who was treated with consideration of age. A 78-year-old male consulted our hospital with a lump on his right breast. The tumor was 3 cm in diameter and was palpable in the E area of his right breast, accompanied by pain. Mammography showed an indistinct mass in the S area. Ultrasonography revealed a well-defined and rough, lobulated mass. Core needle biopsy was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma. Metastatic work-up revealed no evidence of metastasis. The patient underwent mastectomy with sentinel lymph node(SN)biopsy and axial lymph node dissection(Ax)because of positive metastasis in an SN. The pathological findings from the surgically resected specimens indicated solid-tubular carcinoma. Lymph node metastases were observed in an SN(1/1)and Ax(1/3). On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells tested positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors and negative for HER2/neu protein expression. The Ki-67 labeling index was 14%. Postoperatively, the patient has not received chemotherapy, but received hormone therapy as adjuvant therapy considering his age. Nine months after the surgery, the patient is well, and metastasis has not appeared.

TI  - The integration of multi-source remote sensing data for the modelling of shoreline change rates in a mediterranean coastal sector
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel methodological approach is presented to estimate the shoreline change rate in complex coastal settings by using multi-source/multi-temporal shoreline data extracted from both orthoimages and digital elevation models. Several stages are covered to integrate the information available for the coastal area under study by means of a well-balanced and robust data fusion approach: i) determining the most accurate approach for extracting each shoreline from the different available sources, also estimating their corresponding accuracy, ii) finding out the best set of multi-temporal shorelines, within the available ones, to help avoid temporal oversampling and remove local severe shoreline change rate oscillations and, finally, iii) testing linear regression methods to include shoreline accuracy and automatic outlier removal in order to model the underlying general trend of shoreline evolution. A reweighted-weighted linear regression together with an evenly distributed shorelines dataset were chosen as the best approach to robustly integrate all the multisource remote sensing data available and determine which shorelines did not follow the general linear trend.

TI  - Prospective biomonitor and sentinel bivalve species for pollution monitoring and ecosystem health disturbance assessment in mangrove-lined Nicaraguan coasts
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims at contributing to the use of Polymesoda arctata, Anadara tuberculosa, and Larkinia grandis as prospective biomonitors and sentinels, surrogate of Crassostrea rhizophorae for pollution biomonitoring in mangrove-lined coastal systems. Localities were selected along the Nicaraguan coastline in the rainy and dry seasons during 2012-2013: A tuberculosa and L grandis were collected in the Pacific, and P. arctata in the Caribbean. The tissue concentration of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPS) were integrated into pollution indices (chemical pollution index -CPI- and pollution load index -PLI-) and biological endpoints (flesh-condition, reproduction, histopathology and stress-on-stress) were determined as biomarkers of ecosystem health disturbance. In the Caribbean, contaminant tissue concentration was low in P. arctata, with some exceptions. Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Ni and V were mainly recorded during dry season, and PAHs and POPs (HCHs, DDTs, AHTN, PCBs and BDE85) during rainy season. Metals and PAHs were not a major threat in the study area; in contrast, high levels of HCHs and DDTs and low-to-moderate levels of musk fragrances and PBDEs were recorded. Minor differences were found in biological parameters albeit during the rainy season the LT50 values were low and seemingly associated to high PLI and CPI values. In the Pacific, the main pollutants recorded in A. tuberculosa and L. grandis were HCHs, DDTs, AHTN and PDBEs in rainy season and Cd in dry season. Although basic research is needed to understand the general biology, ecology and diseases in these species, biological endpoints comparable to those used in other sentinel bivalves are seemingly suitable biomarkers of health disturbance. Overall, Caribbean P. arctata and Pacific A. tuberculosa and L. grandis seem to be potential target species for pollution monitoring and ecosystem health disturbance assessment in mangrove-lined Nicaraguan coastal systems. Their use together with C. rhizophorae would provide opportunities for common approaches to be applied in inter-ocean countries of the Mesoamerican region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy uses the concept of selective lymphatic drainage and the lymphatic microvasculature to identify first-echelon nodes draining a given malignancy. Although initially considered difficult and unreliable in the head and neck, experience with the technique has improved and evolved significantly over the last 3 decades. It is now recognized to be accurate and reliable for regional nodal staging and detection of occult nodal metastasis in the head and neck. Although initially described for nodal staging of melanoma, the usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy continues to expand and is now extended to other cutaneous malignancies as well as mucosal malignancies of the oral cavity and oropharynx.

TI  - Detecting Dubas bug infestations using high resolution multispectral satellite data in Oman
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dubas bug, Ommatissus lybicus de Bergevin, is one of the major pests of the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera, in Oman, reducing its production by 28%. In addition to the important annual costs to control this pest nationwide, effort, cost and time are spent surveying and spotting O. lybicus infestations. Several studies have indicated the possibility of using remote sensing technology to identify plants stressed by pest infestation. The aim of the present study is to detect O. lybicus infestations by quantifying reflectance changes of different infestation levels and calculating different vegetation indices (VIs) using high-resolution multispectral (MS) images. An image of an area with different sub-locations that had varying levels of infestation was acquired in March 2017 using the WorldView-3 satellite.The reflectance of 8 bands, 32 spectral VIs and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) were derived from the image, and then the correlation was tested using ground-infestation data. The results revealed that the reflectance decreased in the red edge and near-infrared (NIR) bands as the infestation level increased. High levels of infestation showed a significant difference in three bands, red edge, NIR1 and NIR2, compared to no, low and medium levels of infestation. Nineteen out of 32 VIs showed a significant relation with the infestation levels. The relation ranged between r = -0.12, p < 0.05 using the Normalized Difference Mud Index (NDMI) and r = -0.39, p < 0.000 using the Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI)) and Tasselled Cap - Non - Such Index (TC-NSI). The location affected the relation between the infestation and VIs, where the correlation coefficients increased. The maximum correlation found was r = 0.64 using the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) in Al'Ayn Village. The overall accuracy of the supervised classification for detecting the infestation level was 68.3%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.50.

TI  - Vulnerability to stunting in the West African Sahel
T2  - FOOD POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a simple simulation framework for understanding and analyzing vulnerability to stunting. We utilize Demographic and Health Surveys merged with satellite data on climatic shocks. Children aged 0-5 years are grouped into three categories: consistently stunted, vulnerable, and non-vulnerable. The first group constitutes those who are stunted and will also be stunted in any hypothetical period. Non-vulnerable are those whose likelihood to be stunted is zero. The vulnerable face a probability between 0 and 1 of being stunted. The probability is calculated as the share of years in which the child would be stunted, given the village level distribution of weather shocks over the period 2000-2013. We provide estimates of vulnerability to stunting in Burkina Faso, Northern Ghana, Mali, Northern Nigeria, and Senegal by aggregating over villages, districts and countries.

TI  - Optimal joint subcarrier and power allocation for MISO-NOMA satellite networks
T2  - PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel MISO multi-spot-beam satellite system design based on jointly optimizing subcarrier and power allocation for the downlink of a power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) network. The proposed non-convex NP-hard optimization problem minimizes the total transmit power taking into account subcarrier and transmit power constraints. An alternating method is used to solve this problem. For a fixed power allocation, we update the integer nonlinear programming (INLP) subcarrier allocation by using NOMAD toolbox. For a given subcarrier assignment, in order to update the transmit power values, we use the successive convex approximation approach (SCA). In addition, the proposed problem is solved by using the optimal method called "Monotonic Optimization" in order to find the optimality gap of the alternating method. Simulation results show that the total transmit power by applying the alternating method is close to the total transmit power by applying the monotonic approach. Moreover, we observe that the MISO and PD-NOMA techniques reduce the total transmit power of the MISO multi-spot-beam satellite system by approximately 20% with respect to the SISO and OMA techniques and the effectiveness of the proposed scenario and methods is considered in clear and rainy sky situations.

TI  - Evaluating MODIS and MISR aerosol optical depth retrievals over environmentally distinct sites in Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) sensors provide aerosol observations suitable for a wide range of applications. The recently released MODIS Collection 6.1 (C061) includes several improvements compared to the previous products which are expected to minimize uncertainties in aerosol retrievals. Such collection needs to be validated and compared with previous collections form the same or other sensors before being applied for further scientific research on a regional scale. This study evaluates the performance of MODIS Collections 6 (C006) and 6.1 (C061) based on two algorithms: Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) and the merged product (DTB) onboard the Terra (MOD04) and Aqua (MYD04) satellites, and the MISR AOD retrievals against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) over two sites (Lahore and Karachi) in Pakistan during 2007-2014. Results elucidated that C061 MODIS AOD exhibited significant improvement as compared to C006, with the 10 km DT (DB) products generally overestimating (underestimating) AOD relative to AERONET AOD. The MOD04 and MYD04-DT and DB (3 and 10 km) showed comparable performance over the two sites, whereas The DTB was dominated by DT (DB) pixels over Lahore (Karachi). The MISR showed better performance over Karachi with high reflecting surface than over Lahore with dense vegetation cover. The annual cycle of AOD retrieved by the two sensors were consistent with AERONET AOD, with maximum AOD observed during summer months attributed to prevailing climatic conditions. On seasonal basis, the MODIS algorithms exhibited improved performance over Lahore except during summer where DT and DTB showed relatively low performance, attributed to modulations induced by local meteorology to the prevailing surface conditions. However, the sensors exhibited distinct performance over Karachi, where MODIS-DT (10 km) showed close correspondence with AERONET during autumn and winter, whereas MODIS-DT (3 km) exhibited the converse. The MISR performed relatively well during spring over the two stations. The study gives greater insights on the performance of MODIS and MISR and forms the basis for further research on the validation of satellite derived aerosol products over Pakistan.

AB  - In this work, we use remote sensing tools to recognize and map outcrops of altered hydrothermal rock zones in the Guelma basin (Northeastern Algeria). This basin is characterized by many thermal springs which could be the origin of the hydrothermal alterations and the source of polymetallic mineralization of Zn, Sb, Pb, and As. Structural lineaments representing faults or faulted zones were successfully extracted using remote sensing processing. The superimposition of the known mineralization site map with the evidenced lineaments and hydrothermal alteration zones evidences that the zones of high fractures density and of great structural complexity are in agreement with the detected hydrothermal alterations zones.

TI  - Determining the use of Sentinel-2A MSI for wildfire burning & severity detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, reliable, and timely burn severity maps are necessary for planning, managing and rehabilitation after wildfires. This study aimed at assessing the ability of the Sentinel-2A satellite to detect burnt areas and separate burning severity levels. It also attempted to measure the spectral separability of the different bands and derived indices commonly used to detect burnt areas. A short investigation into the associated environmental variables present in the burnt landscape was also performed to explore the presence of any correlation. As a case study, a wildfire occurred in the Sierra de Gata region of the province of Caceres in North-Eastern Spain was used. A range of spectral indices was computed, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). The potential added value of the three new Red Edge bands that come with the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor was also used. The slope, aspect, fractional vegetation cover and terrain roughness were all derived to produce environmental variables. The burning severity was tested using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier. European Environment Agency's CORINE land cover map was also used to produce the land cover types found in the burned area. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service have produced a grading map for the fire using 0.5 m resolution Pleiades imagery, that was used as reference. Results showed a variable degree of correlation between the burning severity and the tested herein spectral indices. The visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum was not well suited to discern burned from unburned land cover. The NBRb12 (short-wave infrared 2 - SWIR2) produced the best results for detecting burnt areas. SAM resulted in a 73% overall accuracy in thematic mapping. None of the environmental variables appeared to have a significant impact on the burning severity. All in all, our study result showed that Sentinel-2 MSI sensor can be used to discern burnt areas and burning severity. However, further studies in different regions using the same dataset types and methods should be implemented before generalizing the results of the current study.

TI  - Impact of Insolation Data Source on Remote Sensing Retrievals of Evapotranspiration over the California Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The energy delivered to the land surface via insolation is a primary driver of evapotranspiration (ET)the exchange of water vapor between the land and atmosphere. Spatially distributed ET products are in great demand in the water resource management community for real-time operations and sustainable water use planning. The accuracy and deliverability of these products are determined in part by the characteristics and quality of the insolation data sources used as input to the ET models. This paper investigates the practical utility of three different insolation datasets within the context of a satellite-based remote sensing framework for mapping ET at high spatiotemporal resolution, in an application over the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in California. The datasets tested included one reanalysis product: The Climate System Forecast Reanalysis (CFSR) at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, and two remote sensing insolation products generated with geostationary satellite imagery: a product for the continental United States at 0.2 degrees, developed by the University of Wisconsin Space Sciences and Engineering Center (SSEC) and a coarser resolution (1 degrees) global Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. The three insolation data sources were compared to pyranometer data collected at flux towers within the Delta region to establish relative accuracy. The satellite products significantly outperformed CFSR, with root-mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.7, 1.5, and 1.4 MJm(-2)d(-1) for CFSR, CERES, and SSEC, respectively, at daily timesteps. The satellite-based products provided more accurate estimates of cloud occurrence and radiation transmission, while the reanalysis tended to underestimate solar radiation under cloudy-sky conditions. However, this difference in insolation performance did not translate into comparable improvement in the ET retrieval accuracy, where the RMSE in daily ET was 0.98 and 0.94 mm d(-1) using the CFSR and SSEC insolation data sources, respectively, for all the flux sites combined. The lack of a notable impact on the aggregate ET performance may be due in part to the predominantly clear-sky conditions prevalent in central California, under which the reanalysis and satellite-based insolation data sources have comparable accuracy. While satellite-based insolation data could improve ET retrieval in more humid regions with greater cloud-cover frequency, over the California Delta and climatologically similar regions in the western U.S., the CFSR data may suffice for real-time ET modeling efforts.

TI  - Identifying channel sand-body from multiple seismic attributes with an improved random forest algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning provides numerous data-driven tools for automatic pattern recognition. Even though various algorithms such as neural networks and support vector machines have been widely applied, it is still necessary to explore new paradigms and algorithms to improve the machine learning assisted seismic interpretation. Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble algorithm, however, only limited studies of random forest in the seismic application were published. In this article, the methodology of random forest is introduced systematically. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of hyper-parameter determination, we propose an improved algorithm named Pruning Random Forest (PRF). To reveal the advantages of PRF in terms of predictive performance, robustness, and feature selection compared with support vector machine, neural network, and decision tree, several well-designed experiments are executed based on the seismic data of the western Bohai Sea of China. The potential and advantages of random forest in the present case are confirmed by various experiments, which substantiates that the proposed pruning random forest algorithm provides a reliable alternative way for further machine learning assisted seismic interpretation.

TI  - Invasion compounds an ecosystem-wide loss to afforestation in the tropical grasslands of the Shola Sky Islands
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical montane habitats, including the Shola Sky Islands in the Western Ghats, host several threatened taxa of which, the global distributions are restricted to these mountain-tops. The rapidly increasing human footprint and the spread of invasive alien plants have already resulted in the local extinction of several taxa. Here we examine the entire Shola Sky Islands ecosystem to estimate the extent of habitat loss and to create a baseline of land use in this rapidly changing landscape. We used LANDSAT imageries from 1973, 1995 and 2017, with 840 ground truth points across the ecosystem. We find substantial landscape modification in the large high elevation plateaus (7-60%) over the last four decades while changes are muted in the other parts. The loss of grasslands to exotic trees predominates (340 km(2), 23%) the modification of this landscape, and, continues today at a rapid pace. Contrary to popular belief, Shola Forests have been relatively stable, implying that most plantations were established on grasslands-traditionally classified as "unproductive wastelands". Across the Protected Area (PA) network, Reserve Forests (RF), the least protected areas have faced the greatest loss of grasslands. Older PAs have lost relatively fewer grasslands, but the invasion from adjoining RFs is now increasing. We highlight the complexity of conservation in this landscape with three case studies of PAs with different management histories. Our study highlights the rapid loss of native Shola Grasslands, the continuing loss to invasive exotic trees, and the challenges of conserving this critical habitat with traditional modes of conservation.

TI  - Modeling the Impact of Zooplankton Diel Vertical Migration on the Carbon Export Flux of the Biological Pump
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - One pathway of the biological pump that remains largely unquantified in many export models is the active transport of carbon from the surface ocean to the mesopelagic by zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM). Here, we develop a simple representation of zooplankton DVM and implement it in a global export model as a thought experiment to illustrate the effects of DVM on carbon export and mesopelagic biogeochemistry. The model is driven by diagnostic satellite measurements of net primary production, algal biomass, and phytoplankton size structure. Due to constraints on available satellite data, the results are restricted to the latitude range from 60 degrees N to 60 degrees S. The modeled global export flux from the base of the euphotic zone was 6.5 PgC/year, which represents a 14% increase over the export flux in model runs without DVM. The mean (+/- standard deviation, SD) proportional contribution of the DVM-mediated export flux to total carbon export, averaged over the global domain and the climatological seasonal cycle, was 0.16 +/- 0.04 and the proportional contribution of DVM activity to total respiration within the twilight zone was 0.16 +/- 0.06. Adding DVM activity to the model also resulted in a deep local maximum in the oxygen utilization profile. The model results were most sensitive to the assumptions for the fraction of individuals participating in DVM, the fraction of fecal pellets produced in the euphotic zone, and the fraction of grazed carbon that is metabolized.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of the Spectral and Spatial Consistency of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 OLI Data for Igneada Longos Forest
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to test the spectral and spatial consistency of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 OLI data for the potential of monitoring longos forests for four seasons in Igneada, Turkey. Vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), were generated for the study area in addition to the five corresponding bands of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 OLI Images. Although the spectral consistency of the data was interpreted by cross-calibration analysis using the Pearson correlation coefficient, spatial consistency was evaluated by descriptive statistical analysis of investigated variables. In general, the highest correlation values were achieved for the images that were acquired in the spring season for almost all investigated variables. In the spring season, among the investigated variables, the Red band (B4), NDVI and EVI have the largest correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.92 and 0.91, respectively. Regarding the spatial consistency, the mean and standard deviation values of all variables were consistent for all seasons except for the mean value of the NDVI for the fall season. As a result, if there is no atmospheric effect or data retrieval/acquisition error, either Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 can be used as a combination or to provide the continuity data in longos monitoring applications. This study contributes to longos forest monitoring science in terms of remote sensing data analysis.

TI  - Transport and Loss of Ring Current Electrons Inside Geosynchronous Orbit During the 17 March 2013 Storm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ring current electrons (1-100 keV) have received significant attention in recent decades, but many questions regarding their major transport and loss mechanisms remain open. In this study, we use the four-dimensional Versatile Electron Radiation Belt code to model the enhancement of phase space density that occurred during the 17 March 2013 storm. Our model includes global convection, radial diffusion, and scattering into the Earth's atmosphere driven by whistler-mode hiss and chorus waves. We study the sensitivity of the model to the boundary conditions, global electric field, the electric field associated with subauroral polarization streams, electron loss rates, and radial diffusion coefficients. The results of the code are almost insensitive to the model parameters above 4.5 RERE, which indicates that the general dynamics of the electrons between 4.5 R-E and the geostationary orbit can be explained by global convection. We found that the major discrepancies between the model and data can stem from the inaccurate electric field model and uncertainties in lifetimes. We show that additional mechanisms that are responsible for radial transport are required to explain the dynamics of >= 40-keV electrons, and the inclusion of the radial diffusion rates that are typically assumed in radiation belt studies leads to a better agreement with the data. The overall effect of subauroral polarization streams on the electron phase space density profiles seems to be smaller than the uncertainties in other input parameters. This study is an initial step toward understanding the dynamics of these particles inside the geostationary orbit.Plain Language Summary The dynamics of the ring current electrons is a competition between loss and transport processes in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. These processes remain poorly understood due to difficulties of in situ particle measurements. Given the scarcity of satellite data, numerical modeling is a powerful approach that allows us to gain a deeper insight into the behavior of the ring current electrons. In this work, we investigate which processes dominate the dynamics of these particles within the geostationary orbit. We use the four-dimensional Versatile Electron Radiation Belt code to model electron loss and transport processes during 17 March 2013 geomagnetic storm. To understand the significance of the model uncertainty, we run an ensemble of simulations with different model parameters and compare results with the Van Allen Probe satellite observations. We show that the global convective electric and magnetic fields control the transport of the ring current electrons inside the geostationary orbit. This work is a basis for future studies, which will be extended further away from the Earth and include more comprehensive plasma wave models.

TI  - Hazard zoning for spatial planning using GIS-based landslide susceptibility assessment: a new hybrid integrated data-driven and knowledge-based model
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The popular use of geographical information system (GIS) technology in landslide assessment ensures good, accurate and fast results with less cost and manages mass movements and identifies safe areas for the development of new settlements. In the literature, different methods have been applied in landslide susceptibility assessment using various models. In these studies, the methods are either expert knowledge-based or data-driven approaches. These two approaches produce different outcomes based on their specific characteristics. Thus, the simultaneous use of a set of methods using fusion techniques at the decision-level improves the results. This study aims to investigate and identify a landslide zonation model by combining different methods in GIS and integrate the results (incorporated in the decision level) to achieve optimum accuracy. In this study, landslide hazard mapping was performed using knowledge-based models such as simple additive weighting (SAW) and fuzzy gamma operator and data-driven models namely radial basis function link network (RBFLN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN). Evaluation results indicate that data-driven methods have better performance than knowledge-based methods based on expert opinion. The SAW method also has a better result than other knowledge-based methods, such as fuzzy gamma. The assessment results of the randomly selected landslide control points indicate that PNN, SAW, RBFLN and fuzzy gamma have accuracies of 82.3, 69.62, 65.39 and 61.26% in landslide zoning, respectively. Meanwhile, weighted mean, maximum, median and minimum were used to incorporate the results in decision-level fusion; results show improved accuracies of 70.53, 83.5, 67.39 and 60.27% for each criterion, respectively.

TI  - Shallow Creep Along the 1999 Izmit Earthquake Rupture (Turkey) From GPS and High Temporal Resolution Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data (2011-2017)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing the spatiotemporal evolution of creep is essential to constrain fault slip budget and understand creep mechanism. Studies based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar and Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite observations until 2012 have shown that the central segment of the 17 August 1999 M-w 7.4 Izmit earthquake on the North Anatolian Fault began slipping aseismically following the event. In the present study, we combine new interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series, based on TerraSAR-X and Sentinel 1A/B radar images acquired over the period 2011-2017, with near-field GPS measurement campaigns performed every 6months from 2014 to 2016. The mean velocity fields reveal that creep on the central segment of the 1999 Izmit fault rupture continues to decay, more than 19years after the earthquake, in overall agreement with models of postseismic afterslip decaying logarithmically with time for a long period of time. Along the fault section that experienced supershear velocity rupture during the Izmit earthquake creep continues with a rate up to 8mm/year. A significant transient accelerating creep is detected in December 2016 on the Sentinel-1 time series, near the maximum creep rate location, associated with a total surface slip of 10mm released in 1month only. Additional analyses of the vertical velocity fields show a persistent subsidence on the hanging wall block of the Golcuk normal fault that also ruptured during the Izmit earthquake. Our results demonstrate that afterslip processes along the North Anatolian Fault east-southeast of Istanbul are more complex than previously proposed as they vary spatiotemporally along the fault.

TI  - Traffic Emission Modelling Using LiDAR Derived Parameters and Integrated Geospatial Model
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traffic emissions are the main cause of environmental pollution in cities and respiratory problems amongst people. This study developed a model based on an integration of support vector regression (SVR) algorithm and geographic information system (GIS) to map traffic carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations and produce prediction maps from micro level to macro level at a particular time gap in a day in a very densely populated area (Utara-Selatan Expressway-NKVE, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia). The proposed model comprised two models: the first model was implemented to estimate traffic CO concentrations using the SVR model, and the second model was applied to create prediction maps at different times a day using the GIS approach. The parameters for analysis were collected from field survey and remote sensing data sources such as very-high-resolution aerial photos and light detection and ranging point clouds. The correlation coefficient was 0.97, the mean absolute error was 1.401 ppm and the root mean square error was 2.45 ppm. The proposed models can be effectively implemented as decision-making tools to find a suitable solution for mitigating traffic jams near tollgates, highways and road networks.

TI  - Satellite mapping of tillage practices in the North Central US region from 2005 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-intensity tillage has become more popular among farmers in the United States and many other regions. However, accurate data on when and where low-intensity tillage methods are being used remain scarce, and this scarcity impedes understanding of the factors affecting the adoption and the agronomic or environmental impacts of these practices. In this study, we used composites of satellite imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and Sentinel-1 in combination with producer data from about 5900 georeferenced fields to train a random forest classifier and generate annual large-scale maps of tillage intensity from 2005 to 2016. We tested different combinations of hyper-parameters using cross-validation, splitting the training and testing data alternatively by field, year, and state to assess the influence of clustering on validation results and evaluate the generalizability of the classification model. We found that the best model was able to map tillage practices across the entire North Central US region at 30 m-resolution with accuracies spanning between 75% and 79%, depending on the validation approach. We also found that although Sentinel-1 provides an independent measure that should be sensitive to surface moisture and roughness, it currently adds relatively little to classification performance beyond what is possible with Landsat. When aggregated to the state level, the satellite estimates of percentage low- and high-intensity tillage agreed well with a USDA survey on tillage practices in 2006 (R-2 = 0.55). The satellite data also revealed clear increases in low-intensity tillage area for most counties in the past decade. Overall, the ability to accurately map spatial and temporal patterns in tillage should facilitate further study of this important practice in the United States, as well as other regions with fewer survey-based estimates.

TI  - Integration of Multiple Spectral Indices and a Neural Network for Burned Area Mapping Based on MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since wildfires have occurred frequently in recent years, accurate burned area mapping is required for wildfire severity assessment and burned land reconstruction. Satellite remote sensing is an effective technology that can provide valuable information for wildfire assessment. However, the common approaches based on using a single satellite image to promptly detect the burned areas have low accuracy and limited applicability. This paper develops a new burned area mapping method that surpasses the detection accuracy of previous methods, while still using a single Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor image. The key innovation is integrating optimal spectral indices and a neural network algorithm. We used the traditional empirical formula method, multi-threshold method and visual interpretation method to extract the sample sets of five typical types (burned area, vegetation, cloud, bare soil, and cloud shadow) from the MODIS data of several wildfires in the American states of Nevada, Washington and California in 2016. Afterward, the separability index M was adopted to assess the capacity of seven spectral bands and 13 spectral indices to distinguish the burned area from four unburned land cover types. Based on the separability analysis between the burned area and unburned areas, the spectral indices with an M value higher than 1.0 were employed to generate the training sample sets that were assessed to have an overall accuracy of 98.68% and Kappa coefficient of 97.46%. Finally, we utilized a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to learn the spectral differences of different types from the training sample sets and obtain the output burned area map. The proposed method was applied to three wildfire cases in the American states of Idaho, Nevada and Oregon in 2017. A comparison of detection results between the new MODIS-based burned area map and the reference burned area map compiled from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data indicates that the proposed method can effectively exploit the spectral characteristics of various land cover types. Also, this new method can achieve higher accuracy with the reduction of commission error (CE, >10%) and omission error (OE, >6%) compared to the traditional empirical formula method. The new burned area mapping method could help managers and the public perform more effective wildfire assessments and emergency management.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Soil Moisture With Downscaled Land Surface Temperatures Using a Data Fusion Approach for Heterogeneous Agricultural Land
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-scale surface soil moisture (SSM, 0-10cm), which is closely linked with land surface temperature (LST), is particularly important to agricultural water resource management. Active and passive microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrievals on the order of kilometer squared resolutions are difficult to apply to heterogeneous agricultural land surfaces that may need SSM data at a resolution of 30m. In this study, the High-resolution Urban Thermal Sharpener and Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model were applied to downscale optical and thermal remote sensing data simultaneously by blending Landsat and MODIS red-near infrared-LST data, with the ultimate goal to generate field-scale SSM values from the trapezoidal approach. To evaluate the performance of the downscaled LSTE (based on the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model method) and SSM, an irrigation district (Area 1) in Inner Mongolia and an irrigation district in the North China Plain (Area 2) with varying spatial heterogeneity were selected as the testbeds. Results indicated that the downscaled LSTE was highly consistent with synchronous Landsat LSTH and in situ LST measurements in Area 1, with the root-mean-square error ranging from 0.73 to 2.75K. Compared with the MODIS SSM, the average root-mean-square error of the downscaled SSM improved from 0.048 to 0.038cm(3)/cm(3) for both areas. The downscaled LSTE and SSM developed in this study enhance the spatiotemporal resolutions of the SSM estimates, maximizing the potential of remotely sensed information for agricultural water resource management.Plain Language Summary Field-scale (30 m) surface soil moisture (SSM), closely linked with land surface temperature (LST), is particularly important for agricultural water resource management, such as for assessment of agricultural droughts, optimization of irrigation schedules and improvement of water use efficiency, particularly in the heterogeneous agricultural land. Here, the High resolution Urban Thermal Sharpener (HUTS) and Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) were jointly adopted to downscale optical and thermal remote sensing data simultaneously by blending Landsat and MODIS Red-Near infrared-LST data, with the ultimate goal to generate field-scale SSM values from the downscaled Red-Near infrared-LST remote sensing data using the theoretical trapezoidal approach. The field-scale LST and SSM developed in this study maximize the potential of remotely sensed information, improve both the spatial and temporal resolutions of SSM, and provide more valuable information on heterogeneous land surfaces for agricultural water resource management.

TI  - Parameter Optimization of a Discrete Scattering Model by Integration of Global Sensitivity Analysis Using SMAP Active and Passive Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active and passive microwave signatures respond differently to the land surface and provide complementary information on the characteristics of the observed scenes. The objective of this paper is to explore the synergy of active radar and passive radiometer observations at the same spatial scale to constrain a discrete radiative transfer model, the Tor Vergata (TVG) model, to gain insights into the microwave scattering and emission mechanisms over grasslands. The TVG model can simultaneously simulate the backscattering coefficient and emissivity with a set of input parameters. To calibrate this model, in situ soil moisture and temperature data collected from the Maqu area in the northeastern region of the Tibetan Plateau, interpolated leaf area index (LAI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LAI eight-day products, and concurrent and coincident Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radar and radiometer observations are used. Because this model needs numerous input parameters to be driven, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test is first applied to conduct global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to select the sensitive and insensitive parameters. Only the most sensitive parameters are defined as free variables, to separately calibrate the active-only model (TVG-A), the passive-only model (TVG-P), and the active and passive combined model (TVG-AP). The accuracy of the calibrated models is evaluated by comparing the SMAP observations and the model simulations. The results show that TVG-AP can well reproduce the backscattering coefficient and brightness temperature, with correlation coefficients of 0.87, 0.89, 0.78, and 0.43 and root-mean-square errors of 0.49 dB, 0.52 dB, 7.20 K, and 10.47 K for sigma(0)(HH), sigma(0)(VV), T-BH, and T-BV, respectively. In contrast, TVG-A and TVG-P can only accurately model the backscattering coefficient and brightness temperature, respectively. Without any modifications of the calibrated parameters, the error metrics computed from the validation data are slightly worse than those of the calibration data. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the synergistic use of SMAP active radar and passive radiometer observations under the unified framework of a physical model. In addition, the results demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of applying GSA in model optimization. It is expected that these findings can contribute to the development of model-based soil moisture retrieval methods using active and passive microwave remote sensing data.

TI  - Remotely-sensed phenology of Italian forests: Going beyond the species
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed observations of seasonal greenness dynamics represent a valuable tool for studying vegetation phenology at regional and ecosystem-level scales. We investigated the seasonal variability of forests in Italy, examining the different mechanisms of phenological response to biophysical drivers. For each point of the Italian National Forests Inventory, we processed a multitemporal profile of the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index. Then we applied a multivariate approach for the purpose of (i) classifying the Italian forests into phonological clusters (i.e. pheno-clusters), (ii) identifying the main phonological characteristics and the forest compositions of each pheno-cluster and (iii) exploring the role of climate and physiographic variables in the phenological timing of each cluster. Results identified four pheno-clusters, following a clear elevation gradient and a distinct separation along the Mediterranean-to-temperate climatic transition of Italy. The "High-elevation coniferous" and the "High elevation deciduous" resulted mainly affected by elevation, with the former characterized by low annual productivity and the latter by high seasonality. To the contrary, the "Low elevation deciduous" showed to be mostly associated to moderate climate conditions and a prolonged growing season. Finally, summer drought was the main driving variable for the "Mediterranean evergreen", characterized by low seasonality. The discrimination of vegetation phenology types can provide valuable information useful as a baseline framework for further studies on forests ecosystem and for management strategies.

TI  - Does Lymph Node Status Prior to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Influence the Number of Sentinel Nodes Removed?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent prospective trials support the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with a lower false-negative rate if three or more sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are identified. In this study, we investigated whether the pre-NAC axillary lymph node status influences the number of SLNs identified.Stage I-III breast cancer patients who received NAC and underwent SLNB from May 2014 to April 2016 were identified from an institutional prospective database. Clinical and pathological factors among clinically node-negative (cN-) and clinically node-positive (cN+) patients who converted to cN- post-NAC were compared. Generalized linear mixed models analyzed factors associated with the number of SLNs removed.Among 343 patients who underwent SLNB during the study period, 335 (98%) had at least one SLN identified, and subsequently comprised the study population. The median number of SLNs identified was 4 (range 1-14), which did not differ according to pre-NAC nodal status (P = 0.15). Overall, 85% of patients had three or more SLNs identified (80% cN- group vs. 89% cN+ group; P = 0.02). On univariable analysis, age < 50 years and presenting with a positive axillary node were significantly associated with identifying three or more SLNs.Our study confirms that SLNB was successfully performed in 98% of our patients after NAC, with very few failed mapping procedures. In the post-NAC setting, the median number of SLNs identified was four, and the status of the axilla prior to NAC did not negatively affect the number of SLNs identified.

TI  - THE PROBLEM OF CONCEPTUALIZATION OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is focused on the conceptual transformations in the interpretation of the concept "fate" in the technogenic culture. In philosophic studies, the concept "fate" is primarily considered in the historical and philosophic aspects. In antiquity, in which the cosmos defines being, the idea of fate was one of the basics in terms of understanding human being. In medieval culture, the idea of fate, as divine providence, retained its importance. In modern times, with the development of natural science and the formation of a scientific worldview, the idea of fate was dislodged into the sphere of philistine ideas. The interest of philosophy in the notion of fate was revived in existentialism, though not in a rationalist, but in an irrationalist context. In the rationalist philosophic tradition, the idea of fate is constituted in the context of the cultural dominant of determinism. Georg Simmel understood fate as the determination of human life by external forces. In Oswald Spengler's works, fate is the inner logic of life, its deep regularity. In this study, along with historical and philosophic analysis, it is shown that the prospect of studying the ontological essence of technology, outlined by Martin Heidegger, at the present stage of the development of science and society finds its embodiment in the phenomenon of technoscience. Heidegger revealed the essence of technology through the concept "Gestell" and stressed that "Gestell is fate because it sends man to revealing historical being". If the phenomenon of fate is viewed in the evolutionary context and interpreted as a kind of a development program, it should be recognized that biology, genetics, and technology science have influenced the conceptual content of this universal of culture. Particular attention is paid to the problem of human development and the preservation of human identity in the conditions of technological expansion. Convergent technologies are able to change radically both people and their world. These fears found expression in the idea of a technological singularity articulated by John Von Neumann. The biological component of human nature was the unchanging foundation upon which the evolution of man was built. The possibility of changing the very foundation creates a qualitatively new situation. Is there a choice for a particular person: how to construct one's self if irreversible biological programs are launched? The prospect of conceptualizing a deterministic attitude and discussing the philosophic problem of determinism and free will is outlined. It is shown that the analysis of deterministic attitudes of human development strategies and civilization is associated with such concepts as "prognostic practice" and "foresight".

TI  - From Detection of Individual Metastases to Classification of Lymph Node Status at the Patient Level: The CAMELYON17 Challenge
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated detection of cancer metastases in lymph nodes has the potential to improve the assessment of prognosis for patients. To enable fair comparison between the algorithms for this purpose, we set up the CAMELYON17 challenge in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 Conference in Melbourne. Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted a total of 37 algorithms before the initial deadline. Participants were provided with 899 whole-slide images (WSIs) for developing their algorithms. The developed algorithms were evaluated based on the test set encompassing 100 patients and 500 WSIs. The evaluation metric used was a quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa. We discuss the algorithmic details of the 10 best pre-conference and two post-conference submissions. All these participants used convolutional neural networks in combination with pre- and postprocessing steps. Algorithms differed mostly in neural network architecture, training strategy, and pre- and postprocessing methodology. Overall, the kappa metric ranged from 0.89 to -0.13 across all submissions. The best results were obtained with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet. Confusion matrix analysis revealed that all participants struggled with reliably identifying isolated tumor cells, the smallest type of metastasis, with detection rates below 40%. Qualitative inspection of the results of the top participants showed categories of false positives, such as nerves or contamination, which could be targeted for further optimization. Last, we show that simple combinations of the top algorithms result in higher kappa metric values than any algorithm individually, with 0.93 for the best combination.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distributions of Cloud Parameters and the Temperature Response Over the Mongolian Plateau During 2006-2015 Based on MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mongolian Plateau (MP) has important influences on regional and global climate change. The spatiotemporal variations in the cloud cover and cloud optical thickness of total, high, middle, and low clouds over the MP during the daytime from 2006 to 2015 are analyzed using MODIS level 2 atmospheric data. Results show that the annual average total cloud cover over the MP decreases from the forest area in the northeast to the desert area in the southwest. The total cloud cover over the MP is obviously higher in summer than in other seasons, in which high clouds have a largest proportion, with the substantial total cloud cover changes. The spatial distributions of the high, middle, and low cloud covers over the MP are highly variable. The cooling effect of the cloud net radiative forcing is greater during the daytime in summer than in other seasons, which is likely associated with thick cloud optical thickness or large cloud cover in summer. Combined with the analyses of relationships among cloud cover, cloud optical thickness, cloud radiative forcing, and air temperature, the results show that significantly negative correlations exist between cloud optical thickness and cloud radiative forcing, and between total cloud cover and air temperature in the MP. The decrease in air temperature in summer over the MP during daytime confirm that the increase in the daytime total cloud cover strengthen the cooling effects of clouds and decrease the air temperature, especially in the high-value area with cloud cover distribution over the northeast MP.

TI  - Glacier facies of Vestfonna (Svalbard) based on SAR images and GPR measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The warming climate of the Arctic affects the mass budget of glaciers, and changes in the distribution of glacier facies are indicative of their response to climate change. The glacial mass budget over large land ice masses can be estimated by remote sensing techniques, but selecting an efficient remote sensing method for recognizing and mapping glacier facies in the Arctic remains a challenge. In this study, we compared several methods of distinguishing the facies of the Vestfonna ice cap, Svalbard, based upon Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and terrestrial high frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements. Glacier zones as determined using the backscattering coefficient (sigma0) of SAR images were compared against GPR data, and an alternative application of Internal Reflection Energy (IRE) calculated from terrestrial GPR data was also used for differentiating the extent of glacier facies. The IRE coefficient was found to offer a suitable method for distinguishing glacier zones and for validating SAR analysis. Furthermore, results of analysis of fully polarimetric Phased Array type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) and European Remote Sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (ERS-2 SAR) images were compared with the IRE coefficient classification. Especially promising method is H-a segmentation, where the glacier zone boundaries corresponded very well with both GPR visual interpretation and IRE classification results. The IRE coefficient's simplicity of calculation makes it a good alternative to the subjective GPR visual interpretation method, where results strongly depend on the operator's level of experience. We therefore recommend for GPR profiles to be used for additional validation of SAR image analysis in studies of glacier facies on the High Arctic ice masses.

TI  - Global climatology of planetary boundary layer top obtained from multi-satellite GPS RO observations
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) top is essential for air quality prediction, weather forecast, and assessment of regional and global climate models. In this article, the long-term climatology of seasonal, global distribution of PBL is presented by using global positioning system radio occultation (GPSRO) based payloads such as Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS), TerraSAR-X, and The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) from the year 2006-2015. We used Wavelet Covariance Transform (WCT) technique for precise PBL top identification. The derived PBL top from GPSRO data is rigorously evaluated with GPS radiosonde data over Gadanki. Significant seasonal variation is noticed in both radiosonde and GPSRO observations. Further, we compared the PBL obtained GPS RO with global radiosonde network and observed very good correlation. The number of occultations reaching down to 500m and retrieval rate of PBL top from WCT method is very high in mid-latitudes compared to tropical latitudes. The global distribution of PBL top shows significant seasonal variation with higher during summer followed by spring, fall, and minimum in winter. In the vicinity of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the PBL top is high over eastern Pacific compared to other regions. The ERA-Interim reanalysis data underestimate the PBL top compared to GPS RO observations due to different measurement techniques. The seasonal variation of global averaged PBL top over land and ocean shows contrasting features at different latitude bands.

TI  - How does PTF Interpret Soil Heterogeneity? A Stochastic Approach Applied to a Case Study on Maize in Northern Italy
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water balance on a local scale is generally achieved by applying the classical nonlinear Richards equation that requires hydraulic properties, namely, water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions, to be known. Its application in agricultural systems on field or larger scales involves three major problems being solved, related to (i) the assessment of spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties, (ii) accounting for this spatial variability in modelling large-scale soil water flow, and (iii) measuring the effects of such variability on real field variables (e.g., soil water storage, biomass, etc.). To deal with the first issue, soil hydraulic characterization is frequently performed by using the so-called pedotransfer functions (PTFs), whose effectiveness in providing the actual information on spatial variability has been questioned. With regard to the second problem, the variability of hydraulic properties at the field scale has often been dealt with using a relatively simple approach of considering soils in the field as an ensemble of parallel and statistically independent tubes, assuming only vertical flow. This approach in dealing with spatial variability has been popular in the framework of a Monte Carlo technique. As for the last issue, remote sensing seems to be the only viable solution to verify the pattern of variability, going by several modelling outputs which have considered the soil spatial variability. Based on these premises, the goals of this work concerning the issues discussed above are the following: (1) analyzing the sensitivity of a Richards-based model to the measured variability of (h) and k() parameters; (2) establishing the predictive capability of PTF in terms of a simple comparison with measured data; and (3) establishing the effectiveness of use of PTF by employing as data quality control an independent and spatially distributed estimation of the Above Ground Biomass (AGB). The study area of approximately 2000 hectares mainly devoted to maize forage cultivation is located in the Po plain (Lodi), in northern Italy. Sample sites throughout the study area were identified for hydropedological analysis (texture, bulk density, organic matter content, and other chemical properties on all the samples, and water retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity on a sub-set). Several pedotransfer functions were tested; the PTFVereckeen proved to be the best one to derive hydraulic properties of the entire soil database. The Monte Carlo approach was used to analyze model sensitivity to two measured input parameters: the slope of water retention curve (n) and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (k(0)). The analysis showed sensitivity of the simulated process to the parameter n being significantly higher than to k(0), although the former was much less variable. The PTFs showed a smoothing effect of the output variability, even though they were previously validated on a set of measured data. Interesting positive and significant correlations were found between the n parameter, from measured water retention curves, and the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), when using multi-temporal (2004-2018) high resolution remotely sensed data on maize cultivation. No correlation was detected when the n parameter derived from PTF was used.These results from our case study mainly suggest that: (i) despite the good performance of PTFs calculated via error indexes, their use in the simulation of hydrological processes should be carefully evaluated for real field-scale applications; and (ii) the NDVI index may be used successfully as a proxy to evaluate PTF reliability in the field.

TI  - Toxicological effects and behavioural and biochemical responses of <i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i> gills and its cholinesterase to copper: a biomarker application
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gills are both morphologically and physiologically complex whereby they perform several functions such as gas exchange, ion and water exchange, acid base balance, nitrogenous waste excretion, and other metabolic transformations. They are one of the first fish organs to be exposed to heavy metals in the aquatic environment. The exposure of Oreochromis mossambicus to copper showed deleterious effects to normal fish behaviours and varying degrees of gill damage when visualized under inverted light microscopy (stained with haematoxylin-eosin), scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Abnormalities of the nucleus shape, swollen cells, lipid droplet deposition, and an increase in vacuolation on the affected gills were observed with the degree of damage associated with CuSO4 exposure concentration. CuSO4 exposure in O. mossambicus also gave various patterns of inhibitory effects on cholinesterase (ChE) depending on the concentration of exposure and the organs exposed. Copper exposure altered ChE activity extracted from the gills of O. mossambicus with 99.9% of inhibition at the highest exposure concentration of CuSO4 (20mg/L). Hence, this study suggests the potential of this fish to become a sentinel species that permits the detection of lower copper contamination levels.

TI  - Comparative effects of seawater acidification on microalgae: Single and multispecies toxicity tests
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to gain knowledge about the potential effects of acidification in aquatic ecosystems, global change research based on microalgae as sentinel species has been often developed. However, these studies are limited to single species tests and there is still a research gap about the behaviour of microalgal communities under this environmental stressor. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the negative effects of CO2 under an ecologically realistic scenario. To achieve this objective, two types of toxicity tests were developed; i) single toxicity tests and ii) multispecies toxicity tests, in order to evaluate the effects on each species as well as the interspecific competition. For this purpose, three microalgae species (Tetraselmis chuii, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Nannochloropsis gaditana) were exposed to two selected pH levels (7.4, 6.0) and a control (pH 8.0). The pH values were choosen for testing different scenarios of CO2 enrichment including the exchange atmosphere-ocean (pH 7.4) and natural or anthropogenic sources of CO2 (pH 6.0). The effects on growth, cell viability, oxidative stress, plus inherent cell properties (size, complexity and autofluorescence) were studied using flow cytometry (FCM). Results showed that T. chuii was the most resistant species to CO2 enrichment with less abrupt changes in terms of cell density, inherent cell properties, oxidative stress and cell viability. Although P. tricornutum was the dominant species in both single and multispecies tests, this species showed the highest decrease in cell density under pH 6.0. Effects of competence were recorded in the multispecies control (pH 8) but this competence was edipsed by the effects of low pH. The knowledge of biological interactions made by different microalgae species is a useful tool to extrapolate research data from laboratory to the field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Extending the SCOPE model to combine optical reflectance and soil moisture observations for remote sensing of ecosystem functioning under water stress conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A radiative transfer and process-based model, called Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE), relates remote sensing signals with plant functioning (i.e., photosynthesis and evapotranspiration). Relying on optical remote sensing data, the SCOPE model estimates photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, but these ecosystem-level fluxes may be significantly overestimated if water availability is the primary limiting factor for vegetation. Remedying this shortcoming, additional information from extra sources is needed. In this study, we propose considering water stress in SCOPE by incorporating soil moisture data in the model, besides using satellite optical reflectance observations. A functional link between soil moisture, soil surface resistance, leaf water potential and carboxylation capacity is introduced as an extra element in SCOPE, resulting in a soil moisture integrated version of the model, SCOPE-SM. The modified model simulates additional state variables: (i) vapor pressure (e(i)), both in the soil pore space and leaf stomata in equilibrium with liquid water potential; (ii) the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) by a soil moisture dependent stress factor; and (iii) the soil surface resistance (r(ss)) through approximation by a soil moisture dependent hydraulic conductivity. The new approach was evaluated at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) with dominant C3 grasses and covering a wet-to-dry episode from January to August 2004. By using the original SCOPE (version 1.61), we simulated half-hourly time steps of plant functioning via locally measured weather data and time series of Landsat (TM and ETM) imagery. Then, SCOPE-SM was similarly applied to simulate plant functioning for three cases using Landsat imagery: (i) with modeled e(i); (ii) with modeled ei and V-cmax; and (iii) with modeled e(i) V-cmax and r(ss). The outputs of all four simulations were compared to flux tower plant functioning measurements. The results indicate a significant improvement proceeding from the first to the fourth case in which we used both Landsat optical imagery and soil moisture data through SCOPE-SM. Our results show that the combined use of optical reflectance and soil moisture observations has great potential to capture variations of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration during drought episodes. Further, we found that the information contained in soil moisture observations can describe more variations of measured evapotranspiration compared to the information contained in thermal observations.

TI  - Radiation therapy after sentinel lymph node biopsy for early stage breast cancer using a magnetic tracer: Results of a single institutional prospective study of tolerance
T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. - The aim of the study was, through a single institutional analysis of a large population of breast cancer patients, to assess the feasibility of and the tolerance to radiotherapy after the use of magnetic detection method for sentinel lymph node biopsy.Material and methods. - The super paramagnetic iron oxide particles database was collected prospectively and identified 520 cases from October 2013 to December 2016 at our institution, All of them received super paramagnetic iron oxide particles injection 20 minutes before the surgical procedure and some of them received also isotope technique. Injection site for super paramagnetic iron oxide particles and isotope was periareolar. Among them, 288 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. In our study, we evaluated the tolerance of postoperative radiotherapy.Results. - The median age of the patients was 64 years, The median follow-up period was 16 months (range: 1-42 months). Double detection of sentinel lymph node was done in the first 30 patients (10.4%). The sentinel lymph node identification rate was 99.7% (287 out of 288). There were 34 axillary lymph node dissections, of which 58.8% were realized straightaway. The total radiation dose was 50 Gy EQD2 (range: 28.5-66 Gy). Regarding the occurrence of radiodermatitis, 95.8% of patients had grade 0-2 radiodermatitis and 1% had grade 3. During follow-up, 19.4% of patients developed grade 1-2 post-therapeutic fibrosis (of which 92,9% grade 1).Conclusion. - The results of this large-scale study show that the radiotherapy after sentinel lymph node biopsy using super paramagnetic iron oxide particles is feasible, and that no increase of the toxicity was observed.

TI  - Near-Real-Time Flood Forecasting Based on Satellite Precipitation Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods, storms and hurricanes are devastating for human life and agricultural cropland. Near-real-time (NRT) discharge estimation is crucial to avoid the damages from flood disasters. The key input for the discharge estimation is precipitation. Directly using the ground stations to measure precipitation is not efficient, especially during a severe rainstorm, because precipitation varies even in the same region. This uncertainty might result in much less robust flood discharge estimation and forecasting models. The use of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) provides a larger area of coverage of rainstorms and a higher frequency of precipitation data compared to using the ground stations. In this paper, based on SPPs, a new NRT flood forecasting approach is proposed to reduce the time of the emergency response to flood disasters to minimize disaster damage. The proposed method allows us to forecast floods using a discharge hydrograph and to use the results to map flood extent by introducing SPPs into the rainfall-runoff model. In this study, we first evaluated the capacity of SPPs to estimate flood discharge and their accuracy in flood extent mapping. Two high temporal resolution SPPs were compared, integrated multi-satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement (IMERG) and tropical rainfall measurement mission multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA). The two products are evaluated over the Ottawa watershed in Canada during the period from 10 April 2017 to 10 May 2017. With TMPA, the results showed that the difference between the observed and modeled discharges was significant with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of -0.9241 and an adapted NSE (ANSE) of -1.0048 under high flow conditions. The TMPA-based model did not reproduce the shape of the observed hydrographs. However, with IMERG, the difference between the observed and modeled discharges was improved with an NSE equal to 0.80387 and an ANSE of 0.82874. Also, the IMERG-based model could reproduce the shape of the observed hydrographs, mainly under high flow conditions. Since IMERG products provide better accuracy, they were used for flood extent mapping in this study. Flood mapping results showed that the error was mostly within one pixel compared with the observed flood benchmark data of the Ottawa River acquired by RadarSat-2 during the flood event. The newly developed flood forecasting approach based on SPPs offers a solution for flood disaster management for poorly or totally ungauged watersheds regarding precipitation measurement. These findings could be referred to by others for NRT flood forecasting research and applications.

TI  - Sentinel node for malignant melanoma: An observational study of a consecutive single centre experience
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for melanoma gives prognostic information, however the success is dependent on several factors. The aim of this study was to describe outcome data after the introduction of the technique at our centre, including analysis of false negative rate (FNR), predictive factors for positive sentinel node (SN) and non-sentinel node (NSN), as well as prognostic factors for melanoma-specific survival (MSS).Materials and methods: This is a retrospective observational study of a prospectively kept database at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Between March 2000 and December 2013, 769 consecutive patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma undergoing SNB were included. The median follow-up time was 55 months (2-179 months). Tumour load in the SN was categorized according to the largest tumour deposit, low when <= 1 mm and high when >1 mm.Results: The FNR was 20% and the SN positivity rate was 14% with a decrease in both FNR and SN positivity rate during the study period. In multivariate analysis the only predictive factor for a positive SN was Breslow thickness. The 5-year melanoma specific survival (MSS) was 81% and in multivariate analysis the prognostic factors were SN-status (low metastatic load HR = 2.6, p = 0.001; high metastatic load HR = 2.7, p = 0.004) followed by Breslow thickness and ulceration.Conclusions: In this study Breslow thickness was the only independent predictive factor for a positive SN, no predictive factors were identified for NSN. Independent prognostic factors for MSS were SN status, Breslow thickness and ulceration. Interestingly, there was no survival difference depending on SN tumour burden when using 1 mm as cut-off.

TI  - New and Improved Built-Up Index Using SPOT Imagery: Application to an Arid Zone (Laghouat and M'Sila, Algeria)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing urban sprawl is a major concern for urban planning. Its negative effects on the environment are of great significance. Remote sensing images are useful for monitoring the spatial distribution and growth of urban built-up areas because they can provide timely and synoptic views of urban land cover. This study proposes a new built-up index for the rapid extraction of built-up land from satellite imagery. The new index has been applied to SPOT images of the cities of Laghouat and M'Sila in Algeria. The newly proposed index was compared with the following indices used in the literature: the normalized difference built-up index, the built-up index, the index-based built-up index and the maximum likelihood classifier. The results, which have an accuracy of 95%, show that the proposed index can significantly enhance built-up land features while effectively suppressing background noise without thresholding, and it is able to serve as a worthwhile alternative for quickly and objectively mapping built-up areas.

TI  - Novel W<i>k</i>NN-based technique to improve instantaneous rainfall estimation over the north of Algeria using the multispectral MSG SEVIRI imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the estimation of rainfall in northern Algeria, a new method is proposed in this study. It based on the k nearest weighted neighbours (WkNN) classification algorithm using the dataset from the radiometer-imager SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager) boarded on the satellite MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) to determine the pixel rainfall rate among the 16 predefined intensity levels observed in the Setif meteorological radar.The implementation of the classification consists in using the spectral characteristics of a new sample (pixel) as input variables of the WkNN classifier to predict his class of membership based on the weighted distances separating him from the samples of the set of learning. The results thus obtained are validated with respect to the rainfall intensity classes observed and co-located by ground radar. The results showed a significant improvement for instantaneous estimate of precipitation during the day, with a correlation coefficient r = 0.87 and statistical parameters RMSE = 2.29 mm/h, Bias = 0.45 mm/h, MAE = 0.35 mm/h, and we have obtained the results similar overnight.

TI  - Using sentinel-1A SAR wind retrievals for enhancing scatterometer and radiometer regional wind analyses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scatterometer surface wind speed and direction observations in combination with radiometer wind speeds allow to generate surface wind analyses with high space and time resolutions over global as well as at regional scales. Regarding scatterometer sampling schemes and physics, the resulting surface wind analyses suffer from lack of accuracy in areas near coasts. The use of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the Sentinel-1A satellite attempts to address the enhancement of surface wind analyses issues. In this study, SAR wind speeds and directions retrieved from backscatter coefficients acquired in interferometric wide (IW) swath mode are used. Their accuracy is determined through comprehensive comparisons with moored buoy wind measurements. SAR and buoy winds agree well at offshore and nearshore locations. The statistics characterizing the comparison of SAR and buoy wind speeds and directions are of the same order as those obtained from scatterometer (Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) and RapidScat) and buoy wind comparisons. The main discrepancy between SAR and buoy data are found for high wind speeds. SAR wind speeds exceeding 10 m s(-1) tend to be underestimated. A similar conclusion is drawn from SAR and scatterometer wind speed comparisons. It is based on the underestimation of SAR backscatter coefficient (sigma degrees) with respect to sigma degrees estimated from scatterometer winds and the geophysical model function (GMF) named CMOD-IFR2 (Ifremer C band MODel). New SAR wind speeds are retrieved using CMOD-IFR2. The corrected SAR retrievals allow better determination of the spatial characteristics of surface wind speeds and of the related wind components in near-coast areas. They are used for enhancing the determination of the spatial structure function required for the estimation of wind fields gridded in space and time at the regional scale. The resulting wind fields are only determined from scatterometer wind observations in combination with radiometer retrievals. Their qualities are determined through comparisons with SAR wind speeds and directions, and through their application for determination of wind power off Brittany coasts.

TI  - Inter-observer variation in the histopathology reports of head and neck melanoma; a comparison between the seventh and eighth edition of the AJCC staging system
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: TNM staging of melanoma has recently been altered by the introduction of the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging manual. The purpose of this study is to analyze the inter-observer variation of histopathology reports and its effect on recommended treatment policy.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 296 cases, diagnosed as primary cutaneous head and neck melanoma (2005-2016), referred to the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NCI) for treatment after prior diagnosis in another hospital (non-NCI). All reports were analyzed for patients demographics, tumor characteristics and histopathologic features.Results: In 53% and 40% of the cases, the histopathologic parameters were discordant, according to AJCC 7th and 8th edition, respectively. This indicated a perfect inter-observer agreement for the measurement of Breslow thickness (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.981) and a substantial agreement for subtype (kappa statistic (kappa)=0.648) and ulceration (kappa = 0.802), while only moderate for dermal mitotic activity (kappa = 0.472). After NCI review, recommended treatment policies were changed in 13% and 11% of the patients when applying TNM 7 and TNM 8, respectively. Scheduling sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) changed in 14 (5%) and 10 (3%) cases when using TNM 7 and TNM 8, respectively.Conclusion: Review by a NCI pathologist of histopathologic parameters of primary cutaneous head and neck melanoma led to significant changes in treatment decision. Introduction of the AJCC 8th edition led to slightly less discordances between NCI and non-NCI reports and consequently smaller impact on treatment planning. Expert review remains indicated when a SLNB is considered for additional staging in selected cases.

TI  - Validation of a Nomogram for Non-sentinel Node Positivity in Melanoma Patients, and Its Clinical Implications: A Brazilian-Dutch Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-sentinel node (NSN) positivity impacts the prognosis of melanoma patients; however, the benefits of completion lymph node dissection in patients with positive sentinel nodes (SNs) are limited.We aimed to present a predictive nomogram for NSN positivity in melanoma patients with a positive SN biopsy.This retrospective analysis from patients who underwent SN biopsy in a Brazilian institution from 2000 to 2015 was used for the construction and internal validation of the nomogram. This nomogram was then externally validated in a cohort of Dutch patients.The Brazilian cohort comprised 1213 patients, with a mean follow-up of 5.11 years. Breslow thickness (odds ratio [OR] 1.170, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.043-1.314]; p = 0.008), number of positive SNs (OR 1.092, 95% CI 1.034-1.153; p = 0.001), and largest diameter of the metastatic deposit (OR 3.217, 95% CI 1.551-6.674; p = 0.002) were statistically significant for NSN positivity. Internal validation was performed using a bootstrapping technique. A good performance was observed (Brier score 0.097) and an excellent power of discrimination was achieved (area under the curve [AUC] 0.822). The nomogram was then applied to the Dutch cohort, and its overall performance (Brier score 0.085), calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test; p = 0.198), and discriminatory power (AUC 0.752, 95% CI 0.615-0.890) were all adequate.We presented a nomogram for assessing NSN probability that should not only be used for surgical considerations but also for risk stratification and clinical decisions. Internal validation has shown that this is an adequate model, while external validation increases the model's reliability and suggests that it can be globally incorporated.

TI  - Impacts of snow and cloud covers on satellite-derived PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite aerosol optical depth (ADD) has been widely employed to evaluate ground fine particle (PM2.5) levels, whereas snow/cloud covers often lead to a large proportion of non-random missing AOD. As a result, the fully covered and unbiased PM2.5 estimates will be hard to generate. Among the current approaches to deal with the data gap issue, few have considered the cloud-AOD relationship and none of them have considered the snow-AOD relationship. This study examined the impacts of snow and cloud covers on AOD and PM2.5 and made full-coverage PM2.5 predictions with the consideration of these impacts. To estimate the missing AOD, daily gap-filling models with snow/cloud fractions and meteorological covariates were developed using the random forest algorithm. By using these models in New York State, a daily AOD data set with a 1-km resolution was generated with a complete coverage. The "out-of-bag" R-2 of the gap-filling models averaged 0.93 with an interquartile range from 0.90 to 0.95. Subsequently, a random forest-based PM2.5 prediction model with the gap-filled AOD and covariates was built to predict fully covered PM2.5 estimates. A ten-fold cross-validation for the prediction model showed a good performance with an R-2 of 0.82. In the gap-filling models, the snow fraction was of higher significance in the snow season compared with the rest of the year. The prediction models fitted with/without the snow fraction also suggested the discernible changes in PM2.5 patterns, further confirming the significance of this parameter. Compared with the methods without considering snow and cloud covers, our PM2.5 prediction surfaces showed more spatial details and reflected small-scale terrain-driven PM2.5 patterns. The proposed methods can be generalized to the areas with extensive snow/cloud covers and large proportions of missing satellite AOD for predicting PM2.5 levels with high resolutions and complete coverage.

TI  - Recent snow cover variation in the Upper Indus Basin of Gilgit Baltistan, Hindukush Karakoram Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous basins like the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) of Gilgit Baltistan (GB) are dependent on seasonal snowmelt and glacier melt. Monitoring of the snow-covered area (SCA) is not only vital for the overall hydrology of the Indus basin but also important to the sustainable agriculture and hydropower system. The snow-covered area in the UIB of GB was investigated for changes over the last 18 years using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product. The study area was divided into five elevation zones ranging from 877-8564 meters above sea level (m ASL). In contrast to the global cryosphere related studies, SCA in the UIB is slightly increasing. Elevation based SCA analysis also indicated that SCA is slightly increasing in each elevation zone. However, a significant amount of snow is concentrated in areas above 5000 m ASL. Due to the strong correlation between SCA and precipitation, the precipitation data also follow a similar trend. Analysis of the climatic data suggests a statistically significant increase in total monthly precipitation and relative humidity, a slight decrease in mean monthly temperature and a significant upward tendency in monthly solar irradiance data. All these trends in combination with the increasing trend in global precipitation, winter westerly disturbances and orographic precipitation are the important factors behind the slightly increasing SCA in the study area. Our results though constrained by short observation period mainly contribute to the understanding of advancing snow cover and glaciers in Hindukush Karakoram.

TI  - Misclassification in Assessment of First Trimester In-utero Exposure to Drugs Used Proximally to Conception: the Example of Letrozole Utilization for Infertility Treatment
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that has an unapproved use for ovulation induction with infertility. Because of the proximity of this use to conception, we selected letrozole to study the effect of 3 different methods for identifying the pregnancy start date and their impact on exposure misclassification. Using electronic health data from the US Sentinel database (2001-2015), we identified live-birth pregnancies conceived through in-vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination. The pregnancy start was calculated using 1) a validated algorithm to estimate the last menstrual period (LMP), 2) LMP + 14 days (i.e., conception estimate), and 3) the fertility-procedure date. We identified 47,628 live-births after intrauterine insemination (n = 24,962) and in-vitro fertilization (n = 22,666), in which 2,458 (5.3%) mothers received letrozole. The algorithm-based conception estimate occurred within 14 days of the fertility procedure for 78.3% of pregnancies. Defining pregnancy start as LMP (45.7/1,000 pregnancies) or LMP + 14 days (12.7/1,000 pregnancies) overestimated letrozole exposure during pregnancy by 8.4-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively, compared with defining it at the date of the fertility procedure (5.5/1,000 pregnancies). While most studies of drug utilization in pregnancy use LMP as the conventional pregnancy start, this introduced substantial exposure misclassification in the example of letrozole. LMP + 14 days was less biased. Researchers should carefully consider the impact of the method for identifying the pregnancy start date on the potential for exposure misclassification.

TI  - An altimeter height extraction technique for dynamically changing rivers of South and South-East Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach is proposed in this study to maximize the skill of satellite altimeter-derived heights by utilizing river extent information from additional sensors. We apply this approach for JASON-3 nadir altimeter. First, locations were identified in South and South East Asia region as potential candidates for this approach based on river extent. Information on river extent composed of river width and course (i.e., path) from visible (Landsat) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) platform (Sentinel-1). The extent-based approach was applied to filter out non-water radar returns in two methods: 1) River Mask (RM) based K-means (KM) clustering (hence, RM + KM) and 2) K-means clustering embedded with River Mask (RM) (hence, KMRM). Both methods were validated over 12 locations with long records of in-situ height observations and with distinct river characteristics. The maximum benefit observed in utilizing dynamic river mask is during low flow season when the probability of non water radar signal contamination is highest. For highly varying seasonal widths, satellite imagery on river conditions, as an ensemble of techniques, yields heights with higher accuracy. An average RMSE improvement of 40% in 8 out of 12 stations is observed. Overall, at least one of the two dynamic mask-based techniques studied consistently outperformed the conventional technique of altimeter height extraction based on a fixed river mask. Information on river mask or extent can play an important role in highly meandering rivers as the deviation between actual satellite altimeter passes and nominal passes can be considered during the extraction of heights. Compared to visible (Landsat) imagery, SAR was found to be much more effective at improving altimeter height extraction because of the all-weather capability during frequently cloudy conditions. The practicality of the river mask-based approach for altimeter height extraction needs to be carefully considered by the operational end user based on available computational resources and the latency that can be afforded. An ensemble of morphology based techniques using SAR imagery is likely the future of satellite altimeter-based river height extraction in South and South-East Asia where rivers are increasingly impacted by human regulation, encroachment and seasonality.

TI  - Characterization of Eastern Mediterranean dust storms by area of origin; North Africa vs. Arabian Peninsula
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Basin is exposed to frequent dust storms during all seasons but summer. The dust is originating from two large sources: a western source, namely North African (mainly Sahara Desert) and an eastern source, the Arabian Peninsula.The characteristics of 53 dust storms (2007-2013) were examined in relation to their origin - western (30) vs. eastern (23). Analysis was done using ground monitoring stations, satellite data and subjective synoptic classification. Significantly higher ground concentration (722 mu g/m(3) for western events vs 242 mu g/m(3) for eastern events), higher Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) levels (0.50 for western events vs 0.32 for eastern events), longer duration (25 h for western events vs 15 h for eastern events) and stronger surface wind speed (6 m/s for western events vs 4 m/s for eastern events) were found for western origin dust storms. Dust top height was higher for eastern origin events (1.7 km for western events vs 2.3 km for eastern events, non significant). The associated synoptic circulation types dominant during the western origin dust storms are winter cold-core cyclones while for the eastern origin events the Red Sea Trough is the dominant type and occur mainly during fall.The main assumed reasons for these distinguished characteristics (higher ground concentration, AOT levels, longer duration, and surface wind speed) are that western origin cyclones can induce both mobilization and transport of dust. Together with longer dust path and local sources contribution will create a potential for high concentration and long-lasting event as compared to eastern origin events where there is a separation between main mobilization process that occur during summer and the transport westwards necessary to deliver dust to the EM and occurs during non-summer events.

TI  - Vulvar malignant melanoma: Pathogenesis, clinical behaviour and management: Review of the literature
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Vulvar malignant melanoma (VMM) is a rare disease, accounting for 5% of all vulvar malignancies and is characterized by low survival and high recurrence rates. It is considered as a distinct entity of mucosal melanoma. Prognostic factors are higher age, advanced Breslow thickness, and lymph node involvement whilst central localization and ulceration status are still under debate. Surgery is the cornerstone for the treatment of primary VMM, however, it can be mutilating due to the anatomical location of the disease. Elective lymph node dissection is not part of standard care. The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in VMM is still being studied. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment do not benefit survival. Immunotherapy in cutaneous melanoma has shown promising results but clinical studies in VMM are scarce. In metastatic VMM, checkpoint inhibitors and in case of BRAF or KIT mutated metastatic VMM targeted therapy have shown clinical efficacy.In this review, we present an overview of clinical aspects, clinicopathological characteristics and its prognostic value and the latest view on (adjuvant) therapy and follow-up.

TI  - The contribution of legal medicine in clinical risk management
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn advanced health services, a main objective is to promote the culture of safety and clinical risk management. In this regard, the reporting of sentinel events fits within a perspective of error analysis, attempting to propose solutions aimed at preventing a new occurrence of the harmful event. The purpose of this study is to analyze the contribution of medico-legal litigation in the management of clinical risk and to propose an organizational model so as to coordinate the intervention of clinical risk management and medico-legal services.MethodsRetrospective review of 206 cases of medico-legal litigation, settled against a Hospital of a North-eastern city in Italy from January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015.ResultsApproximately 20% of cases, that are classifiable as sentinel events, were not reported due to various factors. The reason that these events are under-reported is mainly due to the latency between the event itself and its manifestation as a serious damage to health as well as the discomfort in reporting the events of this kind, which is still widespread among healthcare workers.The systematic research of the available documentation for medico-legal purposes permits the acquisition of more information concerning the clinical event, thereby increasing the number and accuracy of the reports to the clinical risk unit.ConclusionThe analysis of medico-legal litigation is a valid tool to enhance the reporting of sentinel events. One possible proposal is the implementation of an organizational model to establish a rapid procedure for the reporting of sentinel events during the evaluation of medico-legal litigations.

TI  - Does lymphadenectomy improve survival in patients with intermediate risk endometrial cancer? A multicentric study from the FRANCOGYN Research Group
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The role of lymphadenectomy in intermediate risk endometrial cancer remains uncertain. We evaluated the impact of lymphadenectomy on overall survival and relapse-free survival for patients with intermediate risk endometrial cancer.Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients from the FRANCOGYN database with intermediate risk endometrial cancer, based on pre-operative and post-operative criteria (type 1, grade 1-2 tumors with deep (> 50%) myometrial invasion and no lymphovascular space invasion), who received primary surgical treatment between November 2002 and August 2013. We compared overall survival and relapse-free survival between staged and unstaged patients.Results From 1235 screened patients, we selected 108 patients with intermediate risk endometrial cancer. Eighty-two (75.9%) patients underwent nodal staging (consisting of pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy). Among them, 35 (32.4%) had lymph node disease. The median follow-up was 25 months (range 0.4 to 155.0). The overall survival rates were 82.5% for patients staged (CI 64.2 to 91.9) vs 77.9 % for unstaged patients (CI 35.4 to 94.2) (P = 0.73). The relapse-free survival rates were 68.9% for staged patients (CI 51.2 to 81.3) vs 68.8% for unstaged patients (CI 29.1 to 89.3) (P=0.67).Conclusion Systematic nodal staging does not appear to improve overall survival and relapse-free survival for patients with IR EC but could provide information to tailor adjuvant therapy. Sentinel lymph node dissection may be an effective and less invasive alternative staging technique and should provide a future alternative for this population.

TI  - Validating a Time Series of Annual Grass Percent Cover in the Sagebrush Ecosystem
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We mapped yearly (2000-2016) estimates of annual grass percent cover for much of the sagebrush ecosystem of the western United States using remotely sensed, climate, and geophysical data in regression-tree models. Annual grasses senesce and cure by early summer and then become beds of fine fuel that easily ignite and spread fire through rangeland systems. Our annual maps estimate the extent of these fuels and can serve as a tool to assist land managers and scientists in understanding the ecosystem's response to weather variations, disturbances, and management. Validating the time series of annual maps is important for determining the usefulness of the data. To validate these maps, we compare Bureau of Land Management Assessment Inventory and Monitoring (AIM) data to mapped estimates and use a leave-one-out spatial assessment technique that is effective for validating maps that cover broad geographical extents. We hypothesize that the time series of annual maps exhibits high spatiotemporal variability because precipitation is highly variable in arid and semiarid environments where sagebrush is native, and invasive annual grasses respond to precipitation. The remotely sensed data that help drive our regression-tree model effectively measures annual grasses' response to precipitation. The mean absolute error (MAE) rate varied depending on the validation data and technique used for comparison. The AIM plot data and our maps had substantial spatial incongruence, but despite this, the MAE rate for the assessment equaled 12.62%. The leave-one-out accuracy assessment had an MAE of 8.43%. We quantified bias, and bias was more substantial at higher percent cover. These annual maps can help management identify actions that may alleviate the current cycle of invasive grasses because it enables the assessment of the variability of annual grass - percent cover distribution through space and time, as part of dynamic systems rather than static systems.

TI  - Spatial variability in shrub vegetation across dune forms in central Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In desert dune environments, vegetation may be an indicator of dune stability and rates of sediment transport. As topography and underlying controls of vegetation vary over large spatial areas, variations in dune form make scaling up of field research difficult. To mitigate this, and to identify spatial variations in vegetation distributions in a Saudi Arabian sand sea, spectral information from high resolution satellite images was classified to map polygons of shrub vegetation over 360 km(2) of well-defined linear dunes, broken linear dunes and dome dune forms. When compared to topographic characteristics of the landscape, extracted from a digital elevation model, vegetation densities were often highest on 10-20 degrees slopes elevated above interdune salt deposits on dune flanks. Spatially this was confined to small areas, and density was not always related to dune form, more to access of groundwater which encouraged colonisation on the tops of some dunes. Field observations identified shrubs of mainly Calligonum genus whose size is related to the amounts of salts, moving sediment, and access to the water table that varies within and between dune forms. Shrub density is likened to surface roughness (z(0)) to better understand sediment movement and modelling in dunes.

TI  - Comprehensive Validation Study of Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Using Objective Clinical Measures: Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS), Brazilian Portuguese Version
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality-of-life questionnaires (QLQs) do not correlate with objective measurements of treatment sequelae. We performed a comprehensive validation study of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS), adding physical evaluations of the main sequelae related to breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Three hundred patients were evaluated. BCTOS represented a good QLQ for BCT patients, which correlated with objective measurements.Introduction: When evaluating a quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ), many validation studies do not correlate qualityof-life scores with objective measurements of complications associated with treatment. Patients and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional observational study with 300 patients submitted to breast-conserving therapy. The patients answered the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQs C-30 and BR23, as well as the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS) questionnaire. Retest, internal consistency, factorial analysis, convergent/divergent analysis, and Rasch evaluation were performed. All patients underwent physical evaluations to assess lymphedema, handgrip strength, shoulder range of motion, breast cosmesis, and breast pain, and these groups were compared on the basis of BCTOS scores. Receiver operating characteristic curve determined the predictive value of BCTOS scores associated with clinical practice. Results: The internal consistencies of the BCTOS domains ranged from 0.785 to 0.895. Factor analysis grouped according to the original questionnaire. Convergent validation showed differences in the sexual functioning and sexual enjoyment domains of the EORTC BR23. Analysis of known groups found that in most domains, the scores were higher in patients with lymphedema, strength deficit, shoulder range-of-motion alteration, poor breast cosmesis, breast pain, and axillary lymphadenectomy. Using a cutoff of 1.26, lymphedema was associated with the edema domain; using a cutoff of 1.33, Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force/Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic pain was associated with the pain domain; and using a cutoff of 2.37, the cosmetic domain was associated with subjective cosmesis. Conclusion: The association of objective measurements in a validation study of quality of life qualified the study and allowed us to develop better parameters for comparisons of results of breast-conserving therapy between populations.

TI  - When breast cancer gets complicated. A case report of synchronous bilateral breast cancers with discordant tumor markers from the primary to nodes with findings of a sentinel internal mammary subpectoral lymph node
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This case reviews synchronous bilateral breast cancer with left infiltrating ductal carcinoma ER+/PR-, Her2- and right invasive lobular carcinoma ER+/PR-, Her2-. Independent primary bilateral breast tumors are present in 0.2-3.2% of breast cancer. Biopsy also showed differing ER status on the left breast versus the node which was triple negative. The final sentinel node was a left internal mammary node. Recent studies have found that the ER, PR and HER2 status of the primary tumor do not always correlate to the ER, PR and HER2 status of the metastatic sites. This can have deleterious effects on survival. There are no clear guidelines on course of treatment for these complex cases. A review of the current literature is supportive of treating the highest-risk breast malignancy. Despite the unusual pathology and severity of disease, our patient is doing well with treatment.

TI  - Exploring relationships of spring green-up to moisture and temperature across Wyoming, USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation green-up signals the timing of available nutritious plants and shrubs providing high-quality forage for ungulates. In this study, we characterized spatial and temporal patterns of spring phenology and explored how they were related to preceding temperature and moisture conditions. We tested correlations between late winter weather and indicators of the onset and the length of the spring growing period with 250-m resolution time-series satellite data (2001 - 2013) for Wyoming, USA. In western Wyoming mountains, drier and warmer conditions during late winter were associated with earlier spring green-up onset of growth in forests, shrubs, and grasses. In the northeast mountains, onset of spring correlated positively with preceding warmer temperatures, but not with precipitation. In most basin and plains shrublands and grasslands, spring onset was not correlated with temperature, although earlier onset of spring was correlated with drier conditions in 25% of shrub/scrub areas. Results about the length of spring were less definitive, with warmer temperatures related to longer green-up time for 12-30% of the land cover in western mountains but to shorter green-up time periods for 10-20% of the grasses and shrubs in basins and plains. Complex phenological patterns are likely to affect ungulate foraging behaviour on a local scale.

TI  - Hydrogeological Analysis Supported by Remote Sensing Methods as A Tool for Assessing the Safety of Embankments (Case Study from Vistula River Valley, Poland)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim to answer a question: how does the evolution of fluvial environment affect to risk of embankments failure in lowland rivers and how can we identify and describe places at risk of levees failure using the remote sensing data? The study was carried out in the Vistula River valley near Magnuszew (middle Vistula course, central Poland). 24 geological boreholes were drilled to a depth of 2.0-8.5 m and groundwater table observations were conducted in a monitoring network consisting of 22 wells, 5 piezometers (screened within the Holocene alluvial aquifer) and 2 temporary water gauges. Identification of the diversity of the geological structure of the floodplain was supported by airborne laser scanning imaging, as well as high resolution satellite images and aerial photos. This remote sensing study allowed the creation of a conceptual model of hydrogeological conditions. Study takes into account the effects of the land forming activity of flood waters resulting from the evolution of the fluvial environment in the Holocene. Created conceptual model subsequently fed into the construction and calibration of a mathematical groundwater flow model using MODFLOW software. The study allowed the identification and characterisation of intensified groundwater flow zones. Concentrated flow in the substrate of flood protection levees constitutes a threat to their stability. Documented in many publications climate change will induce in future climate scenarios an increase in rainfall and prolongation of dry periods. The implementation of the methodology of identifying the geological forms with the use of presented techniques allows the identification of sections of flood embankments potentially at risk of failure.

TI  - Relationships between field-measured hydrometeorological variables and satellite-based land surface temperature in a hemiboreal raised bog
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature regime is one of the main controlling factors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peat bogs. Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has a potential to become an efficient instrument in environmental monitoring of carbon dioxide and methane emissions from peat bogs. This paper examines the relationships between field-measured hydrometeorological variables and MODIS LST data in a hemiboreal raised bog for a period from May to September (2008-2016). The Pearson product-moment correlation was used to reveal the relationship between the field-measured parameters and LST over years and months. A multiple linear regression was chosen to model relationships between the hydrometeorological variables and LST by month. It was found that the relationships between the studied parameters and LST were year- and month-dependent. The main factor of LST was air temperature, and the correlation between LST and air temperature was the strongest during the entire period of study. This study has shown that the hydrometeorological factors of LST can explain 67%-81 % of the variance in LST in a hemiboreal raised bog. The relationships between the hydrometeorological variables and LST may be implemented in more accurate GHG emissions estimation from bogs.

TI  - Land-Use Change Detection with Convolutional Neural Network Methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used increasingly in several land-use classification tasks, but there is a need to further investigate its potential. This study aims to evaluate the performance of CNN methods for land classification and to identify land-use (LU) change. Eight transferred CNN-based models were fully evaluated on remote sensing data for LU scene classification using three pre-trained CNN models AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet. The classification accuracy of all the models ranges from 95% to 98% with the best-performed method the transferred CNN model combined with support vector machine (SVM) as feature classifier (CNN-SVM). The transferred CNN-SVM model was then applied to orthophotos of the northeastern Cloverdale as part of the City of Surrey, Canada from 2004 to 2017 to perform LU classification and LU change analysis. Two sources of datasets were used to train the CNN-SVM model to solve a practical issue with the limited data. The obtained results indicated that residential areas were expanding by creating higher density, while green areas and low-density residential areas were decreasing over the years, which accurately indicates the trend of LU change in the community of Cloverdale study area.

TI  - Comparison of UAV LiDAR and Digital Aerial Photogrammetry Point Clouds for Estimating Forest Structural Attributes in Subtropical Planted Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating forest structural attributes of planted forests plays a key role in managing forest resources, monitoring carbon stocks, and mitigating climate change. High-resolution and low-cost remote-sensing data are increasingly available to measure three-dimensional (3D) canopy structure and model forest structural attributes. In this study, we compared two suites of point cloud metrics and the accuracies of predictive models of forest structural attributes using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data, in a subtropical coastal planted forest of East China. A comparison between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics was performed across plots among different tree species, heights, and stem densities. The results showed that a higher similarity between the UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics appeared in the dawn redwood plots with greater height and lower stem density. The comparison between the UAV-LiDAR and DAP metrics showed that the metrics of the upper percentiles (r for dawn redwood = 0.95-0.96, poplar = 0.94-0.95) showed a stronger correlation than the lower percentiles (r = 0.92-0.93, 0.90-0.92), whereas the metrics of upper canopy return density (r = 0.21-0.24, 0.14-0.15) showed a weaker correlation than those of lower canopy return density (r = 0.32-0.68, 0.31-0.52). The Weibull parameter indicated a higher correlation (r = 0.70-0.72) than that of the Weibull parameter (r = 0.07-0.60) for both dawn redwood and poplar plots. The accuracies of UAV-LiDAR (adjusted (Adj)R-2 = 0.58-0.91, relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE) = 9.03%-24.29%) predicted forest structural attributes were higher than UAV-DAP (Adj-R-2 = 0.52-0.83, rRMSE = 12.20%-25.84%). In addition, by comparing the forest structural attributes between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP predictive models, the greatest difference was found for volume (Adj-R-2 = 0.09, rRMSE = 4.20%), whereas the lowest difference was for basal area (Adj-R-2 = 0.03, rRMSE = 0.86%). This study proved that the UAV-DAP data are useful and comparable to LiDAR for forest inventory and sustainable forest management in planted forests, by providing accurate estimations of forest structural attributes.

TI  - Assessing and reinitializing wildland fire simulations through satellite active fire data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large wildfires can cover millions of hectares of forest every year worldwide, causing losses in ecosystems and assets. Fire simulation and modeling provides an analytical scheme to characterize and predict fire behavior and spread in several and complex environments. Spatial dynamics of large wildfires can be analyzed using satellite active fire data, a cost-effective way to acquire information systematically worldwide. The simulated growth of three large wildland fires from the USA, Chile and Spain with different fire spread pattern, duration and size has been compared to satellite active fire data. Additionally, a new approach to reinitialize fire simulations in near real-time and predict a more accurate fire spread is shown in this work. Discrepancies between the simulated fire growth and satellite active data were measured spatially and temporally in the three fires, increasing along the fire duration. The reinitialization approach meaningfully improved the accuracy of fire simulations in all case studies. Satellite active fire data showed a high potential to be used in real fire incidents, improving fire monitoring and simulation and, therefore, supporting the decision-making process of the fire analyst. The reinitialization approach could be applied by using the current satellite active fire data such as MODIS or VIIRS as well as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or GPS locations from suppression resources.

TI  - Evaluation of the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel Analysis Tools Using a Comparator with a Different Indication: Comparing the Rates of Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Warfarin and Statin Users
T2  - PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System was established to monitor safety of regulated medical products. Sentinel investigators identified known associations between drugs and adverse events to test reusable analytic tools developed for Sentinel. This test case used a comparator with a different indication.ObjectiveWe tested the ability of Sentinel's reusable analytic tools to identify the known association between warfarin and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Statins, expected to have no effect on GIB, were the comparator. We further explored the impact of analytic features, including matching ratio and stratifying Cox regression analyses, on matched pairs.MethodsThis evaluation included data from 14 Sentinel Data Partners. New users of warfarin and statins, aged 18years and older, who had not received other anticoagulants or had recent GIB were matched on propensity score using 1:1 and 1:n variable ratio matching, matching statin users with warfarin users to estimate the average treatment effect in warfarin-treated patients. We compared the risk of GIB using Cox proportional hazards regression, following patients for the duration of their observed continuous treatment or until a GIB. For the 1:1 matched cohort, we conducted analyses with and without stratification on matched pair. The variable ratio matched cohort analysis was stratified on the matched set.ResultsWe identified 141,398 new users of warfarin and 2,275,694 new users of statins. In analyses stratified on matched pair/set, the hazard ratios (HR) for GIB in warfarin users compared with statin users were 2.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.36-3.28) in the 1:1 matched cohort and 3.10 (95% CI 2.76-3.49) in the variable ratio matched cohort. The HR was lower in the analysis of the 1:1 matched cohort not stratified by matched pair (2.22, 95% CI 1.97-2.49), and highest early in treatment. Follow-up for warfarin users tended to be shorter than for statin users.ConclusionsThis study identified the expected GIB risk with warfarin compared with statins using an analytic tool developed for Sentinel. Our findings suggest that comparators with different indications may be useful in surveillance in select circumstances. Finally, in the presence of differential censoring, stratification by matched pair may reduce the potential for bias in Cox regression analyses.

TI  - Evaluating Combinations of Temporally Aggregated Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 for Land Cover Mapping with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping of large areas is challenging due to the significant volume of satellite data to acquire and process, as well as the lack of spatial continuity due to cloud cover. Temporal aggregation-the use of metrics (i.e., mean or median) derived from satellite data over a period of time-is an approach that benefits from recent increases in the frequency of free satellite data acquisition and cloud-computing power. This enables the efficient use of multi-temporal data and the exploitation of cloud-gap filling techniques for land cover mapping. Here, we provide the first formal comparison of the accuracy between land cover maps created with temporal aggregation of Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat-8 (L8) data from one-year and test whether this method matches the accuracy of traditional approaches. Thirty-two datasets were created for Wales by applying automated cloud-masking and temporally aggregating data over different time intervals, using Google Earth Engine. Manually processed S2 data was used for comparison using a traditional two-date composite approach. Supervised classifications were created, and their accuracy was assessed using field-based data. Temporal aggregation only matched the accuracy of the traditional two-date composite approach (77.9%) when an optimal combination of optical and radar data was used (76.5%). Combined datasets (S1, S2 or S1, S2, and L8) outperformed single-sensor datasets, while datasets based on spectral indices obtained the lowest levels of accuracy. The analysis of cloud cover showed that to ensure at least one cloud-free pixel per time interval, a maximum of two intervals per year for temporal aggregation were possible with L8, while three or four intervals could be used for S2. This study demonstrates that temporal aggregation is a promising tool for integrating large amounts of data in an efficient way and that it can compensate for the lower quality of automatic image selection and cloud masking. It also shows that combining data from different sensors can improve classification accuracy. However, this study highlights the need for identifying optimal combinations of satellite data and aggregation parameters in order to match the accuracy of manually selected and processed image composites.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of urban changes and surface water quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to measure water quality allows researchers to monitor changes in various water quality parameters over temporal and spatial scales that are not always readily apparent from in situ measurements. This study involves using Landsat images and in situ data within GIS to map urban expansion and its resulting influences on water quality in the Pontchartrain Basin over the last three decades. The Pontchartrain Basin is located in southeast Louisiana and covers an area of 25,000 km(2) that encompasses sixteen parishes east of the Mississippi River and four Mississippi Counties. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image from 1985 and a Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) image from 2015 were processed using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm to map urban expansion. In order to estimate how water quality has changed in the Pontchartrain Basin between 1985 and 2015, in situ water quality data from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was interpolated using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK). Comparing urban expansion produced from SAM classification with urban indices, impervious surfaces were better identified and distinguished from other land cover features. The results of this study demonstrated that high levels of fecal coliform were consistent with increased urbanization in water bodies in the Pontchartrain Basin. Phosphorous levels were higher in 2015 compared to 1985 and were at levels high enough to lead to eutrophic conditions. Dissolved oxygen levels were lower near the mouth of the Mississippi river in 2015 than in 1985. The results indicated that urbanization has negative impact on water quality. The geospatial model is recommended to effectively manage and reduce the processing time of large water quality datasets.

TI  - Sampling Strategies for Soil Property Mapping Using Multispectral Sentinel-2 and Hyperspectral EnMAP Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing a sampling strategy for soil property mapping from remote sensing imagery entails making decisions about sampling pattern and number of samples. A consistent number of ancillary data strongly related to the target variable allows applying a sampling strategy that optimally covers the feature space. This study aims at evaluating the capability of multispectral (Sentinel-2) and hyperspectral (EnMAP) satellite data to select the sampling locations in order to collect a calibration dataset for multivariate statistical modelling of the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content in the topsoil of croplands. We tested different sampling strategies based on the feature space, where the ancillary data are the spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 and of simulated EnMAP satellite data acquired in Demmin (north-east Germany). Some selection algorithms require setting the number of samples in advance (random, Kennard-Stones and conditioned Latin Hypercube algorithms) where others automatically provide the ideal number of samples (Puchwein, SELECT and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm). The SOC content and the spectra extracted at the sampling locations were used to build random forest (RF) models. We evaluated the accuracy of the RF estimation models on an independent dataset. The lowest Sentinel-2 normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) for the validation set was obtained using Puchwein (nRMSE: 8.7%), and Kennard-Stones (9.2%) algorithms. The most efficient sampling strategies, expressed as the ratio between accuracy and number of samples per hectare, were obtained using Puchwein with EnMAP and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm with Sentinel-2 data. Hence, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data can be exploited to build a reliable calibration dataset for SOC mapping. For EnMAP, the different selection algorithms provided very similar results. On the other hand, using Puchwein and Kennard-Stones algorithms, Sentinel-2 provided a more accurate estimation than the EnMAP. The calibration datasets provided by EnMAP data provided lower SOC variability and lower prediction accuracy compared to Sentinel-2. This was probably due to EnMAP coarser spatial resolution (30 m) less adequate for linkage to the sampling performed at 10 m scale.

TI  - Feasibility of fine-needle aspiration for assessing responses to chemotherapy in metastatic nodes marked with clips in breast cancer: A prospective registry study
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Clips are often placed to mark axillary nodes with biopsy-confirmed metastases in patients with breast cancer. The evaluation of clipped nodes after chemotherapy can identify patients who have eradication of nodal disease. The goal of this study was to determine whether preoperative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of clipped nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) could predict the presence of residual disease. Methods This prospective registry study enrolled 50 patients with a clip placed to mark nodes with biopsy-confirmed metastases who had completed NAC. Participants underwent FNA of the clipped node before seed-localized lymph node excision. FNA pathology was compared with surgical pathology. Results There were 36 patients (72%) with residual disease on surgical pathology: 3 (8%) had a nondiagnostic aspirate, carcinoma was seen in 14 (39%), and 19 (53%) had a false-negative result. The sensitivity of FNA was 42.4%, its specificity was 100%, and its negative predictive value was 40.6%. In a univariate analysis, the odds of a true-positive result increased significantly with the mean initial size of the clipped node (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; P = .004) and the size of the metastatic focus after NAC (OR, 1.3; P = 0.003), whereas normalization of nodes after chemotherapy (OR, 0.1) and a lack of response on ultrasound (OR, 0.11) were associated with a false-negative result (P = .01). Conclusions FNA of marked nodes after chemotherapy has a high false-negative rate. This highlights the need for surgical staging of the axilla after NAC to assess the response.

T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem-based medical education is based in a biomedical worldview that works to entrench deterministic ways of thinking about socioculturally-influenced health disparities in the minds of medical trainees. This perspective paper considers the utility of Paolo Freire's critical pedagogy as a means of redressing this issue, as it may enable medical learners to perceive and address the social sources of illness that shape their patients' lives. With an eye to advancing health equity, and educating health professionals who are responsive to marginalized and vulnerable communities, this paper considers how a problem-posing medical education could redefine physicians' relationships to knowledge, identity, and to their patients.

TI  - A simplified urban-extent algorithm to characterize surface urban heat islands on a global scale and examine vegetation control on their spatiotemporal variability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a new algorithm, the simplified urban-extent (SUE) algorithm, to estimate the surface urban heat island (UHI) intensity at a global scale. We implement the SUE algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to calculate the UHI intensity for over 9500 urban clusters using over 15 years of data, making this one of the most comprehensive characterizations of the surface UHI to date. The results from this algorithm are validated against previous multi-city studies to demonstrate the suitability of the method. The dataset created is then filtered for elevation differentials and percentage of urban area and used to estimate the diurnal, monthly, and long-term variability in the surface UHI in different climate zones. The global mean surface UHI intensity is 0.85 degrees C during daytime and 0.55 degrees C at night. Cities in arid climate show distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns, with higher surface UHI during nighttime (compared to daytime) and two peaks throughout the year. The diurnal variability in surface UHI is highest for equatorial climate zone (0.88 degrees C) and lowest for arid zone (0.53 degrees C). The seasonality is highest in the snow climate zone and lowest for equatorial climate zone. While investigating the change in the surface UHI over a decade and a half, we find a consistent increase in the daytime surface UHI in the urban clusters of the warm temperate climate zone (0.04 degrees C/decade) and snow climate zone (0.05 degrees C/decade). Only arid climate zones show a statistically significant increase in the nighttime surface UHI intensity (0.03 degrees C/decade). Globally, the change is mainly seen during the daytime (0.03 degrees C/decade). Finally, the importance of vegetation differential between urban and rural areas on the spatiotemporal variability is examined. Vegetation has a strong control on the seasonal variability of the surface UHI and may also partly control the long-term variability. The complete UHI data are available through this website (https://yceo.yale.edu/research/global-surface-uhi-explorer) and allows the user to query the UHI of urban clusters using a simple interface.

TI  - Cloud mask-related differential linear adjustment model for MODIS infrared water vapor product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas of the Earth-atmosphere system and plays a vital role in understanding climate change, if correctly measured from satellites. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can monitor water vapor retrievals at near-infrared (nIR) bands in the daytime as well as at infrared (IR) bands in both daytime and night time. However, the accuracy of IR retrievals under confident clear conditions (> 99% probability) is much poorer than that of nIR retrievals. Additionally, IR retrievals under unconfident clear conditions (> 95%, > 66% and <= 66% probabilities) are usually discarded because the possible presence of clouds would further reduce their accuracy. In this study, we develop a cloud mask-related differential linear adjustment model (CDLAM) to adjust IR retrievals under all confident clear conditions. The CDLAM-adjusted IR retrievals are evaluated with the linear least square (LS) adjusted nIR retrievals under confident clear condition and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations under different probabilities of clear conditions. Both case studies in the USA and global (65 degrees S similar to 65 degrees N) evaluation reveal that the CDLAM can significantly reduce uncertainties in IR retrievals at all clear-sky confidence levels. Moreover, the accuracy of the CDLAM-adjusted IR retrievals under unconfident clear conditions is much better than IR retrievals without adjustment under confident clear conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of the CDLAM in enhancing the accuracy of IR retrievals at all clear-sky confidence levels as well as the data availability improvement of IR retrievals after adjustment with the CDLAM (14% during the analyzed time periods). The most likely reason for the efficiency of the CDLAM may be that the deviation of the differential water vapor information derived by the differential process is significantly shrunken after the linear regression analysis in the presented model. Therefore, the CDLAM is a promising tool for effectively adjusting IR retrievals under all probabilities of clear conditions and can improve our knowledge of the water vapor distribution and variation.

TI  - Empirical cross sensor comparison of Sentinel-2A and 2B MSI, Landsat-8 OLI, and Landsat-7 ETM + top of atmosphere spectral characteristics over the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing landscape monitoring approaches frequently benefit from a dense time series of observations. To enhance these time series, data from multiple satellite systems need to be integrated. Landsat image data is a valuable 30-meter resolution source of spatial information to assess forest conditions over time. Together both operational Landsat satellites-7 and 8 provide a revisit frequency of 8 days at the equator. This moderate temporal frequency provides essential information to detect annual large area abrupt land cover changes. However, the ability to measure subtle and short lived intraseasonal changes is challenged by gaps in Landsat imagery at key points in time. The first Sentinel-2 satellite mission was launched by the European Space Agency in 2015. This moderate resolution data stream provides an opportunity to supplement the Landsat data record. The objective of this study is to assess the potential for integrating top of atmosphere Landsat and Sentinel 2 image data archived in the Google Earth Engine compute environment. In this paper we assess absolute and proportional differences in near-contemporaneous observations for six bands with comparable spectral response functions and spatial resolution between the Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument and Landsat Operational Land Imager and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. We assessed differences using absolute difference metrics and major axis linear regression between over 10,000 image pairs across the conterminous United States and present cross sensor transformation models. Major axis linear regression results indicate that Sentinel MSI data are as spectrally comparable to the two types of Landsat image data as the Landsat sensors are with each other. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values ranging from 0.0121 to 0.0398 were obtained between MSI and Landsat spectral values, and RMSD values ranging from 0.0124 and 0.0372 were obtained between OLI and ETM +. Despite differences in their spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics, integration of these datasets appears to be feasible through the application of bandwise linear regression corrections.

TI  - China and India lead in greening of the world through land-use management
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data show increasing leaf area of vegetation due to direct factors (human land-use management) and indirect factors (such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, nitrogen deposition and recovery from natural disturbances). Among these, climate change and CO2 fertilization effects seem to be the dominant drivers. However, recent satellite data (2000-2017) reveal a greening pattern that is strikingly prominent in China and India and overlaps with croplands world-wide. China alone accounts for 25% of the global net increase in leaf area with only 6.6% of global vegetated area. The greening in China is from forests (42%) and croplands (32%), but in India is mostly from croplands (82%) with minor contribution from forests (4.4%). China is engineering ambitious programmes to conserve and expand forests with the goal of mitigating land degradation, air pollution and climate change. Food production in China and India has increased by over 35% since 2000 mostly owing to an increase in harvested area through multiple cropping facilitated by fertilizer use and surface-and/or groundwater irrigation. Our results indicate that the direct factor is a key driver of the ` Greening Earth', accounting for over a third, and probably more, of the observed net increase in green leaf area. They highlight the need for a realistic representation of human land-use practices in Earth system models.

TI  - Monitoring seasonal variations of colored dissolved organic matter for the Saginaw River based on Landsat-8 data
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an effective tool for studying CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) variations and its relevant environmental factors. Monitoring CDOM distribution and dynamics in small water is often limited by the coarse spatial resolution of traditional ocean color sensors. In this study, because of its high spatial resolution of 30 m, Landsat-8 data were used to assess seasonal variations of CDOM in the Saginaw River, by using an empirical statistic model. Pearson correlation analysis between CDOM variations and other environmental factors, such as temperature, discharge, and dissolved oxygen, shows that temperature was negatively correlated to CDOM variations and discharge played a positive role. We also calculated the monthly mean a(CDOM)(440) (the absorption coefficient of CDOM at 440 nm) for the Saginaw River between April and November from 2013 to 2016. This study demonstrates a good example for future applications in small waters: observing CDOM variations and other relevant environmental factors change by using Landsat remote sensing, so that we can know more about water quality and ecosystem health of small waters as well as the climate change impact on regional watersheds.

TI  - Verification of aerosol classification methods through satellite and ground-based measurements over Harbin, Northeast China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying aerosol types using spectral aerosol optical properties plays a key role in promoting the accuracy of remote sensing observations and expanding our knowledge of the internal relations between aerosol and climate. However, studies on verifying the correctness for aerosol type classification methods are particularly scarce. In this study, data from three month optical and chemical measurements of atmospheric aerosols in Harbin, Northeast China, were used to verify the optical classification methods by comparing their results with the actual aerosol types. Aerosol optical properties like aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), and single scattering albedo (SSA) were obtained through a CE318 sun-photometer, and aerosol type was then identified based on four previously published aerosol classification schemes. To acquire the actual aerosol states, satellite observations from MODIS and CALIPSO was combined and then the morphology, chemical composition, and molecular structure of sample particles were examined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-DES), X-Ray fluorescence spectrophotometer (XRF), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements. Results show that aerosol types over urban Harbin varied a lot during the studying period and mixed aerosol was the dominant type. The optical classification methods mentioned in this study could identify aerosol types correctly in most cases, but sometimes made improper estimations. Besides, they are able to descript the distinct variation of aerosol type on seasonal and daily scale, but at present the result is still too rough to discriminate the detailed changes of actual aerosol state accurately. The combination of different classification methods or chemical measurements would help reducing the misjudgment of aerosol types. Our findings demonstrate that a more comprehensive way to identify changes in aerosol state is urgently needed to enhance our understanding of the impacts of aerosols on climate and remote sensing.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy are widely used in early breast cancer treatment. Right now, the mode of local regional recurrence (LRR) has significantly changed and the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and axillary lymph node recurrence are steadily increasing. Due to its relatively low incidence of LRR compared with distant metastasis, inconsistent of pre-recurrence treatment, difficulty in surgical treatment, and few prospective clinical studies, there are rising new challenges for clinical management of LRR patients. In this article, based on new theory of LRR, clinical diagnosis and treatment progress, and our own clinical practice experience for LRR breast cancer patients, we propose that we should make pathological diagnosis and do systemic evaluation for LRR disease, then considering it as a curable disease, and integrating local and systemic comprehensive treatment for LRR patients, thus to improve their disease outcome.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of the Planar Morphology of Valley Bank Gullies Extracted with High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is a serious environmental problem worldwide, causing soil loss, land degradation, silting up of reservoirs and even catastrophic flooding. Mapping gully features from remote sensing imagery is crucial for assisting in understanding gully erosion mechanisms, predicting its development processes and assessing its environmental and socio-economic effects over large areas, especially under the increasing global climate extremes and intensive human activities. However, the potential of using increasingly available high-resolution remote sensing imagery to detect and delineate gullies has been less evaluated. Hence, 130 gullies occurred along a transect were selected from a typical watershed in the hilly and gully region of the Chinese Loess Plateau, and visually interpreted from a Pleiades-1B satellite image (panchromatic-sharpened image at 0.5 m resolution fused with 2.0 m multi-spectral bands). The interpreted gullies were compared with their measured data obtained in the field using a differential global positioning system (GPS). Results showed that gullies could generally be accurately interpreted from the image, with an average relative error of gully area and gully perimeter being 11.1% and 8.9%, respectively, and 74.2% and 82.3% of the relative errors for gully area and gully perimeter were within 15%. But involving field measurements of gullies in present imagery-based gully studies is still recommended. To judge whether gullies were mapped accurately further, a standard adopting one-pixel tolerance along the mapped gully edges was proposed and proved to be practical. Correlation analysis indicated that larger gullies could be interpreted more accurately but increasing gully shape complexity would decrease interpreting accuracy. Overall lower vegetation coverage in winter due to the withering and falling of vegetation rarely affected gully interpreting. Furthermore, gully detectability on remote sensing imagery in this region was lower than the other places of the world, due to the overall broken topography in the Loess Plateau, thus images with higher resolution than normally perceived are needed when mapping erosion features here. Taking these influencing factors (gully dimension and shape complexity, vegetation coverage, topography) into account will be favorable to select appropriate imagery and gullies (as study objects) in future imagery-based gully studies. Finally, two linear regression models were built to correct gully area (A(ip), m(2)) and gully perimeter (P-ip, m) visually extracted, by connecting them with the measured area (A(ms), m(2)) and perimeter (P-ms, m). The correction models were <mml:semantics>Ams=1.021Aip+0.139</mml:semantics> and <mml:semantics>Pms=0.949Pip+0.722</mml:semantics>, respectively. These models could be helpful for improving the accuracy of interpreting results, and further accurately estimating gully development and developing more effective automated gully extraction methods on the Loess Plateau of China.

TI  - Evaluation of HJ-1A/B CCD Surface Reflectance Products Using the VNIR and MODIS-Based Atmospheric Correction Approaches
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing development of medium- to high-resolution satellites in China has led to a considerable increase in the quantitative applications using the data; therefore, it is important to produce standard surface reflectance (SR) products operationally from such data. However, there is still a lack of relevant SR systems and SR products. We applied two atmospheric correction algorithms, adaptive to most multispectral satellites with visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands, to HJ-1A/B charge-coupled device (CCD) instrument data, namely, the VNIR method and the MODIS-based method, with both methods being based on the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum, Vector (6SV) code, and the look-up tables. We evaluated the accuracy of the SR by these two approaches for HJ-1A/B CCD images compared with the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) corrected reflectance for the period July 2011 to June 2012 over China and surrounding regions. We assessed more than 12 million pixels for the 49 spatial circular subsets, with a radius of 5 km, centered at 12 AERONET sites. The evaluation results indicated that both methods were suitable for operational flow, and that the MODIS-based method had better accuracy than the VNIR method, except for the near-infrared band. This conclusion was also validated by comparison with the normalized difference vegetation index products derived from the MODIS-based SR, VNIR SR, and AERONET SR. Additionally, the MODIS-based method showed superior accuracy when the overpass time of HJ-1A/B was more approximate to that of Terra MODIS.

AB  - Cloud phase is one of the important parameters of weather and climate research and core elements of atmospheric cloud parametric inversion. The accuracy of its recognition directly influences the inversion precision of cloud optical thickness, spherical albedo, effective particle radius, ice/liquid water content and other parameters. In this paper, we combine with cloud phase products of spaceborne multi-angle polarimetric radiometer, polarized laser radar, and millimeter wave radar. Next, we put forward a Dynamic Spatial Optimal Fusion (DSOF) algorithm. In this algorithm we construct the spatial optimal fusion rules of Cloud Top Phase (CTP) for multi-source data. Finally, we realize the cloud phase spatial fusion using these rules. We used the typhoon "Lupit" as the research object and verified this method. The standard deviations are 4.67%, 7.18%, 40.14% and 36.51%, respectively, compared the results of fused CTP to that of CALIPSO, CloudSat, POLDERS and MODIS. The fusion results are most close to the CTP of CALIPSO. The results show that this method can effectively achieve multi-source cloud phase inversion, and provide new technology for the development and data synergy of spaceborne multi-sensor satellite.

TI  - Urban Land Intensive Use Evaluation Study Based on Nighttime LightA Case Study of the Yangtze River Economic Belt
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land intensive use meets the requirements for the sustainable development of urban land and is an important part of urban sustainable development. The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) spans the three major regions of China, which are the most active areas of China's economy. The contradiction between humans and land is becoming more acute. There are also regional differences in land use patterns affecting the coordinated development of the YREB and the construction of an ecological civilization. Therefore, the scientific evaluation of urban land intensive use is a key area in the current research field of urban sustainable development. In this study, the YREB is chosen as the research object, and urban land intensive use is studied using nighttime light data and statistical data on the urban built-up area. An evaluation model based on urban nighttime light intensity and land urbanization is constructed with an allometric growth model. Considering that the impact of land urbanization on urban nighttime light has a possible lag effect, an evaluation model of land intensive use that considers the lag effect between urban nighttime light and the land urbanization level is proposed. Using urban agglomerations and some typical cities in the study area as research samples, the characteristics of urban nighttime light and land urbanization are analyzed to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of land development in the YREB. The results show that nighttime light remote-sensing data can better reflect the level of urban land use, the allometric growth model can better fit the intensity of urban light and the land urbanization level, and the allometric growth characteristics can reflect the land use characteristics of different cities and urban agglomerations. In regional experiments with typical cities and with urban agglomerations, compared to the original allometric growth model, the goodness of fit of the allometric growth model with the lag effect improves, on average, by 3.2% and 2%, respectively, with the highest increases being by 9.9% and 4.9%, respectively. The level of intensive land use in the YREB gradually decreases from east to west, and there are great differences among different cities in the provinces and urban agglomerations. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River have high land intensive use on the whole. In the middle reaches, multicenter cities have a greater efficiency of land use than the surrounding cities. In the upper reaches, only Chengdu and Chongqing have clear advantages in urban land intensive use. The results of this study can be helpful in providing an important reference for the sustainable development of land in the YREB and can provide a basis for future urban land optimization and sustainable development. Realizing the coordination and linkage between key cities and major cities is the key to enhancing the overall sustainable development ability of the core cities in the YREB.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the Black Sea influence on the thermal characteristics of its western hinterland based on satellite imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The marine impact on the land surface temperature (LST) values is detected at daily, seasonal and annual time scales, and a strong linkage with the land cover is demonstrated. The remote sensing products used within the study supply LST data with complete areal coverage during clear sky conditions at 1-km spatial resolution, which is appropriate for climate studies. The sea influence is significant up to 4-5km, by daytime, while the nighttime influence is very strong in the first 1-2km, and it gradually decreases westward. Excepting the winter, the daytime temperature increases towards the plateau with the distance from the sea, e.g. with a gradient of 0.9 degrees C/km in the first 5km in spring or with 0.7 degrees C/km in summer. By nighttime, the sea water usually remains warmer than the contiguous land triggering higher LST values in the immediate proximity of the coastline in all seasons, e.g. mean summer LST is 19.0 degrees C for the 1-km buffer, 16.6 degrees C for the 5-km buffer and 16.0 degrees C for the 10-km buffer. The results confirm a strong relationship between the land cover and thermal regime in the western hinterland of the Black Sea coast. The satellite-derived LST and air temperature values recorded at the meteorological stations are highly correlated for similar locations, but the marine influence propagates differently, pledging for distinct analysis. Identified anomalies in the general observed trends are investigated in correlation with sea surface temperature dynamics in the coastal area.

TI  - Glacier surges in the north-west West Kunlun Shan inferred from 1972 to 2017 Landsat imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The West Kunlun Shan lie close to, or are perhaps part of, two significant glaciological phenomena - the High Mountain Asia surge 'supercluster' and the Karakoram Anomaly. However, glaciological studies, and particularly surge studies, in the range are limited. Here, we extend the database of known surges in the region using Landsat imagery and cross-correlation feature tracking. We examine 88 glaciers larger than 1 km(2) in the Hotan Prefecture of Xinjiang, China, and find evidence of nine surges occurring between 1972 and 2017. Glaciers display low active phase velocities (similar to 0.2-1.5 km a(-1)) that show seasonal acceleration in the summer, active phase periods as short as 2 years, and build-up and deceleration phases of months-years. Although these observations display characteristics indicative of both the classic hydrological and thermal switch mechanisms, the surging observed displays a close resemblance to that in the adjacent Karakoram ranges. Furthermore, the majority of the surges occur clustered at the end of a decadal-scale warming period, corroborating previously proposed causal links between climate and surging in the Karakoram. We suggest that the two regions should be considered part of one larger system when considering surge dynamics in High Mountain Asia.

TI  - Mapping forty years of mangrove cover trends and their implications for flats fisheries in Cienaga de Zapata, Cuba
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove forests of Cienaga de Zapata, Cuba, support populations of bonefish (Albula vulpes), tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), permit (Trachinotus falcatus), and common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) that play key roles in the local sport fishing industry. Despite their importance, no published work has documented changes in these mangroves' extent throughout the past four decades. This project used unsupervised classification of Landsat imagery to quantify areal changes in Zapata's mangrove forests from 1974 to 2017. Results demonstrated a 6.48% decrease in mangrove area over the course of the entire study period. However, rates of mangrove change were not uniformly distributed. The most substantial decrease in mangrove extent occurred when Hurricane Michelle struck Zapata in November 2001, reducing mangrove area by 5.56%. Between 2002 and 2014, Zapata's mangrove extent increased by 5.03%, demonstrating the resilience of the peninsula's mangrove forest to hurricane disturbance. Results suggest that Zapata's national park designation has largely protected its mangroves from anthropogenic destruction, and that hurricane disturbance has been a more substantial driver of change in this important coastal ecosystem. The resilience of Zapata's mangroves to natural hurricane disturbance and their minimal exposure to anthropogenic disturbance offer encouraging evidence for the continued conservation of Zapata's flats fisheries.

TI  - FDA-Catalyst-Using FDA's Sentinel Initiative for large-scale pragmatic randomized trials: Approach and lessons learned during the planning phase of the first trial
T2  - CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative is well positioned to support pragmatic clinical trials. FDA-Catalyst combines direct contact with health plan members and/or providers with data in the Sentinel infrastructure. Here, we describe the rationale, feasibility analyses, and lessons learned from the planning phase of the first large pragmatic trial conducted using the Sentinel Initiative's delivery system capabilities-IMplementation of a randomized controlled trial to imProve treatment with oral AntiCoagulanTs in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (the IMPACT-AFib trial). Methods: During the planning phase, we convened representatives from five commercial health plans, FDA, study coordinating centers, and a patient representative for protocol development, institutional review board preparation, and other activities. Administrative claims data from the plans were included in a retrospective cohort analysis to assess sample size for the trial. Members >= 30 years old with >= 365 days of medical/pharmacy coverage, >= 2 diagnosis codes for atrial fibrillation, a guideline-based indication for oral anticoagulant use for stroke prevention, and no evidence of oral anticoagulant use in the 365 days prior to the index atrial fibrillation diagnosis in 2013 were included. Exclusions for the analysis included other conditions requiring anticoagulation, history of intracranial hemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleed. We calculated rates of oral anticoagulant use, transient ischemic attack or stroke, and bleeding in the 365 days following the index atrial fibrillation diagnosis. Results: A total of 44,786 members with atrial fibrillation with no evidence of recent oral anticoagulant use were identified. In total, 87% (n = 38,759) were classified as having a guideline-based indication for oral anticoagulants. Of those, 33% (n = 12,867) had a new oral anticoagulant dispensed during the following year, 15% (n = 5917) were hospitalized for stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 9% (n = 3469) for bleeding events. This information was used to develop the trial protocol including sample size, power calculations, and level of randomization. Conclusion: Sentinel infrastructure generated preliminary data that supported planning and implementation of a large pragmatic trial embedded in health plans. This planning identified unanticipated challenges that must be addressed in similar trials.

TI  - A distributed cellular automata model to simulate potential future impacts of climate change on snow cover area
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow dynamics in alpine systems play an important role in water resources management. One of the main variables that characterises the snowpack is snow cover area. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to assess the impact of climate change scenarios on snow cover area in alpine systems. The methodology calibrates and validates a distributed cellular automata (CA) model. Potential climate change scenarios can be generated to feed the CA model in order to assess the potential impact of climate change on snow cover area. The methodology has been applied to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in southern Spain, an area with a Mediterranean climate, which is valuable in terms of both its ecology and the tourism industry. Snow falls on the mountains from October to May, but this snow season may vary in the future due to climate change. We analysed the influence of elevation on the potential impact of climate change on the area covered by snow. The size of the potential changes associated with climate change increase with elevation in the case of temperature and decrease in the case of precipitation. These potential changes will modify snow dynamics, causing an important reduction in the area covered by snow (mean 60.4%) for the future horizon considered (2071-2100).

TI  - Uncertainties in the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) Remote Sensing Reflectance for Assessing Diurnal Variability of Biogeochemical Processes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term (sub-diurnal) biological and biogeochemical processes cannot be fully captured by the current suite of polar-orbiting satellite ocean color sensors, as their temporal resolution is limited to potentially one clear image per day. Geostationary sensors, such as the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) from the Republic of Korea, allow the study of these short-term processes because their orbit permit the collection of multiple images throughout each day for any area within the sensor's field of regard. Assessing the capability to detect sub-diurnal changes in in-water properties caused by physical and biogeochemical processes characteristic of open ocean and coastal ocean ecosystems, however, requires an understanding of the uncertainties introduced by the instrument and/or geophysical retrieval algorithms. This work presents a study of the uncertainties during the daytime period for an ocean region with characteristically low-productivity with the assumption that only small and undetectable changes occur in the in-water properties due to biogeochemical processes during the daytime period. The complete GOCI mission data were processed using NASA's SeaDAS/l2gen package. The assumption of homogeneity of the study region was tested using three-day sequences and diurnal statistics. This assumption was found to hold based on the minimal diurnal and day-to-day variability in GOCI data products. Relative differences with respect to the midday value were calculated for each hourly observation of the day in order to investigate what time of the day the variability is greater. Also, the influence of the solar zenith angle in the retrieval of remote sensing reflectances and derived products was examined. Finally, we determined that the uncertainties in water-leaving "remote-sensing" reflectance (R-rs) for the 412, 443, 490, 555, 660 and 680 nm bands on GOCI are 8.05 x 10(-4), 5.49 x 10(-4), 4.48 x 10(-4), 2.51 x 10(-4), 8.83 x 10(-5), and 1.36 x 10(-4) sr(-1), respectively, and 1.09 x 10(-2) mg m(-3) for the chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), 2.09 x 10(-3) m(-1) for the absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter at 412 nm (a(g) (412)), and 3.7 mg m(-3) for particulate organic carbon (POC). These R-rs values can be considered the threshold values for detectable changes of the in-water properties due to biological, physical or biogeochemical processes from GOCI.

TI  - Indirect Assessment of Sedimentation in Hydropower Dams Using MODIS Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images to quantify the sedimentation processes in a cascade of six hydropower dams along a 700-km transect in the Paranapanema River in Brazil. Turbidity field measurement acquired over 10 years were used to calibrate a turbidity retrieval algorithm based on MODIS surface reflectance products. An independent field dataset was used to validate the remote sensing estimates showing fine accuracy (RMSE of 9.5 NTU, r = 0.75, N = 138). By processing 13 years of MODIS images since 2000, we showed that satellite data can provide robust turbidity monitoring over the entire transect and can identify extreme sediment discharge events occurring on daily to annual scales. We retrieved the decrease in the water turbidity as a function of distance within each reservoir that is related to sedimentation processes. The remote sensing-retrieved turbidity decrease within the reservoirs ranged from 2 to 62% making possible to infer the reservoir type and operation (storage versus run-of-river reservoirs). The reduction in turbidity assessed from space presented a good relationship with conventional sediment trapping efficiency calculations, demonstrating the potential use of this technology for monitoring the intensity of sedimentation processes within reservoirs and at large scale.

TI  - Predictors of sentinel lymph node positivity in thin melanoma using the National Cancer Database
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) specimens are often obtained from patients for further staging after these patients have undergone melanoma excision. Limited data regarding predictors of SLNB positivity in thin melanoma are available.Objective: We sought to evaluate predictors of SLNB positivity in thin melanoma.Methods: Patients with cutaneous melanoma with a Breslow thickness <= 1.00 mm who received a SLNB were identified from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2014 (n = 9186). Predictors of SLNB positivity were analyzed using logistic regression.Results: In a multivariate analysis, patients <60 years of age (P < .001) and Breslow thickness >0.8 mm (P = .03) were at increased risk for positive sentinel lymph node (SLN). Moreover, on multivariate analysis, the presence of dermal mitoses increased the odds of SLN positivity by 95% (odds ratio [OR] 1.95 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.53-2.5], P < .001), ulceration by 63% (OR 1.63 [95% CI 1.21-2.18], P < .001), and Clark level IV to V by 48% (OR 1.48 [95% CI 1.19-1.85]). Patients without ulceration but with dermal mitoses had 92% (OR 1.92 [95% CI 1.5-2.48], P < .001) increased SLN positivity.Limitations: Limited survival data are available.Conclusions: Younger age, a Breslow thickness >0.8 mm, the presence of dermal mitoses, ulceration, and Clark level IV to V are positive predictors of positive SLN. While the new American Joint Committee on Cancer system has removed dermal mitotic rate from staging, continued evaluation of dermal mitotic rate could be valuable for guiding surgical decision making about SLNB.

TI  - Smart irrigation forecast using satellite LANDSAT data and meteo-hydrological modeling
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses advances in coupling satellite driven soil water balance model and meteorological forecast as support for precision smart irrigation use in a case study of an operative farm in the South of Italy where semiarid climatic conditions holds. Crop water needs forecast are computed with the intuitive idea of forcing the soil water balance model with the meteorological model outlooks. Discussion on the methodology approach is presented, comparing, for a reanalysis period between June and September 2014, the forecast system outputs with observed soil moisture and crop water needs. Two main issues are here in emphasized: the characteristic of soil moisture water balance model, that due to its state variables may be directly calibrated and validated using satellite or near sensing land surface temperatures; the accuracy of those forecast meteorological variables that are the most important in driving the soil water and energy balance. The soil water balance model performances are then discussed highlighting the importance of using a model which state variable (the pixel surface equilibrium temperature) is the same as the data detected by satellite (Land Surface Temperature), so that it can be used for calibrating and validating soil hydrological parameters. Model outputs are also validated with a comparison of ground latent and sensible heat fluxes from an eddy covariance station and soil moisture data. Problems insight into the meteorological modeling, such as temporal and spatial scale, and their influence on soil moisture forecast are discussed showing on the base of several observation periods the need to increase the meteorological forcings accuracy for this type of applications.The obtained results show how the proposed methodology of the forecasting system is able to have a high reliability in soil moisture forecast correctly providing irrigation suggestion.

TI  - Analysis to Quantify and Optimize Spot Beams for a High Throughput Satellite in Ka and Q/V Bands
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this present work we propose a methodology to optimize the number of spot beams that are necessary in an HTS (High Throughput Satellite) system for 1 Tb/s total pure capacity for Latin America area. Therefore, to obtain the precise spot beams amount, we will use some kinds of algorithms and mechanisms to optimize the system and that can be compared with some traffic ratio configurations in order to meet the data traffic current needs and maybe project them for data traffic variation in the future. Thus, these are the main challenges that will be faced by 2020. Whereby, user capacity should be increased due to the multiple data services that arising such as: HD Video streaming, Big Data, IoT, D2D, etc. This work promises to meet expectations to find the theoretical capacity of an HTS latest generation system.

TI  - Mastectomy or Breast-Conserving Therapy for Early Breast Cancer in Real-Life Clinical Practice: Outcome Comparison of 7565 Cases
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the organ preservation strategy by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy (BCT) has revolutionized the treatment approach of early stage breast cancer (BC), the choice between treatment options in this setting can still vary according to patient preferences. The aim of the present study was to compare the oncological outcome of mastectomy versus breast-conserving therapy in patients treated in a modern clinical setting outside of clinical trials. 7565 women diagnosed with early invasive BC (pT1/2pN0/1) between 1998 and 2014 were included in this study (median follow-up: 95.2 months). In order to reduce selection bias and confounding, a subgroup analysis of a matched 1:1 case-control cohort consisting of 1802 patients was performed (median follow-up 109.4 months). After adjusting for age, tumor characteristics and therapies, multivariable analysis for local recurrence-free survival identified BCT as an independent predictor for improved local control (hazard ratio [HR]:1.517; 95%confidence interval:1.092-2.108, p = 0.013) as compared to mastectomy alone in the matched cohort. Ten-year cumulative incidence (CI) of lymph node recurrences was 2.0% following BCT, compared to 5.8% in patients receiving mastectomy (p < 0.001). Similarly, 10-year distant-metastasis-free survival (89.4% vs. 85.5%, p = 0.013) was impaired in patients undergoing mastectomy alone. This translated into improved survival in patients treated with BCT (10-year overall survival (OS) estimates 85.3% vs. 79.3%, p < 0.001), which was also significant on multivariable analysis (p = 0.011). In conclusion, the present study showed that patients treated with BCS followed by radiotherapy had an improved outcome compared to radical mastectomy alone. Specifically, local control, distant control, and overall survival were significantly better using the conservative approach. Thus, as a result of the present study, physicians should encourage patients to receive BCS with radiotherapy rather than mastectomy, whenever it is medically feasible and appropriate.

TI  - Discriminating between C3, C4, and Mixed C3/C4 Pasture Grasses of a Grazed Landscape Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1a Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In livestock grazing environments, the knowledge of C3/C4 species composition of a pasture field is invaluable, since such information assists graziers in making decisions around fertilizer application and stocking rates. The general aim of this research was to explore the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to discriminate between C3, C4, and mixed-C3/C4 compositions. In this study, three Random Forest (RF) classification models were created using features derived from polarimetric SAR (polSAR) and grey-level co-occurrence textural metrics (glcmTEX). The first RF model involved only polSAR features and produced a prediction accuracy of 68% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.49. The second RF model used glcmTEX features and produced prediction accuracies of 76%, 62%, and 75% for C3, C4, and mixed C3/C4 grasses, respectively. The glcmTEX model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 73% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.57. The polSAR and glcmTEX features were then combined (COMB model) to improve upon their individual classification performances. The COMB model produced prediction accuracies of 89%, 81%, and 84% for C3, C4, and mixed C3/C4 pasture grasses, and an overall prediction accuracy of 86% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.77. The contribution of the various model features could be attributed to the changes in dominant species between sampling sites through time, not only because of climatic variability but also because of preferential grazing.

TI  - Clinical implications of the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The new edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for melanoma builds on the foundation of prior editions but has several important improvements. The availability of regional nodal staging using sentinel lymph node biopsy (with subsequent follow-up) has resulted in more accurate prognostication for patients and clinicians. This facilitates identification of those at higher risk for recurrence, and allows for the appropriate selection of patients for new adjuvant therapy and clinical trials. Although more complex than previous editions, the eighth edition will provide granularity to outcome analysis based on more precise risk stratification.

TI  - Soluble PD-L1 is a potential biomarker of cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness and metastasis in obstructive sleep apnoea patients
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) upregulates the programmed cell death-1 receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) pathway, potentially compromising immunosurveillance. We compared circulating levels of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) in patients with cutaneous melanoma according to the presence and severity of OSA, and evaluated relationships with tumour aggressiveness and invasiveness.In a multicentre observational study, 360 patients with cutaneous melanoma underwent sleep studies, and serum sPD-L1 levels were assayed using ELISA. Cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness indices included mitotic rate, Breslow index, tumour ulceration, Clark level and tumour stage, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis was recorded as a marker of invasiveness.sPD-L1 levels were higher in severe OSA compared to mild OSA or non-OSA patients. In OSA patients, sPD-L1 levels correlated with Breslow index and were higher in patients with tumour ulceration, advanced primary tumour stages or with locoregional disease. The incorporation of sPD-L1 to the classic risk factors to SLN metastasis led to net improvements in the classification of 27.3%.Thus, sPD-L1 levels are increased in melanoma patients with severe OSA, and, in addition, might serve as a potential biomarker of cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness and invasiveness in this group of subjects.

TI  - Effect of coastal land use change on coastline dynamics along the Nigerian Transgressive Mahin mud coast
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last ten decades, the coastal zone has been experiencing population growth and incomparable developments that are in discordance with the dynamic nature of the coastal system. This makes imperative the understanding of complex processes influencing the coastal system. The present study focused on the coastline changes and associated land use/land cover (LULC) patterns along the similar to 89 km Mahin mud section of the Nigerian Coast in the Gulf of Guinea of the North Atlantic Ocean during the last 30 years (1987 similar to 2017). The study utilized ten multispectral Landsat TM/OLI 8 images in the geographic information system (GIS) environment for the coastline changes and the LULC patterns using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) algorithm. Net rates of coastline change, on short-term and long-term periods, were calculated from endpoint rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR) statistical methods, respectively. Results showed that the entire Mahin Mud coast is undergoing serious erosion. Over the entire study period (1987-2017), 58% (50.7 km) coastline of the study area experienced retreat. This rapid rate of coastline retreat has triggered land loss of 10.64 km(2) to the Atlantic over the last 30 years. The study found that although the changing wave climate has a strong influence on the observed patterns of erosion and accretion along the Mahin mud coast, both marine and anthropogenic processes are acting in concomitance to influence coastal retrogradation along the coast. Therefore to curtail the ongoing coastal retrogradation along the mud coast, there is a need to fashion out the most sustainable approach that will facilitate the realization of the twin objectives of safeguarding the mud coast whilst at the same time maintaining and improving the socio-economic development of the area. Further, there is a need for strengthened spatial planning regulations that would control human activities and specify roles of the various coastal stakeholders in mitigating coastal retrogradation and other related coastal hazards in the study area. Finally, we propose a long-term policy of managed retreat that will curtail communities' exposure to coastal hazards, save lives, and lessen the expenditure of public fund on vulnerable infrastructure and response mechanisms.

TI  - Thermal impacts of greenery, water, and impervious structures in Beijing's Olympic area: A spatial regression approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the urban land-use determinants of the urban heat island (UHI) in Beijing's Olympic Area, using different statistical models, land surface temperatures (LST) derived from Landsat 8 remote sensing, and land-use data derived from 1-m high-resolution imagery. Data are captured over grids of different sizes. Spatial regressions are necessary to capture neighboring effects, particularly when the grid unit is small. Grass, trees, water bodies, and shades have all significant and negative effects on LST, whereas buildings, roads and other impervious surfaces have all significant and positive effects. The results also point to significant nonlinear and interaction effects of grass, trees and water, particularly when the grid cell size is small (60 m-90 m). Trees are found to be the most important predictor of LST. When the grids are smaller than 180 m, the indirect impacts are larger than the direct ones, whereas, the opposite takes place for larger grids. Because of their strong performance (R-2 ranging from 0.839 to 0.970), the models can be used for predicting the impacts of land-use changes on the UHI and as tools for urban planning. Finally, extensive uncertainty and sensitivity analyses show that the models are very reliable in terms of both input data accuracy and estimated coefficients precision.

TI  - SURVEY OF FOREST COVER CHANGES BY MEANS OF MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and land cover changes affect the environment in such ways that they can influence the human health by changing the climate, weather, water, air, biodiversity, wildlife, disease risk and food security. Comparing aerial or satellite images from the same region recorded at different times, known as post-classification comparison, is an approach that aims to identify changes in land coverage and understand forest spatial pattern change over time. These patterns are extremely complex, therefore, for their description and understanding a better approach would be multifractal geometry. In this paper, by using the multifractal analysis the evolution of the forest spatial model in southern Moldova over a decade has been investigated. We explored the potential of aerial image processing, lacunarity and textural analysis to detect a correlation between lacunarity, fractal dimensions and coverage crowns areas. This analysis leads to the determination of the percentage of land coverage, the dynamics of the natural reforestation process, the location of mature trees and the determination of areas where the landscape has changed drastically due to deforestation and / or reforestation. Two opposite forest spatial patterns were identified. For four studied forests, the rate of deforestation was continuously increased between 2005 and 2010. For only one forest, the Valeni forest, the coverage crown area has increased over the analyzed time period.

TI  - Detection of geothermal anomalies using Landsat 8 TIRS data in Tulu Moye geothermal prospect, Main Ethiopian Rift
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the high geothermal potential of the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), risks associated with the industry and the difficulty of identifying possible targets using ground surveys alone continue to impede the development of geothermal power diligence in Ethiopia. In this paper, we investigate the geothermal potential of the Tulu Moye prospect area in the MER using Landsat 8, which is an important and cost-effective method of detecting geothermal anomalies. Data with a path/row of 168/054 were obtained from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared (TIR) sensors for October 17, 2014. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction (with the 6S model) and an NDVI-based threshold method for calculating land surface emissivity, a split-window algorithm was applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of the study area. Results show LST values ranging from 292.2 to 315.8 K, with the highest values found in barren lands. A comparison of LST between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 8 shows a maximum difference of 1.47 K. Anomalous areas were also discovered, where LST was about 3-9 K higher than the background area. We identified seven of these as areas of high geothermal activity in the Tulu Moye prospective geothermal area. Auxiliary data and overlay analysis tools eliminated any non-geothermal influences. The research reveals that the distribution of highy prospective geothermal areas is consistent with the development and distribution of faults in the study area. Magmatism is the thermal source and faults provide conduits for the heat to flow from earth's interior to the surface, facilitating the presence of geothermal anomalies. Finally, TIR remote sensing methods prove to be a robust and cost-effective technique for detecting LST anomalies in the geologically active area of MER. Moreover, combining TIR remote sensing with knowledge of the structural geology of the area and geothermal mechanisms is an efficient approach to detecting geothermal areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier changes in the Jankar Chhu Watershed dCW) of Chandrabhaga (Chenab) basin, Lahaul Himalaya were worked out based on Corona and Sentinel 2A images between 1971 and 2016. The JCW consists of 153 glaciers (>0.02 km(2)) with a total area of 185.6 +/- 3.8 km(2) that include 82 glaciers with debris-covered ablation zone, comprising 10.9% of the total glacierized area as in 2016. Change analysis based on Corona (1971), Landsat (2000) and Sentinel 2A (2016) was restricted to 127 glaciers owing to the presence of cloud cover on 26 glaciers in 1971. A subset of glaciers was also mapped using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM; 1989) image. The total glacier area decreased by 14.7 +/- 4.3 km(2) (0.3 +/- 0.1 km(2) a(-1)). The number of glaciers in the JCW increased by four between 1971 and 2016 due to fragmentation. More recently (2000-16), recession rate has increased. Clean-ice area decreased by 21.8 +/- 3.8 km(2) (0.5 +/- 0.1 km(2) a(-1)) while debris-covered ice increased by 7.2 +/- 0.4 km 2 (0.2 +/- 0.01 km(2 )a(-1)). Field observations of select glaciers also support derived recession trend in the JCW. Retreat rates in the JCW have been observed to be much lower than previously reported.

TI  - A comparison of automated object extraction methods for mound and shell-ring identification in coastal South Carolina
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - One persistent archaeological challenge is the generation of systematic documentation for the extant archaeological record at the scale of landscapes. Often our information for landscapes is the result of haphazard and patchy surveys that stem from opportunistic and historic efforts. Consequently, overall knowledge of some regions is the product of ad hoc survey area delineation, degree of accessibility, effective ground visibility, and the fraction of areas that have survived destruction from development. These factors subsequently contribute unknown biases to our understanding of chronology, settlements patterns, interaction, and exchange. Aerial remote sensing offers one potential solution for improving our knowledge of landscapes. With sensors that include LiDAR, remote sensing can identify archaeological features that are otherwise obscured by vegetation. Object-based image analyses (OBIA) of remote sensing data hold particular promise to facilitate regional analyses thorough the automation of archaeological feature recognition. Here, we explore four OBIA algorithms for artificial mound feature detection using LiDAR from Beaufort County, South Carolina: multiresolution segmentation, inverse depression analysis, template matching, and a newly designed algorithm that combines elements of segmentation and template matching. While no single algorithm proved to be consistently superior to the others, a combination of methods is shown to be the most effective for detecting archaeological features.

TI  - Urban vegetation loss and ecosystem services: The influence on climate regulation and noise and air pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services are present everywhere, green vegetation coverage (or green areas) is one of the primary sources of ecosystem services considering urban areas sustainability and peoples urban life quality. Urban vegetation cover loss decreases the capacity of nature to provision ecosystem services; the loss of urban vegetation is also observed within the Amazon. This study aims at identifying urban vegetation loss and relate it to the provision of ecosystem services of reduction of air quality, reduction of air pollution, and climate regulation. Urban vegetation coverage loss was calculated using NDVI on LANDSAT 5 imagery over a 23-year period from 1986 to 2009. NDVI thresholds were arbitrarily selected, and complemented by in locus observation, to establish guidelines for quantitative (area) and qualitative (density) evolution of green cover, divided in six different categories, named as water, bare soil, poor vegetation, moderate vegetation, dense vegetation and very dense vegetation. Data on air pollution, noise pollution and temperature were outsourced from previous works. Measurement show a significant loss of very dense, dense and moderate vegetation coverage and an increase in poor vegetation and bare soil areas, in accordance to increase in air and noise pollution, and local temperature, and provides positive refashions between the loss of urban green coverage and decrease in ecosystem services.

TI  - EFFECT OF COLD WATER IMMERSION PERFORMED ON SUCCESSIVE DAYS ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE, MUSCLE DAMAGE, AND INFLAMMATORY, HORMONAL, AND OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS IN VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of daily cold water immersion (CWI) on physical performance, muscle damage, and inflammatory, hormonal, and oxidative stress markers in volleyball. Six players were submitted to CWI and six players to a placebo, during 5 training days. Thigh circumference, squat jump, and agility were measured on the first, third, and sixth days. On the first and sixth days, blood and saliva were collected for analysis of oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammatory and hormonal levels. Muscle soreness and countermovement jump were quantified daily. The physical performance comparisons did not present differences and the only between group comparison with a large effect size (ES = 21.39) was in Delta% between day 1 and day 2 for countermovement jump. Delayed onset muscle soreness and creatine kinase increased in both groups and the ESs of between group comparisons of Delta% between moments were not more than moderate. Thigh circumference increased only in the placebo group (p = 0.04) and the ES of the between group comparisons of Delta% between moments was large (1.53). No differences were found in oxidative stress, or inflammatory markers. Cortisol decreased only in the CWI-group (p <= 0.05) and the ESs of the between group comparisons of Delta% between moments of the testosterone to cortisol ratio (-1.94) and insulin-like growth-1 (-1.34) were large. Despite the positive effects of daily CWI on muscle edema and hormonal status, the limited effects of CWI on performance, muscle damage, inflammation markers, and reactive oxygen species mediators signal the unimportance of the daily practice of this recovery method in volleyball players.

TI  - Performance of two faecal immunochemical tests for the detection of advanced neoplasia at different positivity thresholds: a cross-sectional study of the Dutch national colorectal cancer screening programme
T2  - LANCET GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are recommended for colorectal cancer screening. Two frequently used FIT methods (FOB-Gold, Sentinel Diagnostics, Milan, Italy and OC-Sensor, Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) perform similarly in detecting advanced neoplasia (ie, colorectal cancer and advanced adenoma) at a fixed positivity cutoff for faecal haemoglobin concentration. It is unclear whether the performance of the two methods is also comparable at other thresholds. We compared the accuracy of the two assays in detecting advanced neoplasia across various thresholds.Methods In a cross-sectional study in the Dutch national screening programme, individuals who were screening naive in 2016 (aged 55-75 years) living in the southwest region of the Netherlands were invited to use two different FIT assays on the same bowel movement. Eligible participants were randomly selected from municipal registers. Participants were referred for colonoscopy if either FIT assay result met the predefined positivity threshold (>= 15 mu pg haemoglobin per g faeces). We compared the respective distributions of reported haemoglobin concentration and positivity rates with various FIT positivity thresholds. The performance of each FIT for identifying advanced neoplasia at colonoscopy in FIT-positive assays was compared with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Findings 21 078 (50.0%) of 42179 invitees completed both FIT assays. The distribution of haemoglobin concentrations differed significantly between the two FITs (p<0.0001), with higher positivity rates for OC-Sensor at FIT thresholds of 5 and 10 mu g haemoglobin per g faeces, similar positivity rates at 15 and 20 mu g haemoglobin per g faeces, and higher rates for FOB-Gold at FIT thresholds of 25-150 mu g haemoglobin per g faeces. 2046 (9.7%) of 21 078 participants had at least one FIT assay that was positive and of these, 1724 (84.3%) attended colonoscopy. The accuracy of results in individuals undergoing colonoscopy did not significantly differ between the FITs, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.675 (95% CI 0.649 to 0.702) for FOB-Gold and 0.686 (0.661 to 0.712) for OC-Sensor (p=0.40). At identical positivity rates, the positive predictive value of the two FIT assays was similar (difference varying from 0.5% [95% CI -2.6 to 3.7] at a positivity rate of 3.5% to 2.4% [-2.5 to 7.3] at a positivity rate of 2.0%).Interpretation The two widely used FITs have significantly different distributions of reported haemoglobin concentration and yield different positivity rates at equal thresholds. However, they perform similarly in detecting advanced neoplasia at a preset positivity rate. When implementing either FIT in a screening programme, the desired positivity rate that identifies participants to be referred for colonoscopy should first be set, guided by available resources and feasibility.

TI  - Near real-time agriculture monitoring at national scale at parcel resolution: Performance assessment of the Sen2-Agri automated system in various cropping systems around the world
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The convergence of new EO data flows, new methodological developments and cloud computing infrastructure calls for a paradigm shift in operational agriculture monitoring. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission providing a systematic 5-day revisit cycle and free data access opens a completely new avenue for near real-time crop specific monitoring at parcel level over large countries. This research investigated the feasibility to propose methods and to develop an open source system able to generate, at national scale, cloud-free composites, dynamic cropland masks, crop type maps and vegetation status indicators suitable for most cropping systems. The so-called Sen2-Agri system automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series in a seamless way to derive these four products, thanks to streamlined processes based on machine learning algorithms and quality controlled in situ data. It embeds a set of key principles proposed to address the new challenges arising from countrywide 10 m resolution agriculture monitoring. The full-scale demonstration of this system for three entire countries (Ukraine, Mali, South Africa) and five local sites distributed across the world was a major challenge met successfully despite the availability of only one Sentinel-2 satellite in orbit. In situ data were collected for calibration and validation in a timely manner allowing the production of the four Sen2-Agri products over all the demonstration sites. The independent validation of the monthly cropland masks provided for most sites overall accuracy values higher than 90%, and already higher than 80% as early as the mid-season. The crop type maps depicting the 5 main crops for the considered study sites were also successfully validated: overall accuracy values higher than 80% and F1 Scores of the different crop type classes were most often higher than 0.65. These respective results pave the way for countrywide crop specific monitoring system at parcel level bridging the gap between parcel visits and national scale assessment. These full-scale demonstration results clearly highlight the operational agriculture monitoring capacity of the Sen2-Agri system to exploit in near real-time the observation acquired by the Sentinel-2 mission over very large areas. Scaling this open source system on cloud computing infrastructure becomes instrumental to support market transparency while building national monitoring capacity as requested by the AMIS and GEOGLAM G-20 initiatives.

TI  - Enhancing the performance of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) for urban land cover mapping using airborne lidar data and band selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) is a widely applied tool to retrieve spatially explicit information on urban land cover from both hyperspectral and multispectral data, but is still prone to misclassification errors when faced with high inter-class similarity, typical of the complex urban environment. In this study we assessed multiple ways to minimize spectral confusion using airborne lidar data as an additional data source and spectral feature selection. Several approaches were tested using simulated hyperspectral data and two case studies in the city of Brussels, Belgium, one based on hyperspectral (APEX) data and one on multispectral (Sentinel-2) data. We found that the implementation of height distribution information (1) as an endmember model selection tool and (2) as a basis for additional fraction constraints at the individual pixel scale, significantly reduced spectral confusion between spectrally similar, but structurally different land cover classes (on average by 80% for the APEX case). This had a net positive effect on subpixel fraction estimations (average R2 increased from 0.34 to 0.80 and from 0.23 to 0.63 for APEX and Sentinel-2, respectively) and pixel classification accuracies (kappa increased from 0.38 to 0.6 for the APEX case). When applied to fine spatial resolution data containing many single-class pixels, endmember model selection based on height information resulted in the additional benefit of lowering computation times by 85%. Spectral feature selection successfully discarded redundant spectral information (on average retaining only 19 out of 218 bands), thereby further lowering processing times by 50%, without affecting accuracies. Despite these significant improvements, spectral confusion remained an issue between classes showing no distinction in height information, particularly pavement and soil. Future research should therefore focus on integrating the proposed approach with advanced endmember detection and selection algorithms, along with exploring innovative ways of highlighting small spectral differences using spectral transformations. The algorithm we propose constitutes a viable approach for mapping of structurally diverse ecosystems, such as urban environments, at multiple spatial scales and with varying level of thematic detail.

TI  - Validation of MODIS-Aqua bio-optical algorithms for phytoplankton absorption coefficient measurement in optically complex waters of El Rincon (Argentina)
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - El Rincon is a highly productive area in the inner-shelf of the Argentine Sea, southern Buenos Aires Province (39 degrees S-62.5 degrees W; 41.5 degrees S-60 degrees W), regarded as the habitat for commercially valuable fish species and important for local artisanal fisheries. The aims of this work were to characterize for the first time the in situ absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda,)) in relation to phytoplankton composition and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and to evaluate the satellite retrieval of a(ph)(443) using two atmospheric correction algorithms and three bio-optical semi-analytical algorithms in order to define which is more suitable for the study area. A total of 28 oceanographic cruises were performed between November 2013 and March 2017 and the sampling included physical variables (temperature, salinity, suspended particulate matter, SPM), Chl-a, phytoplankton absorption and composition. The phytoplankton community was mainly dominated by chain-forming diatoms from the microplankton size class (40-80%), while a single coccolithophore, Gephyrocapsa oceanica (cell diameter < mu m) was a key component (up to 40%) of the nanoplankon. In situ Chl-a (mean 1.8 mg m(-3)) and a(ph) (443) (mean 0.052 m(-1)) generally covariated with no clear seasonality. Their correlation was rather low (R-2 = 0.52) and with high scattering, in agreement with the high interannual variability of phytoplankton composition. Further, the relative low mean specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a(ph)*(443), 0.032 m(2) (mg Chl-a)(-1)) and (a(ph)*(676), 0.014 m(2) (mg Chl-a)(-1)) denoted the presence of big cells and pigment packaging effect. Aside from the optical complexity of these waters, reasonable results were found using the Quasi Analytical Algorithm in retrieving a(ph) coefficient (R-2 = 0.55, Bias = 19%) and switching the atmospheric correction algorithm depending on the distance to the coast, the depth and turbidity. The results found in this paper present for the first time the phytoplankton composition and absorption of algal material characteristics and the derived implication on the performance of bio-optical algorithms in the optically complex waters of El Rincon.

TI  - Optimization of inverter loading ratio for grid connected photovoltaic systems
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at performing and analyzing the inverter sizing optimization process for large-scale grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV). The local solar resource was evaluated and compared to the available satellite data. Analyses of the solar irradiance distribution and its potential effects on inverter sizing were performed. The performance of five different, commercially-available PV module technologies was also evaluated by means of remote data analysis of irradiation and temperature, as well as electrical parameters. This was performed using the metrics of energy yield and performance ratio (PR) for PV systems. A methodology was developed for estimating the optimal inverter sizing in the region considering overload losses and economic aspects, aiming at the optimization and cost reduction of PV-generated electricity. Considering the five technologies, the mean yield was 150 kWh/kWp on a monthly basis. The annual PR ranged from 77% to 85% depending on technology. The local solar resource, measured during three years, was compared to five distinct satellite-derived solar databases. Cloud enhancement and cloud edge effects were observed through the monthly solar irradiation distribution over the three years of measurements. Around 28% of the incident annual irradiation was at irradiance levels at or above 1000 W/m(2). The methodology developed for the optimal inverter loading ratio (ILR) was applied over one full year of solar generation data for the five technologies. It was observed that for inverter loading ratios commonly used on utility-scale PV power plants (around 120%), the overload losses varied from 0.3% to 2.4%, depending on technology. The optimal ILR for the more traditional crystalline Si PV technology was estimated to be 126%.

TI  - Assessing channel migration dynamics and vulnerability (1977-2018) of the Torsa River in the Duars and Tal region of eastern Himalayan foothills, West Bengal, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel migration is perhaps the most rampant quasi-natural hazard that is commonly experienced in the eastern Himalayan foothills of Duars and Tal region, India. The present study is dealt with the Torsa River, which is situated in the Duars and Tal region. The study aims at the changing rate of channel migration and vulnerability of the Torsa River in Duars and Tal region on spatial and temporal basis using geospatial methods. The changing course of the Torsa River was detected using remote sensing and GIS since 1977-2018 (42years). USGS Landsat MSS, ETM, OLI_TRIS sensor data (1977, 2010 and 2018) were considered to demarcate the chronological changes of the river course. Normalized Difference Water Index was used to extract the surface water bodies. Sixteen cross sections have been considered to delimit the river course migration pattern. The results showed that the Torsa River course has been migrating towards the right bank at different places of the study area. In the downstream of Patla Khawa Protected Forest, the continuous lateral migration of the river Torsa and associated river bank erosion invited the loss of agricultural land and socio-economic vulnerability in most of the villages of Cooch Behar I, Cooch Behar II and Mathabhanga II blocks of Cooch Behar district, West Bengal. Therefore, the present study may be helpful for ensuing suitable site specific management options which may check future river bank erosion as well as loss of livelihood and properties.

TI  - Impact of Land-Use/Land-Cover Change on Land Surface Temperature Using Satellite Data: A Case Study of Rajarhat Block, North 24-Parganas District, West Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increase in land surface temperature (LST) of growing urban areas in the current global warming scenario is a cause of concern for city planners. This study discusses the impact of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change on LST of the area in and around Rajarhat block, North 24-Parganas District, West Bengal, covering an area of 165km(2). Multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite data from Landsat 5 TM (1990), Landsat 8 OLI (2016) and Sentinel 2A (2016) are used for the LULC mapping, and thermal infrared data from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 TIRS (2016) are used for estimating the LST of 1990 and 2016. Results show that land-use pattern in November has changed in Rajarhat from 1990 to 2016: 13km(2) of vegetation cover lost due to urbanization; 9.3km(2) of open land converted to agricultural land and open fields/parks; 1.4km(2) of aquaculture ponds converted to tree cover/scrublands and 1.45km(2) of lakes/ponds filled up. Loss of vegetation (scrubland and tree) cover resulted in LST rise by about 1.5 degrees C. Aquaculture ponds have the ability to resist the rise in LST since the increase in temperature of this class is only 0.24 degrees C due to increase in its area. This change in land-use pattern over 26years has increased the LST by 0.94 degrees C. The urban-heat-island (UHI) phenomenon has also increased. The area of the strongest' heat-island phenomenon, as per UTVFI classification scheme, has increased by 20.1km(2). Positive correlation is observed between NDBI and LST's of urban areas (r=0.002 for 1990 and r=0.047 for 2016) which suggests that urbanization is responsible for the rise in LST. The NCEP NOAA surface temperature model suggests that the long-term trends in the rise in maximum LST over Rajarhat is about 1 degrees C from January 1990 to November 2016 with 90% confidence level validating the extracted LST data from satellites. Sustainable urban planning is required to arrest the rise in LST which includes urban forestry, construction of water bodies and fountains, preserving existing aquaculture ponds and reducing construction activities.

TI  - The mystery of economy: Exploring the threshold between theology and economics
T2  - REVIEW & EXPOSITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the permanence of a "theological device" within the structures of economic thought. Using the work of Giorgio Agamben, this article describes how divine providence relates to the natural world; this analysis will in turn provide the basis for a reading of contemporary economics. Oikonomia, in early Christian use, becomes not only a metaphor for the divine household and God's own life, but also begins to designate God's influence both on the divine and the material spheres. Agamben interprets contemporary economics as the theoretical movement that pushes away the "transcendent" principle from the "immanent" principle, leaving the world devoid of any relation to God. This article engages Agamben's insights in a discussion about the structures of such "providential order" inherent to economic thought, and the ways it can be described as a form of "theology," alternative to the Christian worldview.

TI  - Patchy Lakes and Topographic Origin for Fast Flow in the Recovery Glacier System, East Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Recovery subglacial basin, with its largest glacier Recovery Glacier, has been identified as potentially the biggest contributor to future sea level rise from East Antarctica. Subglacial lakes along the main trunk have been detected from satellite data, with four giant lakes (Recovery Lakes A, B, C, and D) located at the onset of the fast ice flow (15m/yr) and multiple smaller lakes along the glacier. The presence of subglacial water potentially plays a key role in the control of fast ice flow of Recovery Glacier. We present new insights on the Recovery Lakes from airborne radar data collected in 2013 and 2015. Using an adjusted classification scheme, we show that a single large area consisting of smaller lakes connected by likely saturated sediment, referred to as Lake AB, exists in the originally proposed area of the Recovery Lakes A and B. We estimate that the current size of Lake AB is approximate to 4,320km(2). Water likely leaks from the western shore of Lake AB lubricating the bed initiating fast ice flow at this location. The difference in the outlines of Lake AB and the Lakes A and B previously derived from surface features suggested that a larger paleolake existed here in the past. From our data, we find Recovery Lake C to be dry; we attribute fast ice flow originating from this area to be due to a topographic step and thus an increase in ice thickness rather than enhanced lubrication at the bed.Plain Language Summary Lakes of liquid water exist under the Antarctic ice sheet. The lake surface is very smooth, and the ice can easily slide over it. This is reflected in a very smooth ice surface, which can be detected in satellite images. To gain more detailed information about subglacial lakes, we need to look below the ice. This is possible with radar waves that travel through the ice where they are reflected at the interface between ice and bedrock or ice and water. Analyzing the reflected signal strength, we derive information about the conditions at the bed and can detect water. Four giant lakes (Recovery Lakes A-D) were identified from satellite data at the onset of fast ice flow of Recovery Glacier. Analyzing a 10-km grid of radar data over these lakes, we now show that Lakes C and D are dry and only one lake exists in the area of the proposed Lakes A and B. This one lake likely regulates the fast ice flow of Recovery Glacier by water leakage from the lake shore.

TI  - Formation and Evolution of Soil Salinization in Shouguang City Based on PMS and OLI/TM Sensors
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the evolution process of soil salinization in Shouguang, the current study applied the Pan and Multi-spectra Sensor (PMS), Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thematic Mapper (TM) data to establish a remote sensing monitoring model of soil salinization. Based on the vegetation and salinity indexes, we extracted the information of soil salinization in the flourishing period of plant growth in Shouguang in 2017. At the same time, we monitored the spatial and temporal patterns of soil salinization in Shouguang from 1998 to 2017. We compared the range of soil salinization reflected by remote sensing data and the regional groundwater level and revealed the formation and evolution mechanism of soil salinization in Shouguang. The results reflected that the distribution of soil salinization in Shouguang demonstrated obvious banding characteristics in distribution, and soil salinization gradually increased from the south to the north. Based on the imagery interpretation of Landsat images of three periods from 1998 to 2017, we found that the area of saline land in Shouguang severely decreased as a whole, but the coastal salinization intensified. Moreover, the inversion of surface soil salinity using the GF-1 satellite PMS image has a high precision, and the goodness of fit (R-2) is up to 0.871. Compared with the GF-1 image, the Landsat image is more suitable for grading and monitoring soil salinization in a wide range. We also confirmed that the change in ground water level is the main reason for the evolution of salinization. Excessive exploitation of groundwater by vegetable production caused the intensification of seawater intrusion and secondary salinization in coastal areas, while the water level dropped in areas far from the coastline. To prevent the deterioration from soil salinization in Shouguang, it is necessary for us to extract the local groundwater resources reasonably and optimally.

TI  - A regional ASTER GDEM error model for the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accuracy of the global ASTER GDEM (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model) version 2 (v2) elevation data product is highly variable regionally, as are its empirical correlations with landscape variables. This paper investigates GDEM error along a 49-site geomorphologic gradient within the core region of the Chinese Loess Plateau, notable for its heterogeneous terrain. The error is modelled using its associations with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) composite forest cover percentage, GlobeLand30 land cover, and key elevation derivatives, including two indices, terrain roughness index (TRI) and topographic position index (TPI), not previously evaluated in GDEM accuracy studies. Overall root mean squared error (RMSE) is 20.33 m, in excess of the GDEM v2 accuracy specifications, while RMSE at each site varies substantially, from 10.67 m for a low relief area to 21.84 m for the most rugged site. Strong associations between covariates, especially slope, aspect, TRI, and forest cover are identified. A regression model using these variables is developed to formally characterize and predict GDEM error. External validation with independent checkpoints across all sites demonstrates that this model can reduce mean error by about 4 m.

TI  - Mapping of the functional anatomy of lymphatic drainage to the axilla in early breast cancer: A cohort study of 933 cases
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The aims of this study were to investigate the correlation between lymphatic drainage and the sentinel lymph node (SLN) status of the subregions in the context of the clinic-pathological parameters of the tumour and the coverage of the axillary volumes by standard and high tangential fields (STgF and HTgF) for whole breast radiotherapy and axillary reverse mapping (ARM).Patients and methods: 933 women with early breast cancer and clinically negative axillary status underwent breast surgery and SLN biopsy followed by axillary lymph node dissection in SLN-positive cases. The subregional localisation of the SLN(s) was registered and statistically analysed with the clinic pathological characteristics of the breast tumour. In node-positive patients treated with breast conserving therapy in whom the SLNs were found in the anterior or posterior axillary subregions, the axillary volumes were contoured using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contouring atlas (n = 61).Results: In 91.1% (n = 797) of the cases, the SLN appeared in the anterior, posterior or central subregions. Using HTgF, Level I or II were completely covered in 65.6% (40/61) and 6.6% (4/61) of the cases, respectively. With STgF, the complete coverage was 0% for both levels. 6.8% (n = 63) of all cases had one positive lymph node in the expected ARM lymph node regions.Discussion: A SLN is more than likely to be present in the anterior, posterior and central axillary subregions. Tangential fields allow only limited coverage of the axillary volumes. Preserving the lateral subregion during ARM may increase the possibility of understaging.

AB  - Monkeypox, caused by a zoonotic orthopoxvirus, is endemic in Central and West Africa. Monkeypox has been sporadically reported in the Republic of the Congo. During March 22-April 5, 2017, we investigated 43 suspected human monkeypox cases. We interviewed suspected case-patients and collected dried blood strips and vesicular and crust specimens (active lesions), which we tested for orthopoxvirus antibodies by ELISA and monkeypox virus and varicella zoster virus DNA by PCR. An ecologic investigation was conducted around Manfouete, and specimens from 105 small mammals were tested for anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies or DNA. Among the suspected human cases, 22 met the confirmed, probable, and possible case definitions. Only 18 patients had available dried blood strips; 100% were IgG positive, and 88.9% (16/18) were IgM positive. Among animals, only specimens from Cricetomys giant pouched rats showed presence of orthopoxvirus antibodies, adding evidence to this species' involvement in the transmission and maintenance of monkeypox virus in nature.

TI  - Analysis of the melting glaciers in Southeast Tibet by ALOS-PALSAR data
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has resulted in the melting of glaciers in the southeastern region of Tibet. This study used the InSAR time series obtained from ALOS PALSAR data to investigate the melting glacier over Southeast Tibet during 2007 - 2010 with the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. Additionally, GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) gravity field model issued by the Center for Space Research (CSR) was used to extract the equivalent water height (EWH) with the deduction of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). The results revealed that the monitoring results by InSAR were basically consistent with the EWHs from GRACE. The glacier deformation in the study area presents a downward trend overall. From the InSAR measurements, a 900-km(2) area within the belt subsided - 1.6 cm yr(-1) during 2007 - 2010, and the subsidence exceeded - 24 cm yr(-1) in some regions. On the other hand, as an auxiliary data source, the monitoring result of GRACE is large space scale and comprehensive, the rate is about -0.01 cm yr(-1) from GRACE. With the variations of glacier shape obtained from MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data, the changing rate of surface temperature was about 0.014 degrees C yr(-1). The surface temperature change is negatively correlated with the rate of the glacial subsidence with the correlation coefficient of - 0.237, which reflects that the melting glacier is influenced by the temperature rising to a certain extent.

TI  - Polarimetric remote sensing of atmospheric aerosols: Instruments, methodologies, results, and perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Workshop on Advancement of Polarimetric Observations - Calibration and Improved Aerosol Retrievals (APOLO)
CL  - Hefei, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Polarimetry is one of the most promising types of remote sensing for improved characterization of atmospheric aerosol. Indeed, aerosol particles constitute a highly variable atmospheric component characterized by a large number of parameters describing particle sizes, morphologies (including shape and internal structure), absorption and scattering properties, amounts, horizontal and vertical distribution, etc. Reliable monitoring of all these parameters is very challenging, and therefore the aerosol effects on climate and environment are considered to be among the most uncertain factors in climate and environmental research. In this regard, observations that provide both the angular distribution of the scattered atmospheric radiation as well as its polarization state at multiple wavelengths covering the UV-SWIR spectral range carry substantial implicit information on the atmospheric composition. Therefore, high expectations in improving aerosol characterization are associated with detailed passive photopolarimetric observations.The critical need to use space-borne polarimetry for global accurate monitoring of detailed aerosol properties was first articulated in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By now, several orbital instruments have already provided polarization observations from space, and a number of advanced missions are scheduled for launch in the coming years by international and national space agencies. The first and most extensive record of polarimetric imagery was provided by POLDER-I, POLDER-II, and POLDER/PARASOL multi-angle multi-spectral polarization sensors. Polarimetric observations with the POLDER-like design intended for collecting extensive multi-angular multi-spectral measurements will be provided by several instruments, such as the MAI/TG-2, CAPI/TanSat, and DPC/GF-5 sensors recently launched by the Chinese Space Agency. Instruments such as the 3MI/MetOp-SG, MAIA, SpexOne and HARP2 on PACE, POSP, SMAC, PCF, DPC-Lidar, ScanPol and MSIP/Aerosol-UA, MAP/Copernicus CO2 Monitoring, etc. are planned to be launched by different space agencies in the coming decade. The concepts of these future instruments, their technical designs, and the accompanying algorithm development have been tested intensively and analyzed using diverse airborne prototypes. Certain polarimetric capabilities have also been implemented in such satellite sensors as GOME-2/MetOp and SGLI/GCOM-C.A number of aerosol retrieval products have been developed based on the available measurements and successfully used for different scientific applications. However, the completeness and accuracy of aerosol data operationally derived from polarimetry do not yet appear to have reached the accuracy levels implied by theoretical sensitivity studies that analyzed the potential information content of satellite polarimetry. As a result, the dataset provided by MODIS is still most frequently used by the scientific community, yet this sensor has neither polarimetric nor multi-angular capabilities. Admittedly polarimetric multi-angular observations are highly complex and have extra sensitivities to aerosol particle morphology, vertical variability of aerosol properties, polarization of surface reflectance, etc. As such, they necessitate state-of-the-art forward modeling based on first-principles physics which remains rare, and conventional retrieval approaches based on look-up tables turn out to be unsuitable to fully exploit the information implicit in the measurements. Several new-generation retrieval approaches have recently been proposed to address these challenges. These methods use improved forward modeling of atmospheric (polarized) radiances and implement a search in the continuous space of solutions using rigorous statistically optimized inversions. Such techniques provide more accurate retrievals of the main aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness and yield additional parameters such as aerosol absorption. However, the operational implementation of advanced retrieval approaches generally requires a significant extra effort, and the forward-modeling part of such retrievals still needs to be substantially improved.Ground-based passive polarimetric measurements have also been evolving over the past decade. Although polarimetry helps improve aerosol characterization, especially of the fine aerosol mode, the operators of major observational networks such as AERONET remain reluctant to include polarimetric measurements as part of routine retrievals owing to their high complexity and notable increase in effort required to acquire and interpret polarization data.In addition to remote-sensing observations, polarimetric characteristics of aerosol scattering have been measured in situ as well as in the laboratory using polar nephelometers. Such measurements constitute direct observations of single scattering with no contributions from multiple scattering effects and therefore provide unique data for the validation of aerosol optical models and retrieval concepts.This article overviews the above-mentioned polarimetric observations, their history and expected developments, and the state of resulting aerosol products. It also discusses the main achievements and challenges in the exploitation of polarimetry for the improved characterization of atmospheric aerosols. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predatory arthropods on billbug (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae) pests in turfgrass
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Generalist predators affect pest populations through direct consumption or by non-consumptive effects, whereby predators induce changes in prey behavior which represent a cost to prey. A diverse community of predatory arthropods has been described in turfgrass, contributing to the direct mortality of pests including black cutworm, fall armyworm, and Japanese beetle. Billbugs are a major pest of turfgrass in the Intermountain West, but the composition of the local predatory arthropod community and whether predators aid in billbug suppression through consumptive or non-consumptive effects is unknown. First, we catalogued the predatory arthropod community on Utah and Idaho golf courses using linear pitfall traps. Then, we assessed adult billbug consumption by resident predators in the field. Using a series of lab assays, we assessed the most abundant predators' consumption of billbug life stages, including adults, sentinel waxworm larvae at varied soil depths, and eggs in turf stems. Finally, we assessed the non-consumptive effects of these abundant predators on adult billbug activity (mating, oviposition, thanatosis). We found that the predatory arthropod community consisted primarily of carabids (Pterostichus melanarius, Harpalus sp., Amara aenea, and Anisodactylus sp.) and spiders (lycosids), representing 60% and 28% of all predators, respectively. In the field and in lab assays, adult billbug mortality from predation was generally low at < 6%. While predators readily consumed sentinel larvae in petri dish arenas, larvae escaped predation at 1 cm soil depth. The greatest consumptive effects of predators were on billbug eggs, with Anisodactlylus sp. feeding on 46% of eggs. Predator exposure reduced overall billbug activity by 56%, and for hunting billbugs, specifically, reduced mating activity by 28%. Our new understanding of the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on billbugs supports the importance of conservation biocontrol in turfgrass and assists in planning for enhancement of specific predators.

TI  - Proximal remote sensing of tree physiology at northern treeline: Do late-season changes in the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) respond to climate or photoperiod?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Relatively little is known of how the world's largest vegetation transition zone the Forest Tundra Ecotone (FTE) is responding to climate change. Newly available, satellite-derived time-series of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) across North America and Europe could provide new insights into the physiological response of evergreen trees to climate change by tracking changes in foliar pigment pools that have been linked to photosynthetic phenology. However, before implementing these data for such purpose at these evergreen dominated systems, it is important to increase our understanding of the fine scale mechanisms driving the connection between PRI and environmental conditions. The goal of this study is thus to gain a more mechanistic understanding of which environmental factors drive changes in PRI during late-season phenological transitions at the FTE including factors that are susceptible to climate change (i.e., air- and soil-temperatures), and those that are not (photoperiod). We hypothesized that late-season phenological changes in foliar pigment pools captured by PRI are largely driven by photoperiod as opposed to less predictable drivers such as air temperature, complicating the utility of PRI time-series for understanding climate change effects on the FTE. Ground-based, time series of PRI were acquired from individual trees in combination with meteorological variables and photoperiod information at six FTE sites in Alaska. A linear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to determine the significance (alpha = 0.001) and effect size (i.e., standardized slope b*) of environmental factors on late-seasonal changes in the PRI signal. Our results indicate that photoperiod had the strongest, significant effect on late season changes in PRI (b* = 0.08, p < 0.001), but environmental variables susceptible to climate change were also significant (i.e., daily mean solar radiation (b* = 0.03, p < 0.001) and daily mean soil temperature (b* = 0.02, p < 0.001)). These results suggest that interpreting PRI time-series of late-season phenological transitions may indeed facilitate our understanding of how northern treeline responds to climate change.

TI  - Estimation of Secondary Phytoplankton Pigments From Satellite Observations Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a method for estimating secondary phytoplankton pigments from satellite ocean color observations. We first compiled a large training data set composed of 12,000 samples; each sample is composed of 10 in situ phytoplankton high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-measured pigment concentrations, GlobColour products of chlorophyll-a concentration, and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs()) data at different wavelengths, in addition to advanced very high resolution radiometer sea surface temperature measurements. The resulting data set regroups a large variety of encountered situations between 1997 and 2014. The nonlinear relationship between the in situ and satellite components was identified using a self-organizing map, which is a neural network classifier. As a major result, the self-organizing map enabled reliable estimations of the concentration of chlorophyll-a and of nine different pigments from satellite observations. A cross-validation procedure showed that the estimations were robust for all pigments (R-2>0.75 and an average root-mean-square error=0.016mg/m(3)). A consistent association of several phytoplankton pigments indicating phytoplankton group specific dynamic was shown at a global scale. We also showed the uncertainties for the estimation of each pigment.Plain Language Summary The knowledge of phytoplankton variability is essential to the understanding of the marine ecosystem dynamics and its response to environmental changes. This paper presents a new approach to estimate phytoplankton pigment concentrations from satellite observations by using an artificial neural network, the so-called self-organizing map. This neural network was calibrated using a large data set of in situ pigment observations from oceanic cruises along with ocean color satellite data provided by the Globcolour project and advanced very high resolution radiometer sea surface temperature. This approach allows an accurate estimation of phytoplankton pigment concentrations and their related uncertainties. Moreover, the method allows to reproduce the spatio-temporal variability of pigment concentration and the dynamics of phytoplankton groups. A particular attention is given to the Southern Ocean whose phytoplankton communities are specific.

TI  - Piezoelectric thermo electromechanical energy harvester for reconnaissance satellite structure
T2  - MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Piezoelectric materials are widely used in aerospace industry as a source of alternate energy for micro or nanoscale electronics because of voltage dependent actuation ability. This phenomena is of absolute importance in cubic reconnaissance satellites as they have maximum number of piezoelectric patches integrated in structure. In this research work, PZT patches in the satellite structure absorbs the mechanical and thermal energy from external environment as well as from internal fluctuations and convert them into electrical energy. This electrical energy can be utilized on the spot or can be stored in batteries for wireless sensors. The experimental setup and electronic circuit is designed in order to mimic the real time conditions based on direct effect of piezoelectricity. The effect of energy generation with respect to fatigue mechanical loading condition is analyzed based on equivalent circuit method. A numerical simulation model based on commercial software ABAQUS Standard has been developed. The developed model has predicted the experimental outcome with less than 3% error. The analytical results are in good agreement with experimental as well as with numerical calculations with less than 5% error. The maximum output energy obtained in this study is 0.8nJ.

TI  - Land cover transition and fragmentation of River Ogba catchment in Benin City, Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined variation in the intensity of land cover transition and the pattern of habitat fragmentation of River Ogba catchment. Landsat images of 1988, 2002 and 2016 were classified into five categories: low density urban, high density urban, mixed vegetation, agriculture and dense forest using maximum likelihood classifier. Intensity analysis approach and landscape metrics were used to analyze the changes and fragmentation of the land cover. Number of patches, largest patch Index, area-weighted shape index and Euclidean nearest neighbour were computed. The results show that although mixed vegetation accounted for the largest land cover category in 1988 and 2002, low density urban dominated the study area in 2016. Intensity analysis of land cover change in the study area indicates a rising trend. The urban fringe is observed to be highly dynamic zone and this is primarily driven by changes in agriculture, low density urban and mixed vegetation. The implications of rapid land cover transition and fragmentation in River Ogba catchment, and especially in the urban fringe, include threat to biodiversity, food supply and deteriorating environmental conditions. This study provides necessary insights for developing sustainable strategies for urban landscape planning, administration and governance.

TI  - Imposex responses in <i>Thaisella chocolata</i> and <i>Xanthochorus buxeus</i> from Callao harbor, Peru
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Imposex responses were comparatively assessed in Thaisella chocolata and Xanthochorus buxeus, in sites previously studied regarding TBT contamination and under the influence of various levels of ship/boat activities in a coastal zone of Peru. In August 2015, at least 60 adult specimens of both T. chocolata and X. buxeus were simultaneously sampled by SCUBA diving in three subtidal sites. A total of 545 adult specimens of T. chocolata and X. buxeus were analyzed in the present study. Imposex incidence (I%) was detected in the two muricid species in the sampled site closest of Callao harbor - P1 (T. chocolata and X. buxeus = 100%) and also in the P2 (T. chocolata = 100% and X. buxeus = 81%). On the other hand, as expected, no sign of imposex was observed in organisms obtained from P3. Thaisella chocolata is likely to be the most sensitive species to imposex development, followed by X. buxeus. Thus, T. chocolata is the most suitable species to be used as a sentinel of TBT contamination due to its high sensitivity and better discrimination of levels among different sites.

TI  - The worsening impacts of land reclamation assessed with Sentinel-1: The Rize (Turkey) test case
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive amounts of land are being reclaimed to build airports, new cities, ports, and highways. Hundreds of kilometers are added each year, as coastlines are extended further out to the sea. In this paper, this urbanization approach is monitored by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique with Sentinel-1 SAR data. The study aims to explore this technology in order to support local authorities to detect and evaluate subtle terrain displacements. For this purpose, a large 3-years Sentinel-1 stack composed by 92 images acquired between 07/01/2015 to 27/01/2018 is employed and stacking techniques are chosen to assess ground motion. The test site of this study, Rize, Turkey, has been declared at high risk of collapse and radical solutions such as the relocation of the entire city in another area are been taken into consideration. A media fact-checking approach, i.e. evaluating national and international press releases on the test site, is considered for the paper and this work presents many findings in different areas of the city. For instance, alerts are confirmed by inspecting several buildings reported by the press. Critical infrastructures are monitored as well. Portions of the harbor show high displacement rates, up to 1 cm/year, proving reported warnings. Rural villages belonging to the same municipality are also investigated and a mountainous village affected by landslide is considered in the study. Sentinel-1 is demonstrated to be a suitable system to detect and monitor small changes or buildings and infrastructures for these scenarios. These changes may be highly indicative of imminent damage which can lead to the loss of the structural integrity and subsequent failure of the structure in the long-term. In Rize, only a few known motion-criticalstructures are monitored daily with in-situ technologies. SAR interferometry can assist to save expensive inspection and monitoring services, especially in highly critical cases such as the one studied in this paper.

TI  - Heavy metals in organs of stray dogs and cats from the city of Naples and its surroundings (Southern Italy)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the concentrations of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in the liver and kidney from stray dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) found dead between 2014 and 2017 in the city of Naples and its surrounding areas. These organs from 290 dogs and 88 cats were collected after ordinary necropsy of stray animals. Heavy metal concentrations were determined by using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Concentrations of Pb (up to 5.93mg/kg) and Cd (ranging from 0.005 to 6.13mg/kg) were detected in both livers and kidneys analyzed. Differences in concentration were found based on age class, gender, and kind of tissue for both elements, with a trend similar to those already reported in the literature for comparable studies from different countries. Cadmium levels in the kidney were significantly higher (p<0.05) in females than those in males for both species. As regards to Pb, the highest concentrations were detected in the liver (3.45mg/kg in dog and 5.93 in cat, respectively) followed by the renal tissue, with no significant difference depending on the animal gender. This study can be considered the first one in Italy regarding stray dogs and cats as bio-indicators of environmental contamination due to lead and cadmium, suggesting that pets could be sentinel animals to evaluate human exposure to these heavy metals.

TI  - Open fires in Greenland in summer 2017: transport, deposition and radiative effects of BC, OC and BrC emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly unusual open fires burned in western Greenland between 31 July and 21 August 2017, after a period of warm, dry and sunny weather. The fires burned on peatlands that became vulnerable to fires by permafrost thawing. We used several satellite data sets to estimate that the total area burned was about 2345 ha. Based on assumptions of typical burn depths and emission factors for peat fires, we estimate that the fires consumed a fuel amount of about 117 ktC and emitted about 23.5 t of black carbon (BC) and 731 t of organic carbon (OC), including 141 t of brown carbon (BrC). We used a Lagrangian particle dispersion model to simulate the atmospheric transport and deposition of these species. We find that the smoke plumes were often pushed towards the Greenland ice sheet by westerly winds, and thus a large fraction of the emissions (30 %) was deposited on snow- or ice-covered surfaces. The calculated deposition was small compared to the deposition from global sources, but not entirely negligible. Analysis of aerosol optical depth data from three sites in western Greenland in August 2017 showed strong influence of forest fire plumes from Canada, but little impact of the Greenland fires. Nevertheless, CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) lidar data showed that our model captured the presence and structure of the plume from the Greenland fires. The albedo changes and instantaneous surface radiative forcing in Greenland due to the fire emissions were estimated with the SNICAR model and the uvspec model from the libRadtran radiative transfer software package. We estimate that the maximum albedo change due to the BC and BrC deposition was about 0.007, too small to be measured. The average instantaneous surface radiative forcing over Greenland at noon on 31 August was 0.03-0.04 W m(-2), with locally occurring maxima of 0.63-0.77 W m(-2) (depending on the studied scenario). The average value is up to an order of magnitude smaller than the radiative forcing from other sources. Overall, the fires burning in Greenland in the summer of 2017 had little impact on the Greenland ice sheet, causing a small extra radiative forcing. This was due to the - in a global context - still rather small size of the fires. However, the very large fraction of the emissions deposited on the Greenland ice sheet from these fires could contribute to accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet if these fires become several orders of magnitude larger under future climate.

TI  - Geospatial modeling of land cover change in the Choco-Darien global ecoregion of South America; One of most biodiverse and rainy areas in the world
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical rain forests of northwest South America fall within the Choco-Darien Global Ecoregion (CGE). The CGE is one of 25 global biodiversity hotspots prioritized for conservation due to its high biodiversity and endemism as well as threats due to deforestation. The analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change within the CGE using remotely sensed imagery is challenging because this area is considered to be one of the rainiest places on the planet (hence high frequency of cloud cover). Furthermore, the availability of high-resolution remotely sensed data is low for developing countries before 2015. Using the Random Forest ensemble learning classification tree system, we developed annual LULC maps in the CGE from 2002 to 2015 using a time series of cloud-free MODIS vegetation index products. The MODIS imagery was processed through a Gaussian weighted filter to further correct for cloud pollution and matched to visual interpretations of land cover and land use from available high spatial resolution imagery (WorldView-2, Quick Bird, Ikonos and GeoEye-1). Validation of LULC maps resulted in a Kappa of 0.87 (Sd = 0.008). We detected a gradual replacement of forested areas with agriculture (mainly grassland planted to support livestock grazing), and secondary vegetation (agriculture reverting to forest) across the CGE. Forest loss was higher between 2010-2015 when compared to 2002-2010. LULC change trends, deforestation drivers, and reforestation transitions varied according to administrative organization (countries: Panamanian CGE, Colombian CGE, and Ecuadorian CGE).

TI  - Assessment of modern recharge to arid region aquifers using an integrated geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The arid and semi-arid regions of the world are facing limited freshwater resources, minimal amounts of rainfall, and increasing population pressure and water demands. These resources, often groundwater, are vulnerable to both natural variability and anthropogenic interventions. Here, we develop and apply an integrated approach using geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing observations to quantify the recharge rates of arid region aquifers that are witnessing rapid groundwater depletion. Focusing on the Saq aquifer system in the Arabian Peninsula, our study was three-fold: (1) to examine the areal extent of aquifer recharge domains using geologic, climatic, and remote sensing data; (2) to investigate the origin of, and modem contributions to, the aquifer system by examining the isotopic composition of groundwater samples; and (3) to estimate the magnitude of modem recharge to the aquifer utilizing estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and a continuous rainfall-runoff model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Isotopic examination of the groundwater from Saq revealed that deeper aquifers (fossil water) are more depleted compared to shallow reserves (alluvial aquifer; mixed waters). Analysis of GRACE-derived terrestrial and groundwater storage estimates indicates that the aquifer system received an annual recharge rate of 5.21 +/- 0.10 Km(3)/yr (11.85 +/- 0.22 mm/yr), equal to about half of the withdrawal rate from wells during the investigation period (2002-2016). Analysis of SWAT results indicates that, from 1998 to 2014, the investigated watersheds received an average annual precipitation of 19.20 km(3), of which approximately 51% is partitioned as potential recharge. The temporal variations in storage, depletion and recharge are related to the changes in regional groundwater extraction, rainfall, and extent of irrigated areas.

TI  - A Novel Joint Change Detection Approach Based on Weight-Clustering Sparse Autoencoders
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of earth observation technology, the number of available remote sensing data has soared dramatically. It becomes a significant problem that how to use remote sensing images and how to improve the accuracy of change detection effectively. In this paper, a novel approach for change detection using weight-clustering sparse autoencoders (WCSAE) combined object-oriented classification with difference images (DIs) is proposed. First, bi-phase images are segmented as patches through the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. Afterward, the average and variance of superpixels are stacked as the input of WCSAE. To reduce the redundant information of extracted features, similar weights in the hidden layer of WCSAE are clustered layer-wise under termination conditions by using the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. For the improvement of the classification accuracy, L1/2 regularization is introduced in the objective function to extract more sparse features and avoid over-fitting. Next, the post-classification change detection map is obtained by means of comparing with classification results of two phase images. Then, by using the change vector analysis technology, the difference map is yielded and also classified under WCSAE to acquire the DI classification map. Finally, the joint probability judgment is implemented on the joint scopes to determine changed and unchanged areas. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified in accordance with the experimental results on standard datasets and actual remote sensing images.

TI  - Estimating earthquake-damage areas using Landsat-8 OLI surface reflectance data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To identify earthquake-damage areas after an earthquake occurs, a method based on Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) surface reflectance (SR) products is proposed. The SR pixels with the influences of clouds, cloud shadows, heavy aerosols, or instrument saturation are eliminated. Then, the mean and standard deviation (STD) images of SR products for two years before an earthquake are acquired; the mean images of the first three post-earthquake images are also obtained. The differences between post- and pre-earthquake mean SR images are taken to reflect the effects of the earthquake on SR. As we focus mainly on the impact of earthquakes on populated areas such as cities or villages, the pixels with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day and night band annual average nighttime light products greater than 0 or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover type data labeled 'urban and built-up' are taken as the study area for this work. Next, the areas with post- and pre-earthquake SR mean image differences greater than 0.1 and greater than 2 times the local STD are taken to represent earthquake-damaged areas. Finally, this method is applied to the 2015 Nepal moment magnitude (Mw) 7.8 earthquake. Compared with the actual damage data provided by the Nepal Earthquake 2015: Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Information Platform (NDRRIP), the results show that the coefficient of determination between NDRRIP fully damaged buildings and Landsat-8 OLI SR data estimated damage pixels is 0.80 for the 69 Nepal districts not heavily influenced by snows.

TI  - Strategy and dialectics: Rejuvenating a long-standing relationship
T2  - STRATEGIC ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay broadens the conversation on the state of organizational contradictions and paradox research by turning to dialectics-a time-honored, living perspective on social processes and relations, which continues to influence our understanding of the past, present, and future. Dialectics distinctive relational process worldview sets it apart from approaches stressing equilibrium, linearity, and coherence, making it highly relevant to a world in flux. I propose that dialectics is already present in strategy research and in contemporary business, and can become even more central to strategy, addressing core questions in the field and propelling it in new directions. Strategy scholars can draw on dialectics principles as a generative tool kit to construct new theories and managerial tools. Dialectics can also be used as a theoretical lens to understand emerging empirical phenomena such as the rapid advent of artificial intelligence. Finally, dialectics critical stance and philosophical grounding makes it a particularly attractive perspective for challenging existing theoretical models and for considering alternatives.

TI  - Mapping spatial-temporal sediment dynamics of river-floodplains in the Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water composition in floodplains plays a key role in ecological processes and is affected by both local water sources and flooding from the main river. Despite local studies, still lacks a complete understanding on the relationship between hydrological processes and sediment distribution in the river-floodplain system of the Amazon basin. This paper presents the first mapping of the dynamics of suspended sediments in rivers and lakes (> 0.25 km(2)) of central Amazon, considering different water types. Previous studies have considered only white water rivers with high sediment concentration. This study also describes some river-lake systems in terms of their spatial-temporal pattern of sediments and water flows. Time series between 2003 and 2017 of red and infrared reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were temporally filtered to retrieve incomplete and low-quality data. These images were assessed as a proxy of the surface suspended sediments concentration; and maps of the spatial-temporal variation of sediments were created, such as the class frequency map. This map represents a 15-year frequency at which each pixel remains in one of the surface suspended sediments concentration classes: high, moderate, and low, with an overall accuracy of 71%. Our findings allowed to observe the variation of sediment concentration along the Solimoes-Amazonas River, such as, for instance, its increase from the confluence with the Tapajos River to the mouth. Some hydrological processes were also observed in lakes of the middle reach, such as overbank flow and resuspension of sediments in depression lakes. In some ria lakes, the main water source comes from local basin with the backwater promoting sediment input in these lakes during the low-water period. The maps produced by this study are available and useful for supporting biogeochemical studies.

TI  - Monitoring LULC changes and its impact on the LST and NDVI in District 1 of Shiraz City
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, immediate and long-term change detection and monitoring using remote sensing (RS) data and geographical information system (GIS) is of paramount importance in generating information about the latest land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in accordance with spatial and temporal changes. Therefore, to obtain these components, a multi-temporal dataset was used consisting of two sets of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1986 to 2011 period across District 1 of Shiraz. Additionally, to investigate the relationship between LST and NDVI over seasons, four Landsat images were used. LULC, LST, and NDVI components were retrieved using Landsat image in ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2 image processing software. Results showed that during the study period, the city had experienced a massive urban (residential) growth. Moreover, change detection suggested that residential areas had increased by 13.17 km(2) and vegetation zones (garden) and barren lands had decreased by 4.6 and 8.63 km(2), respectively, during 1985-2011 period. The study of the relationship between vegetation index (land cover) and vegetation (land use) in District 1 showed that with reduced vegetation zone (land use), the quality of vegetation (land cover) had deteriorated. These findings indicate that reduced quality of vegetation cover and consequently its Reduction can have a positive effect on the temperature patterns. In general, the negative correlation between vegetation and LST caused by lower vegetation quality was less significant in 2011 compared to 1986, while there the correlation between vegetation and LST in summer was higher than other seasons.

TI  - Patterns and Controls of Light Use Efficiency in Four Contrasting Forest Ecosystems in Yunnan, Southwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem light use efficiency (LUE) is a critical parameter in estimating CO2 uptake by vegetation from climatological and satellite data. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and biophysical regulations of ecosystem-level LUE are not well understood, resulting in large uncertainties in the estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) using LUE-based models. In this study, we used eddy covariance to explore spatiotemporal variations and controls of LUE in four contrasting forest ecosystems (savanna, tropical rainforest, subtropical evergreen forest, and subalpine coniferous forest). Based on 27 site years of data, we found that (1) the multiyear mean LUE was 0.063, 0.251, 0.247, and 0.140g C mol photon(-1) in the four contrasting ecosystems, respectively; (2) the LUE in the wet season (May-October) was higher than that in the dry season in all studied ecosystems; (3) the leaf area index controlled GPP and LUE significantly and explained 74%, 29%, 54%, and 36% of the variation in GPP and 51%, 19%, 41%, and 54% of the variation in LUE in the four contrasting ecosystems, respectively; (4) path analysis revealed the critical roles of GPP and vapor pressure deficit in controlling LUE in these four forest ecosystems; and (5) under warming scenarios, LUE may decrease in savanna but increase in the other three ecosystems, while decreasing precipitation (P) may reduce LUE in the ecosystems studied. This study improves our understanding of the influence of biophysical factors on LUE and demonstrates how LUE changes with variations in temperature, soil moisture, and leaf area index, thereby improving estimations of large-scale carbon exchange/cycling.

TI  - Monitoring and understanding the water transparency changes of fifty large lakes on the Yangtze Plain based on long-term MODIS observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Various aspects of the water qualities of the large lakes in the Yangtze Plain (YP) have been studied, while the efforts have been spent on one of the most important parameters-water transparency were only limited to several large lakes. Using in situ remote sensing reflectance and Secchi-disk depth (Z(sd)) datasets, we assessed the performance of a semi-analytical model recently proposed by Lee et al. (2015) for remote sensing of the Z(sd) (Z(sd), (Lee)). The results show that a linear scaling correction over Z(sd), (Lee) (Z(sd)', (Lee)) could lead to improved agreement between remote sensing estimates and field measurements (root mean square error < 35%) in the study region. The Z(sd)'(,) (Lee) scheme was then applied to MODIS/Aqua observations between 2003 and 2016 to obtain the spatial and temporal dynamics of water transparency in 50 large lakes in the YP. The long-term mean Z(sd) of the entire region was 0.39 +/- 1.17 m during the observation period, with high and low values occurring in warm and cold seasons, respectively. Of the 50 examined lakes, half demonstrated decreasing or increasing Z(sd) trends, and the number of lakes exhibiting significantly decreasing trends also comparable to the number exhibiting increasing trends. The relative contributions of the seven potential driving factors (from both human activities and natural processes) to the interannual changes in water clarity were quantified for each lake using a multiple general linear model regression analysis. The responses of Z(sd) to these drivers showed considerable differences among lakes, and human activities demonstrated significant roles in more lakes than those affected by natural variability, accounting for 50% (25/50) and 20% (10/50) of the lakes, respectively. This study provides the first comprehensive basin-scale estimate of the water transparency in the lakes in the YP, and the Z(sd) results and analysis of driving forces can provide important information for local water quality conservation and restoration.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change of Sparse Vegetation Coverage in Northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation coverage is an important biophysical parameter of terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, MODIS data were used to estimate sparse vegetation coverage using an improved dimidiate pixel model in northern China. Specifically, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) products acquired from MOD09A1 and MOD15A2 were selected to acquire the sparse vegetation coverage in northern China. When 1<LAI<3, the no-dense model was used and dense model was used under other conditions. The sparse vegetation coverage results from 2001 to 2015 were used to analyze the spatiotemporal change in this area. In this region, vegetation degradation, vegetation non-alteration and vegetation restoration cover 19.18%, 37.91% and 42.91%, respectively. In recent 5years, vegetation situation is deteriorated, especially in local area. Although vegetation situation is improved on a long time and large scale, we should pay much attention to vegetation degradation in recent years and local areas.

TI  - PS-InSAR Analysis of Sentinel-1 Data for Detecting Ground Motion in Temperate Oceanic Climate Zones: A Case Study in the Republic of Ireland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regions of temperate oceanic climate have historically represented a challenge for the application of satellite-based multi-temporal SAR interferometry. The landscapes of such regions are commonly characterized by extensive, seasonally-variable vegetation coverage that can cause low temporal coherence and limit the detection capabilities of SAR imagery as acquired, for instance, by previous ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT missions. In this work, we exploited the enhanced resolution in space and time of the recently deployed Sentinel-1A/B SAR satellites to detect and monitor ground motions occurring in two study areas in the Republic of Ireland. The first, is a similar to 1800 km(2) area spanning the upland karst of the Clare Burren and the adjacent mantled lowland karst of east Galway. The second, is an area of 100 km(2) in Co. Meath spanning an active mine site. The available datasets, consisting of more than 100 images acquired in both ascending and descending orbits from April 2015 to March 2018, were processed by using the Permanent Scatterer approach. The obtained results highlight the presence of small-scale ground motions in both urban and natural environments with displacement rates along the satellite line of sight up to -17 mm/year. Localized subsidence was detected in recently built areas, along the infrastructure (both roads and railways), and over the mine site, while zones of subsidence, uplift, or both, have been recorded in a number of peatland areas. Furthermore, several measured target points indicate the presence of unstable areas along the coastline. Many of the detected movements were previously unknown. These results demonstrate the feasibility of adopting multi-temporal interferometry based on Sentinel-1 data for the detection and monitoring of mm-scale ground movements even over small areas (<100 m(2)) in environments influenced by temperate oceanic climate.

TI  - Comparison of Contemporary In Situ, Model, and Satellite Remote Sensing Soil Moisture With a Focus on Drought Monitoring
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key drought indicator; however, current in situ soil moisture infrastructure is inadequate for large-scale drought monitoring. One initiative of the ongoing National Soil Moisture Network program is the development of a near real-time drought monitoring product that integrates in situ, model, and satellite remote sensing data. Data integration from diverse sources requires large-scale validation prior to integration. This study develops a framework for assessing the fidelity of in situ, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets. Here we evaluate data from over 100 in situ monitoring stations that are part of nine monitoring networks; North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Climate Prediction Center land surface models; and Soil Moisture Active-Passive, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) satellite products. The results indicate the majority of in situ stations exhibit low error variance and are spatially representative; however, some networks and individual stations exhibit anomalously high error variance or are sited in a way that make them not spatially representative of a larger area. Overall, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 is the modeled product that consistently performed best, and Soil Moisture Active-Passive L3 is the remotely sensed product that consistently performed the best. They were able to both capture in situ soil moisture variability and provide an accurate depiction of drought conditions. The methods and verification framework applied in this study can be used to evaluate any soil moisture data set in any region of the world.Plain Language Summary Soil moisture is an important indicator of drought; however, there are very few monitoring stations that directly measure soil moisture across the contiguous United States. High-quality model and/or satellite remote sensing soil moisture estimates can help fill in the gaps of in-ground soil moisture measurements. However, integration of soil moisture data from diverse sources requires assessment of data quality. This study applies a series of methods for evaluating the integrity of in-ground, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets across the United States. The results indicate that the majority of in-ground sensors tested exhibit high data quality, although some exhibit high measurement error and/or low spatial representativeness. The results also indicate that the land surface models that are part of the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and the Soil Moisture Active-Passive remotely sensed soil moisture products best match in-ground soil moisture measurement variability. Additionally, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Soil Moisture Active-Passive data sets accurately depict drought occurrence. The methods applied here can be used to evaluate the quality of soil moisture data sets in any region of the world.

TI  - An iterative PS-InSAR method for the analysis of large spatio-temporal baseline data stacks for land subsidence estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - South-west of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, is subjected to a high deformation rate due to excessive groundwater extractions. Persistent Scatterrer SAR Interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique is used to monitor Tehran's deformation. Three time series data including two Sentinel-1A (S-1A) spanning from 2014 to 2017, and an ENVISAT-ASAR data stack spanning from 2004 to 2010, are analyzed. The PS-InSAR technique does not perform well on ENVISAT-ASAR due to poor selection of PS points induced by large perpendicular baselines and strong temporal decorrelation of the dataset. In this paper, a novel Iterative PSI method (IPSI) is proposed to increase the PS points which are lost in PS-InSAR technique because of the unsuccessful derivation of the absolute phase value due to an integer ambiguity. The method selects PS points based on simultaneous analysis of their amplitude and phase. Results demonstrate that the density of PSs has been increased by about 4.5 times. Line of Sight (LOS) velocities obtained from both S-1A and ENVISAT-ASAR data analysis are highly compatible with each other, indicating the reliability of the both applied methods. The maximum cumulative displacements are estimated as 39.6 cm and 88.4 cm for Sentinel-1A and ENVISAT-ASAR datasets respectively. Moreover, the subsidence area has grown in the period between the data acquisition time. The methods are successfully validated by subsidence rates obtained from precise leveling and GPS observations.

TI  - A Global MODIS Water Vapor Database for the Operational Atmospheric Correction of Historic and Recent Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis Ready Data (ARD) have undergone the most relevant pre-processing steps to satisfy most user demands. The freely available software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring) is capable of generating Landsat ARD. An essential step of generating ARD is atmospheric correction, which requires water vapor data. FORCE relies on a water vapor database obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, two major drawbacks arise from this strategy: (1) The database has to be compiled for each study area prior to generating ARD; and (2) MODIS and Landsat commissioning dates are not well aligned. We have therefore compiled an application-ready global water vapor database to significantly increase the operational readiness of ARD production. The free dataset comprises daily water vapor data for February 2000 to July 2018 as well as a monthly climatology that is used if no daily value is available. We systematically assessed the impact of using this climatology on surface reflectance outputs. A global random sample of Landsat 5/7/8 imagery was processed twice (i) using daily water vapor (reference) and (ii) using the climatology (estimate), followed by computing accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (APU) metrics. All APU measures were well below specification, thus the fallback usage of the climatology is generally a sound strategy. Still, the tests revealed that some considerations need to be taken into account to help quantify which sensor, band, climate, and season are most or least affected by using a fallback climatology. The highest uncertainty and bias is found for Landsat 5, with progressive improvements towards newer sensors. The bias increases from dry to humid climates, whereas uncertainty increases from dry and tropic to temperate climates. Uncertainty is smallest during seasons with low variability, and is highest when atmospheric conditions progress from a dry to a wet season (and vice versa).

TI  - The spatio-temporal variability of groundwater storage in the Amazon River Basin
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In large Tropical River basins such as the Amazon, groundwater plays a major role in the water and ecological cycles with large influences on the rainforest ecosystems and climate variability. However, due to the lack of monitoring networks, Amazon groundwater storage and its variability remain poorly known. Here, we provide an unprecedented direct estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of the anomaly of groundwater storage over the period January 2003 -September 2010 in the Amazon Basin by decomposing the total terrestrial water storage measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission into the individual contributions of other hydrological reservoirs, using multi-satellite data for the surface waters and floodplains and models outputs for the soil moisture. We show that the seasonal variations of groundwater storage represent between 20 and 35% of the terrestrial water storage seasonal volume variations of the Amazon. Larger seasonal amplitudes of groundwater storage (>450 mm) are found in the Alter do Chao and Ica aquifers in the central part of the Amazon Basin. Anomalies of groundwater storage exhibit a strong interannual variability (STD reaching 120 mm along the central corridor) during the study period in response to hydrologic variability and climatic events such as the extreme drought that occurred in 2005.

TI  - Large Scale Palm Tree Detection in High Resolution Satellite Images Using U-Net
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil and coconut palm trees are important crops in many tropical countries, which are either planted as plantations or scattered in the landscape. Monitoring in terms of counting provides useful information for various stakeholders. Most of the existing monitoring methods are based on spectral profiles or simple neural networks and either fall short in terms of accuracy or speed. We use a neural network of the U-Net type in order to detect oil and coconut palms on very high resolution satellite images. The method is applied to two different study areas: (1) large monoculture oil palm plantations in Jambi, Indonesia, and (2) coconut palms in the Bengaluru Metropolitan Region in India. The results show that the proposed method reaches a performance comparable to state of the art approaches, while being about one order of magnitude faster. We reach a maximum throughput of 235 ha/s with a spatial image resolution of 40 cm. The proposed method proves to be reliable even under difficult conditions, such as shadows or urban areas, and can easily be transferred from one region to another. The method detected palms with accuracies between 89% and 92%.

TI  - Improvement of 3D Power Line Extraction from Multiple Low-Cost UAV Imagery Using Wavelet Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) mapping of power lines is very important for power line inspection. Many remotely-sensed data products like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have been already studied for power line surveys. More and more data are being obtained via photogrammetric measurements. This increases the need for the implementation of advanced processing techniques. In recent years, there have been several developments in visualisation techniques using UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) platform photography. The most modern of such imaging systems have the ability to generate dense point clouds. However, image-based point cloud accuracy is very often various (unstable) and dependent on the radiometric quality of images and the efficiency of image processing algorithms. The main factor influencing the point cloud quality is noise. Such problems usually arise with data obtained via low-cost UAV platforms. Therefore, generated point clouds representing power lines are usually incomplete and noisy. To obtain a complete and accurate 3D model of power lines and towers, it is necessary to develop improved data processing algorithms. The experiment tested the algorithms on power lines with different voltages. This paper presents the wavelet-based method of processing data acquired with a low-cost UAV camera. The proposed, original method involves the application of algorithms for coarse filtration and precise filtering. In addition, a new way of calculating the recommended flight height was proposed. At the end, the accuracy assessment of this two-stage filtration process was examined. For this, point quality indices were proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the quality of low-cost point clouds. The proposed methods improve the accuracy of determining the parameters of the lines by more than twice. About 10% of noise is reduced by using the wavelet-based approach.

TI  - Resolving Three-Dimensional Surface Motion with InSAR: Constraints from Multi-Geometry Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has been widely applied to measure Earth surface motions related to natural and anthropogenic crustal deformation phenomena. With the widespread uptake of data captured by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 mission and other recently launched or planned space-borne SAR missions, the usage of the InSAR technique to detect and monitor Earth surface displacements will increase even more in the coming years. However, InSAR can only measure a one-dimensional motion along the radar line of sight (LOS), which makes interpretation and communication of InSAR measurements challenging, and can add ambiguity to the modelling process. Within this paper, we investigate the implications of the InSAR LOS geometry using simulated and observed deformation phenomena and describe a methodology for multi-geometry data fusion of LOS InSAR measurements from many viewing geometries. We find that projecting LOS measurements to the vertical direction using the incidence angle of the satellite sensor (and implicitly assuming no horizontal motions are present) may result in large errors depending on the magnitude of horizontal motion and on the steepness of the incidence angle. We quantify these errors as the maximum expected error from simulated LOS observations based on a Mogi deformation model. However, we recommend to use LOS observations from several image geometries wherever data are available, in order to solve for vertical and E-W oriented horizontal motion. For an anthropogenic deformation phenomenon observed in seven independent InSAR analyses of Envisat SAR data from the Sydney region, Australia, we find that the strong horizontal motion present could lead to misinterpretation of the actual motion direction when projecting LOS measurements to vertical (uplift instead of subsidence). In this example, the difference between multi-geometry data fusion and vertical projection of LOS measurements (at an incidence angle of 33.8 degrees) reach up to 67% of the maximum vertical displacement rate. Furthermore, the position of maximum vertical motion is displaced horizontally by several hundred metres when the LOS measurements are projected.

TI  - Evaluating Digital Cultural Heritage 'In the Wild': The Case For Reflexivity
T2  - ACM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital heritage interpretation is often untethered from traditional museological techniques and environments. As museums and heritage sites explore the potential of locative technologies and ever more sophisticated content-triggering mechanisms for use outdoors, the kinds of questions that digital heritage researchers are able to explore have become increasingly more complex. Researchers now find themselves in the realm of the immersive, the experiential, and the performative. Working closely with their research participants, they navigate ambiguous terrain, including the often unpredictable affective resonances that are the direct consequences of interaction.This article creates a dialogue between two case studies which, taken together, help to unpack some key methodological and ethical questions emerging from these developments. First, we introduce With New Eyes I See, an itinerant and immersive digital heritage encounter which collapsed boundaries between physical/digital, fact/fiction and past/present. Second, we detail Rock Art on Mobile Phones, a set of dialogic web apps that aimed to explore the potential of mobile devices in delivering heritage interpretation in the rural outdoors.Looking outward from these case studies, we reflect on how traditional evaluation frameworks are being stretched and strained given the kinds of questions that digital heritage researchers are now exploring. Drawing on vignettes from experience-oriented qualitative studies with participants, we articulate specific common evaluative challenges related to the embodied, multimodal, and transmedial nature of the digital heritage experiences under investigation. In doing so, we make the case for reflexivity as a central and more collaborative feature of research design within this field going forward - paying attention to and advocating the reciprocal relationship between researchers and the heritage experiences that we study.

TI  - Evolution of the gravel-bedded anastomosing river within the Qihama reach of the First Great Bend of the Yellow River
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The anastomosing river that is present within the First Great Bend of the Yellow River is different from other sand-bedded rivers of this type because it contains gravel-bedded materials. It is therefore important to determine whether, or not, the specific characteristics of this anastomosing river are similar to those seen in sand-bedded forms, including the characteristics of erosion and deposition, and the stability of channel and interchannel wetlands. Four Landsat images from 1990, 2001, 2013, and 2016 alongside two Google Earth (GE) images from 2011 and 2013 were utilized in this study in tandem with field sampling and observations to select a 12 km main channel length section of the Qihama reach anastomosing river. This section was then used to determine variations in channel planform and sedimentary characteristics over a 26 year period. The results of this study show that this gravel-bedded anastomosing river has exhibited a high degree of stability overall, and that there has been no obvious channel and wetland bank erosion and deposition. Data also show that over the 26 years of this study, anastomosing belt area increased by 2.43%, while the ratio of land to water area remained almost equal. The number of wetlands has also increased along this river section at a rate as high as 62.16% because of the fragmentation of some small interchannel examples, while the talweg has alternately migrated to either the left or right over long periods of time at a relatively stable rate. Indeed, as a result of the migration of this line, there has been significant turnover in the number of islands within the main channel while bank shift has occurred at a rate of about 5 m/yr. The numerous anastomosing channels within this river section remained very stable over the course of this study, characterized by a mean annual migration rate of just 1 m/yr, while the sediments in bank columnar sections are mainly composed of fine sands or silts with a relatively high clay content. The sediment grain-size distribution curve for this river section contains multiple peaks, distinct from the muddy sediments within bank columnar sections from sand-bedded anastomosing rivers. The dense vegetation within riparian and interchannel wetlands alongside this river reach has also protected anastomosing channels from erosion and maintained their stability, a key feature of this gravel-bedded system.

TI  - Incorporating Negative Sample Training for Ship Detection Based on Deep Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - While ship detection using high-resolution optical satellite images plays an important role in various civilian fields-including maritime traffic survey and maritime rescue-it is a difficult task due to influences of the complex background, especially when ships are near to land. In current literatures, land masking is generally required before ship detection to avoid many false alarms on land. However, sea-land segmentation not only has the risk of segmentation errors, but also requires expertise to adjust parameters. In this study, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is applied to detect ships without the need for land masking. We propose an effective training strategy for the Faster R-CNN by incorporating a large number of images containing only terrestrial regions as negative samples without any manual marking, which is different from the selection of negative samples by targeted way in other detection methods. The experiments using Gaofen-1 satellite (GF-1), Gaofen-2 satellite (GF-2), and Jilin-1 satellite (JL-1) images as testing datasets under different ship detection conditions were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in the avoidance of false alarms on land. The results show that the method incorporating negative sample training can largely reduce false alarms in terrestrial areas, and is superior in detection performance, algorithm complexity, and time consumption. Compared with the method based on sea-land segmentation, the proposed method achieves the absolute increment of 70% of the F1-measure, when the image contains large land area such as the GF-1 image, and achieves the absolute increment of 42.5% for images with complex harbors and many coastal ships, such as the JL-1 images.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Small Papillary Thyroid Cancer A Meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to compare reported results on available techniques for sentinel lymph node detection rate (SDR) in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Methods The MEDLINE database was searched via a PubMed interface to identify original articles regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) in thyroid cancer. Studies were stratified according to the sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection technique: vital-dye (VD), Tc-99m-nanocolloid planar lymphoscintigraphy with the use of intraoperative hand-held gamma probes (LS), both Tc-99m-nanocolloid planar lymphoscintigraphy with intraoperative use of hand-held gamma probe and VD (LS + VD), Tc-99m-nanocolloid planar lymphoscintigraphy with the additional contribution of preoperative SPECT/CT, and intraoperative use of hand-held gamma probe (LS-SPECT/CT). Pooled SDR values were presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each SLN detection techniques. A Z-test was used to compare pooled SDR estimates. False-negative rates were summarized for each method. Results Forty-five studies were included. Overall SDRs for the VD, LS, LS + VD, and LS-SPECT/CT techniques were 83% (95% CI, 77%-88%; I-2 = 78%), 96% (95% CI, 90%-98%; I-2 = 68%), 87% (95% CI, 65%-96%; I-2 = 75%), and 93% (95% CI, 86%-97%; I-2 = 0%), respectively. False-negative rates were 0% to 38%, 0% to 40%, 0% to 17%, and 7% to 8%, respectively. Conclusions In patients with PTC, Tc-99m-nanocolloids offer a higher SDR than that of the VD technique. The addition of SPECT/CT improved identification of metastatic SLNs outside the central neck compartment.

TI  - Study of Temperature Heterogeneities at Sub-Kilometric Scales and Influence on Surface-Atmosphere Energy Interactions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from remote sensing techniques has been studied and validated during the past 40 years, leading to important improvements. Accurate LST values are currently obtained through measurements using medium resolution thermal infrared (TIR) sensors. However, the most recent review reports demonstrated that the future TIR LST products need to obtain reliable temperature values at a high spatial resolution (100 m or higher) to study temperature variations between different elements in a heterogeneous kilometric area. The launch of high-resolution TIR sensors in the near future requires studies of the temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneities of the elements in a mixed region. The present study analyzes the LST in a sub-kilometric highly heterogeneous area, combining the use of LST products from high-resolution TIR orbiting sensors with the LST maps created from a TIR camera onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The aim is to estimate the LST variability in a heterogeneous area containing different surfaces (roads, buildings, and grass), observed from different TIR sensors at different spatial resolutions, covering from the meter to the kilometer scales. Several results showed that variations in the LST up to 18 degrees C were identified with the UAV-TIR camera, and significant differences were also present in the LST products obtained from simultaneous overpasses of high-resolution satellite TIR sensors. A second objective of the study, due to the availability of the high-resolution LST fields, was to explore the thermal advection between different elements and determine if it correlates with the surface energy budget in the same area, thus indicating that this process is of importance for heterogeneous terrains at these scales. This paper also highlights the relevance of the UAV-TIR camera flight for future studies since it is not commonly used in TIR remote sensing but has substantial potential advantages.

TI  - Mapping upland peat depth using airborne radiometric and lidar survey data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - A method to estimate peat depth and extent is vital for accurate estimation of carbon stocks and to facilitate appropriate peatland management. Current methods for direct measurement (e.g. ground penetrating radar, probing) are labour intensive making them unfeasible for capturing spatial information at landscape extents. Attempts to model peat depths using remotely sensed data such as elevation and slope have shown promise but assume a functional relationship between current conditions and gradually accrued peat depth. Herein we combine LiDAR-derived metrics known to influence peat accumulation (elevation, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI)) with passive gamma-ray spectrometric survey data, shown to correlate with peat occurrence, to develop a novel peat depth model for Dartmoor.Total air absorbed dose rates of Thorium, Uranium and Potassium were calculated, referred to as radiometric dose. Relationships between peat depth, radiometric dose, elevation, slope and TWI were trained using 1334 peat depth measurements, a further 445 measurements were used for testing. All variables showed significant relationships with peat depth. Linear stepwise regression of natural log-transformed variables indicated that a radiometric dose and slope model had an r(2) = 0.72/0.73 and RMSE 0.31/0.31 m for training/testing respectively. This model estimated an area of 158 +/- 101 km(2) of peaty soil > 0.4 m deep across the study area. Much of this area (60 km(2)) is overlain by grassland and therefore may have been missed if vegetation cover was used to map peat extent. Using published bulk density and carbon content values we estimated 13.1 Mt. C (8.1-21.9 Mt. C) are stored in the peaty soils within the study area. This is an increase on previous estimates due to greater modelled peat depth. The combined use of airborne gamma-ray spectrometric survey and LiDAR data provide a novel, practical and repeatable means to estimate peat depth with no a priori knowledge, at an appropriate resolution (10 m) and extent (406 km(2)) to facilitate management of entire peatland complexes.

T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The prime objective of this study was evaluating six satellite precipitation products by using standard statistical techniques to assess its capability to provide reliable rain rate (amount) and detect rainfall event correctly. High-resolution precipitation products, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM 3B42RT v7), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIAN CDR), African Rainfall Climatology (ARC v2) and Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH v1.0) were utilized. Evaluation includes both numerical and categorial metrices. Results indicated that in terms of rainfall amount estimation, TAMSAT has relatively better capability whilst for detecting rain event, ARC v2 was found capable in Eastern Ethiopian landscape. All precipitation products underestimate precipitation amount with profound bias level. These needs a thorough bias correction before utilization of these satellite precipitation products.

TI  - Monitoring estuarine morphodynamics through quantitative techniques and GIS: A Case study in Sagar Island, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of coastal areas, shorelines, estuarine islands are very important in order to determine the hydro dynamic and hydro meteorological behavior of coastal zone and estuarine deltaic tracts. This paper presents the spatio-temporal changes of morphological configuration of shorelines, river banks of deltaic Sagar Island situated in the mouth reaches of Hugli estuary in India. Passing through the western margin of Ganga delta the Hugli river is flowing to the Bay of Bengal in north south direction and it is dominated by strong tidal current. Being the largest island in Hugli estuary Sagar Island represent variety of inter tidal sub tidal sub-environment formed by estuarine erosional and depositional processes. The study aims to monitor and measure the quantitative changes of shorelines, island area, spatio-temporal variations of erosional and depositional processes and resultant landform assemblages by using shoreline change envelop (SCE), net shoreline movement (NSM) and end point rate (EPR). With the help of multi-temporal maps and image (District map, Police station map of 1912-29, SoI Topographical sheets 1967-69 and IRS P6 LISS IV satellite image of 2014), GIS techniques, mathematical modeling of hydro morphological parameters the present study has given a fruitful result. Measurement of shoreline dynamics clearly shows that coastal shoreline and estuarine bank line erosional processes are very active along south eastern coastal tract, south western part of Sagar Island and exposed concave river banks along the north eastern part of Sagar respectively. Finally is has found that intensity of erosion in Sagar Island is strongly controlled by estuarine exposure, sediment composition, channel flow direction, near bank channel depth, orientation of thalweg line, wave form velocity, long shore velocity, direction of longshore current, episodic cyclonic events with mean high tidal ranges and disturbance in estuarine equilibrium condition.

TI  - Downscaling rice yield simulation at sub-field scale using remotely sensed LAI data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop modeling and remote sensing are key tools to gain deeper understanding on cropping system dynamics and, ultimately, to increase the sustainability of agricultural productions. This study presents a system to estimate rice yields at sub-field scale based on the integration of a biophysical model and remotely sensed products. Leaf area index (LAI) data derived from decametric optical imageries (i.e., Landsat-8, Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2A) were assimilated into the WARM rice model via automatic recalibration of crop parameters at a fine spatial resolution (30 m x 30 m), targeting the lowest error between simulated and remotely sensed LAI. The performance of the system was evaluated by comparing simulated yield using default and recalibrated parameters at sub-field scale with yield maps generated by a GPS-equipped harvester. The training dataset included 40 paddy fields in Northern Italy, which were sampled during three cropping seasons, from 2014 to 2016. The assimilation of remotely sensed LAI into model parameters increased the accuracy of the system: MAE and RRMSE were 0.66 t ha(-1) [CI: 0.54 t ha(-1)-0.78 t ha(-1)] and 13.8% [CI: 11.7%-15.7%], respectively, whereas they were 0.82 t ha(-1) [CI: 0.68 t ha(-1)-0.96 t ha(-1)) and 15.7% [CI: 14.1%,-17.4%] without assimilation. Moreover, the system allowed to properly reproduce the within-field yield variability, thus laying the basis for possible applications in precision agriculture advisory services.

TI  - Comparison of small area estimation methods applied to biopower feedstock supply in the Northern US region
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing interest in utilization of forest biomass for bioenergy has prompted extensive contemporary research regarding costs, supply and technology for efficiently producing electricity and other forms of renewable energy. One challenge facing both researchers and users is obtaining precise estimates of available forest biomass within plausible supply areas for individual power plants. Due to the wide distribution of power plants poised to co-fire with forest biomass, assessing its availability requires methods that can yield precise and low-bias estimates of aboveground forest biomass and other key attributes at varying spatial scales. Small area estimation (SAE) methods have high potential to accomplish this due to the availability of national forest inventory data, combined with satellite imagery and other forms of remotely-sensed auxiliary information. The study assessed several indirect, direct and composite estimators of four forest attributes: aboveground tree biomass, biomass of small-diameter trees, biomass of tops and limbs, and volume at the county-level and within the estimated supply areas around power plants across 20 states in the contiguous Northern U.S. Composite estimators using both k-nearest neighbors imputation and multiple linear regression provided superior estimates of indicators of forest biomass availability based on both precision and bias at the county-level at sampling intensities as low as 10-20%, compared to the other SAE methods examined. The composite estimator using k-nearest neighbors imputation was subsequently shown to produce precise estimates of forest biomass availability for selected power plant supply areas.

TI  - Reconstructing movement history of frozen debris lobes in northern Alaska using satellite radar interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Frozen debris lobes (FDLs) are slow-moving landslides along permafrost-affected slopes, and consist of soil, rock, organic debris, and areas of massive infiltration ice. Based on their proximity to the adjacent infrastructure, their size, and their flow dynamics, FDLs represent potential geohazards. Eight FDLs (FDL-A, -B, -C, -D, -4, -5, -7, -11) within the Dalton Highway corridor in the Brooks Range, Alaska, USA are the subject of this paper. We examined temporal and spatial variation of FDL displacement using medium-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and differential SAR Interferometry (dInSAR) techniques. European Remote Sensing satellite 1/2 (ERS 1/2) and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) acquisitions were used to generate coherent interferograms to study the displacement history of FDLs for 1995-1996 and 2006-2010. We conducted an initial assessment of the capability of satellite InSAR to monitor FDL movement depending on data resolution, season, and vegetation coverage, which also helped us to select useful interferograms. With multi-temporal interferometric displacement maps, we found that seven investigated FDLs (FDL-7 was excluded from this sub experiment due to limited data coverage) demonstrated strong spatial and seasonal variations in their movement patterns, with maximum displacement rates typically occurring in October and minimum displacement rates during February or March, which is consistent with previously published field study results. Overall, through this study we: (1) delineated the active FDLs during the winter period using a wrapped PALSAR interferogram; (2) analyzed the spatial variation of the deformation field within each FDL body; (3) modeled the seasonal changes of FDL deformation rates through the analysis of multi-temporal ERS tandem interferograms; and (4) integrated InSAR-derived deformation rates with those obtained through historical imagery analysis to determine long-term deformation rates. Results from this study fill the gaps left in the historical imagery analysis and provide important seasonal and spatial deformation data, which are essential in the development of a mitigation plan as these features approach infrastructure. We also summarize our research experience studying these moving features using satellite radar interferometry and believe this can be useful for future studies of similar features.

TI  - Beef production and net revenue variability from grazing systems on semiarid grasslands of North America
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability of ranches and rural economies in the Great Plains of western North America is contingent on the economic vitality of beef production in a changing climate. Our objective was to measure and compare the interannual variability of beef production (kg/ha) and net returns ($/ha) over the past 15 years (2003-2017) from grazing yearlings at three different grazing intensities (light, moderate and heavy) on semiarid shortgrass steppe from mid-May to October. Four useful insights emerged: 1) A ranking of interannual variability, from lowest to highest, reveals that beef production had the lowest coefficient of variation (CV = 17-29%), followed by aboveground net primary production (ANPP, 26-32%), spring/early summer precipitation (36%) and net revenue (107-139%). 2) Beef production increased with grazing intensity during average and wet years, but not during dry years. Beef production increased from early August to early September but became negligible from early September to the end of the grazing season. Overall, beef production and net revenue were 41% and 38% greater for the heavy grazing intensity compared to the recommended moderate grazing intensity, respectively. 3) Removing yearlings from pastures in early September rather than the traditional October timing would provide opportunities for ranchers to increase net returns. 4) Forage production, estimated through remote sensing information, was positively associated with beef production, but with a steeper slope for the heavy grazing intensity, indicating greater sensitivity at this grazing intensity level. Economic sustainability of beef production in this rangeland ecosystem is challenged by high interannual variability in net revenues. This variability suggests that ranchers should focus on understanding agricultural economic principles, livestock marketing, and available options for reducing price risk. These efforts would enhance both the economic sustainability of individual ranching operations and rural economies.

TI  - The lurking punitive threat: The philosophy of necessity and challenges for reform
T2  - THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite some encouraging reforms and a new optimism in criminal justice, problematic punishment persists in the USA. In this article, I argue that the difficulties of reform stem, in part, from an ingrained 'philosophy of necessity' that places punishment at the core of how to think about crime and social problems, and promotes a worldview that overvalues punishment's ability to provide safety, provoke change and ensure justice. The philosophy of necessity grants punishment the 'benefit of the doubt', even when such confidence is unwarranted, and fosters reliance on punitive norms that encourage excess and abuse. A series of features work together to encourage the philosophy of necessity in the USA: blindness to the history of using punishment to ensure economic and social security for the privileged, ongoing policies that breed high levels of violence, and cultural endorsement of punitive logic as a substitution for social security and substantive justice.

TI  - Effect of Prompt Particle Events on OLCI Ocean Color Imagery in the South Atlantic Anomaly: Detection and Removal
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been found that cosmic rays and massive charged particles trapped in the magnetosphere or arriving from the sun might produce spike noise over the dark offset signal coming from charge-coupled devices (CCDs) on optic sensors such as Ocean and Land Color Instrument (Sentinel-3/OLCI) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (Envisat/MERIS). These phenomena are called prompt particle events (PPEs) and in the case of OLCI, are the cause of isolated across-track pixel stripes present at the LIE imagery where the radiance values appear anomalously high/low with respect to their surroundings. The magnitude and frequency of these stripes are evidently higher in the region of the South Atlantic (Magnetic) Anomaly (SAA), which also covers central South America. In this region, PPE contamination at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances has a significant impact on water reflectance and biogeophysical product retrieval over the affected pixels, which means they must be detected and removed from the LIB imagery. In this letter, a PPE detection and removal algorithm is proposed to be applied over water bodies, based on a simple moving filter with a 5 x 1 along-track kernel applied over the whole spectral set of OLCI TOA radiances. Its performance was evaluated visually and by comparing with preexistent predictions. Results indicate that images in the SAA region contain 27.8 times more PPE-contaminated pixels than images from outside the SAA and that the mast affected hands are at 400 and 1016 nm, where the fraction of PPE-flagged pixels over the SAA reaches 0.14% and 0.26%, respectively.

It is shown in [18] that the problem of the discriminating sentinel is equivalent to a null-controllability problem with constraint on the control.

TI  - Landsat Orbital Repeat Frequency and Cloud Contamination: A Case Study for Eastern United States
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A primary Landsat constraint is cloud contamination. The goal of this study is to evaluate how increasing Landsat temporal repeat frequency might achieve weekly cloud-free observations. This is a case study which examines eastern United States observations, as a typical representation of the temperate forest biome.A comparison between simultaneous Landsat and MODIS observations shows that MODIS observations provide a reasonable approximation of observed Landsat cloud cover conditions. Daily MODIS cloud observations are examined, using image compositing, to evaluate how increasing Landsat temporal repeat frequency might reduce weekly Landsat cloud contamination.Results suggests that for these eastern US locations weekly clear views are best achieved with daily satellite repeat frequency, bi-weekly clear views with 2-day repeat, monthly clear views are achieved with 4-day repeat and seasonal clear views with 8-day repeat. To more fully understand the global impact of cloud contamination on Landsat observations similar studies are needed for the Earth's other major biomes.

TI  - Impact of modern-day axillary treatment on patient reported arm morbidity and physical functioning in breast cancer patients
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To reduce arm morbidity, routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is often omitted or replaced by axillary radiotherapy (AxRT) in patients with limited nodal involvement. We evaluated patient-reported arm morbidity and physical functioning in breast cancer patients undergoing modern-day axillary treatment.Methods: All patients within the UMBRELLA cohort undergoing local radiotherapy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), ALND and/or AxRT were selected. Patient-reported arm morbidity and physical functioning were assessed with EORTC QLQ C30/BR23 questionnaires up to eighteen months after initiation of radiotherapy. Patient-reported outcomes were compared between patients with SLNB only, ALND only, AxRT (level I-II), AxRT (level I-IV) or AxRT plus ALND by means of mixed model analysis.Results: In total, 949 patients were identified; 641 (68%) SLNB only, 57 (6%) ALND only, 94 (10%) AxRT level I-II, 72 (8%) AxRT level I-IV and 85 (9%) ALND + AxRT. SLNB only resulted in the least arm morbidity scores. ALND + AxRT resulted in most arm morbidity, with clinically relevant differences at 18 months. AxRT (level I-II or level I-IV) resulted in significantly less arm symptoms in the first 3 months compared to ALND. Arm symptom scores between those receiving AxRT on levels I-II and I-IV were similar.Conclusion: Of all axillary management strategies, ALND plus AxRT is associated with worst patient-reported outcomes. AxRT resulted in less arm morbidity compared to ALND. Selective radiotherapy treatment of the axilla, i.e. radiotherapy of levels I-II only instead of levels I-IV, did not lead to clinically relevant reduced arm morbidity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Work-related laryngeal cancer: Trends in France from 2001 to 2016
T2  - EUROPEAN ANNALS OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: As part of the 2014-2019 cancer plan and in order to improve our knowledge of work-related cancers, we analysed the work-related laryngeal cancer risk situations identified in the French national occupational disease surveillance and prevention network (rnv3p) from 2001 to 2016.Material and methods: This study focused on cases of work-related laryngeal cancer, which the expert physician considered to be directly related to exposure (intermediate or strong causal relationship). Demographic data, occupational exposure circumstances (hazards, occupation, business sector), non-occupational risk factors and the occupational physician's opinion concerning notification as an occupational disease were analysed.Results: Two hundred forty-four cases of laryngeal cancer were registered between 2001 and 2016. One hundred and forty seven cases were considered to be work-related, with an intermediate or strong causal relationship in 87 cases. This exclusively male population had a median age of 59 years. Ninety-seven different forms of exposure were identified, including asbestos in 78 cases. The main business sectors concerned were specialized construction (14 cases) and metallurgy (7 cases). Occupational disease notification was recommended in 60 patients, corresponding to asbestos exposure in 80% of cases.Conclusions: Asbestos is the laryngeal cancer risk factor most commonly reported in the network from 2001 to 2016. This study confirms the role of asbestos in laryngeal carcinogenesis. Laryngeal cancer may therefore need to be compensated as an occupational disease in France, as in other European countries.

TI  - Assessing vegetation response to climatic variations and human activities: spatiotemporal NDVI variations in the Hexi Corridor and surrounding areas from 2000 to 2010
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover is a commonly used indicator for evaluating terrestrial environmental conditions, and for revealing environmental evolution and transitions. Spatiotemporal variations in the vegetation cover of the Hexi Corridor and surrounding areas from 2000 to 2010 were investigated using MODIS NDVI data, and the causes of vegetation cover changes were analyzed, considering both climatic variability and human activities. The vegetation cover of the study area increased during 2000-2010. The greenness of the vegetation showed a significant increase from the northwest to the southeast, which was similar to the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation. Variations in vegetation have a close relationship with those in precipitation within the Qilian Mountains region, but the NDVI is negatively correlated with precipitation in oasis areas. Increasing temperatures led to drought, inhibiting vegetation growth in summer; however, increasing temperatures may have also advanced and prolonged the growing periods in spring and autumn. The NDVI showed a slight degradation in March and July, primarily in the Qilian Mountains, and especially the Wushao Mountains. In March, due to low temperatures, the metabolism rate of vegetation was too slow to enable strong plant growth in high elevations of the Qilian Mountains. In July, increasing temperatures enhanced the intensity of transpiration and decreasing precipitation reduced the moisture available to plants, producing a slight degradation of vegetation in the Qilian Mountains. In May and August, the NDVI showed a significant improvement, primarily in the artificial oases and the Qilian Mountains. Abundant precipitation provided the necessary water for plant growth, and suitable temperatures increased the efficiency of photosynthesis, resulting in a significant improvement of vegetation in the Qilian Mountains. The improvement of production technologies, especially in irrigation, has been beneficial to the growth of vegetation in oasis areas. The implementation of large-scale vegetation management has led to several beneficial effects in the artificial oases and grasslands of the Qilian Mountains.

TI  - Innovative approach for geospatial drought severity classification: a case study of Paraiba state, Brazil
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Trend analysis of droughts and their geospatial and temporal variability assists decision-making about water resources management around the world and decreases the harmful effects of drought that affect the entire population. This work aimed to analyze short-, medium- and long-term droughts and their trends in the Brazilian state of Paraiba from 1998 to 2015 using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data and applying the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator method, based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI). TRMM data were validated by comparison with data from 267 rain gauges in the region, which showed the consistency of the satellite data. Therefore, 187 monthly TRMM rainfall time series were used, each with 216months. The series were equally distributed over the entire study area. At the significance level of 0.01, a new geospatial classification of drought severity is proposed, through which it is possible to determine exactly which types of drought events affected or did not affect a given region based on the SPI and the trend of the analyzed SPI time series, which shows the situation of drought risk analysis. The results of the comparison between long- and short-term droughts indicate that the wettest regions of the state of Paraiba are strongly affected by extreme drought events and show trends with increasingly negative slopes. In this way, the proposed geospatial classification is proved to be a useful tool because it provides information about the current drought situation of a given region, simultaneously showing the trend slope with respect to short-, medium- and long-term droughts.

TI  - A novel prediction method for lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer: machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The necessity of lymphadenectomy and the prediction of lymph node involvement (LNI) in endometrial cancer (EC) have been hotly-debated questions in recent years. Machine learning is a broad field that can produce results and estimations. In this study we constructed prediction models for EC patients using the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm for LNI prediction.Methods The study assessed 762 patients with EC. Algorithm models were based on the following histopathological factors: V1: final histology; V2: presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI); V3: grade; V4: tumor diameter; V5: depth of myometrial invasion (MI); V6: cervical glandular stromal invasion (CGSI); V7: tubal or ovarian involvement; and V8: pelvic LNI. Logistic regression analysis was also used to evaluate the independent factors affecting LNI.Results The mean age of patients was 59.1 years. LNI was detected in 102 (13.4%) patients. Para-aortic LNI (PaLNI) was detected in 54 (7.1%) patients, of which four patients had isolated PaLNI. The accuracy rate of the algorithm models was found to be between 84.2% and 88.9% and 85.0% and 97.6% for LNI and PaLNI, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the histologic type, LVSI, depth of MI, and CGSI were independently and significantly associated with LNI (p<0.001 for all).Conclusions Machine learning may have a place in the decision tree for the management of EC. This is a preliminary report about the use of a new statistical technique. Larger studies with the addition of sentinel lymph node status, laboratory findings, or imaging results with machine learning algorithms may herald a new era in the management of EC.

TI  - An Improved Approach for Soil Moisture Estimation in Gully Fields of the Loess Plateau Using Sentinel-1A Radar Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential ecological parameter, soil moisture is important for understanding the water exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially in the Loess Plateau (China). Although Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can be used for soil moisture retrieval, it is still a challenge to mitigate the impacts of complex terrain over hilly areas. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose an improved approach for soil moisture estimation in gully fields based on the joint use of the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) and the Incidence Angle Correction Model (IACM) from Sentinel-1A observations. AIEM is utilized to build a simulation database of microwave backscattering coefficients from various radar parameters and surface parameters, which is the data basis for the retrieval modeling. IACM is proposed to correct the deviation between the local incidence angle at the scatterer and the radar viewing angle. The study area is located in the Loess Plateau of China, where the main land cover is mostly bare land and the terrain is complex. The Sentinel-1A SAR data in C-band with dual polarization acquired on October 19th, 2017 was adopted to extract the VV&VH polarimetric backscattering coefficients. The in situ measurements of soil moisture were collected on the same day of the SAR acquisition, for evaluating the accuracy of the SAR-derived soil moisture. The results showed that, firstly, the estimated soil moisture with volumetric content between 0% and 20% was in the majority. Subsequently, both the RMSE of estimation values (0.963%) and the standard deviation of absolute errors (0.957%) demonstrated a good accuracy of the improved approach. Moreover, the evaluation of IACM confirmed that the improved approach coupling IACM and AIEM was more efficient than employing AIEM solely. In conclusion, the proposed approach has a strong ability to estimate the soil moisture in the gully fields of the Loess Plateau from Sentinel-1A data.

TI  - Beyond Making and Unmaking: Re-Envisioning Sacred Art
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper engages with predominantly Eastern Orthodox thinkers in reassessing the conditions under which sacred art may be possible today. The sacred has both ontological and cultural aspects. An artwork is sacred, firstly, by virtue of partaking of transcendent realities; and secondly, by being embedded in a worldview which allows the work to be made and received as sacred. Drawing on the thought of Philip Sherrard, the paper suggests that current conditions are characterised by cultural forgetting and the loss of such a metaphysical worldview. This paper proposes that the possibilities of sacred art must be rediscovered from within the practices of particular arts; and that this goes hand in hand with the rediscovery of a sacred ontology and of a Christian understanding of freedom. The paper will follow David Bentley Hart in affirming a theological understanding of freedomas the orientation towards, and the attainment of communion with, ontological goodsagainst the prevalent postmodern and ultimately nihilistic notion of freedom as spontaneous volition. It is crucial, therefore, to also identify those transcendent goods towards which art may fruitfully be directed. In this light, the paper proposes the need to revise our concepts of matter, form, and, above all, beauty.

TI  - Evaluating the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites for high-resolution evapotranspiration estimations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel satellite missions are designed to provide remote-sensing observational capability to many diverse operational applications, including in the field of agriculture and food security. They do this by acquiring frequent observations from a combination of optical, thermal and microwave sensors at various spatial resolutions. However, one currently missing capability, that would enable monitoring of evapotranspiration, crop water stress and water use at field scale, is the lack of high-resolution (tens of meters) thermal sensor. In this study we evaluate a methodology for bridging this data gap by employing a machine learning algorithm to sharpen low resolution thermal observations from the Sentinel-3 satellites using images acquired by high-resolution optical sensors on the Sentinel-2 satellites. The resulting dataset is then used as input to land-surface energy balance model to estimate evapotranspiration. The methodology is tested using Terra and Landsat satellite observations, due to lack of sufficiently long time-series of Sentinel observations, and benchmarked against fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal observations acquired by the Landsat satellites. We then apply the methodology to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to confirm its applicability to this type of data. The results show that the fluxes derived with sharpened thermal data are of acceptable accuracy (relative error lower than 20%) and provide more information at flux-tower footprint scale than the corresponding low-resolution fluxes. They also replicate the spatial and temporal patterns of fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal observations. However, the increase in error of the modelled fluxes compared to using high-resolution thermal observations and the inherent limitations of the sharpening approach point to the need to add high-resolution thermal mission to the Sentinels' constellation.

TI  - Front and back yard green analysis with subpixel vegetation fractions from earth observation data in a city
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a novel approach to green space availability in cities that includes the thus-far mostly neglected urban front and backyard green space around residential buildings on privately owned ground. To quantify the full spatial scope of urban green space, we calculated subpixel vegetation fractions from RapidEye remote-sensing data for the entire city with a spectral unmixing technique that enabled us to model the extent of urban vegetation with a high degree of confidence (MAE 7%, R2 0.92). We then applied a new 'urban front and back yard green space derivation algorithm', namely, a masking of the fractional vegetation data using GIS vector data of land cover, in order to delineate the front and backyard greenspace of residential houses in a city with an accuracy of 96%. Combining these two approaches, we can calculate the area of urban front and back yard green space for the entire city (including different residential structure types) and compare this data to the area of public (parks, urban forests) and semi-public (allotment gardens) green spaces that have been used for prevailing per capita green space availability analyses. The new method is exemplified at the city of Leipzig, Germany, which provides different residential structures concerning house types and the surrounding green that are characteristic of many European cities. Key findings include that the total amount of urban front and back yard green space is almost 2000 ha, which is similar to 40% of the amount of public green space (4768 ha). In 15 out of the 63 total districts, there is more front and backyard than public green space, which highlights the importance of these urban front and back yard green space for the analysis of urban livelihoods and a tool for detailed ecosystem services-oriented urban planning.

TI  - Estimation and inter-comparison of dust aerosols based on MODIS, MISR and AERONET retrievals over Asian desert regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents detailed analysis of spatiotemporal variations and trend of dust optical properties i.e., Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom component over Asian desert regions using thirteen years of data (i.e., 2001-2013) retrieved from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR). These regions include Solar Village, Dunhuang and Dalangzadgad and are considered as origin of desert aerosols in Asia. Mann-Kendall trend test was used to show the trend of AOD. The relationship of AOD with weather parameters and general AOD trend over different wavelengths has also been shown. AOD's trend has Angstrom exponent been observed significant throughout the year in Solar Village, while in Dunhuang and Dalanzadgad the significant trend has been found only in peak period (March-June). Analysis show high values of AOD and low values of angstrom in Solar Village during peak period. In Chinese desert regions, high values of AOD have been found during peak period Desert and low values in pre-peak period. Significant relationship has been observed between AOD and average temperature in Solar Village and Dalanzadgad whereas rainfall and wind speed showed no significant impact on AOD in all desert regions.

TI  - Detection of mineral alteration induced by hydrocarbon microseepages by using remotely sensed data in the Fateh Jang area of the Northern Potwar region of Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral alteration can be induced by the hydrocarbon seepages at the earth surface that can be detected by the use of earth observation data. The long-term seepage of hydrocarbons in the subsurface can induce different types of chemical and mineralogical alterations in the rosk and soil. Mapping of these mineral alterion is important to explore hydrocarbon. In this study, satellite images were used to identify the surface mineral alterations due to hydrocarbon microseepages in the Fateh Jang area of the Northern Potwar region, Islamabad, Pakistan. Landsat TM band ratios of 7/5, 3/1, and 5/4 are used to detect ferric minerals, clay minerals, and ferrous iron minerals bearing sedimentary rocks, respectively, which are applied to distinguish the altered and unaltered rocks. Such rocks have specific spectral responses in various bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and thus give rise to a number of anomalies indicating the presence of hydrocarbons. This study uses enhancement techniques of principal component analysis (PCA), band ratio, false color composite (FCC), and thermal anomaly composition for surface expressions caused by microseeps. It is revealed that spectral reflectance signify that the ferrous iron and red bed bleaching have reflection band and absorption band in TM bands 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Clay minerals and kaolinite have enormous reflection in band 5 and absorption capacity in TM band 7. These results can be used as a model to identify the alteration induced by hydrocarbon seepages. The study area is categorized into northern, eastern, southern, and western zones on the basis mineral alteration. The northern zone is characterized by strong anomalies and is relatively rich in clay alteration and ferrous as compared to other zones. Two types of hydrocarbon microseepages were observed in the Fateh Jang area which includes active seepages (gas microseepages and oil seepage) and passive seepage (bleaching effects).

TI  - Effects of drought on plant parameters of different rangeland types in Khansar region, Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation changes and drought are among the most important processes affecting the formation of ecosystems. The main objective of this research was to investigate relationships of field-assessed plant parameters with remotely sensed vegetation cover and an index of drought severity. These relationships were assessed across a range of vegetation types and across seasonal and annual scales in the Khansar region of Isfahan Province, Iran. Vegetation cover was measured by the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (extracted from the USGS MOD13Q1 image product), and drought severity was estimated by the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (for intervals of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12months). Field-based plant parameters (vegetation cover, production rate, and leaf area index (LAI)) were measured for a range of vegetation types covering a range of conditions (315 sites in total, assessed in 2016), using a 4-pixel method. The correlation between NDVI, SPI, and field plant parameters was evaluated using Pearson correlation. The results indicated that the production rate and LAI were higher in rangelands with fair conditions than in those with degraded conditions and varied in each vegetation type during the year. The highest and lowest production rates were observed in Astragalus-Agropyrum (28gm(-2)year(-1)) and Artemisia sieberi-Scariola (9gm(-2)year(-1)), respectively. The correlation between NDVI and plant production varied across plant communities, from 0.552 in Artemisia sieberi-Scariola to 0.865 in Astragalus-Agropyrum. The correlation between NDVI and SPI was highest for 1-month intervals and varied by plant community between 0.622 (p=0.006) for Scariola-Cousinia and 0.840 (p<0.001) Astragalus-Agropyrum. In general, the observations revealed that vegetation type, vegetation form, rangeland condition, and the stratification of the region have key roles in drought monitoring.

TI  - Ground surface response to continuous compaction of aquifer system in Tehran, Iran: Results from a long-term multi-sensor InSAR analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the developed groundwater basins in Iran are subject to land subsidence hazards resulting from the over- extraction of groundwater. Several areas in Tehran, the capital city and a provincial center in north-central Iran, have been reported to be subsiding at different rates. In this study, we present the results of an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis of Tehran using different SAR data between 2003 and 2017. By constructing more than 400 interferograms derived from 39 Envisat ASAR (C-band), 10 ALOS PALSAR (L-band), 48 TerraSAR-X (X-band), and 64 Sentinel-1 (C-band) SAR datasets, we compile displacement time series from interferometric observations using the Small Baseline (SB) technique. Our analysis identifies 3 distinct subsidence features in Tehran with rates exceeding 25 cm/yr in the western Tehran Plain, approximately 5 cm/yr in the immediate vicinity of Tehran international airport, and 22 cm/yr in the Varamin Plain to the southeast of Tehran city. The temporal pattern of land subsidence, which is dominated by a decreasing trend, generally follows the regional decline in groundwater level, which suggests that anthropogenic processes caused by excessive groundwater extraction are the primary cause of land subsidence. Integrating a decadal time series of subsidence constructed from multi-sensor InSAR with in-situ observations suggests that inelastic and permanent compaction dominates the main deformation regime of the Tehran aquifer, and the ratio between elastic and inelastic deformation is approximately 0.4. A geological analysis indicates that the shape of the subsidence bowl in the western Tehran Plain does not follow the trend of major mapped faults in the region. In contrast, the subsidence bowl in Varamin is controlled by the Pishva Fault, which suggests that either this fault acts as a hydrologic barrier to the groundwater flow in this region or that the differences in sediment thickness causes the discontinuity in land subsidence.

TI  - Impacts of forest loss in the eastern Carpathian Mountains: linking remote sensing and sediment changes in a mid-altitude catchment (Red Lake, Romania)
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide accelerated forest loss and the associated environmental impacts are important environmental concerns. In this study, we integrate evidence from historical maps and a Landsat-derived time series of catchment-scale forest cover changes with a multi-proxy, palaeolimnological reconstruction spanning the last 150years from Red Lake (Eastern Carpathians, Romania) to better understand the impact of long-term forest changes on catchment erosion and sediment accumulation. We are able to consider two time windows. Firstly, we show that during the traditional (1840-1948) and socialist (1948-1989) periods, catchment changes and sediment responses, as reflected in the sediment accumulation rate, detrital input and grain size were moderate and likely reflect the combined result of known periods of excessive precipitation and local-scale forest disturbances. Secondly, and in contrast, rapid responses in catchment-scale geomorphological processes to forest loss are evident during the post-socialist land use period (1987-2010). We found that the first land restitution period (1987-1999) and the first part of the second land restitution period (2000-2002) had a greater impact on forest loss and subsequent catchment processes with sediment accumulation rates increasing from 0.5cmyear(-1) to 1.2cmyear(-1). Finally, environmental impacts of forest changes were strongly dependent on the size of the area deforested, its location within the catchment, susceptibility to erosion and geomorphological thresholds. In a region noted for accelerated recent forest loss, our study highlights the potential of combining historical maps, satellite images and sediment proxies for documenting such changes and highlights the need for more strategic and sustainable environmental management planning.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Cloud Detection in Scenes with Snow/Ice Using High Resolution Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of snow versus clouds causes difficulties in cloud detection because of the similarity between cloud and snow spectral characteristics in the visible wavelength range. This paper presents a novel approach to distinguish clouds from snow to improve the accuracy of cloud detection and allow an efficient use of satellite images. Firstly, we selected thick and thin clouds from high resolution Sentinel-2 images and applied a matched filter. Secondly, the fractal digital number-frequency (DN-N) algorithm was applied to detect clouds associated with anomalies. Thirdly, spatial analyses, particularly spatial overlaying and hotspot analyses, were conducted to eliminate false anomalies. The results indicate that the method is effective for detecting clouds with various cloud covers over different areas. The resulting cloud detection effect possesses specific advantages compared to classic methods, especially for satellite images of snow and brightly colored ground objects with spectral characteristics similar to those of clouds.

TI  - Agricultural Risk Factors Influence Microbial Ecology in Honghu Lake
T2  - GENOMICS PROTEOMICS & BIOINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural activities, including stock-farming, planting industry, and fish aquaculture, can affect the physicochemical and biological characters of freshwater lakes. However, the effects of pollution producing by agricultural activities on microbial ecosystem of lakes remain unclear. Hence, in this work, we selected Honghu Lake as a typical lake that is influenced by agriculture activities. We collected water and sediment samples from 18 sites, which span a wide range of areas from impacted and less-impacted areas. We performed a geospatial analysis on the composition of microbial communities associated with physicochemical properties and antibiotic pollution of samples. The co-occurrence networks of water and sediment were also built and analyzed. Our results showed that the microbial communities of impacted and less-impacted samples of water were largely driven by the concentrations of TN, TP, NO3--N, and NO2--N, while those of sediment were affected by the concentrations of Sed-OM and Sed-TN. Antibiotics have also played important roles in shaping these microbial communities: the concentrations of oxytetracycline and tetracycline clearly reflected the variance in taxonomic diversity and predicted functional diversity between impacted and less-impacted sites in water and sediment samples, respectively. Furthermore, for samples from both water and sediment, large differences of network topology structures between impacted and less-impacted were also observed. Our results provide compelling evidence that the microbial community can be used as a sentinel of eutrophication and antibiotics pollution risk associated with agricultural activity; and that proper monitoring of this environment is vital to maintain a sustainable environment in Honghu Lake.

AB  - Background: There is large variability in the risk of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity among patients with intermediate thickness melanoma (ITM), with a subgroup of patients exhibiting a low risk of nodal disease.Objective: To identify a group of patients with ITM for whom the risk of nodal disease is low.Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients with ITM who underwent wide excision and nodal evaluation from 2010 to 2013 was identified by using the National Cancer Database and analyzed for the presence of nodal disease. Classification and regression tree analysis identified the most important factors used in a model to identify groups at low risk of SLN positivity.Results: Of 23,440 patients, 14.7% were found to have nodal metastasis. On classification and regression tree analysis, patients older than 55 years without lymphovascular invasion and with a lesion thickness less than 1.7 mm had an SLN positivity rate of 4.9%. A model using age and thickness in nonulcerated patients identified a low-risk subgroup with a corresponding SLN positivity rate of 4.7%.Limitations: This was a retrospective study, and the model developed requires prospective validation.Conclusions: Patient age is an important factor in estimating risk of SLN in patients with ITM and may help identify patients without ulceration who may be safely spared an SLN biopsy.

TI  - Assessment of MODIS-Based Fractional Snow Cover Products Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover distribution is crucial to Earth's climate and hydrological systems. Snow cover maps from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are widely utilized in climate research and water-source management. Three MODIS-derived fractional snow cover (FSC) products, namely, MOD10A1 version 6, MODSCAG, and MODAGE, are assessed to evaluate the accuracy of FSC data over the Tibetan Plateau from May 2013 to April 2015. A Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) snow map that is based on linear spectral mixture analysis is regarded as the "reference dataset." A total of 149 OLI images that span the Tibetan Plateau are used. The performance of these three datasets is compared to the "reference dataset" by using binary and fractional metrics over forest, grass, and bare soil, and in the Himalaya region. The binary classification assessment reveals that larger local illumination angles and vegetation coverage at the snow boundaries resulted in omission errors in MOD10A1, and snow patchiness caused this model to miss snow. MODSCAG correctly identified snow pixels, but overestimated snow at the snow boundaries and at local illumination angles that exceeded 30 degrees. MODAGE precisely recognized snow-free areas, but underestimated snow coverage because of snow patchiness. MODSCAG and MODAGE produced smaller root mean square errors (RMSE) than MOD10A1, likely because spectral mixture analysis is superior to the normalized difference snow index-based empirical method. The behaviors of these products differed at various spatial scales. The RMSE significantly declined with decreasing spatial resolution from 500 m to 2 km. However, when aggregated to 5 km, the RMSE increased because fewer pixels were involved in the calculation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To describe: 1) settings, activities and types of injuries for an 'initial' (sentinel) injury and subsequent injuries over 24 months, and 2) concordance between sentinel and subsequent injury events.Methods: Participants (n = 2856) were recruited to the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS) following their sentinel injury event, an injury event resulting in an Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) entitlement claim. Subsequent injuries were those from additional ACC claims in the following 24 months. Injury settings, activities and types were from electronic ACC claims data. The risks of having a subsequent injury of the same type as the sentinel injury were estimated.Results: Overall, 1653 (58%) participants had 3444 subsequent injury events in 24 months, resulting in 4470 injury diagnoses. Twenty one percent had at least one subsequent injury event of the same type as their sentinel injury; 33% with a spine sprain/strain had at least one subsequent spine sprain/strain. Many participants had at least one subsequent injury event at same setting (26%) as their sentinel injury; of note, 36% of participants whose sentinel injury occurred at home had at least one subsequent injury at home. Seventeen percent of participants had at least one subsequent injury involving the same activity as their sentinel injury; 28% of those whose sentinel injury was a result of contact in sport had at least one subsequent injury also involving sport.Conclusions: Subsequent injuries among people presenting to healthcare providers are common. Greater emphasis should be placed on maximising such healthcare provider contact as an injury prevention opportunity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is an increasingly common cancer in the United States, although mortality has likely stabilized. Diagnosis relies on a skilled practitioner with the aid of dermoscopy and initial local surgical management is a mainstay of treatment. Recent changes in staging emphasize continued use of sentinel lymph node biopsy to aid in prognostication although routine complete lymph node dissection has fallen out of favor. Advances in systemic treatment options, including targeted and immunotherapy, have dramatically changed the treatment paradigm for advanced melanoma and improved outcome. Prevention via sun protection remains a critical tool in efforts to limit the burden of this disease.

TI  - Incorporating biophysical gradients and uncertainty into burn severity maps in a temperate fire-prone forested region
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As forest fire activity increases worldwide, it is important to track changing patterns of burn severity (i.e., degree of fire-caused ecological change). Satellite data provide critical information across space and time, yet how satellite indices relate to individual measures of burn severity on the ground (e.g., tree mortality or surface charring) and how these relationships change across biophysical gradients remain unclear. To address these knowledge gaps, we used Bayesian hierarchical zero-one-inflated beta (ZOIB) regression models with nearly 600 plots of individual field measures of burn severity distributed across the U.S. Rocky Mountains. We asked the following: How do three commonly used satellite indices of burn severity relate to individual field measures of canopy bum severity and forest-floor bum severity (Q1)? Then, using the highest ranked satellite index, how is reliability affected by biophysical gradients that can be captured in accessible geospatial data (e.g., latitude, slope) (Q2) and stand-structure data typically available only with field data (Q3)? The Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) outperformed the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and the Relative Burn Ratio (RBR) across canopy and forest-floor measures of bum severity, but differences among index performances were minor. Overall, indices performed better for field measures of canopy burn severity than for forest-floor measures. The relationship between RdNBR and individual field measures of burn severity changed across several biophysical gradients. For example, the same value of RdNBR corresponded to different field levels of burn severity depending on latitude, pre-fire forest structure, and pre-fire beetle outbreaks-and effects of biophysical gradients were often different for canopy vs. forest-floor measures of bum severity. We show that estimating field measures of burn severity using satellite indices can be improved by including biophysical information, but if variables that are difficult to obtain without field data (e.g., pre-fire beetle outbreak severity) are lacking, we suggest caution in interpreting satellite indices of burn severity across gradients of pre-fire biophysical conditions. Finally, using an example fire, we illustrate contrasting maps of burn severity that arise from differences in the relationship between individual field measures of burn severity and RdNBR after accounting for error in those relationships.

T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In estuary areas, meteorological conditions have become unstable under the continuous effects of climate change, and the ecological backgrounds of such areas have strongly been influenced by anthropic activities. Consequently, the water quality of these areas is obviously affected. In this research, we identified periods of fluctuation of the general meteorological conditions in the Yangtze River Estuary using a wavelet analysis. Additionally, we performed a spatiotemporal evaluation of the water quality in the fluctuating period by using remote sensing modeling. Then, we explored how the fluctuating meteorological factors affect the distribution of total suspended solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration. (1) The results show that from 2000 to 2015, temperature did not present significant fluctuations, while wind speed (WS) and precipitation (PR) presented the same fluctuation period from January 2012 to December 2012. (2) Based on the measured water sample data associated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, we developed a water quality algorithm and depicted the TSS and Chla concentrations within the WS and PR fluctuating period. (3) We found that the TSS concentration decreased with distance from the shore, while the Chla concentration showed an initially decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend; moreover, these two water quality parameters presented different inter-annual variations. Then, we discussed the correlation between the changes in the TSS and Chla concentrations and the WS and PR variables. The contribution of this research is reflected in two aspects: 1. variations in water quality parameters over a wide range of water bodies can be evaluated based on MODIS data; 2. data from different time periods showed that the fluctuations of meteorological elements had different impacts on water bodies based on the distance from the shore. The results provide new insights for the management of estuary water environments.

TI  - Different dynamic accumulation and toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles and ionic Zn in the soil sentinel organism <i>Enchytraeus crypticus</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is still no consensus over the specific effects of metal-based nanoparticles when compared with the conventional metal salts. Here, the accumulation and toxicity of ZnO-NPs and ZnCl2 in Enchytraeus crypticus over time (1-14 d) were investigated using a sand-solution exposure medium and applying a toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics approach. For both Zn forms, body Zn concentration in the organisms was dependent on both the exposure concentration and exposure time, with equilibrium being reached after 7-14 days of exposure. Generally, the uptake and elimination rate constants (K-u and K-e1) were smaller for ZnO-NPs (5.74-12.6 mg kg(-1)d(-1) and 0.17-0.39 d(-1)) than for ZnCl2 (8.32-40.1 mg kg(-1)d(-1) and 0.31-2.05 d(-1)), suggesting that ionic Zn was more accessible for E. crypticus than nanoparticulate Zn. Based on external exposure concentrations, LC50s for ZnO-NPs and ZnCl2 decreased with time from 123 to 67 Zn mg L-1 and from 86 to 62 Zn mg L-1, reaching an almost similar ultimate value within 14d. LC50s based on body Zn concentrations were almost constant over time (except for 1 d) for both ZnO-NPs and ZnCl2, with overall LC50(body) of Zn being 1720 and 1306 mg kg(-1) dry body weight, respectively, Body Zn concentration, which considers all available pathways, was a good predictor of dynamic toxicity of ZnCl2, but not for ZnO-NPs. This may be attributed to the specific internal distribution and detoxification mechanisms of ZnO-NPs. The particles from ZnO-NPs dominated the accumulation (>75%) and toxicity (similar to 100%). Our results suggest that dynamic aspects should be taken into account when assessing and comparing NPs and metals uptake and consequent patterns of toxicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Robust Radial Velocity Estimation Based on Joint-Pixel Normalized Sample Covariance Matrix and Shift Vector for Moving Targets
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The clutter suppression and target radial velocity estimation are essential in the ground moving target indication processing with multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. In reality, the heterogeneous clutter, the image coregistration error, and channel mismatch will remarkably decline the estimation performance of the target radial velocity. To address these issues, a robust radial velocity estimation algorithm is proposed in this letter. Based on the joint-pixel signal model, the joint-pixel normalized sample covariance matrix (JPNSCM) is employed to mitigate the effect of heterogeneous clutter, and the shift vector determined by JPNSCM is used to obtain the actual target steering vector. Then, the adaptive matched filtering algorithm is adopted to estimate the target radial velocity. Compared with traditional estimation algorithms, the proposed method obtains better performance in both simulations and real SAR data experiments.

TI  - A disturbance weighting analysis model (DWAM) for mapping wildfire burn severity in the presence of forest disease
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems are subject to recurring fires as one of their most significant disturbances. Accurate mapping of burn severity is crucial for post-fire land management and vegetation regeneration monitoring. Remote-sensing-based monitoring of burn severity faces new challenges when forests experience both fire and non-fire disturbances, which may change the biophysical and biochemical properties of trees in similar ways. In this study, we develop a Disturbance Weighting Analysis Model (DWAM) for accurately mapping burn severity in a forest landscape that is jointly affected by wildfire and an emerging infectious disease - sudden oak death. Our approach treats burn severity in each basic mapping unit (e.g., 30 m grid from a post-fire Landsat image) as a linear combination of burn severity of trees affected (diseased) and not affected by the disease (healthy), weighted by their areal fractions in the unit. DWAM is calibrated using two types of inputs: i) look-up tables (LUTs) linking burn severity and post-fire spectra for diseased and healthy trees, derived from field observations, hyperspectral sensors [e.g., Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)], and radiative transfer models; and ii) pre-fire fractional maps of diseased and healthy trees, derived by decomposing a pre-fire Landsat image using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). Considering the presence of tree disease in DWAM improved the overall map accuracy by 42%. The superior performance is consistent across all three stages of disease progression. Our approach demonstrates the potential for improved mapping of forest burn severity by reducing the confounding effects of other biotic disturbances.

TI  - Effects of preservation policy on land use changes in Iranian Northern Zagros forests
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Zagros Forest provides various ecosystem services such as food, timber, water, carbon storage, air purification, wildlife habitat as well as social and cultural benefits for both humans and animals. Due to the economic expansion beginning in the early 1990s in Iran and its resulting desertification, Zagros has lost numerous forests over the last 30 years. To overcome this issue, Zagros Forest Preservation Plan (ZFPP) has been under implementation in Northwestern Iran since 2003 to reduce forest destruction and attract the peoples participation. However, it faced shortcomings caused by a variety of factors including insufficient funds, incomplete preservation, and unsuitable organization during implementation. This research aims to study the effect of ZFPP on forest loss in Sardasht County as a representative of Iranian Northern Zagros Forests. A series of Landsat images were used to analyze the forest loss before ZFPP implementation (1993-2002), after 10 years of implementation (2002-2012), and finally after its revision (2012-2016). Land Change Modeler (LCM) was employed to detect land cover changes for land cover prediction in 2024. We used land cover maps between 2002 and 2012 for calibration. We then compared the predicted land cover map from LCM with actual land cover map in 2016 for validation. The results indicated that 3330, 4562, and 1234 ha of forestlands converted to agricultural lands, rangelands, and built-up areas during 1993-2002, 2002-2012, and 2012-2016, with annual deforestation rates of -0.40%, -0.52% and -0.36%, respectively. The highest deforestation rate was observed between 2002 and 2012 because of the destructive effects of population growth. Land cover prediction indicated that per capita forest area would continue to decline while the other land cover uses would continue to grow more severely around the existing agricultural lands and built-up areas in Sardasht until 2024.

TI  - Discriminating Wet Snow and Firn for Alpine Glaciers Using Sentinel-1 Data: A Case Study at Rofental, Austria
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of glacier changes supports our understanding of climate related glacier behavior. Remote sensing data offer the unique opportunity to observe individual glaciers as well as entire mountain ranges. In this study, we used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to monitor the recession of wet snow area extent per season for three different glacier areas of the Rofental, Austria. For four glaciological years (GYs, 2014/2015-2017/2018), Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR data were acquired and processed. For all four GYs, the seasonal snow retreated above the elevation range of perennial firn. The described processing routine is capable of discriminating wet snow from firn areas for all GYs with sufficient accuracy. For a short in situ transect of the snowfirn boundary, SAR derived wet snow extent agreed within an accuracy of three to four pixels or 30-40 m. For entire glaciers, we used optical remote sensing imagery and field data to assess reliability of derived wet snow covered area extent. Differences in determination of snow covered area between optical data and SAR analysis did not exceed 10% on average. Offsets of SAR data to results of annual field assessments are below 10% as well. The introduced workflow for S1 data will contribute to monitoring accumulation area extent for remote and hazardous glacier areas and thus improve the data basis for such locations.

TI  - Preprocedural checklist for regional anesthesia: impact on the incidence of wrong site nerve blockade (an 8-year perspective)
T2  - REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - World Congress on Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine in
CL  - New York, NY
AB  - Background The term "Wrong-Site Surgery (WSS)" is commonly associated with surgical procedures; however, The Joint Commission (TJC) considers any invasive procedure, not just a surgical procedure, performed on the wrong side, at the wrong site, or on the wrong patient to be a WSS. For anesthesia providers, this means that a wrong-site nerve block (WSNB) also constitutes a WSS and would be considered a sentinel event by TJC. In an attempt to combat WSNB, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine published guidelines in 2014 recommending the use of a preprocedural checklist before performing regional blocks. The effectiveness of such a checklist, however, to reduce the occurrence of WSNB has not yet been demonstrated. We hypothesized that the introduction of a preprocedural checklist specific for regional anesthesia would be associated with a lower rate of WSNB procedures.Methods A retrospective review was performed to compare the incidence of WSNB 2 years before, to 6 years after the implementation of a preprocedural checklist specific to regional anesthesia.Results Prior to checklist implementation, 4 WSNB events occurred during 10 123 procedures (3.95 per 10 000 (95% CI 1.26 to 9.53). Following implementation, WSNB events occurred during 35 890 procedures (0 per 10 000 (95% CI 0 to 0.84)); p= 0.0023.Conclusions Implementation of a regional anesthesia specific preprocedural checklist was associated with a significantly lower incidence of WSNB procedures. While prospective controlled studies would be required to demonstrate causation, this study suggests that for regional anesthesia procedures, a preprocedural checklist may positively impact patient safety.

TI  - Quantitative reconstruction of primary productivity in low latitudes during the last glacial maximum and the mid-to-late Holocene from a global <i>Florisphaera profunda</i> calibration dataset
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean net primary productivity (Npp) is a key component of the marine carbon cycle. Multi-model Npp projections based on a few decades of satellite data show large uncertainties, in particular at low latitudes (30 degrees N-30 degrees S). Calibration of sedimentary proxies with satellite-based Npp estimates allows for the quantitative reconstruction of this variable at longer time-scales. Relative abundance of deep-photic zone coccolithophore species Florisphaera profunda in the fossil record can potentially be used as a quantitative proxy for Npp. However, the robustness of this proxy calibration has been tested in very specific oceanographic settings using surface sediment samples. Here, we use a global dataset of surface sediment (n = 1258) and sediment trap (n = 26) samples with relative abundance data of F. profunda (%) to test the robustness of this proxy as a quantitative indicator of Npp. We study the modern and paleoecology of this species and the main factors affecting its latitudinal distribution. Results show that F profunda % is a strong indicator of Npp at latitudes between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S, while at higher latitudes temperature-related variables are more important. We develop a global calibration model between satellite Npp estimates and F. profunda for the latitudinal range between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S, and we apply it to several low-latitude sediment cores with available F profunda counts covering the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM; 24-19 ka) and the Mid-to-Late Holocene period (MLH; <6 ka). Reconstructed Npp during the LGM is 15% higher than during the MLHdue to the intensification of trade winds that enhanced oceanic upwelling at low latitudes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Satellite-Based Assessment of Grassland Conversion and Related Fire Disturbance in the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce beetle-induced (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby)) mortality on the Kenai Peninsula has been hypothesized by local ecologists to result in the conversion of forest to grassland and subsequent increased fire danger. This hypothesis stands in contrast to empirical studies in the continental US which suggested that beetle mortality has only a negligible effect on fire danger. In response, we conducted a study using Landsat data and modeling techniques to map land cover change in the Kenai Peninsula and to integrate change maps with other geospatial data to predictively map fire danger for the same region. We collected Landsat imagery to map land cover change at roughly five-year intervals following a severe, mid-1990s beetle infestation to the present. Land cover classification was performed at each time step and used to quantify grassland encroachment patterns over time. The maps of land cover change along with digital elevation models (DEMs), temperature, and historical fire data were used to map and assess wildfire danger across the study area. Results indicate the highest wildfire danger tended to occur in herbaceous and black spruce land cover types, suggesting that the relationship between spruce beetle damage and wildfire danger in costal Alaskan forested ecosystems differs from the relationship between the two in the forests of the coterminous United States. These change detection analyses and fire danger predictions provide the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KENWR) ecologists and other forest managers a better understanding of the extent and magnitude of grassland conversion and subsequent change in fire danger following the 1990s spruce beetle outbreak.

TI  - A machine learning approach to map tropical selective logging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hundreds of millions of hectares of tropical forest have been selectively logged, either legally or illegally. Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (> 20 m(3) ha(-1)). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondonia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (< 15 m(3) ha(-1)) We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Park northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes.

Mammography revealed poor extension at the left nipple surrounding skin. A hand-held ultrasonography( HHUS)device and automated breast volume scanner(ABUS)did not detect the thickening of the skin. Surgical biopsy was performed. The skin lesion was diagnosed as Paget disease. We examined her whole body and made a diagnosis of Tis N0 M0, stage 0. The patient underwent a mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological diagnosis on the basis of the resected surgical specimen was invasive ductal carcinoma, negative for ER and PgR, and positive for HER2/neu protein expression, and the Ki-67-positive cell index was 30%. The surgical margins were negative, and no metastasis was found in the sentinel lymph node. She was given trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy. Two years after the surgery, she was well without recurrence.

TI  - A fusion approach to forest disturbance mapping using time series ensemble techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis of Landsat data is widely used for assessing forest change at the large-area scale. Various change detection algorithms have been proposed, each employing different techniques to characterise abrupt disturbance events and longer term trends. However, results can vary significantly, depending on the algorithm, parameters and the spectral index (or indices) chosen. This mismatch in results has led to researchers hypothesizing that an ensemble based approach may increase accuracy. In this study we assess two change detection algorithms (LandTrendr and the R package strucchange), each with three indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI, the Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR, and Tasseled Cap Wetness or TCW). We test their ability to detect abrupt disturbances in sclerophyll forests over a 29 year time period, and subsequently evaluate a number of ensembles, using simple fusion rules and Random Forests models. A total of 4087 manually interpreted reference pixels, sampled from 9 million ha of forest, were used for training and validation. In addition, we assess the effects of priming the Random Forests classifier with confusing cases (commission errors from the time series algorithms). Our results clearly show that ensembles combining multiple change detection techniques out-perform any one method. Our most accurate Random Forests model, using an ensemble of all 6 algorithm outputs, along with 3 bi-temporal change rasters (change in NBR, NDVI and TCW), had an overall error rate of 7%, compared with the most accurate single algorithm/index approach (LandTrendr with NBR), which had an overall error of 21%. Our findings also indicate that acceptable results (14% error) can be achieved without the use of traditional change detection algorithms, by using robust reference data and Random Forests classification. However, by priming the classifier with confusing cases informed by the change detection algorithms, commission errors decreased substantially, at the expense of slight increases in omission errors. In fact, a Random Forests ensemble, using the primed training data and only 3 bi-temporal change rasters, was more accurate than any one individual algorithm, with an overall error of 11%. By including some additional metrics derived from Landsat time series (e.g. 2 year changes and overall means) this error was further reduced to 8%. Given that most change detection algorithms have large processing requirements, this suggests that algorithms can be applied to a sample of pixels only, for the sole purpose of training a machine learning classifier. We demonstrate the feasibility of this previously unexplored approach, by creating annual disturbance maps over a large area of forest (9 million ha) and long time period (29 years).

TI  - Mapping forest aboveground biomass in the reforested Buffelsdraai landfill site using texture combinations computed from SPOT-6 pan-sharpened imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing models for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in naturally growing forests is critical for climate change modelling. AGB models developed using satellite imagery varies with study area, depending on the complexity of vegetation and landscape structure, which affects the upwelling radiance. We assessed the potential of SPOT-6 imagery in predicting AGB of trees planted at different time periods, using image texture combinations. Image texture variables were computed from the SPOT6 pan-sharpened image data, which is characterised by a 1.5 m spatial resolution. In addition, we incorporated the minimal variance technique to select the optimum window sizes that best captures AGB variation in our study area. The results showed that image texture was able to detect AGB for both mature and young trees, however, models detecting mature trees were more superior, with accuracies of R-2 = 0.70 and 0.25 for 2009-2011 and 2011-2013 plantation phases, respectively. In addition, our results showed that the three band texture ratios yielded the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 54.54 kg m(-2)) compared to two texture (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 60.65 kg m(-2)) and single texture band combinations (R-2 = 0.64 and RMSE = 94.13 kg m(-2)). A frequency analysis was also run to determine which bands appeared more frequently in the selected texture band models. The frequency analysis revealed that both the red and green bands appeared more frequently on the selected texture band variables, indicating that they were more sensitive to the variation of AGB in our study area. The results showed high variation in AGB within the Buffelsdraai reforestation site, especially due to varying tree plantation phases as well as topography. In essence, the study demonstrated the possibility of image texture combinations computed from the SPOT-6 image in estimating AGB.

TI  - Survey of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and <i>Trichinella</i> spp. in hedgehogs living in proximity to urban areas in the Czech Republic
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hedgehogs (Mammalia: Erinaceidae) are omnivorous nocturnal animals typically living in anthropogenic areas. They may be suitable as sentinels for a wide range of zoonotic infections. Only a few studies have investigated hedgehogs (and then as representative wildlife species) to establish their role in the life cycle of such tissue parasites with zoonotic potential as Toxoplasma gondii or Trichinella spp. Working with frozen hedgehog cadavers, we tested for these parasites using T. gondii DNA-specific magnetic capture isolation plus polymerase chain reaction and Trichinella spp. digestion assay. All of 50 examined hedgehogs were negative for Trichinella spp. larvae in their muscles, but brain tissue from 5 out of 26 Erinaceus europaeus (19.2%) and 4 out of 24 E. roumanicus (16.6%) tested positive for T. gondii DNA. Frequency of T. gondii for both hedgehog species was equal, as was distribution between males and females and across age categories. Although a few studies have suggested the possibility of Trichinella spp. infection in hedgehogs, the zero prevalence in the tested hedgehogs is not surprising in view of the generally low prevalence of Trichinella spp. in Central Europe. Our results show that hedgehogs are susceptible to infection by T. gondii and can be used as indicator wildlife animal species in anthropogenic ecosystems.

TI  - Mitigating the Impact of Field and Image Registration Errors through Spatial Aggregation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data are commonly used as predictor variables in spatially explicit models depicting landscape characteristics of interest (response) across broad extents, at relatively fine resolution. To create these models, variables are spatially registered to a known coordinate system and used to link responses with predictor variable values. Inherently, this linking process introduces measurement error into the response and predictors, which in the latter case causes attenuation bias. Through simulations, our findings indicate that the spatial correlation of response and predictor variables and their corresponding spatial registration (co-registration) errors can have a substantial impact on the bias and accuracy of linear models. Additionally, in this study we evaluate spatial aggregation as a mechanism to minimize the impact of co-registration errors, assess the impact of subsampling within the extent of sample units, and provide a technique that can be used to both determine the extent of an observational unit needed to minimize the impact of co-registration and quantify the amount of error potentially introduced into predictive models.

TI  - The Potential of High Resolution (5 m) RapidEye Optical Data to Estimate Above Ground Biomass at the National Level over Tanzania
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we review the potential of high resolution optical satellite data to reduce the significant investment in resources required for a national field survey for producing estimates of above ground biomass (AGB). We use 5 m resolution RapidEye optical data to support a country wide biomass inventory with the objective of bringing to the attention of the traditional forestry sector the advantages of integrating remote sensing data in the planning and execution of field data acquisition. We analysed the relationship between AGB estimates from a subset of the national survey field plot data collected by the Tanzania Forest Service, with a set of remote sensing biophysical parameters extracted from a sample of fine spatial (5 m) resolution RapidEye images using a regression estimator. We processed RapidEye data using image segmentation for 76 sample sites each of 20 km by 20 km (covering 2.3% of the land area of the country) to image objects of 1 ha. We extracted reflectance and texture information from those objects which overlapped with the field plot data and tested correlations between the two using four different models: Two models from inferential statistics and two models from machine learning. The best results were found using the random forests algorithm (R-2 = 0.69). The most important explicative factor extracted from the remote sensing data was the shadow index, measuring the absorption of light in the visible bands. The model was then applied to all image objects on the RapidEye images to obtain AGB for each of the 76 sample sites, which were then interpolated to estimate the AGB stock at the national scale. Using the relative efficiency measure, we assessed the improvement that the introduction of remote sensing data brings to obtain an AGB estimate at the national level, with the same precision as the full survey. The improvement in the precision of the estimate (by reducing its variance) resulted in a relative efficiency of 3.2. This demonstrates that the introduction of remote sensing data at this fine resolution can substantially reduce the number of field plots required, in this case threefold.

TI  - Quad and compact multitemporal C-band PolSAR observations for crop characterization and monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring crop condition using optical satellite indices has a legacy of several decades. Early warning of variances in crop production is vital in mitigating regional and global food insecurity. Adoption of optical vegetation indices for this purpose is widespread, yet cloud cover impedes the acquisition of these data. Although early research using scatterometers and aircraft hinted at the sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) responses to crop development, the implementation of satellite SAR observations in operational crop condition monitoring is limited. In the research presented here, volume-to-surface (V/S) scattering ratios derived from C band RADARSAT-2 quad and simulated compact polarimetric (QP and CP) imagery are assessed for their potential to monitor crop growth. Both V/S ratios were strongly correlated with optical vegetation indices, including the widely adopted Normalized Difference and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indices. The changes in the ratio of volume to surface scattering were correlated with variations in crop biomass. The results support the potential of a SAR scattering ratio for crop condition monitoring. In particular, encouraging results were reported for compact polarimetry, a mode that can be implemented to deliver broader swath coverage conducive to regional and national monitoring.

TI  - Analysis of urban surface morphologic effects on diurnal thermal directional anisotropy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote thermal radiative observations over metropolitan areas are subject to an angular-dependent variation, known as the directional thermal anisotropy. The 3D urban surface morphology is one key factor in determining the magnitude and temporal variation of thermal anisotropy. This study uses 3D building data and the Town Energy Balance model (TEB) to explore the impact of morphological variability on diurnal anisotropy patterns, and quantifies errors introduced by a simplification of urban morphology as an array of evenly distributed uniform cubes. Results from the comparison of two representative urban districts in Brooklyn and midtown Manhattan, New York City reveal distinct diurnal anisotropy patterns. Daytime anisotropy varies more time sensitively over the compact high-rise district of Manhattan, although the maximum effective anisotropy (the maximum contrast of directional anisotropy) is smaller than Brooklyn, which is related to a reduced contrast among wall temperatures. A stronger angular effect at night is found as the aspect-ratio increases. The anisotropy is further simulated at the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) overpass time and sensor surface relative geometry over these two morphologic samples. The sensitivity test unravels that the effective anisotropy monotonically increases with a greater aspect ratio for MODIS nighttime overpasses, while the daytime pattern is more complex with a single- or double-peak distribution depending on the solar angle (or time of day). Finally, the variation of building height and size is important in determining the anisotropy from comparing simulations of a realistic 3D building model and a simplified urban morphology as cube array. The morphological simplification can lead to a higher discrepancy in these cases with a high aspect ratio or small sky view factor for both daytime and nighttime. The proposed 3D-computer-graphics approach is computationally affordable for the seen surface estimation and can be applied to IFOVs across a relatively large urban area. Its flexibility in integrating various levels of 3D urban surface complexity makes it a promising tool for correcting the urban thermal anisotropy from satellite observations in the future.

TI  - A new remote sensing index based on the pressure-state-response framework to assess regional ecological change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological indicators have widespread appeal to scientists, environmental managers, and the general public. Remote sensing is unique in its capability to record variety of spatio-temporal information on land surface with complete coverage, especially with regard to larger spatial scales, which has been proven to be an effective data source to create indicators to rapidly identify regional eco-environment. In this paper, a new index, remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) framework, was applied to assess regional ecological changes in Fuzhou City of Fujian Province, southeastern China, using Landsat ETM+/OLI/TIRS images. Taking the advantages of being totally free of artificial interference in the calculation using principal components analysis (PCA) to assign weights of each variable, the RSEI can assess the regional ecological status more objectively and easily. The effectivity of the new index was validated by four approaches, including point-based, classification-based, correlation-based, and urban-rural-gradient-based comparisons. The case study showed that Fuzhou has witnessed ecological improvement during the study period, with the value of RSEI increasing from 0.663 in 2000 to 0.675 in 2016. Spatial variation analysis showed that the poor level of RSEI distributed mostly in the central urban areas, and the ecological degradation was attributed to the fast expansion of the built-up area, characterized by increasing greatly in the value of the normalized differential built up and soil index (NDBSI) in such areas.

TI  - Integration of multi-resource remotely sensed data and allometric models for forest aboveground biomass estimation in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of forest aboveground biomass density (AGB) is useful in forest carbon cycle studies, biodiversity protection and climate-change mitigation actions. However, a finer resolution and spatially continuous forest AGB map is inaccessible at national level in China. In this study, we developed forest type- and ecozone-specific allometric models based on 1607 field plots. The allometric models were applied to Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data to calculate AGB at the footprint level. We then mapped a 30 m resolution national forest AGB by relating the GLAS footprint AGB to various variables derived from Landsat images and Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data. We estimated the average forest AGB to be 69.88 Mg/ha with a standard deviation of 35.38 Mg/ha and the total AGB carbon stock to be 5.44 PgC in China. Our AGB estimates corresponded reasonably well with AGB inventories from the top ten provinces in the forested area, and the coefficient of determination and root mean square error were 0.73 and 20.65 Mg/ha, respectively. We found that the main uncertainties for AGB estimation could be attributed to errors in allometric models and in height measurements by the GLAS. We also found that Landsat-derived variables outperform PALSAR-derived variables and that the textural features of PALSAR better support forest AGB estimates than backscattered intensity.

TI  - Detection of Helminthosporium Leaf Blotch Disease Based on UAV Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Helminthosporium leaf blotch (HLB) is a serious disease of wheat causing yield reduction globally. Usually, HLB disease is controlled by uniform chemical spraying, which is adopted by most farmers. However, increased use of chemical controls have caused agronomic and environmental problems. To solve these problems, an accurate spraying system must be applied. In this case, the disease detection over the whole field can provide decision support information for the spraying machines. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing for HLB detection. In this work, the UAV imagery acquisition and ground investigation were conducted in Central China on April 22th, 2017. Four disease categories (normal, light, medium, and heavy) were established based on different severity degrees. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed for HLB disease classification. The experiments on data preprocessing, classification, and hyper-parameters tuning were conducted. The overall accuracy and standard error of the CNN method was 91.43% and 0.83%, which outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy and stabilization. Especially for the detection of the diseased samples, the CNN method significantly outperformed others. Experimental results showed that the HLB infected areas and healthy areas can be precisely discriminated based on UAV remote sensing data, indicating that UAV remote sensing can be proposed as an efficient tool for HLB disease detection.

TI  - Rapid retrieval strategy for massive remote sensing metadata based on GeoHash coding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of Earth observation technology, satellite data centres have accumulated large amounts of remote sensing data from different spaceborne and airborne sensors. The efficient management and quick retrieval of multisource, massive and heterogeneous remote sensing data in the Big Data age have become increasingly important. In this paper, a spatio-temporal organization model based on GeoHash coding is proposed. First, based on the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard, the heterogeneous remote sensing metadata can be converted into a unified format, and the differences in the multisource remote sensing metadata are screened. Then, the GeoHash algorithm is used to encode and convert the latitude and longitude coordinates of the remote sensing metadata to reduce the remote sensing metadata dimensions under space retrieval conditions. Finally, by building an HBase key value model based on GeoHash, a primary key is used to realize the rapid retrieval of massive remote sensing metadata through the simulation of 1500 million remote sensing metadata retrieval experiments; by comparing with the traditional multi-conditional filtering retrievals, the results show that a spatio-temporal organization strategy for remote sensing metadata based on GeoHash coding can effectively improve the efficiency of remote sensing data retrievals.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrival Based on Sentinel-1 Imagery under Sparse Vegetation Coverage
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important aspect of heat transfer process and energy exchange between land-atmosphere systems, and it is a key link to the surface and groundwater circulation and land carbon cycles. In this study, according to the characteristics of the study area, an advanced integral equation model was used for numerical simulation analysis to establish a database of surface microwave scattering characteristics under sparse vegetation cover. Thus, a soil moisture retrieval model suitable for arid area was constructed. The results were as follows: (1) The response of the backscattering coefficient to soil moisture and associated surface roughness is significantly and logarithmically correlated under different incidence angles and polarization modes, and, a database of microwave scattering characteristics of arid soil surface under sparse vegetation cover was established. (2) According to the Sentinel-1 radar system parameters, a model for retrieving spatial distribution information of soil moisture was constructed; the soil moisture content information was extracted, and the results were consistent with the spatial distribution characteristics of soil moisture in the same period in the research area. (3) For the 0-10 cm surface soil moisture, the correlation coefficient between the simulated value and the measured value reached 0.8488, which means that the developed retrieval model has applicability to derive surface soil moisture in the oasis region of arid regions. This study can provide method for real-time and large-scale detection of soil moisture content in arid areas.

TI  - Assess river embankment impact on hydrologic alterations and floodplain vegetation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - For watersheds in arid regions, floodplain vegetation is critically important to maintain the ecosystem health and integrity of the watersheds. Hydrological conditions control the development and evolution of floodplain vegetation and ecosystems in these watersheds. River embankment will alter hydrology of the watersheds and result in floodplain vegetation and ecosystem changes. The present study proposes an approach combining onsite hydrologic monitoring, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) remote sensing imagery and GIS buffer analysis to assess river embankment impact on hydrologic alterations and floodplain vegetation. The approach is applied to the Tarim River watershed in China where a recently constructed embankment along both banks of the river provides an ideal study site for assess the impact of river embankment. The changes of shallow groundwater level, NDVI, and land use before and after constructing the embankment are analyzed. The results demonstrate the shallow groundwater levels decrease and groundwater salinity has been greatly increased. With reduced flood risk, more arable land has been established in the floodplain. Thus, natural vegetation generally decreases within 20 km from the embankment, impacted by both human activities and hydrologic alterations. A comprehensive study of floodplain ecosystem composition and structure change will improve our understanding of the impact of the embankment and hydrologic alterations and is warranted in the future.

TI  - Spatially varying relationships between surface urban heat islands and driving factors across cities in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global regression models, such as Ordinary Least Squares, are generally used to explore driving factors of surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects across large cities on a national level, but issues of spatial non-stationarity or local variations have rarely been taken into account. Our study quantifies SUHI effects for 274 cities in China with MODIS LST products and explores spatially varying relationships between SUHI intensity (SUHII) and their driving factors using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results show that GWR models have stronger explanatory power and lower spatial autocorrelations of residuals compared with ordinary least square models; the application of GWR models finds that the relationships between SUHII and the driving factors vary across China. Spatially varying coefficients from GWR models could contribute to the development of local-specific urban planning or policies in different regions. The findings from our investigation suggest that GWR has the potential to serve as a useful tool for environmental investigations on a national scale.

TI  - Spaceborne Satellite for Snow Cover and Hydrological Characteristic of the Gilgit River Basin, Hindukush-Karakoram Mountains, Pakistan
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indus River, which flows through China, India, and Pakistan, is mainly fed by melting snow and glaciers that are spread across the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya Mountains. The downstream population of the Indus Plain heavily relies on this water resource for drinking, irrigation, and hydropower generation. Therefore, its river runoff variability must be properly monitored. Gilgit Basin, the northwestern part of the Upper Indus Basin, is selected for studying cryosphere dynamics and its implications on river runoff. In this study, 8-day snow products (MOD10A2) of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, from 2001 to 2015 are selected to access the snow-covered area (SCA) in the catchment. A non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope are calculated to assess whether a significant trend exists in the SCA time series data. Then, data from ground observatories for 1995-2013 are analyzed to demonstrate annual and seasonal signals in air temperature and precipitation. Results indicate that the annual and seasonal mean of SCA show a non-significant decreasing trend, but the autumn season shows a statistically significant decreasing SCA with a slope of -198.36 km(2)/year. The annual mean temperature and precipitation show an increasing trend with highest values of slope 0.05 degrees C/year and 14.98 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficients are calculated for the hydro-meteorological data to demonstrate any possible relationship. The SCA is affirmed to have a highly negative correlation with mean temperature and runoff. Meanwhile, SCA has a very weak relation with precipitation data. The Pearson correlation coefficient between SCA and runoff is -0.82, which confirms that the Gilgit River runoff largely depends on the melting of snow cover rather than direct precipitation. The study indicates that the SCA slightly decreased for the study period, which depicts a possible impact of global warming on this mountainous region.

TI  - Large-Scale Landscape Drivers of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, DOC, and DIC in Boreal River Networks
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The boreal biome is characterized by extremely dense and complex fluvial networks that are closely coupled to land. Reconstructing the role that these fluvial networks play in regional carbon (C) budgets requires identifying landscape and environmental drivers of riverine C that operate at the whole network scale and that can be applied across landscapes. Here we explore drivers of CO2, CH4, and dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic C (DIC) across 190 streams and rivers spanning 8 Strahler orders over an area of 500,000 km(2) of heterogeneous boreal landscape in Quebec, focusing on those drivers that can be readily obtained from remote sensing data. Each C species (except DIC) could be modeled as a function of a proximal network-scale property, such as flow distance or elevation, but adding regional structure to these models greatly improved predictions. These modeled regional effects were similar for DOC, CO2, and CH4 and were strongly related to average regional soil organic content and especially to NPP, the latter integrating regional differences in climate and other environmental factors. These results suggest that there may be regional C baselines determined by a combination of landscape and climate features, which simultaneously influence the average CO2, DOC, and CH4 within fluvial networks, albeit through different underlying mechanisms and with varying degrees of influence on each C species. The latter two C species appear to be more sensitive to regional differences in soil, NPP, and climate than CO2 or DIC, and therefore more likely to shift under future scenarios of change in northern landscapes.

TI  - Lake level changes in the Tibetan Plateau from Cryosat-2, SARAL, ICESat, and Jason-2 altimeters
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake level change in the Tibetan Plateau is an important indicator for regional and global climate changes. We use altimeter data from Cryosat-2, SARAL, ICESat, and Jason-2 to detect lake level changes at different spatial and temporal resolutions over 2003 - 2017 (Jason-3 data in 2017 for validation). Cryosat-2's SARIn mode provides precise water level time series over 59 lakes. SARAL's waveforms are retracked to generate near monthly, high-quality measurements at 31 lakes. Jason-2 provides a reference for removing inter-altimeter biases, enabling coherent records over lakes with Jason-2 passes. After a decade of rise since the ICESat record of 2003, the lake levels of Nam Co, Selin Co, Ngangzi Co, and Chibuzhang Co became flat in 2014 - 2016 and started to fluctuate or decline after 2016. Such positive-flat-negative trends are consistent with the trend variations of mass change from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). SARAL detected persistent lake level declines over 2013 - 2016 in southern Tibet that may signify the onset of decadal reduced flows of the Yarlung Tsangpo and Brahmaputra River that could affect the water supply for their downstream regions in India and Bangladesh. Cryosat-2 and Jason-2 detected sudden lake level rises and falls around Zhuonai, Kusai, and Salt Lake associated with a 2011 lake outburst, which is confirmed by lake volume changes from two Landsat-7 images. With a careful processing and calibration, multiple altimeters allow for determining and cross-validating long-term and episodic lake level changes unachievable by a single altimeter.

TI  - Spirituality and Ethnocultural Empathy Among Italian Adolescents: The Mediating Role of Religious Identity Formation Processes
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study examined the unique and combined roles of spirituality and religious identity formation processes on ethnocultural empathy among Italian youth. Spirituality was conceptualized as a desire for self-transcendence. Ethnocultural empathy entails concern for those of other cultural backgrounds. It was hypothesized that spirituality would predict ethnocultural empathy indirectly by way of religious identity commitment and in-depth exploration. Religious identity commitment is the extent to which people have invested in a particular religious worldview and community, whereas religious identity in-depth exploration is the degree to which they are actively seeking to learn more about their religious belief system. The sample included 301 Italian adolescents. Structural equation modeling revealed that spirituality positively and strongly predicted both mediators (i.e., religious identity commitment and in-depth exploration) and that it had a moderate, positive direct link to ethnocultural empathy. The mediators were in turn significantly related to ethnocultural empathy, with the link being negative for commitment but positive for in-depth exploration. Finally, both of these indirect paths from spirituality to ethnocultural empathy were statistically significant. This suggests that spirituality may improve prosocial relations with those of other cultures by encouraging people to further explore their religious worldviews.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of OLCI Imagery over Extremely Turbid Waters Based on the Red, NIR and 1016 nm Bands and a New Baseline Residual Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A common approach to the pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction of satellite water colour imagery is to calculate aerosol and water reflectance at two spectral bands, typically in the near infra-red (NIR, 700-1000 nm) or the short-wave-infra-red (SWIR, 1000-3000 nm), and then extrapolate aerosol reflectance to shorter wavelengths. For clear waters, this can be achieved simply for NIR bands, where the water reflectance can be assumed negligible i.e., the "black water" assumption. For moderately turbid waters, either the NIR water reflectance, which is non-negligible, must be modelled or longer wavelength SWIR bands, with negligible water reflectance, must be used. For extremely turbid waters, modelling of non-zero NIR water reflectance becomes uncertain because the spectral slopes of water and aerosol reflectance in the NIR become similar, making it difficult to distinguish between them. In such waters the use of SWIR bands is definitely preferred and the use of the MODIS bands at 1240 nm and 2130 nm is clearly established although, on many sensors such as the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), such SWIR bands are not included. Instead, a new, cheaper SWIR band at 1016 nm is available on OLCI with potential for much better atmospheric correction over extremely turbid waters. That potential is tested here. In this work, we demonstrate that for spectrally-close band triplets (such as OLCI bands at 779-865-1016 nm), the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance of the triplet's "middle" band after baseline subtraction (or baseline residual, BLR) is essentially independent of the atmospheric conditions. We use the three BLRs defined by three consecutive band triplets of the group of bands 620-709-779-865-1016 nm to calculate water reflectance and hence aerosol reflectance at these wavelengths. Comparison with standard atmospheric correction algorithms shows similar performance in moderately turbid and clear waters and a considerable improvement in extremely turbid waters.

TI  - Breast Cancer Systemic Treatments and Upper Limb Lymphedema: A Risk-Assessment Platform Encompassing Tumor-Specific Pathological Features Reveals the Potential Role of Trastuzumab
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is frequent but strategies for an individualized risk assessment are lacking. We aimed to define whether tumor-specific pathological features, coupled with clinical and therapeutic data, could help identify patients at risk. Data from 368 patients with node-positive breast cancers were retrospectively collected, including 75 patients with BCRL (0.4-25.6 years follow-up). BCRL was assessed during the standard follow-up oncology visits using the circumferential measurement. Clinicopathologic and therapeutic factors associated with BCRL were integrated into a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was more common in BCRL patients (n = 33, 44% vs. n = 85, 29%, p = 0.01), akin extra nodal extension (ENE) of the metastasis (n = 57, 76% vs. n = 180, 61%, p = 0.02). Sentinel lymph node excision without axillary dissection and extra-axillary radiotherapy were BCRL-unrelated. A higher number of BCRL-positive patients were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab, compared to BCRL-negative patients (p < 0.01). Treatment with trastuzumab and/or taxanes, adjusted for systemic infections, laterality, therapy, and pathological features (i.e., LVI and ENE), had a significant impact in BCRL-free survival (p < 0.01). This work offers new insights on BCRL risk stratification, where the integration of clinical, therapeutic, and tumor-specific pathological data suggests a possible role of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy in BCRL pathogenesis.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Extension in Breast Cancer Between Under and Overtreatment Analysis of a series of cases and literature review
T2  - REVISTA DE CHIMIE
M3  - Review
AB  - The surgical management of breast cancer tumors depends not only on knowing the right histological type of tumor, but also on identifying the grade of axillary node invasion and the presence of metastases. Unfortunately, due to a lack of general understanding of how these tumors actually spread and their path towards axillary lymph nodes, there is a tendency of over or undertreating patients in the surgical environment. Even though we now have the Sentinel Ganglion method to help us, we haven't decided on a universally accepted algorithm in the management of this disease. Many studies are still needed in order to fully clarify the most appropriate surgical management for each type of tumor and the level of axillary node dissection. Multiple factors should be taken into account when managing the case of a patient suffering from breast cancer and faced with the need of an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We have tried to identify some of these factors based on the experience of our clinic and available literature. The factors identified are the positive SLN (Sentinel Lymphatic Node) aspect, the differentiation between micro and macrometastases, the use of the S classification of SLN and microanatomic location of SLN metastases and the microanatomic location (MAL) of the tumor deposit in the sentinel ganglion.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study simulates and predicts the urban environment growth in the Tehran, capital of Iran, using the remote sensing data, multi-layer perceptron neural network, zonal, trend, and profile modeling. A spatial-temporal modeling was used for the analysis and prediction of the urban environment development. After building the probability map of the land changes, random points scatter and kernel analysis (RPSKA) was used. The pixel values of all the maps was extracted to the random points for the scatter plot and kernel analysis. The results obtained by developing the change transition model using multi-layer perceptron neural network showed high accuracy in most of the sub-models. The area of the open lands and green spaces was reduced, and urban areas, agricultural lands, and clay plains were increased. Most of the land use and land cover (LULC) changes during the period 1990-2000 were observed in the north, while the most land use and land cover changes during the period 2000-2016 were observed in the west. The results of RPSKA were shown the direct and inverse relationship between the probability of land changes and the other factor maps. Sever changes have occurred from the open lands to the urban areas. The slope and the population density had more effect on the changes. Modeling of future LULC change showed that the urban areas would be increased, while open lands and green spaces would be decreased. These land changes have taken place in the north and west of the city that these regions were most popular and had suitable infrastructures for developments.

TI  - Detection and Monitoring of Forest Fires Using Himawari-8 Geostationary Satellite Data in South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary satellite remote sensing systems are a useful tool for forest fire detection and monitoring because of their high temporal resolution over large areas. In this study, we propose a combined 3-step forest fire detection algorithm (i.e., thresholding, machine learning-based modeling, and post processing) using Himawari-8 geostationary satellite data over South Korea. This threshold-based algorithm filtered the forest fire candidate pixels using adaptive threshold values considering the diurnal cycle and seasonality of forest fires while allowing a high rate of false alarms. The random forest (RF) machine learning model then effectively removed the false alarms from the results of the threshold-based algorithm (overall accuracy similar to 99.16%, probability of detection (POD) similar to 93.08%, probability of false detection (POFD) similar to 0.07%, and 96% reduction of the false alarmed pixels for validation), and the remaining false alarms were removed through post-processing using the forest map. The proposed algorithm was compared to the two existing methods. The proposed algorithm (POD similar to 93%) successfully detected most forest fires, while the others missed many small-scale forest fires (POD similar to 50-60%). More than half of the detected forest fires were detected within 10 min, which is a promising result when the operational real-time monitoring of forest fires using more advanced geostationary satellite sensor data (i.e., with higher spatial and temporal resolutions) is used for rapid response and management of forest fires.

TI  - Digital Aerial Photogrammetry for Uneven-Aged Forest Management: Assessing the Potential to Reconstruct Canopy Structure and Estimate Living Biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientifically robust yet economical and efficient methods are required to gather information about larger areas of uneven-aged forest resources, particularly at the landscape level, to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and to support the sustainable management of forest resources. In this study, we examined the potential of digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) for assessing uneven-aged forest resources. Specifically, we tested the performance of biomass estimation by varying the conditions of several factors, e.g., image downscaling, vegetation metric extraction (point cloud- and canopy height model (CHM)-derived), modeling method ((simple linear regression (SLR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and random forest (RF)), and season (leaf-on and leaf-off). We built dense point clouds and CHMs using high-resolution aerial imagery collected in leaf-on and leaf-off conditions of an uneven-aged mixed conifer-broadleaf forest. DAP-derived vegetation metrics were then used to predict the dominant height and living biomass (total, conifer, and broadleaf) at the plot level. Our results demonstrated that image downscaling had a negative impact on the accuracy of the dominant height and biomass estimation in leaf-on conditions. In comparison to CHM-derived vegetation metrics, point cloud-derived metrics performed better in dominant height and biomass (total and conifer) estimations. Although the SLR (%RMSE = 21.1) and MLR (%RMSE = 18.1) modeling methods produced acceptable results for total biomass estimations, RF modeling significantly improved the plot-level total biomass estimation accuracy (%RMSE of 12.0 for leaf-on data). Overall, leaf-on DAP performed better in total biomass estimation compared to leaf-off DAP (%RMSE of 15.0 using RF modeling). Nevertheless, conifer biomass estimation accuracy improved when leaf-off data were used (from a %RMSE of 32.1 leaf-on to 23.8 leaf-off using RF modeling). Leaf-off DAP had a negative impact on the broadleaf biomass estimation (%RMSE > 35% for SLR, MLR, and RF modeling). Our results demonstrated that the performance of forest biomass estimation for uneven-aged forests varied with statistical representations as well as data sources. Thus, it would be appropriate to explore different statistical approaches (e.g., parametric and nonparametric) and data sources (e.g., different image resolutions, vegetation metrics, and leaf-on and leaf-off data) to inform the interpretation of remotely sensed data for biomass estimation for uneven-aged forest resources.

TI  - Long-Term Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Fractional Vegetation Cover Product Derived From MODIS and AVHRR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term global land surface fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data are essential for global climate modeling, earth surface process simulations, and related applications. However, high quality and long time series global FVC products remain scarce, although several FVC products have been generated using remote sensing data. This study aims to use the previously proposed Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (denoted as GLASS-MODIS FVC) to generate a long term GLASS FVC product from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data (denoted as GLASS-AVHRR FVC) back to year 1981. The GLASS-AVHRR FVC algorithm adopted the multivariate adaptive regression splines method, which was trained using samples extracted from the GLASS-MODIS FVC product and the corresponding red and near-infrared band reflectances of the preprocessed AVHRR reflectance data from 2003 over the global sampling locations. The GLASS-AVHRR FVC product has a temporal resolution of eight days and a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. Through comparison of the GLASS-AVHRR and GLASS-MODIS FVC products from 2013, good temporal and spatial consistencies were observed, which confirmed the reliability of the GLASS-AVHRR FVC product. Furthermore, direct validation using field FVC measurement based reference data indicated that the performance of the GLASS-AVHRR FVC product (R-2 = 0.834, RMSE = 0.145) was slightly superior to that of the popular long term GEOV1 FVC product (R-2 = 0.799, RMSE = 0.174).

The height that is derived from altimetry measurement is ellipsoidal height. In order to convert the ellipsoidal height to orthometric height, which has physical meaning, accurate estimates of the geoid are needed. This paper evaluates the suitability of geodetic altimetric measurements for improvement of global geoid models over a large lake in the Tibetan Plateau. CryoSat-2 and SARAL/AltiKa are used to derive the high-frequency geoid correction. A validation of the local geoid correction is performed with data from in-situ observations, a laser altimetry satellite (ICESat), a Ka-band radar altimetry satellite (SARAL) and a SAR radar altimetry satellite (Sentinel-3). Results indicate that the geodetic altimetric dataset can capture the high-resolution geoid information. By applying local geoid correction, the precision of ICESat, SARAL and Sentinel-3 retrievals are significantly improved. We conclude that using geodetic altimetry to correct for local geoid residual over large lakes significantly decreases the uncertainty of WSE estimates. These results also indicate the potential of geodetic altimetry missions to determine local geoid residual with centimeter-level accuracy, which can be used to improve global and regional geopotential models.

TI  - Pansharpening with a Gradient Domain GIF Based on NSST
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the fusion quality of multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images, a pansharpening method with a gradient domain guided image filter (GIF) that is based on non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) is proposed. First, multi-scale decomposition of MS and PAN images is performed by NSST. Second, different fusion rules are designed for high- and low-frequency coefficients. A fusion rule that is based on morphological filter-based intensity modulation (MFIM) technology is proposed for the low-frequency coefficients, and the edge refinement is carried out based on a gradient domain GIF to obtain the fused low-frequency coefficients. For the high-frequency coefficients, a fusion rule based on an improved pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) is adopted. The gradient domain GIF optimizes the firing map of the PCNN model, and then the fusion decision map is calculated to guide the fusion of the high-frequency coefficients. Finally, the fused high- and low-frequency coefficients are reconstructed with inverse NSST to obtain the fusion image. The proposed method was tested using the WorldView-2 and QuickBird data sets; the subjective visual effects and objective evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods, and it can efficiently improve the spatial quality and spectral maintenance.

TI  - Development of a snow kernel to better model the anisotropic reflectance of pure snow in a kernel-driven BRDF model framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The linear kernel-driven RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model was originally developed from the simplified scenarios of continuous and discrete vegetation canopies, and has been widely used to fit multiangle observations of vegetation-soil systems of the land surface in many fields. Although this model was not developed explicitly for snow surfaces, it can capture the geometric-optical effect caused by the shadowing of rugged or undulating snow surfaces. However, in this study, this model has been further developed to better characterize the scattering properties of snow surface, which can also exhibit strongly forward-scattering behavior. This study proposes a new snow kernel to characterize the reflectance anisotropy of pure snow based on the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) model that assumes snow can be modeled as a semi-infinite, plane-parallel, weakly absorbing light scattering layer. This new snow kernel adopts a correction term with a free parameter a to correct the analytic form of the ART model that has been reported to underestimate observed snow reflectance in the forward scattering direction in the principal plane (PP), particularly in cases of a large viewing zenith angle (> 60 degrees). This snow kernel has now been implemented in the kernel-driven RTLSR BRDF model framework in conjunction with two additional kernels (i.e., the volumetric scattering kernel and geometric-optical scattering kernel) and is validated using observed and simulated multiangle data from three data sources. Pure snow targets were selected from the extensive archive of the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) BRDF data. Antarctic snow field measurements, which were taken from the top of a 32-m-tall tower at Dome C Station and include 6336 spectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs), were also utilized. Finally, a set of simulated BRFs, generated by a hybrid scattering snow model that combines the geometric optics with vector radiative transfer theory, were used to further assess the proposed method. We first retrieve the value of the free parameter a for a comprehensive analysis using single multiangle snow data with a sufficient BRDF sampling. Then, we determine the optimally fixed value of the a parameter as prior information for potential users. The new snow kernel method is shown to be quite accurate, presenting a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = similar to 0.9) and a negligible bias between the modeled BRFs and the various snow BRDF validation data. The finding demonstrates that this snow kernel provides an improved potential compared to that of the original kernel-driven model framework for a pure snow surface in many applications, particularly those involving the global water cycle and radiation budget, where snow cover plays an important role.

TI  - Intertidal area classification with generalized extreme value distribution and Markov random field in quad-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of intertidal area in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is an important yet challenging issue when considering the complicatedly and dramatically changing features of tidal fluctuation. The difficulty of intertidal area classification is compounded because a high proportion of this area is frequently flooded by water, making statistical modeling methods with spatial contextual information often ineffective. Because polarimetric entropy and anisotropy play significant roles in characterizing intertidal areas, in this paper we propose a novel unsupervised contextual classification algorithm. The key point of the method is to combine the generalized extreme value (GEV) statistical model of the polarization features and the Markov random field (MRF) for contextual smoothing. A goodness-of-fit test is added to determine the significance of the components of the statistical model. The final classification results are obtained by effectively combining the results of polarimetric entropy and anisotropy. Experimental results of the polarimetric data obtained by the Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR satellite demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed classification algorithm.

TI  - Thickness and freeboard statistics of Arctic Multi-year Ice in late summer: Three, recent drilling campaigns
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper targets three, diverse audiences: persons calculating ice loads on structures, persons navigating icecovered waters, and persons using remotely sensed data to estimate ice thickness. The most extensive set of drilling measurements to have been made on thick multi-year ice since the 1980s is presented based upon 22 floes sampled in some of the most remote regions in the world from years 2007 to 2011. Thickness and freeboard measurements from more than 600 drill-holes indicated that mean thicknesses and standard deviations of floes in Nares Strait, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) and the Beaufort Sea ranged from 3.4 +/- 1.3 m to 14.7 +/- 3.8 m. Approximately 23% of the floes had an average thickness of 10 m or more, making them comparable to the 8 to 12 m thick hummock that caused the highest loads ever measured on the offshore structure Molikpaq. The continued presence of thick multi-year ice shows that, although the modal thickness of thermodynamically grown old ice has decreased, driving forces continue to create deformed mull-year ice. The overall thickness distribution of thermodynamically grown and mechanically deformed mull-year ice is lognormally distributed in all of the examined geographic regions. Probability of exceedance curves were used to address underestimated probabilities in the tail. Assessment of first order autocorrelation coefficients showed that drill hole measurements were statistically independent for similar to 85% of the 100 to 200 m long transects. Linear regressions of freeboard versus thickness had less predictive skill at the point-scale (R-2 of 0.57, 10 m spacing) than averages at the transect-scale (R-2 of 0.78, similar to 100 m) and floe-scale (R-2 of 0.88, up to similar to 1 km). The anomalously high freeboard of some drill holes, transects and floes has a number of plausible explanations including loose ice blocks on the underside of relatively level floes, ice blocks in the keel of deformed floes, elevated blocks on the top surface of relatively level ice without a keel, and/or the low density of the elevated and submerged portions of multi-year ice.

TI  - How dielectric breakdown may contribute to the global weathering of regolith on the moon
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space weathering is an important process on airless bodies, and it must be considered when interpreting data from planetary missions. Previous work has shown that solar energetic particles may cause dielectric breakdown in regolith within permanently shadowed regions near the poles of the Moon. Here, we predict that dielectric breakdown weathering could have melted and/or vaporized 2 - 9% of gardened (i.e., thoroughly mixed) regolith at the equator and 5 - 11% near the poles. If so, then similar to 3 - 10% of all gardened regolith on the Moon may have experienced dielectric breakdown, and this process must be considered when analyzing remote sensing data or soil samples returned by the Luna and Apollo missions.

TI  - SMAD7 is a novel independent predictor of survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Overexpression of SMAD7-a hallmark inhibitor of transforming growth factor 8 (TGF9) signaling has been documented and related with adverse prognosis in a number of epithelial malignancies, suggesting that it may be responsible for resistance to TGF beta-induced growth arrest of cancer cells. The involvement of SMAD7 in development and progression of malignant melanoma is unclear, and its expression has not been characterized so far at the protein level in clinical melanoma tissue samples. We evaluated SMAD7 expression in 205 skin melanoma primary tumors by immunohistochemistry and correlated the findings with clinicopathological profiles of patients. Melanocytic SMAD7 was evidenced in 204 cases, and the expression pattern was predominantly nuclear. High expression of SMAD7 was positively associated with several features of tumor aggressiveness, for example, presence of ulceration (P < 0.001), higher tumor thickness (P < 0.001), and mitotic rate (P < 0.001), but not presence of regional or distant metastases. Moreover, high SMAD7 expression independently predicted unfavorable outcome: melanoma specific survival (hazard ratio = 3.16, P < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.88, P < 0.001). Taken together, our results underline the importance of TGF beta signaling in cancer and define SMAD7 as a marker of aggressive tumor behavior and adverse clinical outcomes in melanoma patients.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing for disaster management support: A holistic and staged approach based on case studies in Sentinel Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is one of the primary support tools for disaster management. The Sentinel Asia (SA) initiative was established in 2006 as a collaboration between regional space agencies and disaster management agencies, applying space technology (including representative satellite remote sensing) and Web-GIS technology to assist in disaster management of the Asia-Pacific region. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) worked to establish the SA framework and determine the implementation plan as an SA secretariat. SA can be regarded as an empirical research project to study how satellite remote sensing can support disaster management, in collaboration with users. This paper derives requirements for applying satellite remote sensing to disaster management support via a holistic (including human factors) and staged approach based on case studies in SA.

TI  - Semantic Interoperability for IoT Platforms in Support of Decision Making: An Experiment on Early Wildfire Detection
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main obstacles towards the promotion of IoT adoption and innovation is data interoperability. Facilitating cross-domain interoperability is expected to be the core element for the realisation of the next generation of the IoT computing paradigm that is already taking shape under the name of Internet of Everything (IoE). In this article, an analysis of the current status on IoT semantic interoperability is presented that leads to the identification of a set of generic requirements that act as fundamental design principles for the specification of interoperability enabling solutions. In addition, an extension of NGSIv2 data model and API (de-facto) standards is proposed aiming to bridge the gap among IoT and social media and hence to integrate user communities with cyber-physical systems. These specifications have been utilised for the implementation of the IoT2Edge interoperability enabling mechanism which is evaluated within the context of a catastrophic wildfire incident that took place in Greece on July 2018. Weather data, social media activity, video recordings from the fire, sensor measurements and satellite data, linked to the location and the time of this fire incident have been collected, modeled in a uniform manner and fed to an early fire detection decision support system. The findings of the experiment certify that achieving minimum data interoperability with light-weight, plug-n-play mechanisms can be realised with significant benefits for our society.

TI  - Integrated Multiscale Method for Obtaining Accurate Forest Surface Area Statistics over Large Areas
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest surface area is a fundamental input for forest-related research, such as carbon balance, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem functioning and services. However, an accurate assessment of the area of forestland in China is not available because the forested area is usually calculated as a 2D projected area rather than a 3D surface area, and the impact of changes in the surface terrain on the area is ignored. In this study, we propose an integrated multiscale method that combines geomorphic regionalization and surface area algorithms to calculate the forest surface area in China. The results show that (1) China's forested area is approximately 4.91% larger than the conventional estimates and corresponds to a carbon storage estimate that is approximately 383.72 million tons higher; (2) the integrated multiscale method exhibits good adaptability and high precision for large-scale surface area calculations; and (3) the calculation results of this method are superior to those of remote sensing data or single surface area algorithms, and the calculation efficiency is high.

TI  - Detecting migrant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea: Using Sentinel-2 images to aid humanitarian actions
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of migration by sea is often accompanied by a great deal of risk for the migrants. The need for reliable and on time information on migrant movements is essential, especially as the available information is often limited or inconsistent. The aim of this paper is to show how freely available Sentinel-2 optical images over large areas can support humanitarian actions with timely and accurate geospatial information by providing the exact location of vessels at sea at the time of satellite acquisition. With the proposed detection method, we would like to distance ourselves from border surveillance and fight against clandestine migration as the first associations when dealing with movements of people using satellite technology. Instead, we would like to provide a better understanding of the situation for relieve authorities. Using Sentinel-2 data we have developed an automatic vessel detection and classification procedure. By first removing land from the images with the use of Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) we obtained a sea mask. We then applied a "vessel index", which eliminates most of the atmospherics influences that can significantly weaken the detection results from optical images, and binomial logistic regression on the sea mask to obtain segments of possible vessels. We calculated a group of geometrical and spectral attributes of detected segments and removed all non-vessel segments based on the value of segments area. Later we implemented classification using decision tree classifier. Finally, we performed an accuracy assessment of vessel classification. The results demonstrate that the methodology gives a reliable outcome in a timely and consistent manner but can overlook smaller vessels (the length less than 20 m). Freely available satellite technology can, therefore, offer an efficient and effective solution for frequent monitoring and tracking of vessels in real time across large areas. This approach would give effective results when complementary with other methods for search and rescue of migrants to help reduce the intolerable death toll of refugees while crossing the sea.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Coastal Vulnerability Assessment Studies along Andhra Pradesh, India: A Critical Evaluation of Data Gathering, Risk Levels and Mitigation Strategies
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - The establishment and alteration of any coastal feature is largely dependent upon complex hydrological and geomorphologic processes. Therefore, understanding hazard factors and threat risk level is crucial for mitigating risk in coastal zones. This study examines coastal vulnerability factors and their influence along the Coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) region in India. CAP has been exposed to frequent hydrological and meteorological hazards due to variations in the geographical, geological, and bathymetric characteristics. Despite substantial vulnerabilities, the risk to the coastline of Andhra Pradesh has not been rigorously evaluated. The current research systematically reviews the drivers and effects of hazards and vulnerabilities in CAP. Findings indicate that urban cities have a considerably higher risk of cyclones and floods due to their locations on the Bay of Bengal tectonic plate, the topology of this coastal region, and higher population density. The study revealed that the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) data along CAP is mostly gathered using low-resolution satellite data and/or field observation surveys. The study further revealed that there are very few existing mitigation strategies developed or discussed within the obtained results. However, more accurate data gathering techniques for coastal vulnerability factors are available such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Air-borne and LiDAR sensors, which provide very high resolution data and low-cost accessibility to physically inaccessible places, making them suitable for vulnerability data collection in coastal locations. These findings are useful for stakeholders seeking to reduce or ameliorate the impact of coastal disasters and their impacts on the CAP economy, environment, and population. The study further helps to reduce the existing shortcomings in the assessment techniques used previously.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images provide spatially explicit information on forest change covering wide areas. In this study, bistatic TanDEM-X (TDX) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data were used to derive digital surface models (DSMs) of forest areas using SAR interferometry (InSAR). The capability of change features derived from bitemporal InSAR DSMs to detect forest height (90th percentile of canopy height distribution, H90) and density variations was investigated. Moreover, changes in the forest above-ground biomass (AGB) were estimated from height changes between two InSAR DSMs. Bi-temporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, aerial orthoimages and an ALS-based AGB change map from a study area in Southern Finland were used as references. The results indicate that the InSAR height change of a forested area correlates more with vegetation density change than with height change. The correlation between the InSAR mean height change and the height change feature from ALS was 0.76 at stand level. Correspondingly, the correlation between the InSAR mean height change and the ALS penetration rate change was 0.89. The AGB changes predicted based on InSAR height change agreed well with the reference data; the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 20.7 Mg/ha (18.5% of the mean biomass in 2012) at stand level and 27.4 Mg/ha (27.0%) for 16 x 16 m grid cells. The results show that TDX DSMs can be used to detect biomass changes of different orders of magnitude, e.g. due to logging and thinning.

TI  - Critical Junctures and Conditions of Change: Exploring the Fall of Prison Populations in US States
T2  - SOCIAL & LEGAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - State prison populations in the United States have been regularly declining since 2009, and, at the end of 2014, the combined federal and state prison population was at its lowest level since 2005. Criminologists were caught by surprise by this development in the country that epitomized contemporary 'mass incarceration'. Their theoretical accounts were steeped in a 'punitive worldview' that left no space for the stabilization and eventual decline in mass incarceration in the United States. This article focuses on policy processes, rather than structural conditions, as drivers of penal change. The article begins with an overview of theories of punishment and their shortcomings. The framework that guides our study is based on the concept of 'critical junctures', which are seedbeds of long-term transformative change that present opportunities and constraints for actors in the penal field. The empirical research presented here analyses the adoption of legal reforms aimed at reducing mass incarceration by the 50 US states. We find that a trifecta of conflicting actors - legal, political and public - accounts for the complex and sometimes contradictory ways in which states move towards penal reform.

TI  - Development of a new dust index NDLI for Asian dust extraction system based on Aqua MODIS data and monitoring of trans-boundary Asian dust events in Japan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy Asian dust events occur due to the strong wind in the Gobi deserts and are occasionally carried to Korea, Japan, and North America. They cause problems in human lives, such as respiratory diseases, transportation disturbances due to reduce visibility, and other disruptions in social activities. Remote sensing technology is useful for detecting and monitoring such airborne dust and understanding the distributions and movements of dust. To understand the Asian dust events, in this study, a new dust index is developed for the efficient detection of airborne Asian dust, which is a composite of two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) indices: Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD) and Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI). Our proposed Normalized Dust Layer Index (NDLI) detects dust more efficiently. To identify the characteristics of annual Asian dust events in Japan, a statistical time-series analysis of data from the years 2010, 2013 and 2014 is performed, and it is found that the dust events in 2014 were relatively calmer than those in 2013. An evaluation that was based on ground observations over different sites in Japan indicated that the proposed method performed well. Finally, we integrated our NDLI product into the trans-boundary air pollution satellite image database (TAPSIDB) system for monitoring Asian dust events.

TI  - InSAR-based Glacier Velocity Mapping in the Parlung Zangbo River Basin, Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By applying the method of SAR interferometry to X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of COSMO-SkyMed, detailed motion patterns of five glaciers in the Parlung Zangbo River basin, Tibetan Plateau, in January 2010 have been derived. The results indicate that flow patterns are generally constrained by the valley geometry and terrain complexity. The maximum of 123.9 ma(-1) is observed on glacier No.1 and the minimum of 39.4 ma(-1) is found on glacier No.3. The mean values of five glaciers are between 22.9 and 98.2 ma(-1). Glaciers No.1, No.2, No.4 and No.5 exhibit high velocities in their upper sections with big slope and low velocities in the lower sections. A moraine lake accelerates the speed of mass exchange leading to a fast flow at the terminal of glacier No.3. These glaciers generally move along the direction of decreased elevation and present a macroscopic illustration of the motion from the northwest to the southeast. The accuracy of DEM and registration conditions of DEM-simulated terrain phases has certain effects on calculations of glacier flow direction and velocity. The error field is relatively fragmented in areas inconsistent with the main flow line of the glaciers, and the shape and uniformity of glacier are directly related to the continuous distribution of flow velocity errors.

TI  - Marketing and Sustainability: Business as Usual or Changing Worldviews?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Marketing, and the business schools within which most marketing academics and researchers work, have a fraught relationship with sustainability. Marketing is typically regarded as encouraging overconsumption and contributing to global change yet, simultaneously, it is also promoted as a means to enable sustainable consumption. Based on a critical review of the literature, the paper responds to the need to better understand the underpinnings of marketing worldviews with respect to sustainability. The paper discusses the concept of worldviews and their transformation, sustainability's articulation in marketing and business schools, and the implications of the market logic dominance in faculty mind-sets. This is timely given that business schools are increasingly positioning themselves as a positive contributor to sustainability. Institutional barriers, specifically within universities, business schools, and the marketing discipline, are identified as affecting the ability to effect bottom-up' change. It is concluded that if institutions, including disciplines and business schools, remain wedded to assumptions regarding the compatibility between the environment and economic growth and acceptance of market forces then the development of alternative perspectives on sustainability remains highly problematic.

TI  - Synergies Between Space and Energy: Space as a Tool to Support European Energy Goals
T2  - SPACE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The space and energy sector have similar sustainable ambitions and face similar technological difficulties, providing numerous occasions for learning, collaborating and creating economic and societal value. Adopting space technology and applications within the energy sector offers many high-potential opportunities worth exploring. Space can serve as an enabler for revolutionizing the energy sector by providing information on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency to facilitate the energy transition and support decision and policy-makers in developing, implementing, and monitoring various energy policy areas such as energy resource management and energy transport. Political interest in this topic is rising, and multiple high-level discussions took place in Europe in 2018 to gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and enablers for space as a tool to support European energy policy. This article draws on the insights from two dedicated events to highlight the most prominent opportunities and enablers. The outcomes of these events provide a source of inspiration for policy development, investment decisions, and R&D proposals to further stimulate space as an enabler for sustainable economic growth in the energy sector.

TI  - The state of six dangerous glacial lakes in the Nepalese Himalaya
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Himalaya are increasingly retreating and thinning due to climate change. This process is the primary cause of glacial lakes expansion and has increased the possibilities of the glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that have been responsible for heavy loss of life and damage to downstream infrastructures. This study examines the status of the existing potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the Nepalese Himalaya such as Imja Tsho, Tsho Rolpa, Thulagi, Chamlang South, Barun Tsho, and Lumding Tsho; which were more susceptible to GLOF after the devastating earthquake in 2015. We examined the evolution and decadal expansion rate of lakes from 1987 to 2016 using Landsat images. The results show significant expansion of Imja Tsho, Barun Tsho, and Lumding Tsho at the rates of 42.1, 46.8, and 32.9% respectively, during 2006 - 2016; while other glacial lakes (i.e., Chamlang South, Barun Tsho, and Lumding Tsho) are relatively stable. Although the current status of glacial lakes may be stable in term of burst risk, high expanding lakes must be prioritized for detail studies. Continuous model-based monitoring and risk assessment, mitigation measures and disaster management strategies are necessary for reducing the impact of GLOFs.

TI  - Morpho-physiological and biochemical responses of tolerant and sensitive rapeseed cultivars to drought stress during early seedling growth stage
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The edible oil production in China is highly dependent on the screening and development of drought-resistant rapeseed cultivars especially in water stress areas. However, for the successful production of rapeseed, germination and early seedling growth is the key steps under drought stress, which are not fully understood up till now. To better predict about the adoption of rapeseed cultivars to drought stress, the current study explored the presumed roles of enzymatic, non-enzymatic antioxidants and osmolytes in improving drought tolerance in rapeseed. The comparative analysis in terms of germination and early sprouting growth of six rapeseed cultivars was assessed under normal (0.00MPa) and osmotic stresses (-0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4, and -0.5MPa simulated by polyethylene glycol 6000). Subsequently, based on the process of germination and early sprouting growth, Shenguang 127 (SG 127) and Zhongyou 36 (ZY 36) were chosen as drought-tolerant and -sensitive rapeseed varieties, correspondingly and further evaluated under -0.3MPa osmotic stresses. The results indicated that drought stress rigorously hindered germination and early seedling growth of rapeseed cultivars. On the other hand, SG 127 exhibited less reduction in seedling growth paralleled with ZY 36. SG 127 revealed lower levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipids peroxidation (MDA), electrolyte leakage (EL %) and less reduction in chlorophyll (Chl) content than ZY 36. The drought tolerance of SG 127 may be correlated with enhanced activities of enzymatic (superoxide peroxidase, catalase, and dismutase), non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, glutathione), more accumulation of proline; total soluble sugar and total soluble protein. Furthermore, our study highlighted the significance of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and osmolytes in the establishment of rapeseed seedlings under drought stress. Nevertheless, the better knowledge is crucial to be further investigated on genomic and molecular basis to deeply insight the detail mechanisms of drought tolerance in rapeseed.

TI  - Detection of spatio-temporal evolutions on multi-annual satellite image time series: A clustering based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of satellite technologies makes remote sensing data abundantly available. While the access to such data is no longer an issue, the analysis of this kind of data is still challenging and time consuming. In this paper, we present an object-oriented methodology designed to handle multi-annual Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). This method has the objective to automatically analyse a SITS to depict and characterize the dynamic of the areas (the way that the land cover of the areas evolve over time). First, it identifies the spatio-temporal entities (reference objects) to be tracked. Second, the evolution of such entities is described by means of a graph structure and finally it groups together spatio-temporal entities that evolve similarly. The analysis were performed on three study areas to highlight inter (among the study areas) and intra (inside a study area) similarity by following the evolution of the underlying phenomena. The analysis demonstrate the benefits of our methodology. Moreover, we also stress how an expert can exploit the extracted knowledge to pinpoint relevant landscape evolutions in the multi-annual time series and how to make connections among different study areas.

TI  - Ensemble learning regression for estimating river discharges using satellite altimetry data: Central Congo River as a Test-bed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydraulic variables obtained from remotely sensed data have been successfully used to estimate river discharge (Q). However, most studies have used a rating curve based on a single hydraulic variable or the Manning equation (multiplicative method). In this study, we developed a mathematically different approach to estimating Q by applying the ensemble learning regression method (here termed ELQ), which is one of the machine learning techniques that linearly combine several functions to reduce errors, over the Congo mainstem as a test-bed. Using the training dataset (November 2002 - November 2006) of water levels (H) derived from different Envisat altimetry observations, the ELQ-estimated Q at the Brazzaville in-situ station showed reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 823 m(3) s(-1) (relative RMSE (RMSE normalized by the average in-situ Q, RRMSE) of 2.08%) compared to the Q obtained using a single rating curve. ELQ also showed improved performance for the validation dataset (December 2006 - September 2010). Based on the error analysis, we found the correlation coefficients between input variables affect the performance of ELQ. Thus, we introduced an index, termed the Degree of compensation (I-DoC), which describes how ELQ performs compared to the classic hydraulic relation (e.g., H-Q rating curve). The performance of ELQ improves when I-DoC increases because the additional information could be added in the ELQ process. Since ELQ can combine several variables obtained over different locations, it would be advantageous, particularly if there exist few virtual stations along a river reach. It is expected that ELQ can be also applied to the products of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which will provide direct measurements of surface water slope (5), effective river width (W-e), and H, to be launched in 2021.

TI  - Multi-temporal Nonlinear Regression Method for Landsat Image Simulation
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing is limited in its potential for acquiring time-series images due to the restricted weather conditions in which it may be used. The proposed method simulates a Landsat image at a specific time and applies a multiple nonlinear regression equation that provides a higher degree of correlation with the observed data distribution than the commonly used multiple linear regression equation. In this study, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) were considered as methods of multiple nonlinear regression. In addition to weather, environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity were added to analyze the input parameters in the regression process. Here, the GPR method of nonlinear regression results show significant improvement in Landsat image simulation. Furthermore, regardless of the season, simulation results using multiple parameter combinations showed the highest correlation with the reference images when temperature (ground), humidity, precipitation, visibility distance, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and three types of radiation were applied. It was confirmed that introduction of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products had little positive effects on the results. Thus, the GPR method defined here provides the best simulation results by employing multiple parameters in the calculation.

TI  - The Effects of Releasing Greenbelt Restrictions on Land Development in the Case of Medium-Sized Cities in Korea
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many metropolitan areas around the world aim to control urban growth with a view to achieving efficiency and containing urban problems. Among many urban growth policy tools, the green belt (GB) policy is known as the most rigid and strongest. However, there has been no study on the consequences when GB restrictions are completely removed. The primary purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial effects of greenbelt removal on land development in Korea's medium-sized cities between 2000 and 2017. To do so, we used the Landsat thematic mapper (TM) 5 satellite image (2000) and Landsat OLI TIRS 8 satellite image (2017) along with various attribute data to model the spatial effects of greenbelt removal in the cases of three medium-sized cities in Korea. The result of difference-in-difference (DID) analysis confirms that the effects of GB removal on land development vary depending on the local conditions of land development.

TI  - Generation of a Large-Scale Surface Sediment Classification Map Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Data: A Case Study at the Hwang-do Tidal Flat, Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats are associated with complicated depositional and ecological environments, and have changed considerably as a result of the erosion and sedimentation caused by tidal energy; consequently, the surface sediment distribution in tidal flats must be constantly monitored and mapped. Although several studies have been conducted with the aim of classifying intertidal surface sediments using various remote sensing methods combined with field survey, most of these studies were unable to consider various sediment types, due to the low spatial resolution of remotely sensed data. Therefore, previous studies were unable to efficiently describe precise surface sediment distribution maps. In the present study, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) red, green, blue (RGB) orthoimagery was used in combination with a field survey (232 samples) to produce a large-scale classification map for surface sediment distribution, in accordance with sedimentology standards, using an object-based method. The object-based method is an effective technique that can classify surface sediment distribution by analyzing its correlations with spectral reflectance, grain size, and tidal channels. Therefore, we distinguished six sediment types based on their spectral reflectance and sediment properties, such as grain composition and statistical parameters. The accuracy assessment of the surface sediment classification based on these six types indicated an overall accuracy of 72.8%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.62 and 5-m error range related to the Global Positioning System (GPS) device. We found that 11 samples were misclassified due to the effects of sun glint and cloud caused by the UAV system and shellfish beds, while 14 misclassified samples were influenced by surface water related to the elevation, tidal channels, and sediment properties. These results indicate that large-scale classification of surface sediment with high accuracy is possible using UAV RGB orthoimagery.

TI  - Determination of Slenderness Ratio of Faceplates in Steel-Plate Composite Wall Panels
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modular Steel-plate Composite (SC) construction reduces the construction time and labor requirement in their implementation for nuclear plants. For an effective structural design using SC wall panel, non-slender member is preferred for a faceplate of SC wall panel to satisfy the strength limit and the serviceability limit. The existing specifications developed for SC wall panel construction suggest width-to-thickness ratios (or faceplate slenderness ratios); however, these ratios differ in various specifications. This paper recommends the slenderness ratio of faceplates in SC wall panel. The results reveal that the faceplate slenderness ratio, the ratio of b/t(p), should be less than or equal to 0.907. In addition, the maximum stud (or tie) spacing will be a useful parameter to be considered during fabrication of SC wall, for structural design and also for field applications.

TI  - Forecasting respiratory infectious outbreaks using ED-based syndromic surveillance for febrile ED visits in a Metropolitan City
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Monitoring and detecting sudden outbreaks of respiratory infectious disease is important. Emergency Department (ED)-based syndromic surveillance systems have been introduced for early detection of infectious outbreaks. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a forecasting model of respiratory infectious disease outbreaks based on a nationwide ED syndromic surveillance using daily number of emergency department visits with fever.Methods: We measured the number of daily ED visits with body temperature >= 38.0 degrees C and daily number of patients diagnosed as respiratory illness by the ICD-10 codes from the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database of Seoul, Korea. We developed a forecast model according to the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method using the NEDIS data from 2013 to 2014 and validated it using the data from 2015. We defined alarming criteria for extreme numbers of ED febrile visits that exceed the forecasted number. Finally, the predictive performance of the alarm generated by the forecast model was estimated.Results: From 2013 to 2015, data of 4,080,766 ED visits were collected. 303,469 (7.4%) were ED visits with fever, and 388,943 patients (9.5%) were diagnosed with respiratory infectious disease. The ARIMA (7.0.7) model was the most suitable model for predicting febrile ED visits the next day. The number of patients with respiratory infectious disease spiked concurrently with the alarms generated by the forecast model.Conclusions: A forecast model using syndromic surveillance based on the number of ED visits was feasible for early detection of ED respiratory infectious disease outbreak.

TI  - Prediction of high nodal burden with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAlthough the role of axillary imaging has been redirected for predicting high nodal burden rather than predicting nodal metastases since ACOSOG Z1011 trial, it remains unclear whether and how axillary lymph node (ALN) characteristics predicts high nodal burden. Our study was aimed to evaluate the predictive value of imaging characteristics of ALNs at ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prediction of high nodal burden (3 metastatic ALNs) in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients.MethodsClinicopathological and imaging characteristics were evaluated in patients with ultrasound (n=312) and MRI (n=256). Imaging characteristics include number of suspicious ALNs and cortical morphologic changes (grade 1, cortical thickness<2mm; grade 2, 2-5mm; grade 3, 5mm or fatty hilum loss). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using multivariate analysis.ResultsFor ultrasound, higher (2) T stage (OR=5.65, P=.005), higher number of suspicious ALNs (2 suspicious ALNs, OR=6.52, P=.019; 3 suspicious ALNs, OR=21.08, P=.005), and grade 3 of cortical morphologic changes (OR=9.85, P=.023) independently associated with high nodal burden. For MRI, higher (2) T stage (OR=5.17, P=.011) and higher number of suspicious ALNs (2 suspicious ALNs, OR=69.00, P=.001; 3 suspicious ALNs, OR=93.55, P<.001) were independently associated with high nodal burden. Among patients with 2 suspicious ALNs, those with grade 3 cortical morphologic change at ultrasound had a higher rate of high nodal burden than those with grade 2 (60.0% [3/5] vs. 25.0% [2/8]).ConclusionsA higher number of suspicious ALNs is an independent predictor for high nodal burden. Further stratification can be achieved by incorporating assessment of ultrasound-based cortical morphologic changes.

TI  - Surface Temperature Retrieval from MASTER Mid-wave Infrared Single Channel Data Using Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature has been derived from the MODIS/ASTER airborne simulator (MASTER) mid-wave infrared single channel data using the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) radiative transfer model with input data including the University of Wisconsin (UW) emissivity, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) atmospheric profiles, and solar and line-of-sight geometry. We have selected the study area that covers some surface types such as water, sand, agricultural (vegetated) land, and clouds. Results of the current study show the reasonable geographical distribution of surface temperature over land and water similar to the pattern of the MASTER L2 surface temperature. The thorough quantitative validation of surface temperature retrieved from this study is somehow limited due to the lack of in-situ measurements. One point comparison at the Salton Sea buoy shows that the present estimate is 1.8 K higher than the field data. Further comparison with the MASTER L2 surface temperature over the study area reveals statistically good agreement with mean differences of 4.6 K between two estimates. We further analyze the surface temperature differences between two estimates and find primary factors to be emissivity and atmospheric correction.

TI  - Strategies to Improve and Evaluate Physics-Based Hyperresolution Hydrologic Simulations at Regional Basin Scales
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of physics-based distributed hydrologic models (DHMs) at hyperresolutions (100m) is expected to support several water-related applications but is still prevented by critical data, model validation, and computational challenges. In this study, we address some of these challenges by applying the TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator DHM at a nominal resolution of 88m in the Rio Sonora basin, a regional watershed of 21,000km(2) in northwest Mexico. First, we generate reliable high-resolution (1-km) hydrometeorological forcings by bias correcting reanalysis products with ground observations and applying downscali ng routines that use terrain information at high resolution, which is available globally. Second, we develop a strategy to obtain high-resolution (250-m) grids of soil parameters by integrating a coarse-resolution soil map based on the Food and Agriculture Organization classification with recently released high-resolution global data sets. Third, we apply the model over a decadal period (2004-2013) and use a set of complementary tools, including Taylor diagrams, connectivity analysis, and empirical orthogonal function analysis, to assess its ability to simulate spatial patterns of land surface temperature through comparison with daily remotely sensed products. We find that (i) the hyperresolution-simulated patterns capture the spatial variability of land surface temperature quite well and (ii) vegetation properties are the major physical factors controlling the discrepancies between simulated and remotely sensed products. The strategies presented here are based on global data sets and robust statistical techniques that can be utilized in different settings with other DHMs, and thus, they provide valuable support for the scientific community focused on hyperresolution hydrologic modeling.

TI  - Public perception of river fish biodiversity in four European countries
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Public support for biodiversity conservation is shaped by people's values and their knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward the environment. We conducted the first multinational representative survey of the general public's perceptions of river fish biodiversity in France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. For the online survey, 1000 respondents per country were randomly selected from large panels following country-specific quotas set on age, gender, and educational level. Questions covered people's level of knowledge, beliefs, values, and attitudes toward river fish, environmental threats, and conservation measures. We found that the public had limited knowledge of freshwater fishes. Two non-native species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), were widely perceived as native, whereas native Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was mostly classified as native in Scandinavia and largely as non-native in central Europe. These results suggest an extinction of experience paralleling the extirpation or decline of salmon stocks in countries such as Germany and France. Respondents thought pollution was the dominant threat to riverine fish biodiversity. In reality, habitat loss, dams, and the spread of non-native fishes are equally important. Despite limited biological knowledge, respondents from all countries held an overwhelmingly proecological worldview, supported conservation stocking, and appreciated native fishes, although only a minority interacted with them directly. Differences among the 4 countries related to several conservation issues. For example, threats to biodiversity stemming from aquaculture were perceived as more prevalent in Norway compared with the other 3 countries. Promoting fish conservation based on charismatic species and use values of fishes may work well in countries with a strong economic and cultural link to the freshwater environment, such as Norway. In countries where people rather abstractly care for nature, focusing conservation messaging on broader ecosystem traits and non-use values of fishes is likely to win more support.

TI  - Quantitative Estimation of Biomass of Alpine Grasslands Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to promote the application of hyperspectral remote sensing in the quantification of grassland areas' physiological and biochemical parameters, based on the spectral characteristics of ground measurements, the dry AGB and multisensor satellite remote sensing data, including such methods as correlation analysis, scaling up, and regression analysis, were used to establish a multiscale remote sensing inversion model for the alpine grassland biomass. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model were verified by the remote sensing estimation of a time-space sequence biomass of a plateau grassland in northern Tibet. The results showed that, in the ground spectral characteristic parameters of the grassland's biomass, the original wave bands of 550, 680, 860, and 900 nm, as well as their combination form, had a good correlation with biomass. Also, the remote sensing biomass estimation model established on the basis of the two spectral characteristics (VI2 and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) had a high inversion accuracy and was easy to realize, with a fitting R-2 of 0.869 and an F test value of 92.6. The biomass remote sensing estimate after scale transformation had a standard deviation of 53.9 kg/ha from the fitting model established by MODIS NDVI, and the estimation accuracy was 89%. Therefore, it displayed the ability to realize the estimation of large-scale and long-time sequence remote sensing biomass. The verification of the model's accuracy, comparison of the existing research results of predecessors, and analysis of the regional development background demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of this method.

AB  - BackgroundWe aimed to assess the feasibility of a novel hybrid endoscopic/laparoscopic non-exposed, full-thickness, single-wall gastric resection technique guided by a fluorescence lymphangiography to identify the lymphatic pathway and the sentinel node basin.MethodsEight large white pigs (4 acute and 4 survival models) were included. Indocyanine green was injected submucosally around a pseudo-tumor at four points (1ml, 0.1mg/ml). The lymphatic spreading pathway was identified by the means of near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopic camera, and the resection line was planned outside of the fluorescent signals, to include all the potential lymphatic channels. Lymph node (LN) dissection was performed at greater curvature side and the infrapyloric area preserving the infragastric artery for all pigs. At the lesser curvature, 3-4 branches of the gastric artery were preserved in all acute and in two survival (group A), while in the remaining animals, 1-2 branches were preserved (group B). Perfusion of the remaining stomach was examined by NIR angiography. The gastric motility and function were evaluated by the means of a dynamic MRI immediately after the procedure and repeated after 1 week in surviving animals.ResultsThe hybrid full-thickness resection with bilateral sentinel LN basin dissection were successfully performed with no intra-operative or post-operative complications. The removed specimen was including all the area with florescent signal. The remaining stomach demonstrated a good perfusion at the NIR angiography. The dynamic MRI revealed a preserved emptying function in the acute animals and in the group A, and a loss of function in the group B.ConclusionsFluorescence-lymphangiography guided hybrid resection was feasible to remove a relatively large part of the stomach including the lymphatic spreading pathway and sentinel basin. The extent of dissection in the lesser curvature side can affect the post-operative function and further researches are warranted to optimize the concept.

TI  - Participatory mapping of forest plantations with Open Foris and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have witnessed the practical value of open-access Earth observation data catalogues and software in land and forest mapping. Combined with cloud-based computing resources, and data collection through the crowd, these solutions have substantially improved possibilities for monitoring changes in land resources, especially in areas with difficult accessibility and data scarcity. In this study, we developed and tested a participatory mapping methodology utilizing the open data catalogues and cloud computing capacity to map the previously unknown extent and species composition of forest plantations in the Southern Highlands area of Tanzania, a region experiencing a rapid growth of smallholder-owned woodlots. A large set of reference data, focusing on forest plantation coverage, species and age information distribution, was collected in a two-week participatory GIS campaign where 22 Tanzanian experts interpreted very high-resolution satellite images in Google Earth with the Open Foris Collect Earth tool developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The collected samples were used as training data to classify a multi-sensor image stack of Landsat 8 (2013-2015), Sentinel-2 (2015-2016), Sentinel-1 (2015), and SRTM derived elevation and slope data layers into a 30 m resolution forest plantation map in Google Earth Engine. The results show that the forest plantation area was estimated with high overall accuracy (85%). The interpretation accuracy of local experts was high considering general definition of forest plantation declining with increased details in interpretation attributes. The results showcase the unique value of local expert participation, enabling the collection of thousands of reference samples over a large geographical area in a short period of time simultaneously building the capacity of the experts. However, sufficient training prior to the data collection is crucial for the interpretation success especially when detailed interpretation is conducted in complex landscapes. Since the methodology is built on open-access data and software, it presents a highly feasible solution for repetitive land resource mapping applicable at different spatial scales globally.

TI  - Exploring Possible Influence of Dust Episodes on Surface Marine Chlorophyll Concentrations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert dust deposition is thought to act as fertilizer for phytoplankton growth, since it is rich in the required nutrients. The Mediterranean Sea is a nutrient poor marine environment-with its eastern part being the most oligotrophic-which is subject to dust transport. The Hellenic Seas are part of this low-nutrient, low-chlorophyll environment and they are also affected by dust deposition events. Thus, the dust fertilizing effect can be particularly important, especially during the stratification period, when the nutrients needed for phytoplankton growth are not imported from deeper layers. Some individual dust events are examined here in respect of their possible influence on phytoplankton, through the observed variations of satellite derived chlorophyll concentrations. Two strong dust events that were also extreme weather events and three events in the June-September stratification period are examined for the Hellenic Seas as well as a strong dust event in the Central Mediterranean Sea. The results, only when based on absolute chlorophyll differences above 50%, show that dust events seem to favour phytoplankton abundance mainly during the low productive period; however, these differences are area-limited. The difficulty of reaching safe results through specific dust events and discriminating between other meteorological factors favouring phytoplankton growth are also discussed.

AB  - We encountered a case of synchronous bilateral breast cancer in an elderly patient. A 75-year-old woman visited our hospital because she was identified with an abnormality on mammography during breast cancer screening. An elastic hard tumor 2.0 cm in diameter was detected in the A area of her right breast. Mammography showed an irregular tumor shadow with spicula in the right breast and micro-calcifications in her left breast. Ultrasonography showed a low echoic lesion 20mm in size in the A area of her right breast and a low echoic area 5mm in size in her left breast. Histological examination of core needle biopsy specimens revealed invasive ductal carcinoma in both breasts. Synchronous bilateral breast cancer was diagnosed. Bilateral muscle-preserving mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Postoperative histology revealed bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma without lymph node metastasis that was positive for ER and PgR, was negative for HER2, and had a Ki-67-positive cell index of 20% in the right breast(T1N0M0, Stage Ⅰ), and that was positive for ER, was negative for PgR and HER2, and had a Ki-67-positive cell index of 5% in the left breast(T1N0M0, Stage Ⅰ). The surgical margins were negative. She was administered endocrine therapy as adjuvant therapy for 5 years after the surgery. Eight years after the surgery, she was well without metastasis.

T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) with technetium-99m-sestamibi (Tc-99m-MIBI) for detecting multiple (>2 nodes) axillary lymph node involvement in patients with breast cancer (BC).Patients and methods A total of 184 women with BC were examined. Clinically, axillary lymph nodes were classified as N0 in all cases. Patients underwent SPECT-CT breast and axillary region imaging 10-15 min after a 740 mBq intravenous injection of Tc-99m-MIBI. SPECT-CT data were then verified by definitive histopathological examination (sentinel-node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection were used as reference standard). Diagnostic values of different CT and SPECT signs of multiple (>2) lymph node involvement were evaluated.Results Histological examination of excised lymph nodes showed metastatic involvement in 62 (33.7%) out of 184 patients. In fact, 25 (13.6%) patients had more than two lymph node involvements. In another 37 (20.1%) cases the metastasis was revealed in one or two sentinel lymph nodes only. The main SPECT-CT criteria of multiple (>2) lymph node involvement were as follows: the maximum size of the primary tumor (>20 ram), lymph node dimensions (>12 mm along the long axis and > 10 mm along the short axis), nodal cortical thickness (>4 mm), round shape, solid structure, quantity of identified abnormal lymph nodes (>1), and intensity of tracer uptake. The developed integrated model offers the possibility to exclude multiple lymph node metastasis (>2) in BC patients with a probability of 99%.Conclusion This single-center study showed that in patients with BC, a combination of functional and anatomical data that were obtained by using SPECT-CT with Tc-99m-MIBI can significantly improve detectability of multiple (>2) axillary metastases.

AB  - Recently, with the increase in the number of young cancer patients, we often encounter multiple primary cancer(MPC). In MPC, careful examination is necessary because the treatment order and policies change greatly depending on the stage and prognosis of each tumor. We report a case of synchronous MPC of endometrialcancer and breast cancer. The patient was a 40-year-old woman who underwent endometrial cytology by a previous doctor due to illicit bleeding. As a result of the diagnosis of classⅢB, she underwent gynecological examination in our hospital. Endometroid adenocarcinoma Grade 2 was diagnosed based on endoscopic findings. On pelvic MRI, a lesion adjacent to the neck showed a low signal in the uterine body compared to that in the endocardium. During the preoperative examination, CT showed contrast nodules in the right breast, and ultrasonography was performed at the department of breast surgery. Ultrasonography showed a low-echo mass of 23 mm in the right upper midline region. The needle biopsy results were papillotubular cancer(ER-negative, PgR-negative, HER2 1+, Ki-67 77%). Based on these findings, right breast cancer and endometrial cancer were diagnosed. Initially, we performed right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy; we then performed pancreatectomy in the gynecology department 2 weeks after discharge. After surgery, gynecology studied 6 courses of TC therapy, and currently, EC is undergoing breast surgery.

The author's sources include publications of Russian scholars, the Soviet era standards and laws which underpinned the education system, archive documents from Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chita and Ulan-Ude, written memoirs and interviews with graduates of Eastern Siberian teaching colleges. The research work was carried out in accordance with the methodological apparatus of historical science and the principles of historicism using historical-genetic and historical-systemic methodology. In the first part of the work, the author establishes that teachers in the Soviet era were responsible both for the education of their students and for the formation of their Marxist-Leninist worldview, and that the state regulated all of the processes which took place in the secondary and higher education system. In the second part of the work, the author examines how the historical education system was reformed, how the changes were responsible for the formation of the "New Man" and the Marxist-Leninist worldview, how the "Thaw' opened new opportunities for historians but the domination of the Marxist methodology hindered the research potential of historical science and education, and how the reforms led to the development of a new methodological apparatus for the training of future history teachers. In the third part of the work, the author focuses on the practical elements - curricula, specific teaching practices and training methods, which included the study of scientific, psychological-pedagogical and special-historical disciplines, the dual-purpose reason for the changes - shaping the worldview of future history teachers and deepening their Marxist-Leninist training, and the required participation by students in socio-political, labour, and artistic activities also based on this goal. The author comes to the following conclusions. (1) A powerful education system was created in the Soviet era resulting in intellectual growth for the country and strengthened public consciousness. (2) The training of history teachers was a matter of particular importance to the state. (3) Through a combination of new educational, scientific and social processes, Eastern Siberian teaching colleges produced highly qualified professional teachers, which also contributed to the preparation of employees for the region's party organizations.

AB  - Various scientific researches were conducted to monitor human activities and natural phenomena with the availability of various night time satellite data such as Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMPS). Population growth especially in a faster growing economy like China is an important indicator for assessing socio-economic development, urban planning and environmental management. Thus, spatial distribution of population is instrumental in assessing growth and developmental activities in Beijing city of China. The satellite observation data derived from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was utilized to estimate population density through the measurement of light flux with radiometric recording. The data was calibrated using C-0, C-1, C-2 parameters before processing. Population density of Beijing city was estimated using light volume of this calibrated data. Regression analysis between urban population and light volume revealed high correlation (r(2) = 0.89). Thus, population density can effectively be estimated using light intensity. The model used for estimating urban population density can effectively be utilized for other major cities of the world.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Images to Map the Occurrence of the Cossid Moth (<i>Coryphodema tristis</i>) in <i>Eucalyptus Nitens</i> Plantations of Mpumalanga, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coryphodema tristis is a wood-boring insect, indigenous to South Africa, that has recently been identified as an emerging pest feeding on Eucalyptus nitens, resulting in extensive damage and economic loss. Eucalyptus plantations contributes over 9% to the total exported manufactured goods of South Africa which contributes significantly to the gross domestic product. Currently, the distribution extent of the Coryphodema tristis is unknown and estimated to infest Eucalyptus nitens compartments from less than 1% to nearly 80%, which is certainly a concern for the forestry sector related to the quantity and quality of yield produced. Therefore, the study sought to model the probability of occurrence of Coryphodema tristis on Eucalyptus nitens plantations in Mpumalanga, South Africa, using data from the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI). Traditional field surveys were carried out through mass trapping in all compartments (n = 878) of Eucalyptus nitens plantations. Only 371 Eucalyptus nitens compartments were positively identified as infested and were used to generate the Coryphodema tristis presence data. Presence data and spectral features from the area were analysed using the Maxent algorithm. Model performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve showing the area under the curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) while the performance of predictors was analysed with the jack-knife. Validation of results were conducted using the test data. Using only the occurrence data and Sentinel-2 bands and derived vegetation indices, the Maxent model provided successful results, exhibiting an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.890. The Photosynthetic vigour ratio, Band 5 (Red edge 1), Band 4 (Red), Green NDVI hyper, Band 3 (Green) and Band 12 (SWIR 2) were identified as the most influential predictor variables. Results of this study suggest that remotely sensed derived vegetation indices from cost-effective platforms could play a crucial role in supporting forest pest management strategies and infestation control.

TI  - Operational Monitoring of Illegal Fishing in Ghana through Exploitation of Satellite Earth Observation and AIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, West African coastal countries, including Ghana, have experienced extensive economic damage due to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activity, estimated at about USD 100 million in losses each year. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing poses an enormous threat to the conservation and management of the dwindling fish stocks, causing multiple adverse consequences for fisheries, coastal and marine ecosystems and for the people who depend on these resources. The Integrated System for Surveillance of Illegal, Unlicensed and Unreported Fishing (INSURE) is an efficient and inexpensive system that has been developed for the monitoring of IUU fishing in Ghanaian waters. It makes use of fast-delivery Earth observation data from the synthetic aperture radar instrument on Sentinel-1 and the Multi Spectral Imager on Sentinel-2, detecting objects that differ markedly from their immediate background using a constant false alarm rate test. Detections are matched to, and verified by, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which provide the location and dimensions of ships that are legally operating in the region. Matched and unmatched data are then displayed on a web portal for use by coastal management authorities in Ghana. The system has a detection success rate of 91% for AIS-registered vessels, and a fast throughput, processing and delivering information within 2 h of acquiring the satellite overpass. However, over the 17-month analysis period, 75% of SAR detections have no equivalent in the AIS record, suggesting significant unregulated marine activity, including vessels potentially involved in IUU. The INSURE system demonstrated its efficiency in Ghana's exclusive economic zone and it can be extended to the neighbouring states in the Gulf of Guinea, or other geographical regions that need to improve fisheries surveillance.

TI  - Outlier detection of land surface temperature: Kucukcekmece Region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned and rapid urbanization is one of the reasons for the rising surface temperature in urban areas. There is a large amount of literature demonstrating the association of urbanization with surface temperatures. Kucukcekmece Lake, an important lake that has been meeting the utility water needs of Istanbul, and the unplanned and rapid urbanization around it, has been affected by this inevitable change for years. Although surface temperatures generally correlate strongly with each other, very high and very low temperature values should not be disregarded and need to be investigated. The current study was conducted with the assumption that these values could be outliers; thus, they were analyzed using the box plot method for the selected region. Correlations between land surface temperature (LST) values obtained for Kucukcekmece and its vicinity were examined using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from June 20, 2016 and June 23, 2017, and LST outliers and regions with common outliers on both days were determined. In the study, 310 LST outliers were identified for June 20, 2016 and 34 LST outliers for June 23, 2017; in both images, 33 outliers were found to be common and these clustered in two different buildings. The reasons for the outliers outside the standard surface temperature values as well as the recommended solutions were discussed.

TI  - Clinical application of the sentinel lymph node technique in early ovarian cancer: a pilot study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction There is limited evidence favoring the use of the sentinel lymph node technique in ovarian cancer, and no standardized approach has been studied. The objective of the present pilot study is to determine the feasibility of the sentinel lymph node technique by applying a clinical algorithm.Methods Patients with confirmed ovarian cancer were included. 99mTc and indocyanine green were injected into the ovarian and infundubulo-pelvic ligament stump. A gamma probe and near-infrared fluorescence imaging were used for sentinel lymph node detection.Results The sentinel lymph node technique was performed in nine patients with a detection rate in the pelvic and/or para-aortic region of 100%. The tracer distribution rates of sentinel lymph nodes in the pelvic and para-aortic regions were 87.5% and 70%, respectively.Conclusion The detection of sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage ovarian cancer appears to be achievable. Based on these results, a clinical trial entitled SENTOV (SENtinel lymph node Technique in OVarian cancer) will be performed.

TI  - Long-Term Trends in Phytoplankton Chlorophyll <i>a</i> and Size Structure in the Benguela Upwelling System
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Benguela Upwelling System (BUS) is among the most productive ecosystems globally, supporting numerous fisheries and ecosystem services in Southern Africa. Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations between September 1997 and February 2018 were used to investigate long-term trends in phytoplankton biomass and size structure (microphytoplankton [>20m], nanophytoplankton [2-20m], and picophytoplankton [<2m]) in the Northern Benguela, Southern Benguela (SB), and Agulhas Bank (AB) shelf and open ocean regions of the BUS. Trends in upwelling and correlations with Chla and size structure were examined. Increasing Chla and microphytoplankton trends occurred in the Northern Benguela shelf and open ocean, while decreases were evident on the SB shelf in all seasons. In the SB open ocean, small increases occurred during austral winter, with a decrease in spring. On the AB shelf, increases in Chla and microphytoplankton occurred in summer with decreases during the other seasons. Patterns differed in the AB open ocean, with increases in winter and spring and decreases in summer and autumn. Although R-2 values indicated that linear trends accounted for a reasonable portion of the variance, and most trends were statistically significant, they showed only small changes on the shelf domains and little to no change in the open ocean. Strong correlations between upwelling, Chla, and the size classes were observed, but distinct seasonal differences occurred in each region. This is the first 20-year analysis of phytoplankton biomass and community structure in the BUS and provides a baseline against which future changes can be monitored.Plain Language Summary Two satellite ocean color data products were combined and used to examine trends in chlorophyll a and the proportions of microphytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton in three subregions of the Benguela Upwelling System, namely, the northern Benguela, southern Benguela, and Agulhas Bank. These trends were related to trends in upwelling-favorable winds and significant correlations were observed but with distinct seasonal differences in each region. Linear trends were mostly significant and accounted for a reasonable portion of the variance, but they showed only small changes on the shelf domains and little to no change in the open ocean regions. This study provides the first 20-year analysis of phytoplankton biomass and community structure in the Benguela Upwelling System and provides a baseline against which future changes can be monitored.

TI  - Mercury Concentrations in Sentinel Fish Exposed to Contaminated Sediments Under a Natural Recovery Strategy Within the St. Lawrence River Area of Concern at Cornwall, Ontario, Canada
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Legacy mercury (Hg) sediment deposits are a long-term issue within the St. Lawrence River (Cornwall) area of concern with three depositional areas along the Cornwall, ON waterfront containing sediments that exceed the Ontario Sediment Quality Guidelines for Hg. Assessing the bioavailability of these Hg-contaminated sediments plays a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness of the Cornwall Sediment Strategy based on a natural recovery approach. We collected specimens of fallfish (Semotilus corporalis), round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) to assess spatial and temporal trends of Hg concentrations in various areas along the Cornwall waterfront, including zones of contaminated sediments and non-contaminated reference sites. This study revealed that (1) Hg concentrations in fish collected from the contaminated zones remain greater than those of fish from non-impacted locations, indicating that natural recovery is not yet achieved, (2) total Hg concentrations in yellow perch collected in 2016 were greater than those obtained during a previous assessment, indicating a reversal of the previously observed long-term declines, and (3) total Hg concentrations in yellow perch collected at the outlet of Gray's Creek compared with yellow perch from contaminated zones, suggesting other important inputs of Hg to the ecosystem than the legacy contaminated sediments.

TI  - Coastal biophysical processes and the biogeography of rocky intertidal species along the south-eastern Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim We assess the spatial distribution of a suite of coastal biophysical characteristics and how their variability is related to the distribution and geographic range of a diverse assemblage of coastal benthic species with different larval dispersal strategies. Location South-eastern Pacific (SEP) coast between 18 degrees 20 ' S and 42 degrees 35 ' S. Methods Biophysical variability was assessed using chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature and the signal of turbid river plumes derived from MODIS onboard the Aqua satellite. We established the dominant spatial components using wavelet and coherence analysis, and evaluated the biogeographic structure of 51 rocky intertidal species sampled over similar to 2,600 km along the SEP using multivariate classification and regression trees. Results Biogeographic breaks detected here were consistent with recent biogeographic classification schemes. Distribution breakpoints for species with lecithotrophic larvae clustered around 30 degrees S. We observed a previously unreported break in the distribution of species with planktotrophic larval dispersal strategies around 35 degrees S. These breaks are related to coherence in the spatial structure of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and river outflow over different temporal scales. Regions with similar biophysical characteristics, and the breaks the separate them, are in striking agreement with the biogeographic patterns revealed by the multivariate classification trees. Main conclusions Our results reconcile patterns of biogeographic structure reported for other groups of species along the SEP coast. We suggest that river outflow, a poorly studied coastal environmental forcing, may play an important role in determining the geographic distribution of rocky shore species, probably through its effects on larval dispersal patterns.

TI  - Automated detection of thermoerosion in permafrost ecosystems using temporally dense Landsat image stacks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change has been linked to the degradation of permafrost across northern ecosystems, with notable implications for regional to global carbon dynamics. However, our understanding of the spatial distribution, temporal trends, and seasonal timing of episodic landscape deformation events triggered by permafrost degradation is hampered by the limited spatial and temporal coverage of high-resolution optical, RADAR, LIDAR, and hyperspectral remote sensing products. Here we present an automated approach for detecting permafrost degradation (thermoerosion), using meso-scale high-frequency remote sensing products (i.e., Landsat image archive). This approach was developed, tested, and applied in the ice-rich lowlands of the Noatak National Preserve (NOAT; 12,369 km(2)) in northwestern Alaska. We identified thermoerosion (TE) by capturing the spectral signal associated with episodic sediment plumes in adjacent water bodies following TE. We characterized and extracted this episodic turbidity signal within lakes during the snow-free period (June 15-October 1) for 1986-2016 (continuous data limited to 1999-2016), using the cloud-based geospatial parallel processing platform, Google Earth Engine (TM). Thermoerosional detection accuracy was calculated using seven consecutive years of sub-meter high-resolution imagery (2009-2015) covering 798 (similar to 33%) of the 2456 lakes in the NOAT lowlands. Our automated TE detection algorithm had an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 86% and 0.47 +/- 0.043, indicating that episodic sediment pulses had a "moderate agreement" with landscape deformation associated with permafrost degradation. We estimate that lake shoreline erosion, thaw slumps, catastrophic lake drainage, and gully formation accounted for 62, 23, 13, and 2%, respectively, of active TE across the NOAT lowlands. TE was identified in similar to 5% of all lakes annually in the lowlands between 1999 and 2016, with a wide range of inter-annual variation (ranging from 0.2% in 2001 to 22% in 2004). Inter-annual variability in TE occurrence and spatial patterns of TE probability were correlated with annual snow cover duration and snow persistence, respectively, suggesting that earlier snowmelt accelerates permafrost degradation (e.g. TE) in this region. This work improves our ability to detect and attribute change in permafrost degradation across space and time.

TI  - Detection of potential large Maya settlements in the northern Peten area (State of Campeche, Mexico) using optical and radar remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents preliminary results on the detection of four potential Maya settlements (designed hereafter Sites A, B, C, and D) in the northern Peten area (State of Campeche, Mexico) often referred as the Peten Campechano, using new types of freely available Landsat-8 OLI optical and Sentinel-1A C-band dual-polarized images acquired during the dry and wet seasons. The study also uses the SRTM digital elevation model. Features extracted from the images and DEM over these potential sites were compared to corresponding features from four well-documented Maya cities located in the study area (El Mirador, Calakmul, Uxul, and Yaxnohcah), indicating similar horizontal and vertical dimensions as well as vegetation patterns. The known Maya cities and potential sites are all located adjacent to expansive seasonal wetlands (bajos) following a common locational pattern in Maya urban centers. Further, these sites are also located at intersections of linear features that were interpreted as potential raised causeways (sacbeob) documented in this and other projects. This paper examines both the implications and limitations of these findings, as well as the need for ground verification of these features in future field research.

TI  - Impact of a Hospital Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC) on Nursing Policy and Practice
T2  - WORLDVIEWS ON EVIDENCE-BASED NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2006, our healthcare system created a hospital Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) to support the local delivery of high-quality, safe and high value patient care. Since then, the importance of healthcare staff work life has also been highlighted, and together these four elements form the Quadruple Aim framework. Synergistic to this Aim, the Magnet((R)) program promotes and recognizes organizational nursing excellence. Objective To examine the EPC's work to inform nursing policy and practice in support of the goals of the Quadruple Aim framework and Magnet((R)) designation. MethodsMethods used included the following: (1) descriptive analysis of the hospital EPC's database of rapid reviews; and (2) administration of a 40-item electronic questionnaire to nurses who requested an EPC review during fiscal years (FY) 2015 and 2016. Results Of 308 rapid reviews completed in the EPC's first 10 years, 59 (19%) addressed nursing topics. The proportion of reviews relevant to nursing increased from 5% (2/39) in the center's first 2 years to 44% (25/60) in FY 2015-2016. The majority of nursing reviews (39/59) examined processes of care. Of 23 nurses eligible to participate in the survey, 21 responded (91%). Nurses with administrative or managerial responsibilities requested 70% of reviews; clinical nurse specialists and bedside nurses requested 17% and 9%, respectively. Reviews were used to support clinical program development (48%), provide clinical guidance (33%), update nursing policies or procedures (24%) and develop training and curricula (24%). Nurses were satisfied with the hospital EPC reviews (mean; 4.7/5), and 95% indicated they were likely to request a future review. Linking Evidence to Action A dedicated hospital EPC in partnership with nursing offers a unique mechanism for promoting a culture of evidence-based practice. Nurses at all organizational levels use the services of a hospital EPC to inform nursing policy and practice and are highly satisfied with the process, supporting the Quadruple Aim and Magnet((R)) designation.

AB  - For sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis from Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), the benefit of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) versus radiation therapy (RT) is unclear. This study compares outcomes for patients with SLN metastasis undergoing CLND or RT. We also evaluated positive non-SLNs as a prognostic factor.Using a prospective database, we identified MCC patients with SLN metastasis who underwent CLND or RT. At our institution, CLND was recommended for patients with acceptable perioperative risk, while therapeutic RT was offered to those with high perioperative risk. Primary outcomes were MCC-specific survival (MCCSS), disease-free survival (DFS), nodal recurrence-free survival (NRFS), and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS).From 2006 to 2017, 163 patients underwent CLND (n = 137) or RT (n = 26). Median follow-up was 1.9 years. CLND had no significant differences for MCCSS (5-year survival 71% vs. 64%, p = 1.0), DFS (52% vs. 61%, p = 0.8), NRFS (76% vs. 91%, p = 0.3), or DRFS (65% vs. 75%, p = 0.3) compared with RT. Patients with positive non-SLNs (n = 44) had significantly worse MCCSS (5-year survival 39% vs. 87%, p < 0.001), DFS (35% vs. 60%, p = 0.005), and DRFS (54% vs. 71%, p = 0.03) compared with negative non-SLNs (n = 93). Multivariate analysis showed positive non-SLNs were independently associated with MCCSS, DFS, and DRFS.CLND and RT may have similar outcomes for MCC patients with SLN metastasis when treatment aligns with our institutional practices. For patients undergoing CLND, positive non-SLNs is an important prognostic factor associated with poor survival and distant recurrence. This high-risk group should be considered for adjuvant systemic therapy trials.

TI  - A Generic Framework for Combining Multiple Segmentations in Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) paradigm relies strongly on the segmentation concept, i.e., partitioning of an image into regions or objects that are then further analyzed. Segmentation is a critical step, for which a wide range of methods, parameters and input data are available. To reduce the sensitivity of the GEOBIA process to the segmentation step, here we consider that a set of segmentation maps can be derived from remote sensing data. Inspired by the ensemble paradigm that combines multiple weak classifiers to build a strong one, we propose a novel framework for combining multiple segmentation maps. The combination leads to a fine-grained partition of segments (super-pixels) that is built by intersecting individual input partitions, and each segment is assigned a segmentation confidence score that relates directly to the local consensus between the different segmentation maps. Furthermore, each input segmentation can be assigned some local or global quality score based on expert assessment or automatic analysis. These scores are then taken into account when computing the confidence map that results from the combination of the segmentation processes. This means the process is less affected by incorrect segmentation inputs either at the local scale of a region, or at the global scale of a map. In contrast to related works, the proposed framework is fully generic and does not rely on specific input data to drive the combination process. We assess its relevance through experiments conducted on ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling. Results show that the confidence map provides valuable information that can be produced when combining segmentations, and fusion at the object level is competitive w.r.t. fusion at the pixel or decision level.

TI  - Generation of Large-Scale Moderate-Resolution Forest Height Mosaic With Spaceborne Repeat-Pass SAR Interferometry and Lidar
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the scattering model, inversion approach, and validation of the application results for creating large-scale moderate-resolution (hectare-level) mosaics of forest height through using spaceborne repeat-pass SAR interferometry and lidar. By incorporating several improvements to the forest height inversion and mosaicking approach, the height estimation accuracy along with the robustness of this approach have been considerably enhanced from its originally reported accuracy of RMSE of 3-4 m at a 20-hectare aggregated pixel size to RMSE of 3-4 m on the order of 3-6 hectares. Furthermore, practical data processing schemes are provided in detail. Extensive validation results are demonstrated which include: 1) a forest height mosaic (total area of 11.6 million hectares) is generated for the U.S. states of Maine and New Hampshire using Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) ALOS-1 InSAR correlation data and a small airborne lidar strip (44 000 hectares); 2) the mosaic height estimates are further compared with the available airborne lidar data and field measurements over both flat and mountainous areas; and 3) feasibility of using modern repeat-pass InSAR satellites with short repeat interval is also examined by using JAXA's ALOS-2 data. This simple and efficient approach is a potential observational prototype with much smaller error budget for the future spaceborne repeat-pass L-band InSAR systems with small spatial baseline and moderate/large temporal baseline (such as NISAR) in combination with lidar (such as GEDI) on the application of large-scale forest height/biomass mapping. It also serves as a complementary tool to the spaceborne single-pass InSAR systems using InSAR/PolInSAR methods when full-pol data are not available and/or when the underlying topography slope causes problems for these approaches.

TI  - Assessing the impact of respiratory infections and weather conditions on donor attendance and blood inventory in Hong Kong
T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Maintaining a stable, safe and sufficient blood supply is crucial to the healthcare system. Every year, seasonal influenza epidemics lead to substantial hospitalizations and pose intense pressure on blood transfusion service worldwide, especially in an ageing population of Hong Kong which often see bi-annual influenza outbreaks. However, limited quantitative studies have been performed to assess the impacts of influenza and other respiratory infections on blood supply. Methods We estimated the impacts of respiratory infections on donor attendance and blood inventory, considering the confounding effects of weather conditions. The method only required influenza-like illness data from the existing sentinel surveillance network, local weather data, donor attendance records from blood transfusion service and blood inventory levels from local healthcare system. Results We estimated the number of donor attendance dropped by 6-10% when the number of consultations with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) reported by sentinel general outpatient clinics exceeded five per 1000 consultations, which is a moderate activity level and has been observed frequently in Hong Kong. Blood inventory decreased with increased ILI consultation rates reported by sentinel general outpatient clinics. Adverse weather conditions had negative impacts on both donor attendance and blood inventory. Conclusion Epidemics of influenza and other respiratory infections coupled with adverse weather conditions affected blood supply in Hong Kong. The pressure on blood transfusion service to maintain a stable and sufficient blood supply during influenza seasons should not be overlooked, especially in an ageing population of Hong Kong.

TI  - Improving Forest Aboveground Biomass (AGB) Estimation by Incorporating Crown Density and Using Landsat 8 OLI Images of a Subtropical Forest in Western Hunan in Central China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation modeling based on remote sensing is an important method for large-scale biomass estimation; the accuracy of the estimation models has been a topic of broad and current interest. In this study, we used permanent sample plot data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of western Hunan. Remote-sensing-based models were developed for different vegetation types, and different crown density classes were incorporated. The linear model, linear dummy variable model, and linear mixed-effects model were used to determine the most effective and accurate method for remote-sensing-based AGB estimation. The results show that the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the linear dummy model and linear mixed-effects model were significantly better than those of the linear model; the R-adj(2) increased more than 0.16 and the RMSE decreased more than 2.12 for each vegetation type, and the F-test also showed significant differences between the linear model and linear dummy variable model and between the linear model and linear mixed-effects model. The accuracies of the AGB estimations of the linear dummy variable model and the linear mixed-effects model were significantly better than those of linear model in the thin and dense crown density classes. There were no significant differences in the AGB estimation performance between the linear dummy variable model and linear mixed-effects model; these two models were more flexible and more suitable than the linear model for remote-sensing-based AGB estimation. The results of this study provide a new approach for solving the low-accuracy estimations of linear models.

TI  - Evaluating VIIRS EPS Aerosol Optical Depth in China: An intercomparison against ground-based measurements and MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Workshop on Advancement of Polarimetric Observations - Calibration and Improved Aerosol Retrievals (APOLO)
CL  - Hefei, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) has been providing routine retrievals of aerosol properties since 2011. As a new generation advanced sensor, VIIRS has certain advantages in terms of spectral and accuracy and spatial resolution, especially with updated algorithm for the NOAA Enterprise Processing System (EPS) since July 2017. However, the VIIRS EPS aerosol products have not been extensively validated. In this study, we evaluate the VIIRS EPS AOD product over mainland China, which has been suffering from heavy aerosol pollution in the recent decade. By comparing collocated VIIRS and ground observations over 12 sites for the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and 5 sites from the Sun sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET), we find that VIIRS AOD achieves overall reasonable agreement, with 50.61% falling within the expected accuracy interval and a correlation of 0.91 with ground observation. A positive bias of 0.13 is noticed with relatively larger mean bias found in the spring and summer. VIIRS AOD also has a high bias compared with MODIS. The bias is found to be slightly increasing with AOD level. The seasonal variability of VIIRS AOD are also mostly consistent with surface observation and MODIS. VIIRS aerosol model still needs improvement, especially for dust and urban aerosols. A Combined Principal Component Analysis (CPCA) to extract dominant spatial and temporal variability between VIIRS and MODIS data also shows very good agreement, an indication that VIIRS is capable of capturing the major aerosol variability over China.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Preparing experiment-ready images is a labor-intensive but necessary process for almost all remote sensing related studies. This short communication introduces a software to efficiently acquire large-scale high-quality and cloud-free Landsat images to support subsequent analysis and applications. The software fully leverages Google Earth Engine's processing of huge amount of remote sensing images, and the visualization on the availability and accessibility of Landsat images provided by heatmaps at both regional and global scales. The cloud percentage property and quality bands of Landsat surface reflectance products are used for masking clouds, cloud shadows, snow/ice, and low-quality pixels in this study. The software can be applied to effectively choose study areas and prepare data in different fields, such as hydrology, ecology, and human activities. This functioning open-source software can be accessible via GitHub webpages in both JavaScript and Python formats.

TI  - Full year crop monitoring and separability assessment with fully-polarimetric L-band UAVSAR: A case study in the Sacramento Valley, California
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal information on plant and soil conditions is needed urgently for monitoring of crop productivity. Remote sensing has been considered as an effective means for crop growth monitoring due to its timely updating and complete coverage. In this paper, we explored the potential of L-band fully-polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data for crop monitoring and classification. The study site was located in the Sacramento Valley, in California where the cropping system is relatively diverse. Full season polarimetric signatures, as well as scattering mechanisms, for several crops, including almond, walnut, alfalfa, winter wheat, corn, sunflower, and tomato, were analyzed with linear polarizations (HH, HV, and VV) and polarimetric decomposition (Cloude-Pottier and Freeman-Durden) parameters, respectively. The separability amongst crop types was assessed across a full calendar year based on both linear polarizations and decomposition parameters. The unique structure-related polarimetric signature of each crop was provided by multitemporal UAVSAR data with a fine temporal resolution. Permanent tree crops (almond and walnut) and alfalfa demonstrated stable radar backscattering values across the growing season, whereas winter wheat and summer crops (corn, sunflower, and tomato) presented drastically different patterns, with rapid increase from the emergence stage to the peak biomass stage, followed by a significant decrease during the senescence stage. In general, the polarimetric signature was heterogeneous during June and October, while homogeneous during March-to-May and July-to-August. The scattering mechanisms depend heavily upon crop type and phenological stage. The primary scattering mechanism for tree crops was volume scattering (> 40%), while surface scattering (> 40%) dominated for alfalfa and winter wheat, although double-bounce scattering (> 30%) was notable for alfalfa during March-to-September. Surface scattering was also dominant (> 40%) for summer crops across the growing season except for sunflower and tomato during June and corn during July-to-October when volume scattering (> 40%) was the primary scattering mechanism. Crops were better discriminated with decomposition parameters than with linear polarizations, and the greatest separability occurred during the peak biomass stage (July-August). All crop types were completely separable from the others when simultaneously using UAVSAR data spanning the whole growing season. The results demonstrate the feasibility of L-band SAR for crop monitoring and classification, without the need for optical data, and should serve as a guideline for future research.

TI  - Impact of Sea State on Wind Retrieval From Sentinel-1 Wave Mode Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution wind field is essential to investigate local winds variability over the global ocean. Space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide wind observations up to hundreds of meters. Although SAR wind retrieval algorithms have been widely studied, improvements are still required. Sea state has been proven to be a primary factor in impacting wind speed retrieval. In this study, we analyzed data from Sentinel-1 wave mode, which alternately operates at two incidence angles (23.8 degrees and 36.8 degrees) over open ocean. Accuracy of wind speed retrieval is assessed against collocated in situ buoys. Wind speed residual is found to be closely related to significant wave height H-s at both incidence angles. A comparable dependence of wind speed residual on sea state is observed at 23.8 degrees with results of advanced SAR since they operate at the same incidence angle. While a weaker sea state impact on the retrieved wind speed is obtained at 36.8 degrees, consistent with the scatterometer analysis. In addition, the wind speed residual is similarly dependent on azimuth cutoff as H-s. We, therefore, demonstrate the possibility to compensate the sea state impact by including azimuth cutoff in the geophysical model function of the normalized radar cross section.

TI  - Monitoring 40-Year Lake Area Changes of the Qaidam Basin, Tibetan Plateau, Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Areal changes of high-altitude inland lakes on the Qaidam Basin (QB) of the Tibetan Plateau are reliable indicators of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Due to the physical difficulties to access, our knowledge of the spatial patterns and processes of climatic and human impacts on the Basin has been limited. Focusing on lake area changes, this study used long-term Landsat images to map the patterns of lakes and glaciers in 1977, 1990, 2000, and 2015, and to monitor the spatially explicit changes of lakes between 1977 and 2015. Results revealed that the total number of lakes (area > 0.5 km(2)) increased by 18, while their total area expanded by 29.8%, from 1761.5 +/- 88.1 km(2) to 2285.9 +/- 91.4 km(2). Meanwhile, glaciers have decreased in area by 259.16 km(2) in the past four decades. The structural equation model (SEM) was applied to examine the integrative effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on lake area. Precipitation change exhibited the most significant influence on lake area in the QB from 1977 to 2000, while human activities also played an important role in the expansion of lakes in the QB in the period 2000-2015. In particular, extensive exploitation of salt lakes as mining resources resulted in severe changes in lake area and landscape. The continuously expanding salt lakes inundated the road infrastructure nearby, posing great threats to road safety. This study shed new light on the impacts of recent environmental changes and human interventions on lakes in the Qaidam Basin, which could assist policy-making for protecting the lakes and for strengthening the ecological improvement of this vast, arid basin.

TI  - Cascades of sub-decadal, channel-floodplain changes in low-gradient, non-vegetated reaches near a dryland river terminus: Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The terminus of the ephemeral Rio Colorado is located at the margins of Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, the world's largest salt lake. The low-gradient (<0.0006mm(-1)), non-vegetated reaches approaching the terminus provide an excellent natural laboratory for investigating cascades of channel-floodplain changes that occur in response to quasi-regular flows (at least once annually) and fine-grained sediment supply (dominantly silt and clay). High-resolution satellite imagery (<0.65m, various dates from 2004 onwards) and field data reveal widespread, pronounced and rapid morphodynamics on sub-decadal timescales, including channel erosion and chute cutoff formation, and development of crevasse channels and splays, floodouts (unchannelled surfaces at channel termini), and erosion cells (floodplain scour-transport-fill features). In particular, following high annual precipitation (>400mm) in 2004-2005 and two subsequent high magnitude daily precipitation events (similar to 40mm), all of which led to widespread flooding, numerous crevasse splays formed between 2004 and 2016, avulsions occurred at nearby floodouts, and erosion cells downstream of the splays and floodouts underwent striking morphological changes. High-precision GPS data reveal two preferential localities for erosion cell development: partially or fully abandoned channels with crevasse splay remnants, and topographic lows between channels. In this overall low-gradient setting, comparatively high gradients (up to similar to 0.0006mm(-1)) at the edge of splay deposits and topography created by crevasses and abandoned channels may initiate knickpoint retreat and thereafter erosion cell development. Abandoned channels with splays tend to give rise to narrow, deep erosion cells, while topographic lows promote relatively shallow, wide erosion cells. In both situations, erosion cells may extend upslope and downslope, and eventually connect to form straight channels. The channel-floodplain morphodynamics near the Rio Colorado terminus extend previous analyses of low-gradient, dryland river systems, particularly because the lack of vegetation and quasi-regular floods drive cascades of rapid changes on sub-decadal timescales.

TI  - Exploring Spatial Influence of Remotely Sensed PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration Using a Developed Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, more and more remotely sensed data are being accumulated, and the spatial analysis methods for remotely sensed data, especially big data, are desiderating innovation. A deep convolutional network (CNN) model is proposed in this paper for exploiting the spatial influence feature in remotely sensed data. The method was applied in investigating the magnitude of the spatial influence of four factorspopulation, gross domestic product (GDP), terrain, land-use and land-cover (LULC)on remotely sensed <mml:semantics>PM2.5</mml:semantics> concentration over China. Satisfactory results were produced by the method. It demonstrates that the deep CNN model can be well applied in the field of spatial analysing remotely sensed big data. And the accuracy of the deep CNN is much higher than of geographically weighted regression (GWR) based on comparation. The results showed that population spatial density, GDP spatial density, terrain, and LULC could together determine the spatial distribution of <mml:semantics>PM2.5</mml:semantics> annual concentrations with an overall spatial influencing magnitude of 97.85%. Population, GDP, terrain, and LULC have individual spatial influencing magnitudes of 47.12% and 36.13%, 50.07% and 40.91% on <mml:semantics>PM2.5</mml:semantics> annual concentrations respectively. Terrain and LULC are the dominating spatial influencing factors, and only these two factors together may approximately determine the spatial pattern of <mml:semantics>PM2.5</mml:semantics> annual concentration over China with a high spatial influencing magnitude of 96.65%.

TI  - Monitoring active motion of the Guobu landslide near the Laxiwa Hydropower Station in China by time-series point-like targets offset tracking
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2009, the Guobu landslide has been very active, posing a safety threat to the Laxiwa Hydropower Station, located only several hundred meters downstream along the upper Yellow River in China. To investigate the current state of this landslide, we analyzed two stacks of X-band TerraSAR-X (TSX) High-resolution Spotlight (HS) mode images acquired from September 2015 to April 2017 in descending orbits with different look angles. A new time-series point-like target offset tracking (TS-PTOT) method is proposed to retrieve time-series surface displacements at point-like targets (PTs) from SAR image pairs properly combined with large temporal baselines and small spatial baselines. According to an evaluation of the standard deviation of time-series displacements at stable points, the TS-PTOT method increased the measurement precision of offset tracking by about 25% over the results using a single master. Our TSX-HS TS-PTOT results manifested a spatial pattern and magnitude of displacements highly similar to DInSAR result produced with an ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image pair. The maximum displacement rate at the upper part of the slope during the study period was around 80 cm/yr in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, which is much lower than the displacement rate measured in 2010. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) displacements at those identified homologous PTs were estimated by combining two-dimensional (2D) displacements measured by TS-PTOT from the two SAR data stacks. The 3D deformation pattern of the Guobu landslide properly verified its toppling-sliding deformation mechanism.

TI  - Detection of coastal wetland change in China: a case study in Hangzhou Bay
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland monitoring is crucial for understanding wetland changes and responses to natural and anthropogenic actions. In this research, Hangzhou Bay coastal wetland was selected as the study area to analyze spatial patterns and dynamic changes based on Landsat multitemporal imagery. A hybrid approach combining expert knowledge, decision tree, threshold technique, unsupervised classification and postprocessing was developed for wetland classification. Three typical sites were selected to analyze different change patterns. Over the last 10years, the wetlands have undergone dramatic changes, continued to expand outwards due to natural accumulation and increased in area. At the same time, these wetlands have also partially decreased with artificial reclamation and urban construction. An analysis of typical sites found that the change in the western part of this region was dominated by natural accumulation and that in the central and eastern parts was dominated by reclamation due to geographical location and hydrological power. In general, wetlands are continually changing under the joint action of natural accumulation, artificial reclamation and urban construction. The local terrain, hydrology, soil, population, economy and policy also influence wetland changes. The results of wetland monitoring are essential for the protection and management of local wetlands.

TI  - Sentinel: Breaking the Bottleneck of Energy Utilization Efficiency in RF-Powered Devices
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of the limited available energy, radio frequency (RF)-powered devices must be capable of efficiently utilizing scarce energy by planning task execution according to the current harvested energy. However, the energy utilization efficiency is challenging to be improved in RF-powered devices, since sensing the harvested energy consumes a significant amount of energy that should be used for task execution. In this paper, we propose Sentinel, a novel low power method to sense the harvested energy. Sentinel is fully delegated to detect the energy for the device, while the device does not participate in the energy sensing. By this means, the computing overhead of the device is reduced. Sentinel works with low energy consumption, and functions as a trigger to activate the device when, and only when, the energy reaches an expected energy threshold. We also present a lightweight scheme to set the desired thresholds so that Sentinel achieves detecting any expected thresholds. We implement Sentinel by off-the-shelf components and conduct experiments to show that Sentinel consumes only 5.2% of energy overhead of the general energy sensing technique. With Sentinel, we show that the energy utilization efficiency can be improved up to 94.9%, outperforming the best existing works at 64.7% in the WISP platform.

TI  - DCNR: deep cube CNN with random forest for hyperspectral image classification
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of remote sensing data analysis. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) has been proven to be an effective deep learning model, which can extract high-level features directly from the raw data and thereby utilize rich information contained in HSI data. However, labor cost to label enough HIS data for training model is usually expensive, so that it is a strong demand of utilizing limited training data to get a satisfied classification accuracy. In this paper, we put forward a deep cube CNN model - DCNR, which is composed of a cube neighbor HSI pixels strategy, a deep CNN and a random forest classifier. In DCNR model, cubic samples, containing spectral-spatial information, are generated by putting each target pixel and its neighbors together. Then features with high representative ability, extracted by applying a specially designed cube CNN model on each cubic sample, are fed into the random forest classifier for the classification of the target pixel. Results show that DCNR model can achieve classification accuracy of 96.78%, 96.08% and 94.85% on KSC, IP and SA datasets respectively with 20% samples as training set, and 85.03%, 83.45 and 62.17% on KSC, IP and SA datasets respectively with only 1% samples as training set, significantly outperforming random forest and cube CNN models.

TI  - Earth and Rock-Filled Dam Monitoring by High-Resolution X-Band Interferometry: Gongming Dam Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Middle-sized earth- and rock-filled dams with clay cores continue to settle by approximately 0.5-1.5% of their height for approximately 1-3 years after their construction phase. This paper investigates the use of high-resolution spaceborne Synthetic aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry to monitor this settlement process, with the case of the Gongming dam in China. The varieties of slope foreshortening and stretching in the radar coordinates are attributed to the radar's local incidence angle and the dam's slope heading, which are analysed in detail. Focusing on the embankment slope settlement analysis, the equations for calculating foreshortening and the line-of-sight deformation decomposition are derived in detail for the adjustment and data fusing. The scattering characteristics of different materials on the dam surface are analysed, including the grass slope, concrete slope, top road (crest), top wall, step, and ditch. According to the analysis of the precipitation data from a local meteorological station, the coherence losses on the slopes are mainly caused by surface moisture. Both the TerraSAR-X Spotlight (TSX-SL) data and the COSMO-SkyMed Strip Mode (CSK-SM) data are analysed by the stacking method to assess the slopes' deformations. The TSX-SL data results show the highest rate of settlement as 2 cm/yr on the top of the dam slope, consistent with the clay core shrinking process. The CSK-SM data show a similar trend in the lower part of the dam slope but underestimate the deformation in the upper part of the slope.

TI  - Uneven urban-region sprawl of China's megaregions and the spatial relevancy in a multi-scale approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a global phenomenon, megaregions are now and will continue to be the main form of urbanization, especially in developing countries including China. Although megaregions have been viewed as the most powerful formation to accelerate urbanization, the unprecedented regional growth and the uneven urban-region sprawl between different cities are emerging as critical problems. Despite many concerns about rapid regional growth from social and economic perspectives, not much is known about the multi-scale dynamic of urban-region sprawl in terms of land use. In this study, we examined the two most important megaregions of China, the BeijingTianjin-Hebei region (B-T-H) and the Yangtze River Delta region (Y-R-D), to understand their urban-region sprawl patterns and the relevancy of multiple spatial scales among different types of cities. The analysis included directly identifying the developed land from remotely sensed data collected between 1980 and 2010. The results showed that (1) at the regional scale, although both megaregions expanded rapidly during 1980-2010, the obvious difference existed in their regional sprawl patterns. The sprawling rate of Y-R-D was obviously higher than that of B-T-H, implying the megaregions implemented quite different development strategies. (2) At the city scale, both the dominant and non-dominant cities within the megaregions had distinct contributions to the regional sprawl of the mega cities. The greatest contribution from the dominant cities was the fast expansion of the main urban areas; the greatest contribution of the non-dominant cities was the fast rural sprawl. Overall, the varied spatial differences in the regional sprawl of China's megaregions highlight that sustainable regional development requires multi-scale joint development plan management, not only considering the synergy of cities with different sizes, but also the synergy between urban and rural areas.

TI  - Do High-Voltage Power Transmission Lines Affect Forest Landscape and Vegetation Growth: Evidence from a Case for Southeastern of China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of the network of high-voltage power transmission lines (HVPTLs) is inevitably covering more forest domains. However, no direct quantitative measurements have been reported of the effects of HVPTLs on vegetation growth. Thus, the impacts of HVPTLs on vegetation growth are uncertain. Taking one of the areas with the highest forest coverage in China as an example, the upper reaches of the Minjiang River in Fujian Province, we quantitatively analyzed the effect of HVPTLs on forest landscape fragmentation and vegetation growth using Landsat imageries and forest inventory datasets. The results revealed that 0.9% of the forests became edge habitats assuming a 150 m depth-of-edge-influence by HVPTLs, and the forest plantations were the most exposed to HVPTLs among all the forest landscape types. Habitat fragmentation was the main consequence of HVPTL installation, which can be reduced by an increase in the patch density and a decrease in the mean patch area (MA), largest patch index (LPI), and effective mesh size (MESH). In all the landscape types, the forest plantation and the non-forest land were most affected by HVPTLs, with the LPI values decreasing by 44.1 and 20.8%, respectively. The values of MESH decreased by 44.2 and 32.2%, respectively. We found an obvious increasing trend in the values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in 2016 and NDVI growth during the period of 2007 to 2016 with an increase in the distance from HVPTL. The turning points of stability were 60 to 90 meters for HVPTL corridors and 90 to 150 meters for HVPTL pylons, which indicates that the pylons have a much greater impact on NDVI and its growth than the lines. Our research provides valuable suggestions for vegetation protection, restoration, and wildfire management after the construction of HVPTLs.

TI  - Study on Differential-Based Multispectral Modeling of Soil Organic Matter in Ebinur Lake Wetland
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, according to the feasibility and reliability of using the hyperspectral data to retrieve SOM from hyperspectral data, combined with the high efficiency of differential processing in extracting spectral information, a new method based on differential algorithm for soil organic matter modeling In this study, the content of soil organic matter can be obtained by differentiating the multi-spectral remote sensing images directly, which aims to provide the direction for the future study of soil organic matter rapid measurement is proposed. In this paper, Landsat 8_OLI multi-spectral remote sensing image data is used to perform the radiation calibration, geometric correction, atmospheric correction, mosaic and cropping of multi-spectral remote sensing images. The first order differential and second order differential are processed by IDL software. The image can better express the real situation of the object. The first-order differential image can distinguish the water body from the soil better. The original remote sensing image contains a lot of information, including the noise. The differential image processed by the remote sensing image excludes the original image In the study area, five-point method was used to collect soil samples, indoor potassium dichromate oxidation-volume method to measure soil organic matter data, and multispectral data was used to analyze soil organic matter data from the ground to analyze soil organic matter It is found that there is a sensitive band in the correlation between the first-order differential data and soil organic matter content, indicating that the first-order differential processing can transform the original remote sensing image data in some obscure soil in the multi-spectral range. Organic information is released; select a high correlation number established based on the raw remote sensing data, first-order differential data, single-band multi-spectral data of the second order differential linear and multi-band multi-spectral linear model, and select the best model to estimate soil organic matter content retrieval.The main conclusions are as follows : (1) By differentiating the original image, it is found that the image after differential processing changes obviously and the image noise of first-order differential processing decreases, which further highlights the hidden information of soil organic matter in the image. The second-order differential processing suppresses soil organic matter information. (2) The data of the original remote sensing images have a low correlation with soil organic matter content. The data of the first-order differential treatment reflect the correlation of the soil organic matter sensitive band, that is, the partial band data, and the second-order differential processing after the remote sensing images of each band data on soil organic matter content of the correlation is weak. (3) Multi-band modeling is superior to single-band modeling, and the first-order differential multiband model has the best prediction accuracy. The model's coefficient of determination and the coefficient of model fitting are 0. 898 and 0. 854 respectively. The soil organic matter content in this region was well estimated. The fitting accuracy of single-band model and multi-band model was compared comprehensively. It was found that both the single-band model and the first-order differential model had better prediction ability. (4) Based on the first-order differential multi-band model, the inversion of SOM in the study area was carried out. The inversion result is in accordance with the actual situation, which provides a practical method and reference for the mapping of soil organic matter content in arid area.

TI  - Developing Daily Cloud-Free Snow Composite Products From MODIS and IMS for the Tienshan Mountains
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily cloud-free snow cover products are important premise and foundation for hydrological simulation, climate system research, and snow disaster monitoring in the Tienshan Mountains, Central Asia. In this study, partial clouds appearing in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were removed by temporal and spatial filtering, and the remaining cloud pixels were replaced by Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS). The results show that the retrieved annual mean snow cover obtained from the improved MODIS product data is 31.5% higher than the original MODIS product. Through validation performed via in situ observations, the overall accuracy, land accuracy, and snow accuracy also increased to 88.2%, 91.9%, and 81.9%, respectively. However, the overall accuracy shows a lower accuracy in transitional months compared to other months, which derives mainly from the difference in spatial scales between IMS and in situ observations.Plain Language Summary The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has a high spatial and time resolution but always obscured by cloud. While the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow cover product can penetrate cloud but has coarse spatial resolution. In response to these strengths and limitations, this study combines MODIS and IMS to create an improved snow product which is both free from cloud interference and features high temporal and spatial resolution. The novel composite snow-mapping product is then applied over the Tienshan Mountains region in Central Asia. The retrieved annual mean snow cover for the improved MODIS product data is 31.5% higher than the original MODIS product. Furthermore, compared with in situ snow depth measurements, the overall accuracy, land accuracy, and snow accuracy of the improved snow product is 88.2%, 91.9%, and 81.9%, respectively. Given the significant improvement in its accuracy, this product can readily be applied to climate change research and snow disaster monitoring.

TI  - GEOMORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A TRANSECT FROM THE YELLOW RIVER TO THE IRON PAGODA IN KAIFENG CITY, CHINA
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The downstream area of the Yellow River is a suspended river and has constantly threatened the security of Kaifeng city. The Yellow River is one of the main forces driving the geomorphological characteristics evolution of Kaifeng city. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing system (UAVRSS) technology mean that research can now include both macroscopic and microscopic remotely sensed data. This paper utilized a digital elevation model (DEM) obtained using UAVRSS technology and evaluated the DEM and digital orthophoto map (DOM) of a given transect to analyze the geomorphological characteristics from the macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. Results of this research show that: the surface elevation near the Iron Pagoda is 88.44 m, the spire elevation is 143.618 m and the height is 55.183 m. The downstream area of the Yellow River in the Kaifeng city area is a typical suspended river. The surface elevation rises from 88.44m in Kaifeng city to 105 m near the Yellow River levee, while the elevation of the Yellow River is 92.25 m. The Yellow River is about 4 m above Kaifeng city and the river embankment is 16.56 m above the city. On a macro level, the transect elevation gradually decreases from north to south, which exhibits a stepwise pattern called the Four Typical Ladders. On a micro level, the most geomorphological changes were seen in the North Wall, the city-protection dike and the embankment. Those drastic changes were mainly influenced by the Yellow River floods, three major defense projects, and other human activities. The Yellow River remains the major of safety hazard to Kaifeng's steady and healthy development. Communities in Kaifeng city need to take a more active role in safeguarding their security and continuously aiding in flood control by recognizing the importance of major local defense projects.

AB  - Objective To characterize the etiology and epidemiological characteristics of the acute meningitis and encephalitis syndrome (AMES) in Jinan city in 2013-2016. Methods The epidemiological data, clinical diagnosis, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from 3 577 AMES cases in 6 sentinel hospitals in Jinan city in 2013-2016. Samples of all cases were made sero-diagnosis for Immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and negative cases of JEV for enterovirus (EV), mumps virus (MuV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Virus isolation and molecular identification were performed. Positive rates were analyzed by Chi-square test. Results In 2013-2016, the positive rates of JEV, EV, MuV and HSV were 9.0% (322/3 577 cases), 22.1% (643/ 2 916 eases), 9.9% (289/2 916 eases), 26.9% (783/2 916), respectively. Of these, the positive rates of JEV were 32.9% (261/794), 1.2% (14/1 175), 1.0% (8/807) and 4.9% (39/801 cases); EV: 19.5% (91/466), 35.1% (342/974 cases), 15.5% (115/743) and 13.0% (95/733); MuV: 9.2% (43/466), 14.4% (140/974), 9.0% (67/743) and 5.3% (39/733). HSV: 35.4% (16.5/466), 38.5% (375/974), 25.7% (191/743) and 7.1% (52/733). There were significant differences in positive rates of 4 kinds of viruses in 2013-2016 (P<0.001). A total of 81 EV strains belonging to 8 serotypes were isolated from 1 020 CSF specimens. The positive rates were 4.8% (6 cases), 13.1% (55 cases), 4.1% (7 cases) and 4.2% (13 cases) from 2013 to 2016. Coxsackievirus (CV) B5, echovirus (E) 6 and E30 accounted for 46% (37 isolates), 22% (18 isolates) and 21% (17 isolates) of all strains. Conclusion The AMES cases in Jinan city in 2013-2016 were mainly caused by HSV, EV, MuV, JEV. CVB5, E6 and E30 were the dominant serotypes of EV associated with AMES cases in Jinan city.

TI  - Radar Scatter Decomposition to Differentiate between Running Ice Accumulations and Intact Ice Covers along Rivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For ice-jam flood forecasting it is important to differentiate between intact ice covers and ice runs. Ice runs consist of long accumulations of rubble ice that stem from broken up ice covers or ice-jams that have released. A water wave generally travels ahead of the ice run at a faster celerity, arriving at the potentially high flood-risk area much sooner than the ice accumulation. Hence, a rapid detection of the ice run is necessary to lengthen response times for flood mitigation. Intact ice covers are stationary and hence are not an immediate threat to a downstream flood situation, allowing more time for flood preparedness. However, once ice accumulations are moving and potentially pose imminent impacts to flooding, flood response may have to switch from a mitigation to an evacuation mode of the flood management plan. Ice runs are generally observed, often by chance, through ground observations or airborne surveys. In this technical note, we introduce a novel method of differentiating ice runs from intact ice covers using imagery acquired from space-borne radar backscatter signals. The signals are decomposed into different scatter componentssurface scattering, volume scattering and double-bouncethe ratios of one to another allow differentiation between intact and running ice. The method is demonstrated for the breakup season of spring 2018 along the Athabasca River, when an ice run shoved into an intact ice cover which led to some flooding in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.

TI  - Mathematical Assessment of the Effects of Substituting the Band Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) for the Spectral RTE in the Applications of Earth's Surface Temperature Retrievals from Spaceborne Infrared Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Planck's thermal emission function, the reflectivity-emissivity decoupled Kirchhoff's law and the associated atmospheric radiative transfer equation (RTE) is a theoretical base for Earth surface temperature (ST) retrievals from spaceborne infrared imageries. The infrared (IR) instruments generally collect band averaged radiance which are usually different from the RT codes simulated spectral one. Although IR band RTE is widely used, the effects of substituting the band-averaged RTE for the corresponding spectral one for those broadband observations (e.g., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal IR bands) have not been evaluated. In this paper, mathematical analysis and numerical experiments have been conducted to clarify the uncertainties arising from this substitution treatment. Firstly, we present the IR spectral RTE in a concise manner, and then, based on the law of conservation of energy and the integral assumption, a detailed mathematical derivation of the commonly-used IR band RTE has been derived. The significant improvement of the derivation is the validation of the integral assumption, which states that over a small spectral region, the integral of a product is approximately equal to the product of integrals. In the IR spectral region, taking the most significant term of the IR band RTE as an example (i.e., the surface emission term), we confirmed that, for the satellite collected IR signals emitted from the Earth's surface, over any bandwidth at any band-location and under any instrument spectral response function (SRF), the integral approximation (IA) is a well-founded approximation and thus the IR band RTEs are good approximations for the corresponding spectral ones. Furthermore, in the ST, especially the land ST, product validation investigations, the ST errors introduced by the substituting treatment are negligible and do not need to be taken into consideration.

TI  - An Adaptive Spectral Decorrelation Method for Lossless MODIS Image Compression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral decorrelation has been considered an important approach in multispectral image compression to remove the redundancy among bands. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive spectral decorrelation method based on clustering analysis for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image compression. The remote sensing image bands are divided into different clusters by the method based on density peak clustering. Then, reversible Karhunen-Loeve transform and polynomial least square estimation are employed to reduce the band redundancy, achieving an effective spectral decorrelation. As shown by the experimental results, our method achieves remarkable bit-saving when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms on MODIS image data set.

TI  - The prevalence and clinical characteristics of tick-borne diseases at One Sentinel Hospital in Northeastern China
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeastern China is a region of high tick abundance, multiple tick-borne pathogens and likely human infections. The spectrum of diseases caused by tick-borne pathogens has not been objectively evaluated in this region for clinical management and for comparison with other regions globally where tick-transmitted diseases are common. Based on clinical symptoms, PCR, indirect immunofluorescent assay and (or) blood smear, we identified and described tick-borne diseases from patients with recent tick bite seen at Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital. From May 2010 to September 2011, 42% (75/180) of patients were diagnosed with a specific tick-borne disease, including Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human babesiosis and spotted fever group rickettsiosis. When we compared clinical and laboratory features to identify factors that might discriminate tick-transmitted infections from those lacking that evidence, we revealed that erythema migrans and neurological manifestations were statistically significantly differently presented between those with and without documented aetiologies (P < 0.001, P = 0.003). Twelve patients (6.7%, 12/180) were co-infected with two tick-borne pathogens. We demonstrated the poor ability of clinicians to identify the specific tick-borne disease. In addition, it is necessary to develop specific laboratory assays for optimal diagnosis of tick-borne diseases.

TI  - Mapping Forest Canopy Height in Mountainous Areas Using ZiYuan-3 Stereo Images and Landsat Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is an important parameter for studying biodiversity and the carbon cycle. A variety of techniques for mapping forest height using remote sensing data have been successfully developed in recent years. However, the demands for forest height mapping in practical applications are often not met, due to the lack of corresponding remote sensing data. In such cases, it would be useful to exploit the latest, cheaper datasets and combine them with free datasets for the mapping of forest canopy height. In this study, we proposed a method that combined ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) stereo images, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission global 1 arc second data (SRTMGL1), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance data. The method consisted of three procedures: First, we extracted a digital surface model (DSM) from the ZY-3, using photogrammetry methods and subtracted the SRTMGL1 to obtain a crude canopy height model (CHM). Second, we refined the crude CHM and correlated it with the topographically corrected Landsat 8 surface reflectance data, the vegetation indices, and the forest types through a Random Forest model. Third, we extrapolated the model to the entire study area covered by the Landsat data, and obtained a wall-to-wall forest canopy height product with 30 m x 30 m spatial resolution. The performance of the model was evaluated by the Random Forest's out-of-bag estimation, which yielded a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.53 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.28 m. We validated the predicted forest canopy height using the mean forest height measured in the field survey plots. The validation result showed an R-2 of 0.62 and a RMSE of 2.64 m.

TI  - Intercropping Classification From GF-1 and GF-2 Satellite Imagery Using a Rotation Forest Based on an SVM
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been widely used in vegetation cover research but is rarely used for intercropping area monitoring. To investigate the efficiency of Chinese Gaofen satellite imagery, in this study the GF-1 and GF-2 of Moyu County south of the Tarim Basin were studied. Based on Chinese GF-1 and GF-2 satellite imagery features, this study has developed a comprehensive feature extraction and intercropping classification scheme. Textural features derived from a Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and vegetation features derived from multi-temporal GF-1 and GF-2 satellites were introduced and combined into three different groups. The rotation forest method was then adopted based on a Support Vector Machine (RoF-SVM), which offers the advantage of using an SVM algorithm and that boosts the diversity of individual base classifiers by a rotation forest. The combined spectral-textural-multitemporal features achieved the best classification result. The results were compared with those of the maximum likelihood classifier, support vector machine and random forest method. It is shown that the RoF-SVM algorithm for the combined spectral-textural-multitemporal features can effectively classify an intercropping area (overall accuracy of 86.87% and kappa coefficient of 0.78), and the classification result effectively eliminated salt and pepper noise. Furthermore, the GF-1 and GF-2 satellite images combined with spectral, textural, and multi-temporal features can provide sufficient information on vegetation cover located in an extremely complex and diverse intercropping area.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Surface Characteristics in the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh Deserts of China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deserts and sandy land in northern China are very susceptible to sandy desertification and are the main source of sand-dust storms of Asian dust. However, because of the complex factors involved, descriptions of the relationship between sandy desertification and surface characteristics in these regions are lacking. We monitored the surface characteristics and their changes in time using information about soil, vegetation, and landforms in the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD), Tengger Desert (TD), and Ulan Buh Desert (UBD) in the northern China. The monitoring was done using tasseled cap angle (TCA), disturbance index (DI), and topsoil grain size index (TGSI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images combined with a decision tree classification. Results showed that the TD had higher topsoil fine sand content, and the ratio of non-vegetated to vegetated areas was similar with that in the UBD. Northeast-southwest coarse sand dunes with thin interdune (NECTI) dominated the BD, fine sand dunes (FSD) dominated the TD, and a combination of northeast-southwest coarse sand dunes with wide interdune (NECWI) and northwest-southeast coarse sand dunes with wide interdune (NWCWI) dominated the UBD. From 2000 to 2015, in the BJD the area of the NECTI, non-sand dune (Non) and potential sand sources (PSS) increased, whereas the area of the NECWI, FSD and NWCWI decreased, indicating a improve process in the BJD. In the TD, the area covered by Non increased, whereas the area covered by PSS, NECWI, NECTI, FSD, and NWCWI decreased from 2000 to 2015. The area covered by the various surface characteristic types fluctuated annually in the UBD from 2000 to 2015. Changes in surface characteristics reflect the combined effects of natural conditions and human activity. The findings of our study will assist scientists and policy makers in proposing different management techniques to combat sandy desertification for the different surface characteristics of these regions.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation Based on Multi-sensor Data in a Semi-arid Sandy Area
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is important for identifying and monitoring desertification, especially in arid and semiarid regions. By using regression and pixel dichotomy models, we present the comparison of Sentinel-2A (S2) multispectral instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 (L8) operational land imager (OLI) data regarding the retrieval of FVC in a semi-arid sandy area (Mu Us Sandland, China, in August 2016). A combination of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) high-spatial-resolution images and field plots were used to produce verified data. Based on a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) regression model, the results showed that, compared with that of L8, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of S2 increased by 26.0%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) and the sum of absolute error (SAE) decreased by 3.0% and 11.4%, respectively. For the ratio vegetation index (RVI) regression model, compared with that of L8, the R-2 of S2 increased by 26.0%, and the RMSE and SAE decreased by 8.0% and 20.0%, respectively. When the pixel dichotomy model was used, compared with that of L8, the RMSE of S2 decreased by 21.3%, and the SAE decreased by 26.9%. Overall, S2 performed better than L8 in terms of FVC inversion. Additionally, in this paper, we develop a verified scheme based on UAV data in combination with the object-based classification method. This scheme is feasible and sufficiently robust for building relationships between field data and inversion results from satellite data. Further, the synergy of multi-source sensors (especially UAVs and satellites) is a potential effective way to estimate and evaluate regional ecological environmental parameters (FVC).

TI  - Missing emissions from post-monsoon agricultural fires in northwestern India: regional limitations of MODIS burned area and active fire products
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A rising source of outdoor emissions in northwestern India is crop residue burning, occurring after the monsoon (kharif) and winter (rabi) crop harvests. In particular, post-monsoon rice residue burning, which occurs annually from October to November and is linked to increasing mechanization, coincides with meteorological conditions that enhance short-term air quality degradation. Here we examine the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED), whose bottom-up emissions are based on the 500-m burned area product, MCD64A1, derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. Using a household survey from 2016, we find that MCD64A1 tends to underestimate burned area in many surveyed villages, leading to poor representation of small, scattered fires and consequent spatial biases in model results. To more accurately allocate such small fires and resolve sub-village heterogeneity, we use an experimental hybrid MODIS-Landsat method (ModL2T) to map burned area at 30-m spatial resolution, which results in 44 21% higher burned area than MCD64A1 and up to 105 52% increase in dry matter emissions over GFEDv4s. In our validation and assessments, we find that ModL2T performs better relative to MCD64A1 in terms of bias and omission error, but may introduce commission error due to conflation of burning with harvest and still underestimate burned area due to Landsat's coarse temporal resolution (every 16 days). We conclude that while MODIS and Landsat provide more than two decades worth of observations, their spatio-temporal resolution is too coarse to overcome several region-specific challenges: small median landholding size (1-3 ha), quick harvest-to-sowing turnover period, prevalence of partial burning, and increasing haziness. To further constrain agricultural fire emissions in northwestern India and improve model estimates of associated public health impacts, integration of finer resolution imagery, as well as better understanding of the spatial patterns in burn rates, burn practices, and fuel loading, is requisite.

TI  - Impacts of Wetland Reclamation and Paddy Field Expansion on Observed Local Temperature Trends in the Sanjiang Plain of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The warming or cooling effects on regional climate in response to early land use change may be strengthened, weakened, or eliminated by the same or opposite effect in the subsequent land use/management period. Taking the Sanjiang Plain in China as our study area, this paper analyzed the surface temperature change due to land use/land management changes from the mid-1950s to 2015, based on the land surface temperature response model and the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method using remote sensing data, meteorological observation data, and reanalysis data. Results revealed a magnitude of monthly mean land surface warming up to 1.31 degrees C due to the land use change from wetland to rain-fed farmland and a cooling effect of -1.32 degrees C caused by the land management change from rain-fed farmland to paddy fields during the growing season. The trends were confirmed using OMR method. Land surface temperature change based on remote sensing data was divided into radiative and nonradiative forcing. The nonradiative processes play a dominant role in regulating the local surface temperature. The monthly mean temperature differences in response to land use changes differ greatly during the growing season. The temperature difference was greater in May and June (spring) than in July and August (summer). Our study shows that the land use impact on regional climate could be switched dramatically, and it would be basically consistent with the impact of natural wetlands before reclamation in our study area right now, which provides important information for mitigating and adapting to global climate change at regional scale.Plain Language Summary The Sanjiang Plain was once part of the Great Northern Wilderness in China, which has experienced extensive wetland drainage and farmland development since the mid-1950s. Then, large areas of rain-fed farmland have been rapidly transformed into paddy fields since the 1990s due to land management policies change and the pursuit of economic interests. The impacts of these successive land use changes on surface temperature were analyzed synthetically. We found that the warming effect of wetland reclamation over 40years has been eliminated due to the cooling effect of paddy field expansion since the 1990s. For both the change of wetland reclamation and paddy field expansion, the temperature difference was greater in May and June (spring) than in July and August (summer).

TI  - Parameterizing Sea Surface Temperature Cooling Induced by Tropical Cyclones: 1. Theory and An Application to Typhoon Matsa (2005)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature cooling (SSTC) induced by tropical cyclones (TCs) could produce a significant impact on the TC intensity. Although a coupled atmosphere-ocean model could provide such SSTC, various challenges associated with coupled modeling often lead many TC researchers to continue to use atmosphere-only models. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to develop a fast, robust, and effective parameterization scheme for TC-induced SSTC that can be used in atmosphere-only TC models. The following three steps are taken to achieve this goal: (i) Results from an idealized ocean simulation, together with theoretical and temperature budget analyses, are analyzed to isolate each major mechanism causing TC-induced SSTC, which is then used as a basis for the parameterization; (ii) building upon the idealized ocean simulation, a new SSTC parameterization scheme including vertical mixing, advection, and SST recovery processes under the influences of sea surface height anomalies and ocean subsurface temperature is developed; and (iii) this SSTC parameterization scheme is evaluated through numerical simulations of Typhoon Matsa (2005) and validated against remote sensing data. Results show significant improvements in the simulated TC intensity and SST changes after applying this parameterization scheme. Although further testing with more TC cases is needed, these results are promising, and the parameterization scheme should be compatible with any TC weather prediction model.Plain Language Summary It is well known that tropical cyclones (TCs) may induce local cooling in sea surface temperature (SST), through upwelling of cold water from underneath, which would in turn act to slow down TC intensification. So it is highly desirable to incorporate the fine-scale structures of the TC-induced SST cooling into numerical TC models in order to improve the prediction of TC intensity. In this study, we developed an easy-to-use, fast, and effective parameterization scheme for TC-induced SST cooling that can be used in atmosphere-only TC models. Results show significant improvements in the simulated TC intensity and SST changes after applying this parameterization scheme. Although further testing with more TC cases is needed, the parameterization scheme should be compatible with any TC weather prediction model.

TI  - Impacts of Climate on Spatiotemporal Variations in Vegetation NDVI from 1982-2015 in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - By using the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) third-generation normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3g) data, this paper explores the spatiotemporal variations in vegetation and their relationship with temperature and precipitation between 1982 and 2015 in the Inner Mongolia region of China. Based on yearly scale data, the vegetation changes in Inner Mongolia have experienced three stages from 1982 to 2015: the vegetation activity kept a continuous improvement from 1982-1999, then downward between 1999-2009, and upward from 2009 to 2015. On the whole, the general trend is increasing. Several areas even witnessed significant vegetation increases: in the east and south of Tongliao and Chifeng, north of Xing'anmeng, north and west of Hulunbir, and in the west of Inner Mongolia. Based on monthly scale data, one-year and half-year cycles exist in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and temperature but only a one-year cycle in precipitation. Finally, based on the one-year cycle, the relationship between NDVI and climatic were studied; NDVI has a significant positive correlation with temperature and precipitation, and temperature has a greater effect in promoting vegetation growth than precipitation. Moreover, based on a half-year changing period, NDVI is only affected by temperature in the study region. Those findings can serve as a critical reference for grassland managers or policy makers to make informed decisions on grassland management.

TI  - Warming slowdown over the Tibetan plateau in recent decades
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the recent global warming hiatus and the warming on high elevations are attracting worldwide attention, this study examined the robustness of the warming slowdown over the Tibetan plateau (TP) and its related driving forces. By integrating multiple-source data from 1982 to 2015 and using trend analysis, we found that the mean temperature (T-mean), maximum temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) showed a slowdown of the warming trend around 1998, during the period of the global warming hiatus. This was found over both the growing season (GS) and non-growing season (NGS) and suggested a robust warming hiatus over the TP. Due to the differences in trends of T-max and T-min, the trend of diurnal temperature range (DTR) also shifted after 1998, especially during the GS temperature. The warming rate was spatially heterogeneous. The northern TP (NTP) experienced more warming than the southern TP (STP) in all seasons from 1982 to 1998, while the pattern was reversed in the period from 1998 to 2015. Water vapour was found to be the main driving force for the trend in T-mean and T-min by influencing downward long wave radiation. Sunshine duration was the main driving force behind the trend in T-max and DTR through a change in downward shortwave radiation that altered the energy source of daytime temperature. Water vapour was the major driving force for temperature change over the NTP, while over the STP, sunshine duration dominated the temperature trend.

TI  - Monitoring and forecasting analysis of a landslide in Xinmo, Mao County, using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 24 June 2017, an enormous landslide struck the village of Xinmo in Mao County, Sichuan Province. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1 satellite are chosen to monitor the landslide using the small baseline set (SBAS) technology, following which the deformation time series are obtained for the source area and are found to be consistent with the accelerated creep model. The displacement time series before the landslide clearly show movement processes associated with transient creep, steady-state creep and tertiary creep. The main deformation area is ascertained by calculating the average displacement of 5 representative regions. Three-month time series before the landslide are selected to calculate the failure time of the landslide both separately and together using the inverse-velocity method. The results show that the time series of the main deformation area can fit a linear model of the inverse velocities better than those of the marginal area, and the forecasted time is closer to the actual failure time. The forecasted time calculated using the time series of three regions in main deformation area is June 25, which is only one day apart from the actual failure time.

TI  - Automatic identification of the lake area at Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using remote sensing images
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd Conference of the Asian-Association-for-Quaternary-Research (ASQUA) on Quaternary Environments and Ancient Civilizations in East Asia
CL  - SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The lake area of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) was identified using an automatic waterbody interpretation method. The spectral reflectance of water is much lower than that of other land-surface materials in remote sensing images. The method made use of this characteristic, and divided the lake area into pure water pixels and mixed pixels. In total, 4051 field-collected ground control points of the boundaries of the 17 lakes were used to calibrate and validate the method. The lake area changes from the 1980s to 2015 were also analyzed. It can deal with the mismatch between the grid image boundaries and vector real lake boundaries. Results indicate that it is necessary to consider this mismatch when identifying waterbodies based on remote sensing images, especially in the case of waterbodies with an irregular shape. The method can distinguish waterbodies from wetlands and glaciers, and the interpretation accuracy was improved. In 2015, 1177 lakes with an area larger than 1 km(2) were recorded; the total lake area of the QTP was 43873.6 km(2). In general, the QTP lakes have expanded during the past several decades. The lake area has increased by 18.3% from the 1980s to 2015. This indicates expansion in the Northern Tibetan Plateau and shrinkage in the southern region of the QTP. The changes of precipitation were the main reasons for lake area changes on the QTP. However, the increased glacier melt runoff played a dominant role in the upper regions of the Yalungzangbo and Yellow rivers. The method proposed herein can be easily applied to other studies to monitor waterbodies based on remote sensing images, especially in the case of large waterbodies.

T2  - BMJ HEALTH & CARE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo develop an ontology to identify pregnant women from computerised medical record systems with dissimilar coding systems in a primary care sentinel network.Materials and methodsWe used a three-step approach to develop our pregnancy ontology in two different coding schemata, one hierarchical and the other polyhierarchical. We developed a coding system-independent pregnancy case identification algorithm using the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network database which held 1.8 million patients' data drawn from 150 primary care providers. We tested the algorithm by examining individual patient records in a 10% random sample of all women aged 29 in each year from 2004 to 2016. We did an external comparison with national pregnancy data. We used chi (2) test to compare results obtained for the two different coding schemata.Results243 005 women (median age 29 years at start of pregnancy) had 405 591 pregnancies from 2004 to 2016 of which 333 689 went to term. We found no significant difference between results obtained for two populations using different coding schemata. Pregnancy mean ages did not differ significantly from national data.DiscussionThis ontologically driven algorithm enables consistent analysis across data drawn from populations using different coding schemata. It could be applied to other hierarchical coding systems (eg, International Classification of Disease) or polyhierarchical systems (eg, SNOMED CT to which our health system is currently migrating).ConclusionThis ontological approach will improve our surveillance in particular of influenza vaccine exposure in pregnancy.

TI  - Remote sensing evidence for a possible 10 kilometer in diameter impact structure in north-central Niger
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing investigations of West Africa reveal a roughly 10 km in diameter, circular feature in north central Niger. The circular feature is located within Early Devonian fluvio-marine sedimentary strata about 100 km to the north of a suite of igneous ring dikes located in the Air Massif. Whether the circular feature is related to the ring dikes, structural doming, or an impact crater can be evaluated from earlier geologic mapping (Black, 1967) and image analyses. Previous mapping indicates that the circular feature is defined by outcrops of Devonian Idekel sandstone and the Late Proterozoic, weakly-metamorphosed molasse of the Proche-Tenere Formation. Absent in published lithologic descriptions of these sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks are diapiric evaporite deposits that could produce the observed circular morphologies. Lithologies that define the circular feature are confirmed by classification techniques using the ENVI software platform and band ratios/math from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A data. Spectral profile comparisons between the igneous intrusive rocks exposed in the Air Massif, outcrops of sedimentary rock that are proximal to the circular feature, and desert sand confirm that the sedimentary rocks mapped by Black (1967) define the circular feature. The shallow subsurface structure, revealed through Spacebome Imaging Radar-C data, and 3-D modeling using Sentinel 1A data, is also not consistent with nearby ring dike structures. These data suggest that the circular feature did not likely form as a magmatic intrusion close to the time of sedimentary rock deposition. We propose that the circular feature formed from either a meteorite impact after deposition of the host sedimentary units or by some other, but less likely, geologic process. Confirmation of an impact explanation for the circular feature would require sample analysis and inspection for shock-metamorphosed materials.

TI  - Detection and prediction of land use/land cover change using spatiotemporal data fusion and the Cellular Automata-Markov model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection and prediction of land use/land cover (LULC) change is crucial for guiding land resource management, planning, and sustainable development. In the view of seasonal rhythm and phenological effect, detection and prediction would benefit greatly from LULC maps of the same seasons for different years. However, due to frequent cloudiness contamination, it is difficult to obtain same-season LULC maps when using existing remote sensing images. This study utilized the spatiotemporal data fusion (STF) method to obtain summer Landsat-scale images in Hefei over the past 30years. The Cellular Automata-Markov model was applied to simulate and predict future LULC maps. The results demonstrate the following: (1) the STF method can generate the same inter-annual interval summer Landsat-scale data for analyzing LULC change; (2) the fused data can improve the LULC detection and prediction accuracy by shortening the inter-annual interval, and also obtain LULC prediction results for a specific year; (3) the areas of cultivated land, water, and vegetation decreased by 33.14%, 2.03%, and 16.36%, respectively, and the area of construction land increased by 200.46% from 1987 to 2032. The urban expansion rate will reach its peak until 2020, and then slow down. The findings provide valuable information for urban planners to achieve sustainable development goals.

TI  - Modeling of Thin-Cloud TOA Reflectance Using Empirical Relationships and Two Landsat-8 Visible Band Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are a common barrier of satellite optical images and adversely affect applications of remotely sensed optical data sets. The optical thickness of clouds varies spatiotemporally. The thickness can be very thin making the detection of thin clouds difficult. A new cirrus band (Band-9) of Landsat-8 has been added to detect thin clouds. However, the majority of spaceborne optical sensors existed previously or in operation do not have the cirrus band. An algorithm is developed to detect thin clouds without using a cirrus band. In particular, the top-of-atmosphere reflectance of thin clouds is modeled using the empirical relationships of the deep blue and blue bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager. A Landsat-8 image of path 14/row 36 near southeastern North Carolina, USA, is used to validate the algorithm. Thin clouds are well-identified when compared to Landsat-8 Band-9 data. The spatial correlation coefficient for both is 93.49%. Therefore, the algorithm is valid. The algorithm is further verified when a blue band and a green band are used to develop the algorithm. Thus, the analytical approach should be extendible to Landsats 4, 5, and 7 sensors or optical sensors as long as they have a blue band and a green band. Finally, the applicability of the algorithm under various atmospheric conditions is verified after analyzing two water vapor absorption spectral bands of NASA/JPL Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data.

TI  - Quantitative responses of satellite-derived night-time light signals to urban depopulation during Chinese New Year
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As an efficient proxy measure for various kinds of human activity, remotely sensed data of night-time light (NTL) have been widely studied. The connection between NTL and human population dynamics over fine time/space scales, however, is less understood. In this study, using NTL data derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and population dynamics sensed by the largest Chinese social media platform, we performed a nationwide analysis regarding whether NTL signals respond in a timely manner to provisional urban depopulation during the Chinese New Year holiday. Our results show that nearly three quarters of urban pixels with decreased NTL brightness show a marked decline in population, and more than half of the pixels showing reduced population can be identified through dimmed night-time lights. Moreover, our findings indicate that there might be a log-linear positive correlation between the magnitude of urban depopulation and the reduced brightness of NTL at both the pixel and city levels. Our findings suggest the overall usefulness of current VIIRS NTL data for investigating population dynamics at short time scales in terms of spatial extent and magnitude.

TI  - An Automatic Morphological Attribute Building Extraction Approach for Satellite High Spatial Resolution Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new morphological attribute building index (MABI) and shadow index (MASI) are proposed here for automatically extracting building features from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing satellite images. By investigating the associated attributes in morphological attribute filters (AFs), the proposed method establishes a relationship between AFs and the characteristics of buildings/shadows in VHR images (e.g., high local contrast, internal homogeneity, shape, and size). In the pre-processing step of the proposed work, attribute filtering was conducted on the original VHR spectral reflectance data to obtain the input, which has a high homogeneity, and to suppress elongated objects (potential non-buildings). Then, the MABI and MASI were calculated by taking the obtained input as a base image. The dark buildings were considered separately in the MABI to reduce the omission of the dark roofs. To better detect buildings from the MABI feature image, an object-oriented analysis and building-shadow concurrence relationships were utilized to further filter out non-building land covers, such as roads and bare ground, that are confused for buildings. Three VHR datasets from two satellite sensors, i.e., Worldview-2 and QuickBird, were tested to determine the detection performance. In view of both the visual inspection and quantitative assessment, the results of the proposed work are superior to recent automatic building index and supervised binary classification approach results.

TI  - High-Resolution Spaceborne, Airborne and In Situ Landslide Kinematic Measurements of the Slumgullion Landslide in Southwest Colorado
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Slumgullion landslide, located in southwestern Colorado, has been active since the early 1700s and current data suggests that the most active portion of the slide creeps at a rate of similar to 1.5-2.0 cm/day. Accurate deformation measurement techniques are vital to the understanding of persistent, yet slow-moving landslides like the Slumgullion. The factors that affect slope movements at the Slumgullion are on-time scales that are well suited towards a remotely sensed approach to constrain the 12 different kinematic units that make up the persistent creeping landslide. We derive a time series of motion vectors (magnitude and direction) using subpixel offset techniques from very high resolution TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight ascending/descending data as well as from a novel high-resolution amalgamation of airborne lidar and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) Structure from Motion (SfM) digital surface model (DSM) hillshades. Deformation rates calculated from the spaceborne and airborne datasets show high agreement (mean difference of similar to 0.9 mm/day), further highlighting the potential for the monitoring of ongoing mass wasting events utilizing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) We compare pixel offset results from an 11-day synthetic aperture radar (SAR) pair acquired in July of 2016 with motion vectors from a coincident low-cost L1 only Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) field campaign in order to verify the remotely sensed results and to derive the accuracy of the azimuth and range offsets. We find that the average azimuth and range pixel offset accuracies utilizing the methods herein are on the order of 1/18 and 1/20 of their along-track and slant range focused ground pixel spacing values of 16.8 cm and 45.5 cm, respectively. We utilize the SAR offset time series to add a twelfth kinematic unit to the previously established set of eleven unique regions at the site of an established minislide within the main landslide itself. Lastly, we compare the calculated rates and direction from all spaceborne- and airborne-derived motion vectors for each of the established kinematic zones within the active portion of the landslide. These comparisons show an overall increased magnitude and across-track component (i.e., more westerly angles of motion) for the descending SAR data as compared to their ascending counterparts. The processing techniques and subsequent results herein provide for an improved knowledge of the Slumgullion landslide's kinematics and this increased knowledge has implications for the advancement of measurement techniques and the understanding of globally distributed creeping landslides.

TI  - Temporal patterns of phytoplankton phenology across high latitude lakes unveiled by long-term time series of satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring temporal changes in phytoplankton dynamics in high latitude lakes is particularly timely for understanding the impacts of warming on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed 33-years of high resolution (30 m) Landsat (LT) data for reconstructing seasonal patterns of chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in four lakes across Finland, between 60 degrees N and 64 degrees N. Chl a models based on LT spectral bands were calibrated using 17-years (2000-2016) of field measurements collected across the four lakes. These models were then applied for estimating chl a using the entire LT-5 and 7 archives. Approximately 630 images, from 1984 to 2017, were analyzed for each lake. The chl a seasonal patterns were characterized using phenology metrics, and the time-series of LT-based chl a estimates were used for identifying temporal shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a concentration. Our results showed an increase in the length of phytoplankton growth season in three of the lakes. The highest increase was observed in Lake Koylionjarvi, where the length of growth season has increased by 28 days from the baseline period of 1984-1994 to 2007-2017. The increase in the length of season was mainly attributed to an earlier start of phytoplankton blooms. We further analyzed surface temperature (T-s) and precipitation data to verify if climatic factors could explain the shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a. We found no direct relationship between T-s and chl a seasonal patterns. Similarly, the phonological metrics of Ts, in particular length of season, did not show significant temporal trends. On the other hand, we identify potential links between changes in precipitation patterns and the increase in the phytoplankton season length. We verified a significant increase in the rainfall contribution to the total precipitation during the autumn and winter, accompanied by a decline in snowfall volumes. This could indicate an increasing runoff volume during the beginning of spring, contributing to an earlier onset of the phytoplankton blooms, although further assessments are needed to analyze historical streamflow values and nearby land cover data. Likewise, additional studies are needed to better understand why chl a patterns in some lakes seem to be more resilient than in others.
