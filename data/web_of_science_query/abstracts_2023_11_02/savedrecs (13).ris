TI  - Understanding the states and dynamics of mangrove forests in land cover transitions of The Gambia using a Fourier transformation of Landsat and MODIS time series in Google Earth Engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionMangroves are resilient forests of transitional zones between land, ocean and freshwater for they are tolerant to salinity. In The Gambia, mangrove forests are found along the coast of Atlantic Ocean and River Gambia where they support the livelihoods of millions through multiple ecosystems services. Despite their importance in The Gambia, consistent country-wide information on their coverage, dynamics and change hotspots are lacking. Thus far, it remains unclear whether the coverage of mangroves has decreased or increased over the last few decades. Often, the existing estimates vary strongly across sources and the methodologies in the available literature are not always reproducible. This study attempts to fill these gaps by providing up-to-date spatial information on mangrove forests in The Gambia. MethodsTo provide a reproducible workflow and a comprehensive assessment, we used continuous time series of freely available data to study the extent and dynamics of mangrove forests in The Gambia. To construct gap-free image time series, we used statistical models to describe land surface phenology based on monthly composites derived from Landsat and MODIS land surface reflectance acquired between 2000 and 2020. We used 1212 Landsat and 407 MODIS tiles spread across multiple spectral indices along with a calibrated set of training and validation data to train and validate a random forest classifier for accurate land cover classifications. Results and discussionThe overall accuracy and Kappa statistics of the classifications range between 0.96 and 0.98. Our findings suggest a net increase of 4,000 ha in mangrove forests over the last 2 decades, corresponding to an annual rate of 200 ha. The net increase is largely due to strong policy making which results in participative forest resource management through the national forest action plan. The net increase in mangrove forests should not mask the substantial degradation in some places across the country. We estimated a total loss of nearly 5,670 ha, most of which appears to have taken place during the last decade in favor of wetlands. The Gambian mangroves are amongst the most promising green business in Gulf of Guinea, deserving an integrated governance - policy framework that address the key requirements for ecological sustainability.

TI  - Cost-benefit analysis of remote sensing data types for mapping mosquito breeding sites
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmentally friendly biological mosquito control by Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis formulations needs appropriate breeding maps. The mapping accuracy depends on the quality of the used remote sensing data. Further, the mapping is expected to be cost-effective. Our aim was to study the effect of the quality of various remote sensing data on the applicability of the maps. We depicted larval habitats by manual interpretation in Quantum GIS 3.16.1 software using remote sensing data of SENTINEL, Google Earth, commercial geoTIFF RGB orthophoto, individual unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) RGB, and multispectral mosaics. Based on our results, after classification of the target area by sorting, mixed-use of remote sensing data is required to achieve a highly cost-efficient mapping: RGB aerial photographs with 0.5 m per pixel resolution can be used efficiently in areas dominated by grassland habitats, while forest areas need customised footage taken by UAS or drones during the foliage-free period (15 cm per pixel resolution, multispectral technique). Our cost-benefit analysis showed that the aim-optimised method could reduce investment to 6-8% and the cost of data collection to 20-50% of the highest budget. This result is significant for all participants of biological mosquito control.

TI  - Potential of GIS and remote sensing in mapping land degradation: catchment of the Manyame River, Zimbabwe
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Manyame River Catchment area in Zimbabwe is experiencing severe land degradation mainly due to legal and illegal land husbandry practices. These practices are negatively impacting the sustainability of the existing ecosystems. The conditions of the land can be inferred using its vegetative cover, e.g., the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Quantitative data relating to land degradation based on notable physical features such as gullies, for the Manyame River Catchment at landscape scales are poor. This study focused on the distribution and magnitude of land degradation in the Manyame River Catchment area. The study mapped out the contours of human-induced land degradation using a residual trend analysis (RESTREND) method. In particular, the study used remotely sensed data (NDVI and precipitation time series) to analyse the shifts over the period 2000-2017. The analysis used R statistical software packages (RESTREND and Kendall) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to quantify the degradation trends. The results indicated extracts of those areas which experienced significant human-induced land degradation during the study period. RESTREND effectiveness was assessed using Mann- Kendall. The results of this study can be used by natural resource practitioners in monitoring, assessing, and managing environmental changes using GIS tools.

TI  - A remotely sensed study of the impact of meteorological parameters on vegetation for the eastern basins of Afghanistan
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Despite the importance of the Amu Darya and Kabul River Basins as a region in which more than 15 million people live, and its vulnerability to global warming, only a few studies addressed the issue of the linkage of meteorological parameters on vegetation for the eastern basins of Afghanistan. In this study, data from the MODIS, Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) was used for the period from 2000 to 2021. The study utilized several indices, such as Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Optical Integrated Drought Index (OIDI). The relationships between meteorological quantities, drought conditions, and vegetation variations were examined by analyzing the anomalies and using regression methods. The results showed that the years 2000, 2001, and 2008 had the lowest vegetation coverage (VC) (56, 56, and 55% of the study area, respectively). On the other hand, the years 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2020 had the highest VC (71, 71, 72, and 72% of the study area, respectively). The trend of the VC for the eastern basins of Afghanistan for the period from 2000 to 2021 was upward. High correlations between VC and soil moisture (R = 0.73, p = 0.0008), and precipitation (R = 0.63, p = 0.0014) were found and also significant correlation was found between VC and drought index OIDI. It was revealed that soil moisture, precipitation, land surface temperature, and area under meteorological drought conditions explained 45% of annual VC variability. It was also found that the orography had a significant influence on both the spatial distribution of the LST and VCI, as well as the spatial correlations between VCI and meteorological parameters.

TI  - Determining the precise extent of sentinel basins during laparoscopic gastrectomy for early gastric cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeBy analyzing sentinel basin dissection (SBD) data from the SEntinel Node ORIented Tailored Approach (SENORITA) trial, we sought to determine the precise extent of the sentinel basin (SB) without a tracer.Materials and methodsThis study investigated SB length in patients (n = 25) who underwent laparoscopic SBD for early gastric cancer (EGC) in the SENORITA trial. SB length along the greater curvature (GC) and lesser curvature (LC) was measured intraoperatively before performing SBD.ResultsIn all 25 cases, along the LC of the stomach, the lengths of the SB were 3.7 cm [2.0-5.0] (median [min-max]) proximally and 3.0 cm [2.3-5.5] distally; along the GC side, the lengths of the SB were 6.8 cm [3.5-11.0] proximally and 7.0 cm [3.8-9.5] distally from the tumors. The SB length at the GC or LC side was not significantly different between subgroups categorized by tumor depth, size, and longitudinal location. When tumors were located at the anterior wall of the stomach, the length of the proximal SB (10.0 cm [9.0-11.0]) at the GC side was the longest. In cases with several sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), the lengths of the SB at the GC side were significantly longer than those with fewer SLNs. However, the lengths of the SB were similar on the LC side regardless of the number of SLNs.ConclusionsThis pilot study had some limitations of a small number of enrolled patients, the lack of research on the specific station of SLNs, and the inaccurate indication for sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) without tracer. Nevertheless, the present study which reported the extents of SBs might be the first step towards simplifying procedures in laparoscopic SNNS for stomach preservation in EGC.

TI  - Earthquake building damage detection based on synthetic-aperture-radar imagery and machine learning
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a framework for semi-automated building damage assessment due to earthquakes from remote-sensing data and other supplementary datasets, while also leveraging recent advances in machine-learning algorithms. The framework integrates high-resolution building inventory data with earthquake ground shaking intensity maps and surface-level changes detected by comparing pre- and post-event InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) images. We demonstrate the use of ensemble models in a machine-learning approach to classify the damage state of buildings in the area affected by an earthquake. Both multi-class and binary damage classification are attempted for four recent earthquakes, and we compare the predicted damage labels with ground truth damage grade labels reported in field surveys. For three out of the four earthquakes studied, the model is able to identify over 50 % or nearly half of the damaged buildings successfully when using binary classification. Multi-class damage grade classification using InSAR data has rarely been attempted previously, and the case studies presented in this report represent one of the first such attempts using InSAR data.

TI  - The CHROMA cloud-top pressure retrieval algorithm for the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite mission
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides the theoretical basis and simulated retrievals for the Cloud Height Retrieval from O-2 Molecular Absorption (CHROMA) algorithm. Simulations are performed for the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), which is the primary payload on the forthcoming NASA Plank-ton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, and the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) currently flying on the Sentinel 3 satellites. CHROMA is a Bayesian approach which simultaneously retrieves cloud optical thick-ness (COT), cloud-top pressure and height (CTP and CTH respectively), and (with a significant prior constraint) surface albedo. Simulated retrievals suggest that the sensor and algorithm should be able to meet the PACE mission goal for CTP error, which is +/- 60 mb for 65 % of opaque (COT >= 3) single-layer clouds on global average. CHROMA will provide pixel-level uncertainty estimates, which are demonstrated to have skill at telling low-error situations from high-error ones. CTP uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated in magnitude, although COT uncertainty is overestimated relative to observed errors. OLCI performance is found to be slightly better than OCI overall, demonstrating that it is a suitable proxy for the latter in advance of PACE's launch. CTP error is only weakly sensitive to correct cloud phase identification or assumed ice crystal habit/roughness. As with other similar algorithms, for simulated retrievals of multi-layer systems consisting of optically thin cirrus clouds above liquid clouds, retrieved height tends to be underestimated because the satellite signal is dominated by the optically thicker lower layer. Total (liquid plus ice) COT also becomes underestimated in these situations. However, retrieved CTP becomes closer to that of the upper ice layer for ice COT asymptotic to 3 or higher.

TI  - Monitoring carbon stock changes in Solan Forest Division of Indian Western Himalayas
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) has rich forest resources but is increasingly threatened by changes in land use. It is therefore imperative to understand forest carbon budgets and ecosystem productivity in this ecologically sensitive mountain landscape. The study assessed spatial distribution and changes in forest carbon stocks of Solan Forest Division over the period 1998-2010. Forest inventory data was gathered from the Divisional Working Plan and through field enumeration. The IRS 1D (LISS-III) satellite data were preprocessed through geometric and radiometric corrections. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from the reflectance of red and near-infrared radiation. Statistical relationships between inventory-based forest carbon stocks and NDVI were used as a basis for spatial extrapolation to the whole region. A significant relationship was observed between carbon stock and NDVI for both 1998 (R = 0.741) and 2010 (R = 0.663). The carbon density ranged from < 10.49 to 168.03 t ha(-1) (1998) and from < 11.32 to 181.23 t ha(-1) (2010). Over the period 1998-2010 although the forest area decreased, the carbon stock increased by < 0.71 to 11.49%. Imposition of felling bans, afforestation, natural ageing of secondary forests and profuse natural regeneration may be associated with the observed increase in carbon stock. The study suggested that NDVI derived from optical imageries can be utilised to assess vegetation carbon dynamics in subtropical forests of the region. Among a myriad of mitigation options, maintaining and enhancing carbon in forested landscapes remains an efficacious strategy. Similar studies in fragile ecosystems vulnerable to anthropogenic modification can facilitate robust monitoring of terrestrial carbon sequestration and its capacity in meeting emission reduction targets.

TI  - Large-scale mapping of new mixed rice cropping patterns in southern China with phenology-based algorithm and MODIS dataset
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Jianghan Plain is a traditional paddy rice cropping area in southern China, consisting of single-cropping rice (SCR) and double-cropping rice (DCR). In recent years, the integrated farming of rice and crayfish (IRC) has developed rapidly in the area. The purpose of this study was to employ multiple vegetation indices derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data to update the rice cropping pattern map of the Jianghan Plain. The Enhanced Vegetation Index combined with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Land Surface Water Index was applied to extract the phenological stages of paddy fields based on their spectral signatures. Then, the spatial distribution of SCR, DCR, and IRC was mapped by the phenology-based algorithm. The spatial comparison between MODIS-based mapping results and high spatial-resolution data showed that the overall classification accuracy (CA) was 91.69%. The CA of SCR, DCR, and IRC was 91.25%, 92.00%, and 92.50%, respectively. The total MODIS-derived rice area had a good quantitative consistency with statistical data (R-2 = 0.86, P < 0.01) and land-use data (R-2 = 0.63, P < 0.01). The research demonstrated the promise of the MODIS dataset in mapping croplands mixed with paddy fields and rice-crayfish fields over large areas.

TI  - Mapping photovoltaic power stations and assessing their environmental impacts from multi-sensor datasets in Massachusetts, United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy is often viewed as a sustainable alternative to non-renewable energy, yet the debate between solar energy promotion and environmental cost has received growing attention. Accurate geographic information of photovoltaic power stations is a prerequisite for quantifying cost and benefit of clean energy promotion. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the environmental impacts of photovoltaic power stations by geo-mapping solar panels over space and time. Based on the case of Massachusetts, United States, we classified the solar panel arrays using object -based image analysis on Sentinel-2 monthly composites, identified the per-array construction year based upon 20-year all available Landsat time-series dataset, and assessed the solar-induced environmental impacts with various environmental datasets. The accuracy assessment suggests that our classification performs well for detecting solar arrays (overall accuracy: 96%), depicting photovoltaic power stations geometry (average Jaccard Index value: 0.70), and capturing the construction years (percentage of temporal bias less than one year: 73%). Solar-induced land use and cover changes have largely occurred in forest and cropland, where 49% and 23% of the solar arrays have been installed, respectively. Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis uncovers that more than half of the mapped solar arrays were built in proximity (within 500 m) to rare wildlife habitats or adjacent to wetlands. This work exemplifies a new framework for identifying multifaceted land change information through a combination of finer-resolution Sentinel-2 images and long Landsat-based data archive. The findings can be useful for informing spatial planning and contributing to the growth, expansion, advancement, and location selection of solar installation arrays. The study also provides a new perspective for monitoring forest loss due to clean energy promotion and addressing critical issues of local conflicts between solar energy and environmental conservation.

TI  - Alternatives and reduced need for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) staging for melanoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been introduced in the 1990s to identify patients who might benefit from completion lymph node dissection. Neither SLNB nor CLND improved survival, but SLNB staging did provide the best staging, above Breslow thickness and ulceration. The SLN status and SLN tumour burden were used in all trials until date look-ing at modern adjuvant systemic therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) or targeted therapies (TT). Adjuvant ICI and TT are shifting towards stage II melanoma. The question is whether there is still role for SLNB in melanoma, in this day and age, and if so, how does the future look for SLNB staging? The SLN status and SLN tumour burden might be useful for a consultation to discuss the number needed to treat in a risk/benefit discussion. For stage IIB/C patients, it seems likely, however, that patients will forego a nuclear scan followed by the risk of surgical intervention and morbidity associated with SLNB if they opt to receive adjuvant therapy regardless of the SLNB result. For stage I/IIA, it is still required to detect high-risk patients who might benefit from adjuvant therapy. However, biomarkers are emerging, such as gene expression profilers (GEP), immunohistological signatures and liquid biopsies with ctDNA. There still is a role for SLNB staging in melanoma today, but we expect that the avail-ability of therapeutic option independent of SLNB status as well as emergence of validated biomarkers to predict risk will reduce the need for SLNB staging in the upcoming decade to the point it will no longer be used.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Channel capacity limit of multi-beam satellite system
T2  - WIRELESS NETWORKS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The requests of broadband coverage area and the expected user demand is satisfied by the satellite industry by using multiple spot beams of high throughput satellites with fixed multi-beam pattern and footprint planning. The technology core of high-throughput satellite is multi-beam technology, and the means to efficiently reuse spectrum is a full-frequency reuse scheme. In order to study the channel capacity limit of multi-beam satellite systems, the Wiener-Gaussian access model of terrestrial cellular systems is analyzed in this paper. This paper analyzes the Wiener-Gaussian access model of terrestrial cellular systems, then considers the difference between the spatial characteristics and gain characteristics of the multi-beam satellite system compared with the terrestrial cellular system, and proposes a Wiener model suitable for the multi-beam satellite communication system. On this basis, the channel capacity limit of multi-beam satellites under different fading conditions is deduced when using optimal linear precoding and minimum mean square error precoding. It provides theoretical support for the in-depth study of the channel capacity mechanism and system performance of multi-beam satellites.

TI  - Global Dam Tracker: A database of more than 35,000 dams with location, catchment, and attribute information
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present one of the most comprehensive geo-referenced global dam databases to date. The Global Dam Tracker (GDAT) contains 35,000 dams with cross-validated geo-coordinates, satellite-derived catchment areas, and detailed attribute information. Combining GDAT with fine-scaled satellite data spanning three decades, we demonstrate how GDAT improves upon existing databases to enable the inter-temporal analysis of the costs and benefits of dam construction on a global scale. Our findings show that over the past three decades, dams have contributed to a dramatic increase in global surface water coverage, especially in developing countries in Asia and South America. This is an important step toward a more systematic understanding of the worldwide impact of dams on local communities. By filling in the data gap, GDAT would help inform a more sustainable and equitable approach to energy access and economic development.

TI  - Traits of dominant plant species drive normalized difference vegetation index in grasslands globally
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Theoretical, experimental and observational studies have shown that biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships are influenced by functional community structure through two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms: (1) the dominance effect (which relates to the traits of the dominant species); and (2) the niche partitioning effect [which relates to functional diversity (FD)]. Although both mechanisms have been studied in plant communities and experiments at small spatial extents, it remains unclear whether evidence from small-extent case studies translates into a generalizable macroecological pattern. Here, we evaluate dominance and niche partitioning effects simultaneously in grassland systems world-wide.Location: Two thousand nine hundred and forty-one grassland plots globally.Time period: 2000-2014.Major taxa studied: Vascular plants.Methods: We obtained plot-based data on functional community structure from the global vegetation plot database "sPlot ", which combines species composition with plant trait data from the "TRY " database. We used data on the community-weighted mean (CWM) and FD for 18 ecologically relevant plant traits. As an indicator of primary productivity, we extracted the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS. Using generalized additive models and deviation partitioning, we estimated the contributions of trait CWM and FD to the variation in annual maximum NDVI, while controlling for climatic variables and spatial structure.Results: Grassland communities dominated by relatively tall species with acquisitive traits had higher NDVI values, suggesting the prevalence of dominance effects for BEF relationships. We found no support for niche partitioning for the functional traits analysed, because NDVI remained unaffected by FD. Most of the predictive power of traits was shared by climatic predictors and spatial coordinates. This highlights the importance of community assembly processes for BEF relationships in natural communities.Main conclusions: Our analysis provides empirical evidence that plant functional community structure and global patterns in primary productivity are linked through the resource economics and size traits of the dominant species. This is an important test of the hypotheses underlying BEF relationships at the global scale.

TI  - Do precipitation anomalies influence short-term mobility in sub-saharan Africa? An observational study from 23 countries
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPrecipitation anomalies are associated with a number of poor health outcomes. One potential consequence of precipitation extremes is human geographic mobility. We evaluated the associations between precipitation anomalies (droughts and heavy rains) and short-term mobility in 23 sub-Saharan African countries by linking satellite data on precipitation to cross-sectional representative surveys.MethodsUsing data from 23 Demographic and Health Surveys from 2011 to 2017, we estimated the associations between deviations in long-term rainfall trends and short-term mobility among 294,539 women and 136,415 men over 15 years of age. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to assess potential non-linear relationships between rainfall deviations and short-term mobility, adjusting for survey month and socio-demographic covariates, and stratified by participant gender. Furthermore, we assessed whether these associations differed by marital status.ResultsRainfall deviations were associated with short-term mobility among women, but not men. The relationship between rainfall deviations and mobility among women was U-shaped, such that women had increased marginal probabilities of mobility in instances of both lower and heavier precipitation. Differences between married and unmarried women were also revealed: among married women, we found positive associations between both rainfall deviation extremes (drought and heavy rains) and mobility; however, among unmarried women, there was only a positive association for heavy rains.ConclusionPrecipitation anomalies were associated with short-term mobility among women, which may be in turn associated with poor health outcomes. More research with longitudinal data is needed to elaborate the associations between weather shocks, mobility, and downstream health impacts.

TI  - Large-scale mapping of solifluction terraces in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau using high-resolution satellite images and deep learning
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solifluction terraces are a topographic and sedimentary signature for understanding the mechanism of soli-fluction occurrence and the past climate (e.g., paleoclimate), and have also impacts on hillslope stability. Traditional field surveys and aerial remote sensing have been primarily employed to map solifluction terraces, but they have challenges in large-scale mapping, which results in little knowledge of spatial distribution of so-lifluction terraces in many areas of the world. In this study, we made a first attempt at large-scale mapping of solifluction terraces based on high-resolution satellite remote sensing images and deep learning in the Luhuo and Xinduqiao areas, located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Enriched training samples were firstly generated through manually delineated 1057 solifluction terrace and non-solifluction terrace polygons in Luhuo and data augmentation. The DeepLabv3+ model (Chen et al., 2018) was then trained by these diverse and abundant samples, and employed to Gaofen-2 satellite images for extraction of solifluction terraces in both the Luhuo and Xinduqiao areas. The performance estimation showed that the F1-score, precision, and recall reached 91.15 %, 84.56 %, and 98.85 % in the Luhuo area, and 84.30 %, 84.90 %, and 83.71 % in the Xinduqiao area, respectively. The extracted results of solifluction terraces were also validated by field investigations in the Xinduqiao area. Moreover, we found that the solifluction terraces were mainly distributed around the slope angle of 21 degrees and concentrated in the altitude range of 3000-3900 m, but the slope orientations were heterogeneous in both areas. Our results demonstrated that the combination of high-resolution satellite images and deep learning had a sig-nificant potential for mapping solifluction terraces at regional and global scales.

TI  - A tohu (sign) to open our eyes to the realities of Indigenous Maori registered nurses: A qualitative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Identify the experiences of Maori nurses and priorities for a Maori model of relational care working with Maori patients and their whanau (extended family network) in acute hospital services.Background: Maori, the Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa (New Zealand), have a relational and holistic worldview fundamental to establishing relationships with Maori patients and their whanau. Increasing the Indigenous Maori nursing workforce can improve Maori patient experiences but is challenged by ongoing recruitment and retention issues.Design: A qualitative Maori-centred research methodology with 12 Maori nurses.Methods: Data were collected using wananga (learning through discussion, deliberation and consideration) using he aha o hikoi (journey mapping) and korero mai (storytelling). Inductive thematic analysis was undertaken using a mahi a roopu (group process) approach. This study was conducted between May 2022 and June 2022.Results: Three key themes: (1) Maori first, nurse second, (2) Cultural loading and (3) Compromised realities were identified. Maori nurses' praxis used their complex cultural and clinical intelligence to engage in a mana-enhancing way (strengths-based) to improve the care delivery for whanau Maori during their hospitalization journey. Cultural loading meant Maori nurses were often burdened with unrecognized workloads as they provided care for Maori patients and whanau, which often compromised their cultural integrity. Conclusion: Nurses' commitment to care for whanau and their assigned patient load created extra burdens and threatened their cultural integrity. Their experiences highlighted modes of practice rather than models of care required to improve healthcare delivery for Maori entering the hospital. These findings signal issues and areas nursing leaders need to heed, necessary for addressing the retention of Maori in nursing and improving workload equity.Patient or Public Contribution: Maori nurses and service users were involved in the interpretation of the data.

TI  - Statistical evaluation of snow accumulation and depletion from remotely sensed MODIS snow time series data using the SARIMA model
T2  - AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the remote and challenging terrain of the Himalayan region, accurate measurement of cyclic snow accumulation and depletion is a significant challenge. To overcome this, an attempt has been made in the present study by applying a statistical analysis of MODIS snow time series data with the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model from 2003 to 2018 over the Beas river basin. The Box-Jenkins methodology of forecasting is based on the identification using seasonality, stationarity, ACF, and PACF plots; and estimation based on maximum likelihood techniques; and the last diagnostic checking based on the residual and error values have been used. Later, forecasting models have been proposed separately for the snow accumulation period (October-February) as (1,1,1) (0,1,3)(19) and for the snow depletion period (March-September) as (1,1,1) (1,1,2)(27) after calibration of the data (2003-2015) and the same were then validated using data (2016-2018). The accuracy assessment of the models has been checked using performance criteria like AIC, MSE, and RSS. The comparison of the forecasting models with the observed data showed a good agreement with R-2 of 0.83 and 0.89 for snow accumulation and snow depletion, respectively. This research highlights the potential of utilizing satellite data and statistical modeling to address the challenges of monitoring snow cover in remote and inaccessible regions.

TI  - Revealing the river ice phenology on the Tibetan Plateau using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 overlapping orbit imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice monitoring is vital for water resources, hydrological research, and operational management of flood risk from ice jams. Remote sensing offers an efficient way to monitor river ice. However, limited by the temporal and spatial resolutions of imagery, research regarding river ice phenology and processes on the Tibetan Plateau are lacking. This study provides an innovative monitoring approach to the river ice phenology on the Tibetan Plateau using imagery from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites in regions where the satellite orbits overlap during the cold season. We selected representative river reaches in different basins and climate zones in the overlapping orbit regions to reveal the river ice phenology and process on the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that the overlapping orbit imagery significantly improved the temporal resolution of river ice moni-toring, and detailed information on river ice phenology and processes could be obtained. The ice-cover durations in different river reaches on the Tibetan Plateau varied, ranging from 55 to 277 days. The ice-cover period tended to be longer in the river reaches with high latitudes and elevations. In addition, the river ice processes in reaches with flow cutoff were different from those in reaches with no flow cutoff. In winter, the ice period in cutoff flow river reaches was longer than that in non-cutoff flow river reaches. In a typical braided channel on the plateau, water usually froze in a small channel with low velocity, and the resulting ice gradually spreads to other small channels. This research is the first to investigate the river ice phenology and processes on the Tibetan Plateau, and the relevant results provide a reference for river ice studies on this plateau.

TI  - Monitoring rice grain protein accumulation dynamics based on UAV multispectral data
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context or problem: The rapid and accurate estimation of grain protein accumulation (GPA) dynamics in rice by remote sensing (RS) is essential for rice grain quality assessment. However, challenges are faced when multi -spectral data are directly used to estimate the GPA due to the lack of corresponding sensitive feature bands. Objective or research question: The purpose of this study is to establish an estimation model that can monitor the dynamics of grain protein accumulation after rice heading. It aims to solve the monitoring of dynamic indicators (such as GPA) in the process of grain quality formation. Methods: To achieve progress in GPA monitoring, physiological parameters that are closely connected to GPA must be considered as an intermediate bridge between RS and GPA. The indirect model of "spectral parameter -physiological parameter -protein accumulation dynamic" was used in this study to develop a RS method for monitoring the dynamics of GPA based on a machine learning method. The GPA three-parameter estimation model was established using three physiological parameters as intermediate parameters: leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), and nitrogen harvest index (NHI) with the leaf N status. Results: The results show that the indirect model outperforms the direct estimation model of protein accumu-lation based on the vegetation index in terms of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the GPA three-parameter estimation model was tested using dataset from different multispectral cameras (Mini-MCA6 and AIRPHEN), revealing the good performance with R2 and RMSE of 0.71 and 14.86 g / m2 respectively. Conclusions: These results indicated that incorporating nitrogen status and nitrogen partitioning into the GPA RS estimation model could improve the estimation accuracy of grain protein accumulation dynamics in rice. Implications or significance: The success in estimating GPA with this method would advance the timely monitoring of different crop productivity indicators during the formation process. This study has great potential for improving RS monitoring of grain quality formation processes and facilitating spectral estimation of grain quality.

TI  - Validation of standard ocean-color chlorophyll-a products in turbid coastal waters: A case study on statistical evaluation and quality control tests in the Persian Gulf
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Selecting the appropriate in-situ and satellite matchups is a critical task for evaluating and application of ocean color products in optically complex coastal waters. This article investigates the performance of five single-sensor and two merged multi-sensors Chl-a products in the Persian Gulf. In this study, bio-optical and Chl-a measurements collected from 531 stations in the northern Persian Gulf from 2008 to 2019 were used. In-situ samples were initially controlled to filter out inappropriate datasets. Results indicated that surface measurements may not be representative of satellite-derived Chl-a, and satellite estimations were mostly consistent with Chl-a concentrations in the first optical depth (Chlopt). Statistical analysis showed that all satellite-derived Chl-a products overestimated the Chlopt by 48%-170%, in which Chl-a from Neural-Network and OC5 algorithms yielded the best agreement. Afterwards, the QC tests were designed based on the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 555 nm as a proxy of SPM, Rrs(412)/Rrs(443) as a proxy of CDOM, and Rrs(560)/Rrs(490) as a proxy of Chl-a, to select the matchups with the least interference of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) on Chl-a. The correlation between Chlopt and satellite-derived Chl-a improved significantly after applying the QC tests (R2 = 0.80-0.89). The valid pixels were determined using matching the results of QC tests and standard level-2 quality flags. Finally, statistical calibration was used to create the final quality controlled calibrated Chl-a maps, using regression coefficients obtained from training/validation exercises and bootstrapping-like techniques applied to the quality-controlled datasets. The findings showed that in turbid coastal waters, standard ocean color Chl-a products cannot be validated only by performing statistical methods, and quality control experiments are necessary for their applications.

TI  - The importance of in-year seasonal fluctuations for biomonitoring of apex predators: A case study of 14 essential and non-essential elements in the liver of the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) in the United Kingdom
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Trace elements are chemical contaminants spread in the environment by anthropogenic activities and threaten wildlife and human health. Many studies have investigated this contamination in apex raptors as sentinel birds. However, there is limited data for long-term biomonitoring of multiple trace elements in raptors. In the present study, we measured the concentrations of 14 essential and non-essential trace elements in the livers of the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) collected in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2019 and investigated whether concentrations have changed during this period. In addition, we estimated the importance of selected variables for modelling element accumulations in tissues. Except for cadmium, hepatic concentrations of harmful elements in most buzzards were lower than the biological significance level of each element. Hepatic concentrations of certain elements, including lead, cadmium, and arsenic, varied markedly seasonally within years. Their peak was in late winter and trough in late summer, except copper which showed an opposite seasonal pattern. In addition, lead in the liver consistently increased over time, whereas strontium showed a decreasing trend. Hepatic concentrations of cadmium, mercury, and chromium increased with age, whereas selenium and chromium were influenced by sex. Hepatic concentrations of arsenic and chromium also differed between different regions. Overall, our samples showed a low risk of harmful effects of most elements compared to the thresholds reported in the literature. Seasonal fluctuation was an important descriptor of exposure, which might be related to the diet of the buzzard, the ecology of their prey, and human activities such as the use of lead shot for hunting. However, elucidating reasons for these observed trends needs further examination, and biomonitoring studies exploring the effects of variables such as age, sex, and seasonality are required.

TI  - Stream power indices correspond poorly with observations of alluvial river channel adjustment
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A variety of stream power-based approaches for predicting catchment-scale alluvial channel adjustment have been developed. There is an international interest in applying these to inform river catchment management. However, there is some uncertainty regarding their ability to make consistently accurate predictions. This study evaluates the performance of a range of stream power indices for predicting observed channel adjustment. Remotely sensed data were used to generate 33 different stream power indices every 50 m across the networks of five test catchments. The performances of the indices were evaluated by comparing them against observations of erosion and deposition-dominated channels extracted from the UK's River Habitat Survey (RHS) database. A selection of metrics for evaluating the performance of the indices were calculated. The key finding from this study is that the stream power indices were poorly associated with the observations of alluvial channel adjustment. It is not clear whether this poor association is due to limitations with stream power indices or the suitability of the RHS observations. However, this is not the first study to find a weak association between stream power and observed adjustment. Therefore, caution is recommended to anyone hoping to take advantage of the practicability of stream power indices until further testing is applied using alternative observation datasets. An additional finding from this study is the inconsistency of outcomes between different measures of model performance. It is recommended that future studies also employ multiple model performance measures rather than relying on accuracy alone.

TI  - NIR-II fluorescence lymphatic imaging and intraoperative navigation based on the ?isolated cage? monodisperse strategy
T2  - NANO TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window is well suited for biological systems due to lower tissue scattering and micrometer-scale resolution at depths of millimeters. Unfortunately, none of the NIR-II fluorophores have clinical application due to low quantum yields, poor photostability, and long-term biosafety concerns. Herein, we develop NIR-II fluorescent nanoprobes based on the "isolated cage" monodisperse strategy, which significantly inhibits the pi-pi stacking interactions and restricts internal ro-tation of the arrested indocyanine green (ICG) fluorophores, which minimizes aggregation-caused quenching and enhances their NIR-II imaging performance. Unlike ICG's imaging window of several min-utes, the nanoformulations have reduced photobleaching and provide longer observation times. The in-creased imaging time allows high spatiotemporal resolution of blood vessels and lymphatic system. Benefiting from the high resolution and sensitivity of the nanoprobes, sentinel lymph nodes are accurately removed under fluorescence navigation. More intriguingly, the patency of lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) is presented more intuitively by qualitative and quantitative NIR-II fluorescence signals, which will directly benefit the innovation and promotion of LVA.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Pechora River forms the large Pechora River plume in the southeastern part of the Barents Sea (also called the Pechora Sea). Many previous works addressed water masses in the Barents Sea, however, the Pechora plume received relatively little attention, therefore, many basic aspects of its structure and variability remain unknown. In this study, we focus on spreading of the Pechora plume in the Pechora Sea during ice-free periods. Based on the extensive in situ measurements and satellite observations, we describe the dependence of area and spatial characteristics of the Pechora plume on wind forcing, river discharge rate, and spring ice conditions. We reveal three general types of Pechora plume spreading, which are determined by the external forcing conditions. Joint analysis of a large set of in situ and satellite data provided opportunity to study the variability of the Pechora plume on the synoptic, seasonal, and interannual time scales. We reveal regular advection of the Pechora plume through the Kara Strait into the Kara Sea. In addition, we describe formation of a significant area of increased salinity within the Pechora plume formed during wind-induced coastal upwelling events. The results of this research are of key importance for understanding the physical, biological, and geochemical processes in the Pechora Sea and the adjacent areas of the Barents and Kara seas.

TI  - Perspective: Improving the accuracy of plant phenology observations and land-cover and land-use detection by optical satellite remote-sensing in the Asian tropics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent advances in satellite-borne optical sensors led to important developments in the monitoring of tropical ecosystems in Asia, which have been strongly affected by recent anthropogenic activities and climate change. Based on our feasibility analyses conducted in Indonesia in Sumatra and Sarawak, Malaysia in Borneo, we discuss the current situation, problems, recent improvements, and future tasks regarding plant phenology observations and land-cover and land-use detection. We found that the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board the Sentinel-2A/2B satellites with a 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day observational intervals could be used to monitor phenology among tree species. For the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite with a 1,000-m spatial resolution and 10-min observational intervals, we found that the time-series in vegetation indices without gaps due to cloud contamination may be used to accurately detect the timing and patterns of phenology among tree species, although the spatial resolution of the sensor requires further improvement. We also found and validated that text and pictures with geolocation information published on the Internet, and historical field notes could be used for ground-truthing land cover and land use in the past and present time. The future development of both high frequency (<= 10 min) and high spatial resolution (<= 10 m) optical sensors aboard satellites is expected to dramatically improve our understanding of ecosystems in the tropical Asia.

TI  - Linking frass and insect phenology to optimize annual forest defoliation estimation
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - It is often logistically impractical to measure forest defoliation events in the field due to seasonal variability in larval feeding phenology (e.g., start, peak, and end) in any given year. As such, field data collections are either incomplete or at coarse temporal resolutions, both of which result in inaccurate estimation of annual defoliation (frass or foliage loss). Using Choristoneura pinus F. and Lymantria dispar dispar L., we present a novel approach that leverages a weather-driven insect simulation model (BioSIM) and defoliation field data. Our approach includes optimization of a weighting parameter (w) for each instar and imputation of defoliation. Results show a negative skew in this weighting parameter, where the second to last instar in a season exhibits the maximum consumption and provides better estimates of annual frass and foliage biomass loss where sampling data gaps exist. Respective cross-validation RMSE (and normalized RMSE) results for C. pinus and L. dispar dispar are 77.53 kg center dot ha - 1 (0.16) and 38.24 kg center dot ha - 1 (0.02) for frass and 74.85 kg center dot ha - 1 (0.10) and 47.77 kg center dot ha - 1 (0.02) for foliage biomass loss imputation. Our method provides better estimates for ecosystem studies that leverage remote sensing data to scale defoliation rates from the field to broader landscapes and regions.center dot Utilize fine temporal resolution insect life cycle data derived from weather-driven insect simulation model (BioSIM) to bridge critical gaps in coarse temporal resolution defoliation field data.center dot Fitting distributions to optimize the instar weighting parameter (w) and impute frass and foliage biomass loss based on a cumulative density function (CDF).center dot Enables accurate estimation of annual defoliation impacts on ecosystems across multiple insect taxa that exhibit distinct but seasonally variable feeding phenology.

TI  - Subspace prototype learning for few-Shot remote sensing scene classification
T2  - SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, few-shot remote sensing scene classification (FSRSSC)has attracted more and more researchers' attention. The FSRSSC aims to solve the problem of how to distinguish novel categories when there are limited labeled samples quickly. The FSRSSC framework mainly includes two stages: 1) pre-training (meta-training) stage, which uses training data to train the feature extractor. 2) meta-testing stage, the trained feature extractor is used to extract the features of testing data of different categories from the training data. A limited number of labeled samples are used to train the classifier and complete the clas-sification task. In this paper, we proposed subspace prototype learning for few-shot remote sensing scene classification method (SPL). To improve the generalization performance of the feature extractor in the pre-training stage and the robustness of the classifier in the meta-testing stage, we improve the existing methods from two aspects. On the one hand, we introduce the pre-trained model on the natural images. Then we use remote sensing data to fine-tune the pre-trained model to solve the problem of negative transfer caused by the differences between natural and remote sensing images. On the other hand, in the meta-test phase, we use the subspace learning method to learn a subspace prototype for each type of sample and complete the classification task by measuring the distance between the samples and the prototype, which achieves performance classification performance.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Pathways of degradation in rangelands in Northern Tanzania show their loss of resistance, but potential for recovery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiarid rangelands are identified as at high risk of degradation due to anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Through tracking timelines of degradation we aimed to identify whether degradation results from a loss of resistance to environmental shocks, or loss of recovery, both of which are important prerequisites for restoration. Here we combined extensive field surveys with remote sensing data to explore whether long-term changes in grazing potential demonstrate loss of resistance (ability to maintain function despite pressure) or loss of recovery (ability to recover following shocks). To monitor degradation, we created a bare ground index: a measure of grazeable vegetation cover visible in satellite imagery, allowing for machine learning based image classification. We found that locations that ended up the most degraded tended to decline in condition more during years of widespread degradation but maintained their recovery potential. These results suggest that resilience in rangelands is lost through declines in resistance, rather than loss of recovery potential. We show that the long-term rate of degradation correlates negatively with rainfall and positively with human population and livestock density, and conclude that sensitive land and grazing management could enable restoration of degraded landscapes, given their retained ability to recover.

TI  - Hypoxia enhances IPF mesenchymal progenitor cell fibrogenicity via the lactate/GPR81/HIF1α pathway
T2  - JCI INSIGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypoxia is a sentinel feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The IPF microenvironment contains high lactate levels, and hypoxia enhances cellular lactate production. Lactate, acting through the GPR81 lactate receptor, serves as a signal molecule regulating cellular processes. We previously identified intrinsically fibrogenic mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) that drive fibrosis in the lungs of patients with IPF. However, whether hypoxia enhances IPF MPC fibrogenicity is unclear. We hypothesized that hypoxia increases IPF MPC fibrogenicity via lactate and its cognate receptor GPR81. Here we show that hypoxia promotes IPF MPC self-renewal. The mechanism involves hypoxia-mediated enhancement of LDHA function and lactate production and release. Hypoxia also increases HIF1 alpha levels, and this increase in turn augments the expression of GPR81. Exogenous lactate operating through GPR81 promotes IPF MPC self-renewal. IHC analysis of IPF lung tissue demonstrates IPF MPCs expressing GPR81 and hypoxic markers on the periphery of the fibroblastic focus. We show that hypoxia enhances IPF MPC fibrogenicity in vivo. We demonstrate that knockdown of GPR81 inhibits hypoxia-induced IPF MPC self-renewal in vitro and attenuates hypoxia-induced IPF MPC fibrogenicity in vivo. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia creates a feed-forward loop that augments IPF MPC fibrogenicity via the lactate/GPR81/HIF1 alpha pathway.

TI  - LuoJiaAI: A cloud-based artificial intelligence platform for remote sensing image interpretation
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid processing, analysis, and mining of remote-sensing big data based on intelligent interpretation technology using remote-sensing cloud computing platforms (RS-CCPs) have recently become a new trend. The existing RS-CCPs mainly focus on developing and optimizing high-performance data storage and intelligent computing for common visual representation, which ignores remote sensing data characteristics such as large image size, large-scale change, multiple data channels, and geographic knowledge embedding, thus impairing computational efficiency and accuracy. We construct a LuoJiaAI platform composed of a standard large-scale sample database (LuoJiaSET) and a dedicated deep learning framework (LuoJiaNET) to achieve state-of-the-art performance on five typical remote sensing interpretation tasks, including scene classification, object detection, land-use classification, change detection, and multi-view 3D reconstruction. The details of the LuoJiaAI application experiment can be found at the white paper for LuoJiaAI industrial application. In addition, LuoJiaAI is an open-source RS-CCP that supports the latest Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for better developing and sharing Earth Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and products on benchmark datasets. LuoJiaAI narrows the gap between the sample database and deep learning frameworks through a user-friendly data-framework collaboration mechanism, showing great potential in high-precision remote sensing mapping applications.

TI  - Nine decades of data on environmental chemical pollutant exposure in dogs: a bibliometric analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent decades, a global concern associated with environmental chemical contamination has emerged as an important risk factor for the development of human diseases. Risk assessment methods based on animal approaches have shown to be very useful as early warning systems. However, questions, knowledge gaps, and limitations still need to be addressed in animals close to humans, such as dogs. The objective of this study was to analyze citation patterns, impact of publications, and most relevant authors, countries, institutional affiliations, and lines of research on environmental chemical contaminants and their relationship with dogs, in terms of exposure and biological effects. For this, a bibliometric analysis was carried out. Results revealed an increase in scientific production on this subject during the last 90 years in journals such as Health Physics, Science of the Total Environment, and Plos One, highlighting authors such as Muggenburg, Sonne, Boecker, and Dietz. The USA, Brazil, Germany, and the UK and universities such as California, Colorado State, and Purdue were the most relevant countries and institutional affiliations in scientific production and collaboration in relation to this topic. There is a growing interest in the development of lines of research related to heavy metals (mercury and lead mainly) and persistent organic compounds (PCBs, PBDEs, pesticides) using dogs as sentinels, as well as new sources of interest related to zoonosis and One Health. Finally, issues related to pollutants, sentinel lymph nodes, and epidemiology appear as new areas of research. These results highlight interesting current challenges and future research perspectives on dogs as sentinels for environmental chemical contamination.

TI  - Towards long-term records of rain-on-snow events across the Arctic from satellite data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain-on-snow (ROS) events occur across many regions of the terrestrial Arctic in mid-winter. Snowpack properties are changing, and in extreme cases ice layers form which affect wildlife, vegetation and soils beyond the duration of the event. Specifically, satellite microwave observations have been shown to provide insight into known events. Only Ku-band radar (scatterometer) has been applied so far across the entire Arctic. Data availability at this frequency is limited, however. The utility of other frequencies from passive and active systems needs to be explored to develop a concept for long-term monitoring. The latter are of specific interest as they can be potentially provided at higher spatial resolution. Radar records have been shown to capture the associated snow structure change based on time-series analyses. This approach is also applicable when data gaps exist and has capabilities to evaluate the impact severity of events. Active as well as passive microwave sensors can also detect wet snow at the timing of an ROS event if an acquisition is available. The wet snow retrieval methodology is, however, rather mature compared to the identification of snow structure change since ambiguous scattering behaviour needs consideration. C-band radar is of special interest due to good data availability including a range of nominal spatial resolutions (10 m-12.5 km). Scatterometer and SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data have therefore been investigated. The temperature dependence of C-band backscatter at VV (V - vertical) polarization observable down to -40 ? is identified as a major issue for ROS retrieval but can be addressed by a combination with a passive microwave wet snow indicator (demonstrated for Metop ASCAT - Advanced Scatterometer - and SMOS - Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity). Results were compared to in situ observations (snowpit records, caribou migration data) and Ku-band products. Ice crusts were found in the snowpack after detected events (overall accuracy 82 %). The more crusts (events) there are, the higher the winter season backscatter increase at C-band will be. ROS events captured on the Yamal and Seward peninsulas have had severe impacts on reindeer and caribou, respectively, due to ice crust formation. SAR specifically from Sentinel-1 is promising regarding ice layer identification at better spatial details for all available polarizations. The fusion of multiple types of microwave satellite observations is suggested for the creation of a climate data record, but the consideration of performance differences due to spatial and temporal cover, as well as microwave frequency, is crucial. Retrieval is most robust in the tundra biome, where results are comparable between sensors. Records can be used to identify extremes and to apply the results for impact studies at regional scale.

TI  - Nonsentinel Axillary Lymph Node Status in Clinically Node-Negative Early Breast Cancer After Primary Systemic Therapy and Positive Sentinel Lymph Node: A Predictive Model Proposal
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. In clinically node-negative (cN0) early stage breast cancer (EBC) undergoing primary systemic treatment (PST), post-treatment positive sentinel lymph node (SLN+) directs axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), with uncertain impacts on outcomes and increased morbidities.Patients and Methods. We conducted an observational study on imaging-confirmed cN0 EBC, who underwent PST and breast surgery that resulted in SLN+ and underwent ALND. The association among baseline/postsurgical clinic-pathological factors and positive nonsentinel additional axillary lymph nodes (non-SLN+) was analyzed with logistic regression. LASSO regression (LR) identified variables to include in a predictive score of non-SLN+ (ALND-predict). The accuracy and calibration were assessed, an optimal cut-point was then identified, and in silico validation with bootstrap was undertaken.Results. Non-SLN+ were detected in 22.2% cases after ALND. Only progesterone receptor (PR) levels and macrometastatic SLN+ were independently associated to non-SLN+. LR identified PR, Ki67, and type and number of SLN+ as the most efficient covariates. The ALND-predict score was built based on their LR coefficients, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 and an optimal cut-off of 63, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.925. Continuous and dichotomic scores had a good fit (p = 0.876 and p = 1.00, respectively) and were independently associated to non-SLN+ [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.06, p = 0.002 and aOR: 23.77, p < 0.001, respectively]. After 5000 bootstrap-adjusted retesting, the estimated bias-corrected and accelerated 95%CI included the aOR.Conclusions. In cN0 EBC with post-PST SLN+, non-SLN+ at ALND are infrequent (similar to 22%) and independently associated to PR levels and macrometastatic SLN. ALND-predict multiparametric score accurately predicted absence of non-SLN involvement, identifying most patients who could be safely spared unnecessary ALND. Prospective validation is required.

TI  - Estimation of crop water stress index and leaf area index based on remote sensing data
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of crop water stress index (CWSI) and leaf area index (LAI) over large-irrigation schemes requires the use of cutting-edge technologies. Combinations of remote sensing techniques with ground-truth data have become available for use at the catchment level. These approaches allow us to estimate actual evapotranspiration and have the capability of monitoring crop water status and saving irrigation water in water-scarce regions. This study was conducted in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkiye. Fully distributed CWSI maps were generated and we assessed the relationship between CWSI and the LAI for some specific crops in the winter season of 2021. Landsat 7 and 8 data were used and meteorological data were acquired from two stations in the study area. "Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration' methodology was applied to estimate the energy balance components. CWSI maps displayed spatio-temporal changes in tandem with crop-type variations. Consequently, results presented a high correlation (r 1/4 0.95 and r 1/4 0.99 for wheat and lettuce, respectively) between CWSI and LAI, a moderate correlation (r 1/4 0.44) for potatoes in the winter season. Thus, by utilizing remotely sensed data, the CWSI values would be directly estimated without requiring any in situ measurements of the canopy and air temperature over-irrigation scheme.

TI  - Monitoring shifting cultivation in Laos with Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation is an agricultural practice in which plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned, and vegetation is allowed to regenerate during fallow periods. Shifting cultivation is usually associated with cutting and burning forests and thus it is an important driver of forest disturbance in the tropics. However, studies of shifting cultivation are limited, and current area estimates of shifting cultivation are highly uncertain. Although Southeast Asia is a hotspot of shifting cultivation, there are no national maps of shifting cultivation in Southeast Asia at moderate or high resolution (less than or equal to 30 m). Monitoring shifting cultivation is challenging because it is highly dynamic, small-scale and results in complex post-disturbance landscapes. In this study, we monitored shifting cultivation using Landsat time series on Google Earth Engine for the entire country of Laos from 1991 to 2020. First, CCDC-SMA (Continuous Change Detection and Classification -Spectral Mixture Analysis) was used to detect forest disturbances. Then, these disturbances were attributed by combining time series analysis, object-based image analysis (OBIA), and post-disturbance land cover classification. Forest dis-turbances were assigned to Shifting cultivation, New plantation, Deforestation, Severe Drought, and Subtle Disturbance annually from 1991 to 2020 at a 30-m resolution. The major forest disturbances in 1991-2020 were mapped with an overall accuracy of 85%. Shifting cultivation is mapped with a producer's accuracy of 88% and a user's ac-curacy of 80%. The margin of error of the sampling-based area estimates of Shifting cultivation is 5.9%. Shifting cultivation is the main land use in Laos, accounting for 32.9% +/- 1.9% of Laos over the past 30 years. To study changes in shifting cultivation over time, the area of shifting cultivation was estimated at 5-year intervals be-tween 1991 and 2020 with all margins of error <17%. Results show that the area of slash-and-burn activities in Laos increased in 2015-2020. Our study provides an effective approach for monitoring shifting cultivation, which can be potentially applied into other regions. Our results not only provide valuable information for land management in Laos, but also can support analysis of spatial-temporal patterns of shifting cultivation and estimation of carbon emissions associated with shifting cultivation for REDD+ reporting.

AB  - To quantify the ecological consequences of recent nationwide restoration efforts in China, spatially explicit information on forest biomass carbon stock changes over the past 20 years is critical. However, long-term biomass tracking at the national scale remains challenging as it requires continuous and high-resolution monitoring. Here, we characterize the changes in the above- and belowground biomass carbon (AGBC and BGBC) of forests in China between 2002 and 2021 at 1 km spatial resolution by integrating multiple types of remote sensing observations with intensive field measurements through regression and machine learning approaches. On average, 8.6 +/- 0.6 and 2.2 +/- 0.1 PgC were stored in above- and belowground live forests in China. Over the last 20 years, the total forest biomass carbon pool in China has increased at a rate of 114.5 +/- 16.3 TgC yr(-1 )(approximately 1.1 % yr(-1)). The most pronounced forest biomass carbon stock gains occurred in central to southern China, including the southern Loess Plateau, Qinling mountains, southwestern karsts and southeastern forests. While the combined use of multi-source remote sensing data provides a powerful tool to assess the forest biomass carbon changes, future research is also needed to explore the drivers of the observed woody biomass trends and to evaluate the degree to which biomass gains will translate into biodiverse, healthy ecosystems that are sustainable.

TI  - Assessing the role of evapotranspiration in reducing surface temperatures in Harare using the SEBAL algorithm
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Within urban areas, buildings, roads, and paved surfaces, absorb and re-emit the sun's heat more than natural landscapes. Urban areas, where these structures are highly concentrated and vegetation is limited, become 'heat islands' contributing to a range of environmental, economic, and human health problems. Despite this, limited research, has, to date, been carried out to assess the influence of evapotranspiration (ET) on urban surface temperatures for Harare, Zimbabwe. In this study, the uSEBAL algorithm was used to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature (LST) using Landsat images in Hazare, Zimbabwe. The influence of ET on LST was also examined during the hot and post rain seasons. Results showed significant negative relationships (p < 0.05) between ET and LST. High ET rates were recorded over water bodies and green spaces as compared to built-up areas. High ET rates resulted in correspondingly low LST. This is the first time such results are reported for Harare. The conclusion drawn from these results is that as ET increases, temperature decreases, thus there was a negative relationship between ET and LST during the hot season. Additionally, low ET coincided with high LST in low vegetation and densely built-up areas. From these findings we can deduce ways of mitigating effects of thermal discomfort in urban areas i.e., inclusion of green spaces and water bodies within the cities. It is recommended that more green spaces be created within residential zones and encourage construction of green buildings and cooling technologies.

TI  - Assessing riverbank erosion in Bangladesh using time series of Sentinel-1 radar imagery in the Google Earth Engine
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverbank erosion occurs along many of the Earth's river systems, affecting riverine populations by destroying agricultural land and housing. In this study, we detected past events of riverbank erosion along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh using time series of Sentinel-1 satellite radar imagery, ground-range-detected (GRD) data with a 12 d revisit cycle, available inthe Google Earth Engine (GEE). Eroded land is detected by performing a landcover classification and by detecting land cover changes from vegetatedareas before the monsoon to sand or water after the monsoon. Further,settlements are detected as persistent scatterers and classified as erodedif they are located on eroded land. We found that with Sentinel-1 data,erosion locations can be determined already 1 month after the end of themonsoon and hence potentially earlier than using optical satellite imageswhich depend on cloud-free daylight conditions. Further, we developed aninteractive GEE-based online tool allowing the user to explore whereriverbank erosion has destroyed land and settlements along the Jamuna infive monsoon seasons (2015-2019). The source code of our implementation ispublicly available, providing the opportunity to reproduce the results, toadapt the algorithm and to transfer our results to assess riverbank erosionin other geographical settings.

TI  - Exploring the seasonality of surface urban heat islands using enhanced land surface temperature in a semi-arid city
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the seasonal variations in surface urban heat island (SUHI) in different local climate zones (LCZs) is crucial to efforts to reduce the impacts of urban warming on local residents. However, such an understanding is constrained by the lack of land surface temperatures (LSTs) at both high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study created time series LSTs by fusing Landsat 8 satellite data and gap-filled MODIS products to further analyses of the SUHI seasonality in a semi-arid city, Xi'an, China. The results showed that LSTs of the open building types were generally lower than those of the compact building types. The highest SUHI intensity (7.17 degrees C) was found in 'compact mid-rise buildings' (LCZ2), whereas lowest (3.62 degrees C) was found in 'open high-rise buildings' (LCZ4) in July. The SUHI intensity peaked about 17-23 days later than the background LST. The annual SUHI hysteresis cycles exhibited an anti-clockwise concave-up pattern in the monsoon-influenced hot-summer humid continental climate (Dwa per Ko center dot ppenGeiger climate scheme). The SUHI intensity in autumn was higher than in spring under the same background LST. These results provide valuable information for developing heat mitigation strategies in different seasons.

TI  - Development of active shielding gamma probe: a simulation study
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study is to evaluate a gamma probe with active shielding by using GEANT4 simulation framework. We used BGO scintillators both for gamma detection and active shielding from a point radioactive source, namely 140 keV gammas from Tc-99m. All scintillators were coupled to the silicon photomultipliers with an active area of 3 x 3 mm(2). The response of the gamma probe to radiation was simulated using the optical photon transportation available in the GEANT4 package. We used the simulation results to determine the sensitivity, spatial and angular resolution, and shielding efficiencies in the air and scattering medium for the proposed gamma probe model according to NEMA NU 3-2004 standards. The ability of the probe to find the direction of emission was also evaluated. The sensitivity of the probe was found between 1262 -42284 cps/MBq in the scattering medium based on two scenarios based on active shielding use. In terms of FWHM, the spatial resolution in scattering medium at 30 mm source-to-probe distance was 31 mm and the angular resolution at the same distance was 59?. The shielding effectiveness of the probe was in the range of 89.90 +/- 0.65% and 97.20 +/- 0.19%. The emission directions of gammas were found with an error of less than 8 degrees.

TI  - Lightning activity over Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states situated in the east coast of India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lightning activity over Telangana (17 degrees N-19 degrees N and 78 degrees E-82 degrees E), and the 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh (A.P) are studied using the data from the lightning imaging sensor aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data during the period 1998-2013. It is observed that the flash rate density, flash count, and flash days over the study regions (Telangana, Rayalaseema, and coastal A.P) exhibit semi-annual variation with primary maximum in the pre-monsoon season (May-June) and secondary maximum in the post-monsoon season (September). The annual mean flash count is maximum (87.645) over Vishakhapatnam district, and flash rate density is maximum (0.058 fl km(-2) day(-1)) over Srikakulam district compared to all other regions. The Inter-annual variation of lightning flash count shows that the lightning over Srikakulam district is increasing significantly. In Telangana, Rayalaseema (except Chittoor district), and coastal A.P (except Guntur, Krishna and Nellore) regions the flash count is highly correlated with surface temperature and convective available potential energy. The correlation of flash count with Aerosol Optical Depth and convective precipitation is very poor over these regions. This shows that the lightning over Telangana, Rayalaseema and in coastal A.P districts during pre-monsoon season is mainly due to buoyancy force developed because of the heating of land during daytime. The lightning flash Radiance values over Telangana, Rayalaseema, and coastal Andhra Pradesh regions are maximum during post-monsoon season (October-November). This study helps in understanding the spatio-temporal variation and the intensity of lightning activity over Telangana and A.P, which is first of its kind, over these regions.

TI  - Anatomical site and size of sentinel lymph node metastasis predicted additional axillary tumour burden and breast cancer survival
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the current standard assessment for tumour burden in axillary lymph node (ALN). However, not all SLN+ patients have ALN metastasis. The prognostic implication of SLN features is not clear. We aimed to evaluate predictive factors for ALN metastasis and the clinical value of SLN features. Methods and resultsA total of 228 SLN+ and 228 SLN- (with matched year and grade) cases were included. Clinicopathological features in SLN, ALN and primary tumours, treatment data and survival data were analysed according to ALN status and outcome. Except for larger tumour size and the presence of LVI (both P < 0.001), no significant differences were found in SLN- and SLN+ cases. Only 31.8% of SLN+ cases with ALN dissection had ALN metastasis. The presence of macrometastases (MaM), extranodal extension (ENE), deeper level of tumour invasion in SLN and more SLN+ nodes were associated with ALN metastasis (P <= 0.025). Moreover, isolated tumour cells (ITC) and level of tumour invasion in SLN were independent adverse prognostic features for disease-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival, respectively. Interestingly, cases with ITC located in the subcapsular region have better survival than those in cortex (OS: chi(2) = 4.046, P = 0.044). ConclusionsOur study identified features in SLN, i.e. the level of tumour invasion at SLN and tumour size in SLN as useful predictors for both ALN metastasis and breast cancer outcome. The presence of ITC, particularly those with a deeper invasion in SLN, portended a worse prognosis. Proper attention should be taken for their management.

TI  - Mangrove zonation mapping in West Africa, at 10-m resolution, optimized for inter-annual monitoring
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface area of mangrove ecosystems in Senegal have fluctuated substantially over several decades. Satellite data at 10 to 30-m resolution, which has been available since the 1980s, has allowed the mapping and quan-tification of these dynamics. However, the plant formations have reorganized internally; this has not been well-documented, possibly because there is no established method for detecting zonation of the Senegalese mangrove. This paper proposes a two-step method for mapping the zonation of the Saloum Delta mangrove. First, mangrove surfaces were detected using machine learning methods from an object-based time series. Finally, a typology was developed through object-based clustering using time-series metrics derived from the harmonic regression modeling of the vegetation fraction. A comparison with field data allowed us to determine the number of classes and discriminating variables. The results showed that the selected method resulted in an overall accuracy of 97.55% (Kappa = 95.42) for the land cover at 4 classes (Water, Mangrove, Salt flats, Other land covers), with an F1-Score of 98.91% for the mangroves. Second, our results suggest that the annual trend of the vegetation fraction at the object scale is effective in differentiating mangrove zonation into three classes based on canopy density and stand height (HM: High mangrove; LDM: Low and dense mangrove; LOM: Low and open mangrove). Finally, the temporal stability of the classes and uncertainty around the magnitudes of the plant fraction values per class were assessed by Bayesian inference. An overall accuracy of 85.5% can be expected to identify the zonation typology on an inter-annual scale. This mapping technique can be used to characterize the rate of change in zonation in response to environmental changes and to guide management strategies.

TI  - Bishift Networks for Thick Cloud Removal with Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the presence of clouds, the available information in optical remote sensing images is greatly reduced. These temporal-based methods are widely used for cloud removal. However, the temporal differences in multitemporal images have consistently been a challenge for these types of methods. Towards this end, a bishift network (BSN) model is proposed to remove thick clouds from optical remote sensing images. As its name implies, BSN is combined of two dependent shifts. Moment matching (MM) and deep style transfer (DST) are the first shift to preliminarily eliminate temporal differences in multitemporal images. In the second shift, an improved shift net is proposed to reconstruct missing information under cloud covers. It introduces multiscale feature connectivity with shift connections and depthwise separable convolution (DSC), which can capture local details and global semantics effectively. Through experiments with Sentinel-2 images, it has been demonstrated that the proposed BSN has great advantages over traditional methods and state-of-the-art methods in cloud removal.

TI  - Prophylactic inguinal lymphadenectomy for high-risk cN0 penile cancer: The optimal surgical timing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFew reports have investigated the oncologically safe timing of prophylactic inguinal lymphadenectomy for penile cancer patients with clinically normal inguinal lymph nodes (cN0), particularly those who received delayed surgical treatment. MethodsThe study included pT1aG2, pT1b-3G1-3 cN0M0 patients with penile cancer who received prophylactic bilateral inguinal lymph nodes dissection (ILND) at the Department of Urology of Tangdu Hospital between October 2002 and August 2019. Patients who received simultaneous resection of primary tumor and inguinal lymph nodes were assigned to the immediate group, while the rest were assigned to the delayed group. The optimal timing of lymphadenectomy was determined based on the time-dependent ROC curves. The disease-specific survival (DSS) was estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier curve. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations between DSS and the timing of lymphadenectomy and tumor characteristics. The analyses were repeated after stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment. ResultsA total of 87 patients were enrolled in the study, 35 of them in the immediate group and 52 in the delayed group. The median (range) interval time between primary tumor resection and ILND of the delayed group was 85 (29-225) days. Multivariable Cox analysis demonstrated that immediate lymphadenectomy was associated with a significant survival benefit (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.57; p = 0.009). An index of 3.5 months was determined as the optimal cut-point for dichotomization in the delayed group. In high-risk patients who received delayed surgical treatment, prophylactic inguinal lymphadenectomy within 3.5 months was associated with a significantly better DSS compared to dissection after 3.5months (77.8% and 0%, respectively; log-rank p<0.001). ConclusionsImmediate and prophylactic inguinal lymphadenectomy in high-risk cN0 patients (pT1bG3 and all higher stage tumours) with penile cancer improves survival. For those patients at high risk who received delayed surgical treatment for any reason, within 3.5 months after resection of the primary tumor seems to be an oncologically safe window for prophylactic inguinal lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Understanding the spatio-temporal behavior of crop yield, yield components and weed pressure using time series Sentinel-2-data in an organic farming system
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Organic farming has begun to represent a practical alternative for reducing the environmental impact of crop production and increasing biodiversity. In agricultural systems, the growing demand for stable crop pro-duction requires the adoption of useful tools for the sustainable intensification of agriculture. While organic farming systems face various drawbacks, which affect crop yield. Among the limiting factors, weed management is one of the most difficult aspects of organic farming.Objective: The aim of the study was (i) to evaluate the effect of weed pressure on yield spatial variability (ii) to analyze the spatial variability of yield and yield components based on hand-sampled yield data (iii) to evaluate the ability of the most commonly used vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite platforms to understand within-field spatial and temporal variability during the crop cycle (iv) to evaluate the ability of the cluster analysis procedures on NDVI satellite data to identify, discriminate and map sub-areas with different yield, yield components, and weed pressure at the farm level in an organic farming system.Methods: Remote sensing techniques (Sentinel-2 images), vegetation index (NDVI), cluster analysis (Hierarchical clustering Ward's minimum variance approach) and hand-sampled data (georeferenced yield and yield com-ponents field data) were used for understanding the spatio-temporal behavior of crops. Results and conclusions: The cluster analysis of NDVI data from Sentinel-2 collected at eight different stages detected the crop spatial and temporal variability at an early stage. In an open field of 24 ha, an area of about 9 ha, showed a high weed level with a yield average value 78 % lower than the most productive cluster area. The yield components, especially the spike number per square meter, also recorded very low values, mainly due to the negative effect of the high presence of weeds (in particular oats), which reached average values of 250 g m-2. An area of 7.3 ha showed the highest yield at harvest with a yield value 45 % higher than the mean harvest data. The study highlights that from the early tillering stage to the booting stage the NDVI maps derived from the Satellite Sentinel-2 and clustered by Ward's method represent the weeds distribution impact on crop yield and yield components and an early warning for the assessment of one of the most important limiting factors in organic farming.Significance: Sentinel-2 data and cluster analysis can improve an efficient assessment and management strategies in an organic farming agricultural system. Furthermore, the use of precision agriculture tools in organic farming can lead to a site-specific management at the farm level and therefore a sustainable intensification of agriculture systems.

TI  - How many bootstrap replications are necessary for estimating remote sensing-assisted, model-based standard errors?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - When probability samples are not available, the model-based framework may be the only option for constructing inferences in the form of prediction intervals for population means. Further, for machine learning and some non-parametric and nonlinear regression prediction techniques, resampling methods such as the bootstrap may be the only option for obtaining the standard errors necessary for constructing those prediction intervals.All bootstrap approaches entail repeatedly sampling from the original sample, estimating the parameter of interest for each replication, and estimating the standard error of the estimate of the parameter as the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates over replications. The objective of the study was to develop a procedure for terminating resampling such that the resulting number of replications assures, at least in probability, that the estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the standard error corresponding to one million replications. The analyses used a variety of datasets: five forest inventory datasets with either volume or aboveground biomass as the dependent variable and metrics from either airborne laser scanning or Landsat as independent variables, three from Europe, one from Southwest Asia, and one from Africa; and two forest/non-forest versus Landsat datasets, one from Minnesota and one from Wisconsin, both in the USA. The primary contribution of the study was development and demonstration of a procedure that specifies criteria for terminating resampling that assure in probability that the bootstrap estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the estimate obtained with one million replications.

TI  - Fluvial terrace mapping from ALOS-PALSAR data for archaeological prospection in the middle Uruguay River basin, Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological research carried out in the terminal section of the middle Uruguay River basin (Entre Rios) since the end of the 19th century has made it possible to identify a complex network of human occupations that show differences in the settlement pattern and use of space. In the area between the Mocoret ' a River mouth and the Del Molino stream, located to the north of the city of Concepci ' on del Uruguay, more than 68 archaeological sites are known. All of them are chronologically located within the Holocene and distributed in the adjacent plains, tributary courses and islands of the Argentine territory. As a result of the Pleistocene-Holocene fluvial dynamics and geological evolution, the geomorphological landscape of these banks displays three terraces in the middle course, between the cities of Federaci ' on and Concordia. The sedimentary deposits of the lower terrace, corre-sponding to the Holocene, are known as Concordia Formation. Previous research recorded sites distributed in different landscape units closely linked to river courses, in sectors with wide visibility (terraces, floodplains, sedimentary banks, erosion banks, dune fields and islands). Many of these sites were flooded by the Salto Grande dam, built in the 1970s. Since then, and despite the systematic archaeological research carried out in the region, the number of archaeological sites recorded is very low. This difficulty in locating the sites was the reason for the design of a prospecting model adjusted to this need. Based on known information, we designed a terrain pro-spection model using Geographic Information Systems. This model allowed us to identify the Holocene geoforms where it is most likely to find archaeological sites in the middle Uruguay River basin. This will enable the recording of archaeological sites to be expanded and their locations in the landscape to be characterised. This paper presents the results of geomorphometric analyses developed with a computer tool called Geomorphon, which recognises landform associations. A positive correlation was recorded between the location of the archaeological sites known to date and geomorphometric features interpreted as edges and top surfaces of the low terrace (ridges and shoulders associated with flat surfaces, from geomorph routine). This makes it possible to guide archaeological surveys towards the lower terrace (Concordia Formation) and test the model a priori.

TI  - Sentinel-2 time series analysis for monitoring multi-taxon biodiversity in mountain beech forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity monitoring represents a major challenge to supporting proper forest ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. The latter is indeed shifting in recent years from single-species to multi-taxon approaches. However, multi-taxonomic studies are quite rare due to the effort required for performing field surveys. In this context, remote sensing is a powerful tool, continuously providing consistent and open access data at a different range of spatial and temporal scales. In particular, the Sentinel-2 (S2) mission has great potential to produce reliable proxies for biological diversity. In beech forests of two Italian National Parks, we sampled the beetle fauna, breeding birds, and epiphytic lichens. First, we calculated Shannon's entropy and Simpson's diversity. Then, to produce variables for biodiversity assessment, we exploited S2 data acquired in the 4 years 2017-2021. S2 images were used to construct spectral bands and photosynthetic indices time series, from which 91 harmonic metrics were derived. For each taxon and multi-taxon community, we assessed the correlation with S2 harmonic metrics, biodiversity indices, and forest structural variables. Then, to assess the potential of the harmonic metrics in predicting species diversity in terms of Shannon's and Simpson's biodiversity indices, we also fit a random forests model between each diversity index and the best 10 harmonic metrics (in terms of absolute correlation, that is, the magnitude of the correlation) for each taxon. The models' performance was evaluated via the relative root mean squared error (RMSE%). Overall, 241 beetle, 27 bird, and 59 lichen species were recorded. The diversity indices were higher for the multi-taxon community than for the single taxa. They were generally higher in the CVDA site than in GSML, except for the bird community. The highest correlation values between S2 data and biodiversity indices were recorded in CVDA for multi-taxon and beetle communities (| r| = 0.52 and 0.38, respectively), and in GSML for lichen and beetle communities (| r| = 0.34 and 0.26, respectively). RMSE% ranged between 2.53 and 9.99, and between 8.1 and 16.8 for the Simpson and Shannon index, respectively. The most important variables are phase and RMSE of red-Edge bands for bird and lichen communities, while RMSE and time of tassel cap and from EVI indices for beetles and multi-taxon diversity. Our results demonstrate that S2 data can be used for identifying potential biodiversity hotspots, showing that the herein presented harmonic metrics are informative for several taxa inhabiting wood, giving concrete support to cost-effective biodiversity monitoring and nature-based forest management in complex mountain systems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of droughts in Iran using remote-sensing indices
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study spatially monitored drought in Iran using drought indicators. Four drought indicators measured from 2016 to 2020 were used: temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), vegetation health index (VHI), and precipitation condition index (PCI). Moreover, a standardized precipitation index (SPI) was prepared using rainfall measurements from 1989 to 2019. The TCI revealed that most of Iran was classified as having "severe drought" in 2020. The highest value of VCI showed for northern Iran, which belongs to the class without drought. The VHI indicated that vegetation stress increased over the study period throughout the region, and areas of severe and moderate drought reached their greatest extents in the aforementioned years. Significant droughts occurred in central, eastern, and southeastern Iran, and mild droughts occurred in northern Iran. The PCI indicated that rainfall amounts have diminished in most of the country over the period of study. The 30-year SPI showed that northern Iran received fine rain and the region has parts that can be classified as either extremely wet or very wet. However, most of the country was extremely dry and severely dry. The analysis of the VHI index for agricultural plants showed that 27.71% of Iran's agricultural regions, including the provinces of Razavi Khorasan, Hamadan, and Khozestan, experienced "critical drought" conditions. The study provides guidance for the selection of the most useful drought-monitoring indicators and can enable a more thorough understanding of drought in arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - V-BANet: Land cover change detection using effective deep learning technique
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development alters landscapes, frequently degrading environmental services and quality of life. High-resolution remote sensing images provide a chance to detect subtle changes in land cover and can capture the features of a ground object. However, traditional approaches usually experience difficulties when processing large and quickly expanding datasets, low levels of automation, limited computational efficiency, and incon-sistent identification accuracies and standards brought on by inconsistent operators. Conducting change detec-tion in a more accurate, automated, and standardized manner has become crucial and increasingly difficult due to the quick collection of remote sensing data. Therefore, in this paper, V-Net and Bilateral Attention Network (V-BANet) based deep learning is implemented to segment the landscapes and extract the features from the images. Initially, the bi-temporal images are segmented using V-Net to independently identify the objects in each image. Then spatial and channel attention blocks are employed in Bilateral Attention Network to learn more discrim-inative features from the images. Finally, the features' relationships are discovered by contrasting the original feature map in one image with the updated feature map in the other. Objective and subjective experiments are performed on a public bi-temporal high-resolution ONERA Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset and the LEVIR-CD dataset. Moreover, the proposed approach reached an accuracy of 99.29% and IoU of 98.31% with the OSCD Dataset and 99.42% accuracy and 98.83% IoU with the LEVIR-CD Dataset. The experimental outcomes with each specified dataset demonstrated that the suggested methodology outperformed several state-of-the-art techniques and produced superior results.

TI  - Integrating random forest and synthetic aperture radar improves the estimation and monitoring of woody cover in indigenous forests of South Africa
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody canopy cover (CC) is important for characterising terrestrial ecosystems and understanding vegetation dynamics. The lack of accurate calibration and validation datasets for reliable modelling of CC in the indigenous forests in South Africa contributes to uncertainties in carbon stock estimates and limits our understanding of how they might influence long-term climate change. The aim of this study was to develop a method for monitoring CC in the Dukuduku indigenous forest in South Africa. Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) global mosaics of 2008, 2015, and 2018, polarimetric features, and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCMs) were used. Machine learning models Random Forest (RF) vs Support Vector Machines (SVM) were developed and calibrated using Collect Earth Online (CEO) data, a free and open-access land monitoring tool developed by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The addition of GLCMs produced the highest accuracy in 2008, R-2 (RMSE) = 0.39 (36.04%), and in 2015, R-2 (RMSE) = 0.51 (27.82%), and in 2018, only SAR variables gave the highest accuracy R-2 (RMSE) = 0.55 (29.50). The best-performing models for 2008, 2015, and 2018 were based on RF. During the ten-year study period, shrubland and wooded grassland had the highest transition, at 6% and 13%, respectively. The observed changes in the different canopies provide valuable insights into the vegetation dynamics of the Dukuduku indigenous forest. The modelling results suggest that the CEO calibration data can be improved by integrating airborne LiDAR data.

TI  - Satellite and <i>in situ</i> cyanobacteria monitoring: Understanding the impact of monitoring frequency on management decisions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in reservoirs can be transported to downstream waters via scheduled discharges. Transport dynamics are difficult to capture in traditional cyanoHAB monitoring, which can be spatially disparate and temporally discontinuous. The introduction of satellite remote sensing for cyanoHAB monitoring provides opportunities to detect where cyanoHABs occur in relation to reservoir release locations, like canal inlets. The study objectives were to assess (1) differences in reservoir cyanoHAB frequencies as determined by in situ and remotely sensed data and (2) the feasibility of using satellite imagery to identify conditions associated with release-driven cyanoHAB export. As a representative case, Lake Okeechobee and the St. Lucie Estuary (Florida, USA), which receives controlled releases from Lake Okeechobee, were examined. Both systems are impacted by cyanoHABs, and the St. Lucie Estuary experienced states of emergency for extreme cyanoHABs in 2016 and 2018. Using the European Space Agency's Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery processed with the Cyanobacteria Index (CIcyano), cyanoHAB frequencies across Lake Okeechobee from May 2016-April 2021 were compared to frequencies from in situ data. Strong agreement was observed in frequency rankings between the in situ and remotely sensed data in capturing intra-annual variability in bloom frequencies across Lake Okeechobee (Kendall's tau = 0.85, p-value = 0.0002), whereas no alignment was observed when evaluating inter-annual variation (Kendall's tau = 0, p-value = 1). Further, remotely sensed observations revealed that cyanoHABs were highly frequent near the inlet to the canal connecting Lake Okeechobee to the St. Lucie Estuary in state-ofemergency years, a pattern not evident from in situ data alone. This study demonstrates how remote sensing can complement traditional cyanoHAB monitoring to inform reservoir release decision making.

TI  - A comparison of ICG-NIR with blue dye and technetium for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in vulvar cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure for vulva cancer is a safe alternative to a radical inguino-femoral lymphadenectomy (IFLN) for small unifocal tumours. SLN evaluation through biopsy and ultra-staging has helped gynaecological oncology surgeons improve operative morbidity with no cost to oncologic safety. Established techniques for groin SLN detection and excision in vulvar cancer use 99mTc-nanocolloid radiotracer and blue dye (BD) for identification of the SLN. Indocyanine green (ICG)-near infrared (ICG-NIR) techniques for SLN mapping have proven utility in other gynaecological cancer sites and is gaining interest as a technique for SLN mapping in vulvar cancerMethods: Fifty consecutive patients with unifocal vulvar squamous cell cancers of <40 mm lateral diameter and with depth of invasion > 1 mm underwent SLN mapping and excision using a combination of 99mTc-nanocolloid, BD and ICG. SLN detection results were recorded on a per-patient and per-groin basis. The success rates SLN for detection by individual tracer substance or combinations of tracer were determined by presence of one or more tracer, detectable in the SLN specimen.Results: 92% of patients had a successful SLN procedure. The per-groin detection rate was 84%. All suc-cessfully mapped SLN were identified with the combination of ICG-NIR and 99mTc-nanocolloid compared to 69% with BD 99mTc-nanocolloid. Success rates for the SLN procedure were not dependent on prior excision of the primary lesion or operator experience.Conclusions: Incorporation of ICG-NIR into standard SLN mapping protocols may allow for the aban-donment of routine use of BD and its poor side effect profile.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Satellite observation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and water storage change over Iran
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Like many other Middle East countries, Iran has been suffering from severe water shortages over the last two decades, as evidenced by significant decline in surface water and groundwater levels. The observed changes in water storage can be attributed to the mutually reinforcing effects of human activities, climatic variability, and of course the climate change. The objective of this study is to analyze the dependency of atmospheric CO2 increase on the water shortage of Iran, for which we investigate the spatial relationship between water storage change and CO2 concentration using large scale satellite data. We conduct our analysis using water storage change data from GRACE satellite and atmospheric CO2 concentration from GOSAT and SCIAMACHY satellites during 2002-2015. To analyze the long-term behavior of time series we benefit from Mann-Kendal test and for the investigation of the relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentration and total water storage we use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Regression model. Our Results show that the water storage change anomaly and CO2 concentration are negatively correlated especially in northern, western, southwest (Khuzestan province), and also southeast (Kerman, Hormozgan, Sistan, and Baluchestan provinces) of Iran. CCA results reveal that in the most of northern regions, the decrease in water storage is significantly influenced by the increase of CO2 concentration. The results further show that precipitation in the highland and peaks does not seem to be influenced by the long and short-term variation in CO2 concentration. Besides, our results show that the CO2 concentration is slightly correlated with a weak positive trend in evapotranspiration over agricultural areas. Thus, the indirect effect of CO2 on increasing evapotranspiration is observed spatially in the whole of Iran. The results of the regression model between total water storage change and carbon dioxide (R-2 = 0.91)/water discharge/water consumption show that carbon dioxide has the highest effect on total water storage change at large scale. The results of this study will contribute to both water resource management and mitigation plans to achieve the goal of CO2 emission reduction.

TI  - Where does a glacier end? Integrated geophysical, geomorphological and photogrammetric measurements to image geometry and ice facies distribution
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we integrated different techniques, spanning from Ground Penetrating Radar to geomorphological and photogrammetric data, to characterize the glacial and proglacial environments of the Sforzellina Glacier (Central Alps, Italy). Direct data highlighted the presence of debris-covered ice and even of dead ice patches in front of the actual glacier terminus. Such an information was further proved by geophysical data. We try to correlate the dead ice patches occurrence with several parameters such as debris cover thickness, ground tem-perature, solar radiation, elevation, velocity of glacier retreat, and dip of the topographic surface without finding relevant correlations, except for the local bedrock morphology. In fact, the latter factor seems to be crucial to make the favourable conditions to dead ice patches formation and preservation with time.Since ice is not always outcropping, while dead ice patches never outcrop because they are hidden by continuous debris cover, classical glaciological monitoring techniques are not always successfully applicable.On the basis of the obtained results, we argue that estimates of glacier extension just related to surficial in-formation, like in the case of exclusive use of remote sensing data and outcropping ice monitoring, can produce relevant underestimations. The presence of hidden ice patches, even not strictly part of the glacier body, is further important to quantify the total water equivalent, as well as to make affordable forecasts of the future glaciers evolution.

TI  - Rethinking spatiotemporal variations in air temperature over the Qilian Mountains, Western China, from 1979 to 2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qilian Mountains region, located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, is a region in western China that is sensitive to climate change and serves as an important ecological security barrier. Previous studies mostly used meteorological stations to study climate change in the Qilian Mountains; however, due to the known distribution limitations (scarcity and inhomogeneity) of meteorological stations in mountainous areas, relevant results remain inconclusive. To address this issue, we used 30 meteorological stations in and around the Qilian Mountains and the China meteorological forcing dataset (CMFD) with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees to comprehensively analyse the spatiotemporal distribution of and variation in the air temperature over the Qilian Mountains, with a particular focus on elevation-dependent warming (EDW); then, land surface albedo data from the ERA5-Land and MODIS products were employed to interpret the EDW. The results showed that the annual mean lapse rate in the Qilian Mountains is-0.56 degrees C/100 m. From 1979 to 2018, the air temperature over the Qilian Mountains experienced a significant upwards trend with an annual mean rate of 0.39 degrees C/decade, the maximum rate occurring in December-February (DJF, 0.56 degrees C/decade) and the minimum rate occurring in June-August (JJA, 0.28 degrees C/decade). Spatially, significant warming was found in most areas of the Qilian Mountains, and a slight cooling trend was found in the north and southeast. Unlike other typical areas, the Qilian Mountains showed reversed EDW during 1979-2018, i.e., the increasing trends in air temperature decreased with elevation, which was mainly caused by the reversal in EDW over the 1999-2008 period and could be largely explained by the change in land surface albedo.

T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Humans are continuously storying and re-storying themselves through language and socially organizing language into narratives to create meaning through experiences. Storytelling through narrative inquiry can bridge world experiences and co-create new moments in time that honor human patterns as wholeness and illuminate the potential for evolving consciousness. This article aims to introduce narrative inquiry methodology as a caring and relational research approach aligned with the worldview grounding Unitary Caring Science. This article uses nursing as an exemplar to inform other human science disciplines interested in using narrative inquiry in research, while defining essential components of narrative inquiry through the theoretical lens of Unitary Caring Science. By exploring research questions through this renewed understanding of narrative inquiry informed by the ontological and ethical tenets of Unitary Caring Science, healthcare disciplines will be knowledgeable and prepared to facilitate knowledge development to contribute to the sustainment of humanity and healthcare beyond eliminating the cause of illness and into the experience of living well with illness. The co-creative process of narrative inquiry as a caring and healing inquiry can guide collective wisdom, moral force, and emancipatory actions by seeing and valuing human experiences through an evolved holistic and humanizing lens.

TI  - Increase in chlorophyll-a concentration in Lake Taihu from 1984 to 2021 based on Landsat observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Taihu, located in a densely populated and highly industrialized area in eastern China, has experienced dramatic changes in water quality since the reform and opening-up in the 1980s. Landsat data can be used to trace water quality changes over approximately 40 years. However, chlorophyll-a (Chla) estimation, which characterizes the trophic sta-tus, has not been thoroughly explored (especially in turbid water using wide bandwidth Landsat) due to the interfer-ence of suspended particulate matter (SPM) to Chla. In this study, we used Landsat TM/OLI for turbid water Chla inversion and to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of Chla in Lake Taihu for 38 years and its influencing factors. An optical classification algorithm based on Rrs(green)/Rrs(red) was used to exclude highly turbid waters dominated by SPM; Chla was estimated only in waters with low SPM. We constructed an exponential estimation model based on Rrs(NIR)/Rrs(red), and verified the accuracy of the model using the measured Chla synchronized with satellite data. The model was applied to Landsat images to calculate the Chla concentration in Lake Taihu during 1984-2021, and its spatiotemporal distribution patterns were further analyzed. Spatially, the Chla concentrations in the western and northern regions of Lake Taihu were higher than those in other regions, probably because these areas are estuaries with large exogenous pollutant discharge and more nutrients are imported from exogenous sources. Chla showed an overall significant upward trend from 1984 to 2021 probably because of temperature rise, wind speed reduction, and nutrient increase. The results of the spatial and temporal variation of Chla and the influencing factors in this study provide supporting data for eutrophication monitoring and management in Lake Taihu. The proposed Chla estimation method can be extended to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of eutrophication in other inland waters with similar optical properties.

TI  - Calibrating a hydrological model in ungauged small river basins of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau based on near-infrared images
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge monitoring sites are scarce in high mountain basins, especially on the Tibetan Plateau where rivers are widely distributed. The potential for estimating river discharge using remote sensing has been widely utilized for large continental rivers, while its application to smaller regional rivers has been limited. To address this issue, we investigate the reliability of calibrating a hydrological model for two small subbasins lacking discharge data in the upstream region of the Heihe River located on the Tibetan Plateau, based solely on multiple pixel ratio (MPR) data derived from near-infrared satellite images. Using six independent calibration schemes based on discharge or MPR data, the value of MPR data for hydrological modeling is explored. We first calibrate a model using observed discharge data and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSEs) based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (Q-NSE scheme). We then use estimated discharge values derived from MPR data and identify different parameter sets that result in the highest NSEs in a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty framework (Q-NSE-1, Q-NSE-2 and Q-NSE-3 schemes). Spearman rank coefficients between MPR data and observed discharge data are then used as an alternative way to calibrate the model (MPR-SR scheme). The MPR-SR scheme is also applied with a simple water-balance filter, which removes parameter sets, which result in either under-estimated or overestimated total discharge volumes (MPR-SRF scheme). The Babao River Basin and Yeniugou River Basin are used to compare the different calibration schemes and to perform parameter sensitivity analyses. The MPR-SRF calibration scheme achieved better performance in both river basins, with NSEs of 0.63 and 0.62, respectively, during the validation period. This study demonstrates the potential of the MPR-SRF calibration scheme to enhance models of small ungauged river basins lacking ground discharge observation data, and provides insights into how remote sensing data can be more effectively combined with hydrological modelling.

TI  - Forecasting land-use changes due to coastal city development on the peri-urban area in Makassar City, Indonesia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the urban areas in Indonesia, Makassar City has been experiencing massive expansion during the past decades, resulting in land-use changes and structures in the surrounding peri-urban areas. This study examines the land-use changes and socio-economic characteristics in Makassar City since 2001, then generates a projection of land-use changes of the next decade (the year 2031) in peri-urban areas, particularly in Tamalanrea and Biringkanaya sub-districts. Several Landsat Thematic Mapper ima-geries and Thematic Maps were used to analyze the land-use changes. In contrast, Cellular Automata-Markov Chain was used to simulate land-use projection and interviews to discover the community's socio-economic characteristics. According to the forecasting results, the area of built-up land was pre-dicted to increase to 11531.4 ha or 67.27% in 2031, while the remaining vacant land (non-built-up land) was predicted to reach 5611.8 ha or 32.73%. A significant increase occurred in the total built area com-pared to land use conditions in 2016, and this is in line with the projected population growth amounting to 2,027,826 people by 2031. Based on these findings, the direction of coastal city development ought to be modified to restrict open land use. At the same time, spatial policies must be obeyed to prevent the loss of designated zones.(c) 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of GPS radio occultation assimilation on the 18-21 July 2021 heavy rainfall event in Henan
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) assimilation system and Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale regional model were used to investigate the sensitivity of assimilating Global Positioning System radio occultation (GPS-RO) data for a "21 center dot 7" heavy rainfall event in Henan Province. The Ensemble Forecast Sensitivity to Observation (EFSO) algorithm was used to assess the influence of the GPS-RO assimilation relative to conventional heavy rainfall observations in Henan. Sensitivity experiments revealed that the 6-h accumulated precipitation simulated by the three experiments surpassed 200 mm, which was similar to the automated station observations, and the rainfall center location and intensity simulated by the assimilated GPS-RO experiment (EXPR2) were also similar to the observations. Following GPS-RO data assimilation, the upper-level west border continental high pressure was improved, which increased the pressure gradient on the east and west sides of the heavy rainfall, resulting in enhanced dynamic lifting and water vapor flow from the lower level to the whole Henan downpour center. The entire convective convergence rising height increased, which had an optimum influence on the dynamic and thermal conditions of heavy rainfall. The EFSO estimates revealed that most observations improved the model predictions, with the conventional surface pressure and U-wind observations making a positive standardized contribution of approximately 0.05 and 0.075, respectively, but T(Temperature) and Q(Specific humidity) making a negative standardized contribution of approximately-0.025. The GNSS GPS-RO greatly improved the prediction results by decreasing the error by 0.125, and the National Satellite Meteorological Center (NSMC) FY-3D contributed the most to the model.

TI  - Exploration of groundwater potential zones mapping for hard rock region in the Jakham river basin using geospatial techniques and aquifer parameters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial techniques are useful to understand the groundwater resources assessment, development, and management. Groundwater mapping is essential to counter the excessive withdrawal of groundwater and fulfil the need of drinking, irrigation water in hard rock areas. Currently, the main problem is facing the groundwater level is decreasing due to less rainfall, climate changes and increasing demand, which is under in the hot zones. This results can be more useful for future challenges, sustainable development and demand to Jakham river basin. The main objective of this paper to demarcated the groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) using geospatial techniques for the hard rock region with the reference of aquifer parameters. In this paper, we have used to total eight thematic layers such as geomorphology, land use, soil, topographic elevation, slope, post-monsoon groundwater level (GWL), net recharge, and transmissivity, which are prepared from satellite data and field verification. All thematic layers were integrated for assigning the weights to demarcation of the groundwater potential zones in the RS and GIS environment. The selected thematic layers and features were assigned weightage and normalized by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique. Finally, the thematic layers were systematically integrated using weighted overlay analysis within a GIS environment. We have classified into five GWPZ classes i.e. very high, high, moderate, low, and very low for basin area using GIS, and AHP methods. The study area result indicated that high and moderate zone, which is confined in the central part of the basin, covers 2.43 % and 43.88 % area, respectively. The low (49.21 %) and very low (4.25%) GW potential zone is under the confined aquifer in the high slope and rock outcrops formations near the basin boundary. The final GWPZ map was validated with groundwater level fluctuation data, which illustrates the accuracy of the adopted approach. This unique approach and conclusions of this work may also help to develop the framework and policies for swiftly analyzing groundwater recharge planning, development and locating the artificial recharge structures in the other semi-arid, arid and hard rock regions.

TI  - A Machine Learning-Based Semantic Pattern Matching Model for Remote Sensing Data Registration
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing image registration can benefit from a machine learning method based on the likelihood of predicting semantic spatial position distributions. Semantic segmentation of images has been revolutionized due to the accessibility of high-resolution remote sensing images and the advancement of machine learning techniques. This system captures the semantic distribution location of the matching reference picture, which ML mapped using learning-based algorithms. The affine invariant is utilized to determine the semantic template's barycenter position and the pixel's center, which changes the semantic border alignment problem into a point-to-point matching issue for the machine learning-based semantic pattern matching (ML-SPM) model. The first step examines how various factors such as template radius, training label filling form, or loss function combination affect matching accuracy. In this second step, the matching of sub-images (MSI) images is compared using heatmaps created from the expected similarity between the images' cropped sub-images. Images having radiometric discrepancies are matched with excellent accuracy by the approach. SAR-optical image matching has never been easier, and now even large-scale sceneries can be registered using this approach, which is a significant advance over previous methods. Optical satellite imaging or multi-sensor stereogrammetry can be combined with both forms of data to enhance geolocation.

TI  - Nightside 135.6 nm emission enhancements of mid/low latitudes during geomagnetic storms as observed by the ionosphere PhotoMeter (IPM) on the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-3D
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - IPM has detected nightside 135.6 nm emission enhancements over a wide latitude range, from the sub-auroral latitudes to the equa-torial regions during geomagnetic storms. Our work, presented in this paper, uses the data of IPM to understand these 135.6 nm emission enhancements during of geomagnetic storms and studies the variations of total electron content (TEC) and the F2 layer peak electron density (NmF2) in the region of enhanced emissions. Middle and low latitude emission enhancements are presented during several med-ium storms in 2018. The variations of both the integrated electron content (IEC) derived from the nighttime OI 135.6 nm emission by IPM and TEC from the International GNSS Service (IGS) relative to the daily mean of magnetically quiet days of per each latitude bin (30 degrees <= geographic latitude < 40 degrees, 15 degrees <= geographic latitude < 30 degrees, 0 degrees <= geographic latitude < 15 degrees,-15 degrees <= geographic latitude < 0 degrees, -30 degrees <= geographic latitude <-15 degrees,-40 degrees <= geographic latitude <-30 degrees) are investigated and show that on magnetically storm day, IEC by IPM always increases, while TEC from IGC may increase or decrease. Even if both increase, the increase of IEC is greater than that of TEC. From the comparison of IEC and TEC during magnetic storms, it can be seen that the enhancement of the nighttime 135.6 nm emissions is not entirely due to the ionospheric change. The time of IEC enhancements at each latitude bin is in good agreement, which mainly corresponds to the main phase time of the geomagnetic storm event and lasts until the recovery phase. The available ground-based iono-sonde stations provide the values of NmF2 which match the 135.6 nm emissions measured by IPM in space and time. The variations of NmF2 squared can characterize the variations of the OI 135.6 nm emissions caused by O+ ions and electrons radiative recombination. The study results show that the OI 135.6 nm emission enhancements caused by O+ ions and electrons radiative recombination (where NmF2 squared increases) are obviously a contribution to the measured 135.6 nm emission enhancements by IPM. The contribution accounts for at least one of all contributions to the measured 135.6 nm emission enhancements by IPM. However, where the NmF2 squared provided by ionosonde decrease or change little (where the OI 135.6 nm emissions cause by O+ ions and electrons radiative recombination also decrease or change little), the emission enhancements measured by IPM at storm-time appear to come from the con-tributions of other mechanisms, such as energetic neutral atoms precipitation, or the mutual neutralization emission (O+ + O-?2O + hv (135.6 nm)) which also occupies a certain proportion in 135.6 nm airglow emission at night.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of COSPAR.

TI  - Study of air contamination in Iraq using remotely sensed Data and GIS
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is an effort to spatially assess the air quality in Iraq. A statistical model was applied to predict air quality and determine the relationships of air pollutants with the Air Quality Index (AQI) in 2020. Remotely sensed and ground station data were used in this study. Three methods have been applied; spatial interpolation, Least Square (LS) statistical method, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. Analysis revealed that air quality was unhealthy in Iraq. The northern part showed moderate air quality whereas contamination levels were high in most of the southern part of Iraq. Predictive (LS), and (GWR) models were developed. The resulting correlation coefficient R-2 was equal to 0.88 and 0.85 for LS and GWR respectively. Accuracy evaluations were 95% and 94%. The results of the study have the potential to assist the related government departments and disaster management authorities in decision-making and urban air contamination risk reduction.

TI  - Boundary of nighttime ozone chemical equilibrium in the mesopause region: Improved criterion of determining the boundary from satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A modified derivation of the criterion of nighttime ozone chemical equilibrium (NOCE) in the mesopause region is presented. Accord-ing to 3D model calculations, the improved criterion reproduces the lower boundary of the equilibrium much better than its earlier ver-sion. Processing of the SABER/TIMED data of 2021 has shown that the modified criterion elevates the NOCE boundary by -0.1-1. 7 km, depending on latitude and season. The proposed method of determining the condition of chemical equilibrium can be used to anal-yse the equilibrium of many trace gases in the stratosphere and troposphere important for different practical applications.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - The Synergistic Effect of Topographic Factors and Vegetation Indices on the Underground Coal Mine Utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Understanding the synergistic effect between topography and vegetation in the underground coal mine is of great significance for the ecological restoration and sustainable development of mining areas. This paper took advantage of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing to obtain high-precision topographic factors (i.e., digital elevation model (DEM), slope, and aspect) in the Shangwan Coal Mine. Then, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated utilizing Landsat images from 2017 to 2021, and the NDVI with the same spatial resolution as the slope and aspect was acquired by down-sampling. Finally, the synergistic effect of topography and vegetation in the underground mining area was revealed by dividing the topography obtained using high-precision data into 21 types. The results show that: (1) the vegetation cover was dominated by "slightly low-VC", "medium-VC", and "slightly high-VC" in the study area, and there was a positive correlation between the slope and NDVI when the slope was more than 5°. (2) When the slope was slight, the aspect had less influence on the vegetation growth. When the slope was larger, the influence of the aspect increased in the study area. (3) "Rapidly steep-semi-sunny slope" was the most suitable combination for the vegetation growth in the study area. This paper revealed the relationship between the topography and vegetation. In addition, it provided a scientific and effective foundation for decision-making of ecological restoration in the underground coal mine.

TI  - Maritime connectivity, transport infrastructure expansion and economic growth: A global perspective
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving transport connectivity has become increasingly significant to international trade research and transport policy agendas. Little has been done so far to investigate the direct association between maritime connectivity and economic growth, let alone the exact effect magnitude. As the connection between ports, local economies, and global logistics networks becomes ever closer, the economic role of port connectivity deserves closer attention. This paper uses the Panama Canal expansion as a quasi-natural experiment, and proposes a dynamic difference-in-differences (DID) method for making causal inferences about the impact of port connectivity on regional economic growth. This study leverages data mining of multiple sources of satellite data to provide innovative measures of ship movement, port area, and economic activity. We construct an index based on the global shipping network data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to measure the extent to which the ports are exposed to the canal expansion. This allows careful handling of the endogeneity problem. Change in the port area is used as a proxy for port capacity expansion, and is identified via satellite imaging. Night light data provide a measure of regional economic activity around the ports, and of the effect of port connectivity on regional economic growth. Our findings suggest that improvements in port connectivity have a significant and fairly durable stimulating effect on regional economic growth, and that port infrastructure expansion is one potential channel for realizing this effect.

TI  - Deep learning reveals rapid vegetation greening in changing climate from 1988 to 2018 on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) have been debated in recent decades. Most studies suggest that wetter and warmer climatic conditions would release low temperature constraints and stimulate alpine vegetation growth. Other studies suggest that climate warming might inhibit vegetation growth by increasing soil moisture depletion in the southern QTP. Most of previous studies have relied on vegetation indices derived from satellite observations to retrieve large-scale vegetation changes, and the uncertainty of vegetation indices makes it difficult to accurately characterize the vegetation trends on the QTP. Here, we developed a deep learning algorithm in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to accurately map the land use/cover change (LUCC) on the QTP, and then infer vegetation gain and loss and their drivers during the period 1988-2018. The vegetation on the QTP experienced rapid greening, which was dominated by transitions from bareland to alpine grassland (27.45 x 104 km2) and from alpine grassland to alpine meadow (17.43 x 104 km2) during 1988-2018. Furthermore, although human activities influence vegetation succession at the local scale, the dominant influ-encing factors affecting vegetation greening on the QTP are precipitation (q -statistic = 23.87 %) and temperature (q-statistic = 11.01 %). A 30-year time series analysis clarified the specific dynamics of vegetation on the QTP, thus contributing to the understanding of the response mechanisms of alpine vegetation under climate change and providing a reference for the formulating of reasonable ecological protection policies and human develop-ment strategies.

TI  - Are mental health nurses meeting the requirements of second health professionals in presenting opinions to the court?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accessible Summary What is known on the subject? Mental health legislation is currently under review following recommendations for repeal and replacement. Through the statutory role of the second health professional, mental health nurses are in a strong position to offer a unique clinical perspective, engagement and advocacy for tangata whaiora (person seeking wellness) and whanau. Maori are more likely to be subject to a compulsory treatment order than non-Maori. Whanau involvement in care is a core element to well-being from a Te Ao Maori (Maori world view) perspective. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? Understanding the level of whanau involvement in the MHA process. Understanding challenges for nursing practice for consideration in the current review of MHA legislation. Identification of the opportunity nurses have to contribute to reducing high rates of Maori under CTOs. What are the implications for practice? The current MHA review needs to include the resourcing required to support the clinicians practising in statutory roles. More emphasis is needed to build the cultural knowledge and capability of the nursing workforce to integrate principles of a Te Ao Maori worldview into care delivery. These learnings highlight the importance of nursing responsibility in the SHP role. IntroductionClinical practice within statutory roles is an important issue for the nursing profession. There is increasing involvement of nurses undertaking statutory roles and opportunities for nurses to advocate and offer their unique clinical opinion regarding the need for restrictive measures imposed by mental health act legislation. AimThe aim of this study was to analyse whether registered nurses who undertake the role of second health professional (SHP) within New Zealand's Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act (1992) (MHA) are meeting the expectations of that role. MethodA retrospective analysis of 156 cases was undertaken of clinical reports completed by registered nurses. The reports were measured against an established competency framework modified to include MHA expectations for whanau (family) involvement. ResultsFrom a sample of 156 cases, 22 were identified as reviews of initial orders for assessment and treatment while 134 were opinions related to the application for a compulsory treatment order (CTO). In most cases, reports achieved a good standard. There were limitations in nurses completing the documentation to the required standard, and adaptations were evident in efforts to meet clinical and legal expectations. There was a significant absence of evidence of whanau consultation. DiscussionResourcing through education, support and ongoing development are required to ensure that nurses are equipped to meet the expectations of the legislation. There is an opportunity for nurses to influence decision-making and support the reduction in use of community treatment orders. A review of the existing competency framework is required to include cultural approaches and involvement of whanau. Implications for PracticeIt is important to understand the factors that strengthen nursing practice to improve health outcomes and tangata whaiora and whanau experience. This study uses methods of clinical audit to describe current practice and establish an evidence base to measure change.It also offers important learnings for consideration within MHA legislation review and for nursing workforce development.

TI  - Continuous monitoring and sub-annual change detection in high-latitude forests using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially and temporally precise monitoring of forest resources is becoming increasingly vital in rapidly changing environmental and economic conditions. However, recent developments in moderate resolution satellite imagery have led to spectrally consistent and temporally dense datasets capable of capturing both seasonal variation and long-term trajectories. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of continuous monitoring algorithms to detect transitional changes such as timber harvesting at sub-annual scales. However, less is known about the ability to use these algorithms in areas such as high-latitude forests which have large data gaps over winter due to prolonged snow cover. This study investigated the use of a time series of 7-day Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) composites along with the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt Change, Seasonality, and Trend (BEAST) algo-rithm for change detection and monitoring in two managed forest areas in Canada. On average, both sites had no data periods (over winter) lasting similar to 200 days. Despite this, BEAST successfully detected change, with overall accuracies of 88.7% and 97.3% for both sites when compared to an independent validation dataset derived from visual interpretation of PlanetScope images. A simulation of change detection in near-real time revealed that approximately 75% of changes were detected within 7 and 11 valid images for each site. Furthermore, moni-toring the trend slope of the spectral index showed that areas with a new declining slope were typically about twice as likely to occur in photointerpreted polygons of non-stand replacing disturbance, indicating that such a technique could be used as an early warning signal of fine-scale changes such as those due to insect defoliation or drought. Overall, this study demonstrated the efficacy of a continuous change detection and monitoring framework, which could be used to provide insights at previously unavailable temporal and spatial scales, thereby allowing forest managers the ability to quickly react to changes in uncertain future conditions.

TI  - Observing the recent floods and drought in the Lake Victoria Basin using Earth observations and hydrological anomalies
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lake Victoria Basin, home of Africa's largest freshwater lake, experienced extensive floods in 2019-2020 and anomalous drought conditions in early 2022. Both antithetical hydrological events raised concerns for an estimated 35 million people within the basin who are vulnerable to these continually recurrent hydrometeorological extremes. While there is a need for high -resolution spatial and temporal hydrological monitoring, in-situ observations are limited and insufficient within the basin. This study assesses the capability of publicly available Earth ob-servations and models to capture the occurrence of recent hydrological extremes within the Lake Victoria Basin. Spatial and temporal comparisons of the following hydrological variables are conducted within the Lake Victoria Basin from June 2002 - June 2022: precipitation, evapo-transpiration, runoff, soil moisture, lake height, and total water storage anomaly (TWSA). Results from the time series and spatial analyses confirm that the anomalous wet and dry events respectively occurred from October 2019 - March 2020 and November 2021 - March 2021. The observations also indicated a quick recovery from the drought event by June 2022. Additionally, a comparison of 9-km soil moisture and 1-km downscaled near-surface soil moisture products improves understanding of wetness spatial variability within the basin. These results were vali-dated using in-situ soil moisture data available through the International Soil Moisture Network, making this the first study to validate the downscaled 1-km soil moil moisture product within the African continent. Methods from this study demonstrate the utility of a diverse array of publicly available Earth observation and model data to improve understanding of recent hydrological anomalies and extreme events within the Lake Victoria Basin. This can be applied to water re-sources management, particularly in regions lacking sufficient in-situ hydrological data.

TI  - A new Sargassum drift model derived from features tracking in MODIS images
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive Sargassum stranding events affect erratically numerous countries from the Gulf of Guinea to the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasting transport and stranding of Sargassum aggregates require progress in detection and drift modelling. Here we evaluate the role of currents and wind, i.e. windage, on Sargassum drift. Sargassum drift is computed from automatic tracking using MODIS 1 km Sargassum detection dataset, and compared to reference surface current and wind estimates from collocated drifters and altimetric products. First, we confirm the strong total wind effect of approximate to 3 % (approximate to 2 % of pure windage), but also show the existence of a deflection angle of approximate to 10 degrees between Sargassum drift and wind directions. Second, our results suggest reducing the role of currents on drift to 80 % of its velocity, likely because of Sargassum resistance to flow. These results should significantly improve our understanding of the drivers of Sargassum dynamics and the forecast of stranding events.

TI  - Granulomatous inflammation in inborn errors of immunity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Granulomas have been defined as inflammatory infiltrates formed by recruitment of macrophages and T cells. The three-dimensional spherical structure typically consists of a central core of tissue resident macrophages which may merge into multinucleated giant cells surrounded by T cells at the periphery. Granulomas may be triggered by infectious and non-infectious antigens. Cutaneous and visceral granulomas are common in inborn errors of immunity (IEI), particularly among patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), combined immunodeficiency (CID), and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The estimated prevalence of granulomas in IEI ranges from 1%-4%. Infectious agents causing granulomas such Mycobacteria and Coccidioides presenting atypically may be 'sentinel' presentations for possible underlying immunodeficiency. Deep sequencing of granulomas in IEI has revealed non-classical antigens such as wild-type and RA27/3 vaccine-strain Rubella virus. Granulomas in IEI are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of granuloma presentation in IEI presents challenges for mechanistic approaches to treatment. In this review, we discuss the main infectious triggers for granulomas in IEI and the major forms of IEI presenting with 'idiopathic' non-infectious granulomas. We also discuss models to study granulomatous inflammation and the impact of deep-sequencing technology while searching for infectious triggers of granulomatous inflammation. We summarize the overarching goals of management and highlight the therapeutic options reported for specific granuloma presentations in IEI.

TI  - Remote sensing of canopy water status of the irrigated winter wheat fields and the paired anomaly analyses on the spectral vegetation indices and grain yields
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is the world's largest consumer of freshwater resources, particularly in semi-arid regions where crop production is reliant on both irrigation and rainfall. Therefore, proper irrigation management is critical in achieving sustainable agriculture by increasing crop yield while conserving water resources. Remote sensing has demonstrated a great promise in monitoring crop status including crop water status based on the spectral vegetation index (VI). Therefore, the vegetation growth (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), vegetation water status (shortwave crop reflectance index, SCRI), and vegetation drought stress (moisture stress index, MSI) indices were calculated to assess the impact of irrigation management on canopy water status in a cluster of winter wheat fields in a semi-arid area in three non-consecutive growing seasons with different seasonal rainfall amounts and distributions. The winter wheat fields were typically irrigated six times in each growing season according to a fixed phenological-based irrigation scheduling. Results showed that NDVI, SCRI, and MSI had a high correlation with the remotely sensed locally calibrated leaf area index (LAI), among which NDVI had the strongest correlation (r = 0.9). The analysis revealed that the combined use of VIs succeeded in detecting spatial and temporal crop drought stress levels during the growing seasons. Furthermore, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) was interpreted to quantitatively classify the level and extent of drought stress in the winter wheat fields. The results of the NDWI analysis revealed that 62%, 100%, and 72% of the irrigated winter wheat fields have experienced some levels of drought stress during the normal growing season with wet spring, normal growing season with wet autumn, and dry growing season, respectively. The drought stress was basically due to the lack of effective rainfall during spring in March and April when crops have the highest vegetative growth, irrespective of the rainfall amount during autumn and winter. This revealed the importance of timely irrigation management during spring time. In addition, paired anomaly analysis of the NDVI, MSI, and SCRI with the wheat grain yields could identify good and poor wheat fields and recognize proper management zones of the wheat fields in terms of potential grain production. The findings of this study demonstrated that remote sensing is a strong and reliable tool in irrigation management to help sustain food production in arid or semi-arid areas with limited water resources.

TI  - Application of sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: A survey among Chinese gynecological oncologists
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To gain a better understanding of the use of sentinel lymph node mapping by Chinese oncologists for endometrial cancer staging and analyze factors influencing its application. Methods: Questionnaires were collected online before and by phone after the symposium to evaluate the general characteristics of oncologists who participated in the endometrial cancer seminar and factors associated with the application of sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer patients. Results: Gynecologic oncologists from 142 medical centers participated in the survey. 35.4% of doctors employed sentinel lymph node mapping for endometrial cancer staging, 57.3% chose indocyanine green as the tracer. Multivariate analysis revealed that cancer research center (odds ratio = 4.229, 95% CI 1.747-10.237), physician familiarity with sentinel lymph node mapping (odds ratio = 126.188, 95% confidence interval 43.220-368.425) and the use of ultrastaging (odds ratio = 2.657, 95% confidence interval 1.085-6.506) were related to the doctors' selection of sentinel lymph node mapping. There was a significant difference in the surgical procedure for early endometrial cancer, the number of removed sentinel lymph node, and the reason for not adopting sentinel lymph node mapping before and after the symposium. Conclusions: The theoretical knowledge of sentinel lymph node mapping, the use of ultrastaging, and cancer research center are related to a higher acceptance of sentinel lymph node mapping. Distance learning is conducive to the promotion of this technology.

TI  - Assessing the link between land use/land cover changes and land surface temperature in Himalayan urban center, Srinagar
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapidly growing urbanization and the consequent land use/land cover (LULC) changes have resulted in unsustainable growth of cities in Indian subcontinent especially in Himalayan region which are highly sensitivity to condition like climate change. Using multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite datasets, this study analyzes the impact of LULC changes on land surface temperature (LST) in the Himalayan city of Srinagar from 1992 to 2020. For LULC classification, the maximum likelihood classifier technique was utilized, and to extract LST from Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (TM) (OLI), spectral radiance was employed. The results show that, among various LULC classes, built-up area has seen a maximum increase of 14% while agriculture has decreased by about 21%. On the whole, Srinagar city has witnessed an increase in LST by 4.5 degrees C with maximum increase of 5.35 degrees C especially over marshes and a minimum increase of 4 degrees C on agriculture landscape. Other LULC categories of built-up, water bodies, and plantation saw an increase in LST by 4.19 degrees C, 4.47 degrees C, and 5.07 degrees C, respectively. The transformation of marshes into built-up saw a maximum increase in LST by 7.18 degrees C followed by water body to built-up (6.96 degrees C) and water body to agriculture (6.18 degrees C) while minimum increase was seen in the conversion of agriculture to marshes by about 2.42 degrees C followed by agriculture to plantation (3.84 degrees C) and plantation to marshes (3.86 degrees C). The findings may be useful to urban planners and policymakers in terms of land use planning and city thermal environment control.

TI  - POBI interpolation algorithm for CYGNSS near real time flood detection research: A case study of extreme precipitation events in Henan, China in 2021
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In late 2016, NASA launched the first constellation of the global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) small satellites called the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS). The stable data quality and continuous free availability of CYGNSS scientific data provided a new method for flood monitoring. However, owing to the pseudorandom distribution of CYGNSS data, researchers must always choose between high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution during the performance of flood monitor-ing based on CYGNSS data. For floods caused by extreme precipitation with sudden and short durations, the current flood mapping based on CYGNSS data cannot be updated in near real time. However, the near real time update of the flood distribution range is mean-ingful for postdisaster emergency response and rapid rescue. This study aimed to address this problem using a newly proposed spatial interpolation method based on previously observed behaviour (POBI). First, a method for calculating the surface reflectivity of the CYGNSS was introduced, followed by the principle of the POBI spatial interpolation method. The applicability of the POBI method in Henan Province, China, was then analysed, and by using the flood in Henan Province, China, in July 2021 as an example, the feasi-bility of CYGNSS near real time flood mapping based on the POBI method was evaluated. Based on the results, near real time and 3 km flood distribution monitoring results can be obtained using the proposed new method. The results were evaluated using MODIS (Moder-ate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images and compared with the observations of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) in the same period. The results show that the flooded areas obtained by CYGNSS correspond to the inundated areas in MODIS images and are also in high agreement with the SMAP. In addition, CYGNSS allows for finer mapping and quantification of inundation areas and flood duration. Moreover, we also discussed the potential of CYGNSS to detect floods in shorter periods of time (a few hours) and did a preliminary evaluation using precipitation data from meteorological stations. The results are also highly consistent.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The goal of the study is to research on the factors affecting the quality of life (QoL) in breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT).METHODS Four hundred and fifty-seven Stage I-III breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant RT were evaluated using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and EORTCBR23 questionnaires at four different times.RESULTS Over time, statistically significant differences were determined in parameters of QoL score as global health, physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functions (p<0.001) in the functional scale of module-C30; fatigue (p<0.001), appetite loss (p=0.012), insomnia (p=0.002), constipation (p=0.026), financial difficulty (p<0.001) in its symptom scale; future perspective (p=0.008), body image (p=0.001), sexual functioning (p=0.011) in module-BR23 functional scale; breast symptoms (p<0.001), systemic therapy side effects (p<0.001), arm symptoms (p=0.046), upset by hair loss (p=0.017) in its symptom scale. Menopausal status (physical and role functions, fatigue, and appetite loss), the type of breast surgery (physical, role and social functions, fatigue, and financial difficulties), the type of axillary interventions (global health status, social function, fatigue, and financial difficulties), adjuvant chemotherapy (financial difficulties, body image, systemic treatment side effects, arm symptoms, and hair loss), and lymphatic irradiation (global health status, role function, fatigue, systemic treatment side effects, and arm symptoms) have affected some scores of QoL.CONCLUSION The QoL scores for certain functions/symptoms were worse compared to the opposite cohort; that is, premenopausal versus postmenopausal, breast-conserving surgery versus modified radical mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy versus axillary lymph node dissection, no adjuvant chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy, and no lymphatic irradiation versus lymphatic irradiation.

TI  - A stepwise framework for interpolating land surface temperature under cloudy conditions based on the solar-cloud-satellite geometry
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared land surface temperature (LST) data from satellites often contain extensive missing values due to high cloudiness degree, which severely hinders their use in applications. Despite the many methods developed, common methods, such as fusion with microwave or reanalysis data and the surface energy budget approach, still remain subject to important limitations and uncertainties, such as dependency on coarse resolution data and difficulty in interpolation for large-scale missing LST data. In this study, we proposed a stepwise framework for estimating missing cloudy-sky LST values of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from informative samples owing to the solar-cloud-satellite geometry (SCSG) effect, by which satellite imagery records the cloudy-sky LST values of a portion of pixels. We first estimated the clear-sky LST equivalents for all cloud -affected pixels via a similarity-based approach and then determined unknown LSTs for cloudy pixels by training a machine-learning model on cloudy-sky LST values observed owing to the SCSG effect. We demon-strated the utility of this approach by using MODIS/Aqua daytime LST data over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and validated the interpolation results against representative in-situ LST observations and two recently published all-weather LST datasets. When compared to the corresponding in-situ measurements, the interpolated cloudy-sky LST values showed satisfactory accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) value of 3.99 degrees C and a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.74, while the MODIS/Aqua clear-sky LST values led to an MAE value of 2.66 degrees C and an R2 value of 0.86. Compared to the two all-weather LST datasets, results of this study showed the highest accuracy over the data-gap-filled regions in terms of all quantitative performance metrics, more natural tran-sition textures, and better representation of seasonal characteristics. The proposed framework has the advantage of relying on the MODIS family data and handling extensive missing data as well as triggers opportunities to leverage the SCSG effect to produce high-quality all-weather LST data.

TI  - Deep-learning model for sea surface temperature prediction near the Korean Peninsula
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) near the Korean Peninsula have increased rapidly due to global warming; this phenomenon can lead to high water temperatures and extensive damage to Korean fish farms. To reduce such damage, it is necessary to predict high water temperature events in advance. In this study, we developed a method for predicting high water temperature events using time series SST data for the Korean Peninsula obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 product and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network designed for time series data prediction. First, the SST prediction model was used to predict SSTs. Predicted SSTs exceeding 28 degrees C, which is the Korean government standard for issuing high water temperature warnings, were designated as high water temperatures. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of the SST prediction model, 1-to 7-day predictions were evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The R2, RMSE, and MAPE values of the 1-day prediction SST model were 0.985, 0.14 degrees C, and 0.38%, respectively, whereas those of the 7-day prediction SST model were 0.574, 0.74 degrees C, and 2.26%, respectively. We also calculated F1 scores to evaluate high water temperature classification accuracy. The F1 scores of the 1- and 7-day SST prediction models were 0.963 and 0.739, respectively.

TI  - Drawing wisdom from the Pacific: A Tongan participative approach to exploring and addressing family violence
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of qualitative research approaches that are embedded within a Tongan worldview and associated relational practices is pivotal to enhancing knowledge of, and culturally-informed responses to violence within the Tongan kainga (family). We are currently in the early stages of such developments. This reflexive methodological article draws conceptual insights and cultural concepts from the exemplar of a Tongan faith-based family violence prevention programme, which was developed by Tongan community practitioners in Aotearoa New Zealand. We document the adaptation of Tauhi va (nurturing loving and harmonious relationships), Nofo (indigenous cultural immersion), and Talanoa (Pacific indigenous ways of dialogue and discussion) in the design and documenting of this culturally-embedded response to such violence. Elsewhere, we have documented the violence programme in question and its implications for participating families, and the broader faith-based community and leaders. In this article we present a Tongan methodology that we hope is used for other scholar activists also engaged in participative action-oriented research within Tongan and other Indigenous communities more broadly.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility assessment by mapping and diachronic analysis: Case of Bushwira (Democratic Republic of Congo)
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work contributes to the study of the susceptibility of land in the Great Lakes region to mass movements. The aim is to understand the study of physical and anthropogenic natural phenomena leading to the triggering of landslides in the Bushwira area in Kabare territory (South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo - DRC). For this purpose, mapping and diachronic analysis of land use were carried out. This investigation first focused the in-ventory and the determination of the ongoing processes and the morphometric parameters of the landslides. Twelve (12) landslides were inventoried including 6 rotational, 4 translational and 2 "nonidentified mechanism of failure" landslides. The diachronic analysis carried out based on the observations of Google Earth and LANDSAT satellite images, has revealed a significant change in land use in the study area. The amplification of landslides in the study area is due to the presence of clay soil; steep slopes; slopes facing northwest, south and north; inappropriate deforestation and exploitation of construction materials. The lithology, topography, pedology and hydrology are the natural physical factors that predispose the Bushwira sector to landslide hazards. Eight orientation classes have been identified, 35% of which are northwest facing (292.5 degrees -337.5 degrees). Slopes facing northwest followed by those facing south and north are more sensitive to movement in this area. North-east and east-facing slopes are not affected by landslides. This indicates that the slopes oriented towards the North-West followed by those oriented towards the South and the North are more susceptible to sliding in this area. It is recommended to build adequate retaining structures offered by geotechnical studies before any human achievement of notorious importance.

T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThere is a lack of studies assessing the survival of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (rSLNB) versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for surgical axillary staging among patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). MethodsWe retrospectively identified patients with IBTR from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2000 to 2017. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) between the rSLNB and ALND groups. ResultsOf the 2141 women with IBTR after lumpectomy and SLNB, 524 did not receive surgical axillary staging (nonsurgery group) and 1617 patients who did undergo axilla surgery received either rSLNB or ALND as axillary staging (1268 with rSLNB and 349 with ALND). The 10-year OS rates were 61.9% for the nonsurgery and 73.8% for axilla surgery groups (p = .001). In the 1:1 matched cohorts, the 10-year OS rates were 61.4% for the nonsurgery and 69.1% for axilla surgery groups (p = .072). After adjusting for other factors, axillary surgery treatment of IBTR was an independent favorable factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.90; p = .004). Within the axilla surgery group, rSLNB presented a comparable 10-year OS to the ALND cohort (log-rank test p = .054). Multivariate Cox analysis, as well as subgroup analysis, showed that rSLNB had a similar benefit to ALND (10-year OS; HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.88-1.58; p = .268). ConclusionsThe results of this cohort study suggested that receiving surgical axillary staging was associated with better survival of IBTR patients, and rSLNB had a similar long-term survival outcome as ALND. rSLNB might be considered for surgical axillary staging among patients with IBTR after lumpectomy and initial SLNB.

TI  - Examining the Role of the Main Terrestrial Factors Won the Seasonal Distribution of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentration over Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Global warming is one of the most important environmental issues from the last few decades and is causing climate change due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Therefore, examination of atmospheric CO2 concentration (XCO2) variations on the local and global scale is critical. The purpose of this research was to analyze the role of environmental variables in the seasonal distribution of XCO2 from 2015 to 2021 across Iran. Initially, by using XCO2 data acquired from the OCO-2 satellite, yearly and seasonal Spatio-temporal XCO2 distribution maps were developed. Subsequently, to understand the role of environmental variables on the Spatio-temporal variations of XCO2, the correlation of XCO2 with vegetation cover, precipitation and temperature were examined in different seasons. The annual increase of XCO2 can be observed, the concentrations in each year in all the areas were higher than those in the previous year. There was a different pattern of the spatial distribution of XCO2 in different seasons. In the growing seasons (spring and summer), the critical role of environmental variables in the north and west of Iran caused reaching XCO2 to the minimum amount. While in the cold seasons (autumn and winter) due to the decrease of vegetation cover, the XCO2 did not decrease in these areas. Furthermore, finding the correlation of XCO2 with environmental variables revealed that XCO2 had a significant correlation with these variables in the growing seasons. These correlations showed that the region with low vegetation coverage and precipitation and high temperature, which is situated in the south and east of Iran had the maximum amount of XCO2. Our results suggested the potential of satellite data for producing Spatio-temporal distribution maps that will help us to a better understanding of the carbon cycle at a regional scale.

TI  - Time continuous two-source energy-water balance modelling of heterogeneous crops: FEST-2-EWB
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate knowledge of the water and energy exchanges in the soil-crop-atmosphere system is critical for a precise and aware control of all agricultural operations, from field management to irrigation and harvest. This concern is more complex to address in heterogeneous systems, with the presence of bare soil or simple grass in between the main crop. In this work, a two-source energy-water balance model is developed, joining the advantages of the single-source FEST-EWB model (internal computation of surface temperature and time-continuous modelling) and those of two-source approaches (employing two surface temperatures to accurately characterize the intra-pixel heterogeneity). In order to validate the model results, a laboratory experiment has been designed over a lysimeter, with the target of obtaining partitioned estimates of Evaporation and Transpiration over a heterogeneous grass crop. These partitioned fluxes were supported by a safe error margin in the scaling procedure (less than +/- 1 mm/d). The FEST-EWB and FEST-2-EWB models were first calibrated using surface temperature obtained from thermal camera observations (with roughly 1.7 degrees C of average bias). Then, they were validated against the partitioned estimated. The single-source modelling showed a consistent overestimation of the estimated Transpiration, by an amount roughly 20% of the average irrigation event. On the other hand, the two-source model shows much lower (6%) errors, portraying more accurately the Transpired water volume. Such an improvement in crop water consumption estimation can provide a successful reference to optimize the use of the irrigation water resource, with consistent water savings.

TI  - LST determination of different urban growth patterns: A modeling procedure to identify the dominant spatial metrics
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing threat of urban heating has attracted considerable scholarly attention to their modeling and pre-diction. To improve the urban land surface temperature (LST) determination, this study assumed that the spatial pattern of built-up patches matters in LST prediction. To test this idea in a rapidly-urbanizing landscape, different urban growth types including infilling, edge expansion and outlying patterns and their LST layers were extracted from Landsat images in 1992, 2002, 2012, and 2022. The mean LST of each growth pattern was then modeled using the multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis and an array of independent variables related to the spatial formation and LST of the newly-grown and previously-existed urban patches. Results of the best infilling MLR model (R2 = 0.579) showed that the highest mean LST of the infilling growth is expected to be around the center of large focal patches. The mean LST of the edge expansion growth patches were found to be influenced by the mean LST of the edge of their focal patches and their shape structure (R2 = 0.362). The area of the outlying growth patches was also selected as the sole predictor of their mean LST (R2 = 0.334). According to the findings, the mean LST of the outlying, infilling and edge expansion growth patterns are influenced by the landscape composition, configuration and structure, respectively. Our results corroborate the idea that the performance of the urban LST prediction and their practical implications can be improved when the built-up landscape is divided into more spatially similar growth classes.

TI  - Retrieval of hourly PM2.5 using top-of-atmosphere reflectance from geostationary ocean color imagers I and II
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To produce real-time ground-level information on particulate matter with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), many studies have explored the applicability of satellite data, particularly aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, many of the techniques used are computationally demanding; to overcome these challenges, machine learning(ML)-based research has been on the rise. Here, we used ML techniques to directly estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over South Korea using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager I (GOCI-I) and its next generation GOCI-II with improved spatial, spectral, and temporal resolu-tions. Three ML techniques were used to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations: random forest, light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and artificial neural network. Three schemes were examined based on the input feature composition of the GOCI spectral bands: scheme 1 using all GOCI-I bands, scheme 2 using only GOCI-II bands that overlap with GOCI-I bands, and scheme 3 using all GOCI-II bands. The results showed that LGBM performed better than the other ML models. GOCI-II-based schemes 2 and 3 (determination of coefficient (R2) = 0.85 and 0.85 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 7.69 and 7.82 mu g/m3, respectively) performed slightly better than GOCI-I-based scheme 1 (R2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 8.49 mu g/m3). In particular, TOA reflectance at a new channel (380 nm) of GOCI-II was identified as the most contributing variable, given its high sensitivity to aerosols. The long-term estimation of PM2.5 concentrations using the proposed models was examined for ground stations located in two major cities. GOCI-II-based models produced a more detailed spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations owing to their higher spatial resolution (i.e., 250 m). The use of TOA reflectance data, instead of AOD and other aerosol products commonly used in previous studies, reduced the missing rate of the estimated ground-level PM2.5 concentrations by up to 50%. Our results indicate that the proposed approach using TOA reflectance data from geostationary satellite sensors has great potential for estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations for operational purposes.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Geographic Information System (GIS) combined with remote sensing and field data was used to identify and map Souss-Massa National Park (SMNP) habitats, an exceptionally biodiverse coastal area located in Morocco. Habitats in fenced and unfenced areas were compared to assess the fencing effectiveness for conserving semi-arid/arid environments. Sentinel-2A level-2A data acquired on March 25, 2021, were analysed using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin in QGIS software. The supervised classification technique and the maximum likelihood classifier were used. Ground truthing consisted of training data used for the supervised classification and reference data (850 validation points) used for accuracy assessment based on the confusion matrix method. SMNP composed of 11 natural habitat classes (70.91%) and 6 disturbed habitat classes (29.09%). The overall accuracy (> 96%) and kappa coefficient (0.95) showed a high classification accuracy. Fenced areas were dominated by natural habitats (> 88%), whereas unfenced areas contained more disturbed habitats (> 51%), indicating that fencing was an effective conservation tool. Natural habitats in unfenced areas are largely being modified and degraded, and therefore, monitoring and conservation actions should be further strengthened. The presented methodology shows a promising application potential in future and related ecological studies conducted in other regions, notably developing countries.

TI  - Occult nodal metastases in T1-T2cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma: Correlation between sentinel node positivity and completion neck dissection analysis
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Sentinel node procedure (SN) is a standard procedure that has shown its safety and effectiveness for T1/T2 cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), with completion neck dissection (CND) for patients with positive SN. The aim of this study was to characterize the nodal involvement in a cohort of SN + OSCC. Materials and Methods: Patients with T1/T2 cN0 OSCC with positive SN with CND were included in this singlecenter, prospective cohort study between 2000 and 2013. Results: 54/301 patients had at least one positive SN. In 43/54 (80 %) cases, only the SN(s) were invaded; with only one SN involved (SN+=1) in 36/54 (67 %) cases. No predictive factors of nodal involvement in the CND were found considering the followings: SN micro/macrometastases, primary tumor's depth of invasion (DOI), perineural spread, lymphovascular involvement, primary tumor location, T stage and extranodal extension. The SN micrometastatic involvement (n = 22) was significantly associated with only one SN + CND- (p = 0.017). In the group of patients with unique micrometastatic involvement in the SN (n = 20/54), there was a higher isolated nodal recurrence free time (p = 0.017). Conclusion: 80% of T1/T2 cN0 OSCC with positive SN had no other lymph node metastases in the CND, questioning the potential benefits of this procedure. Predictive factors such as the size of the SN metastasis need to be tested to stratify the risk of positive non-SN lymph nodes leading to a personalized treatment, lowering the therapeutic morbidity while maintaining the oncologic safety.

TI  - Interannual, sub-seasonal and spatial variations in growing season surface heat fluxes for the US Corn Belt
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal variations in surface latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes from croplands and patches of remnant deciduous forest in the Midwest U.S. Corn Belt have been proposed to trigger "nonclassical mesoscale circulations" (NCMCs) in the atmosphere's boundary layer and moist convection, under suitable synoptic con-ditions. However, prior to evaluating the link between land use and land cover (LULC), NCMCs, and precipitation for the Corn Belt, it is necessary to better understand the interannual, sub-seasonal, and spatial variations in surface heat fluxes. Here, a nine-year warm season "climatology" (1999-2007) of daily afternoon and early evening averages of LE and H from two flux towers, representative of cropland (Bondville, IL) and deciduous forest (Morgan Monroe State Forest, IN), is analyzed for sub-seasonal and interannual variations in the convective fluxes. Wilcoxon signed rank tests show significant growing season and sub-seasonal anomalies in LE and H at both flux tower sites. Structural equation modeling relates these inter-growing season anomalies in LE and H to variations in net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature, while MODIS Normalized Differ-ence Vegetation Index data link some of the sub-seasonal variations in the surface energy balance to phenology at the start of the growing season. Additional composite analysis of LE and H from the North American Regional Reanalysis shows characteristic spatial heterogeneities and significant differences in LE and H for different synoptic circulation patterns related to the variations in net radiation and LULC. These results highlight the importance of considering the sub-seasonal and spatial variations in surface heat fluxes of the Corn Belt for the range of synoptic conditions, within the context of this region's recent interannual climate variations and will help inform the search for LULC-influenced moist convection.

TI  - A Study on Effective Compressive and Shear Properties of Tetrahedral Lattice Materials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tetrahedral lattice materials can be used as the core of a sandwich structure. The properties of tetrahedral lattice materials can be controlled by modifying their geometrical parameters and relative density. In this paper, a tetrahedral lattice structure deformation mechanism-based theoretical analysis model is established to predict the effective mechanical properties of the structure under compressive and shear loadings. The ana-lytical solutions are subsequently verified by finite element analysis of a large-scale lattice material model. Based on the obtained results, the effects of the geometrical parameters, relative density, and shear deformation are discussed. At a specific relative density, as strut inclination angle increases: (1) the effective compressive modulus in the z-direction increases; (2) the effective compressive modulus in x- and y-directions, and the effective shear modulus in xy-, xz-, and yz-directions firstly increases but then decreases; (3) the effective Poisson's ratios nu zx and nu zy increase, whereas, nu xz , nu yz , nu xy ,and nu yx decrease. With an increase in relative density, the effective compressive and shearing modulus increase, the effective Poisson's ratios remain constant, nu xy and nu yx are always equal to 0 when the strut inclination angle is 45 degrees. The effect of shear deformation on the effective mechanical properties increases as the slenderness ratio increases. The predicted effec-tive properties enable the tetrahedral lattice unit cells to be treated as material in the design and analysis process.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The thermal environment is a crucial part of ecological environments. It is vital to study the distribution and generation of thermal environments for regional sustainable development. Mining area, agricultural area and urban area were taken as the research object, and remote sensing data were used to study the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the thermal environment. The relationship between the thermal environment and land use types was analyzed, and the effect of mining and reclamation on the thermal environment was emphasized. The main findings were: (1) the thermal effect zone in the study area was dispersed. The area ratio of the thermal effect zone accounted for 69.70%, 68.52%, 65.85%, 74.20% and 74.66% in the year 2000, 2003, 2009, 2013 and 2018, respectively. The contribution to the overall thermal effect was in the order of agricultural area > mining area > urban area. (2) The proportion of forest and the average grid temperature always showed a significant negative correlation in different scales and had the highest correlation and the greatest influence. (3) The land surface temperature (LST) of opencast areas was higher than the surrounding temperature, and the temperature difference was 3-5 °C. The LST of reclaimed sites was lower than the surrounding temperature, and the temperature difference was -7 to 0 °C. The quantitative study found that reclamation mode, shape and spatial location could affect the cooling effect of the reclaimed site. This study can provide a reference for the mitigation of thermal effects and the identification of influences of mining and reclamation on the thermal environment in the coordinated development of similar regions.

TI  - Land subsidence modeling and assessment in the West Pearl River Delta from combined InSAR time series, land use and geological data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - West Pearl River Delta (WPRD) is sinking as a result of the jointed effect of natural and anthropogenic factors. Land subsidence has increasingly become a concern because of tremendous population growth and rapid urbanization over this region in the last few decades. In this study, sixty-seven Sentinel-1 images, acquired between 2016 and 2021, were analyzed with the persistent scatterer interferometry technique (PSI), to monitor and reveal the ground subsidence characteristics in the WPRD. It is found that the overall vertical deformation velocities observed in the WPRD ranged between -70 mm/year and 10 mm/year. Three subsidence bowls were found in the study area (Gaolan island of Zhuhai, the junction area of Zhuhai and Zhongshan, and the junction area of Zhongshan and Jiangmen). The spatial-temporal subsidence characteristics have been analyzed. It is discovered that the ground subsidence is mostly dispersed in Quaternary deposits and is highly relevant to the thickness of sediments, indicating that soft soil consolidation is one of the primary causes contributing to land subsidence. Furthermore, land use maps for 2016 and 2021 were generated using Landsat-8 images for the investigation on the relationship between land subsidence and land use. The results obtained from analysis demonstrated that the rapid subsiding areas mainly occurred in the land-use classes as follows: aquaculture, urban land, and agricultural land. The land use conversion pattern with more significant anthropogenic influence usually causes a higher subsidence rate. In addition, based on soft soil thickness, groundwater exploitation, land use, elevation, and strata lithology, a Random Forest Regression (RFR) model was used to predict subsidence rates (R2 = 0.631, RMSE = 2.7 mm/year). The importance of these influencing factors of land subsidence was calculated based on the RFR algorithm. The results indicated that soft soil thickness, elevation, groundwater exploitation, strata lithology, and landcover type are the most significant factors affecting subsidence. The applicability of geological data and land-use history for land subsidence prediction has been demonstrated with the use of the RFR algorithm.

TI  - Characterizing the accuracy of satellite-based products to detect soil moisture at the global scale
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based soil moisture (SM) products exhibit distinct error patterns at various timescales. Knowledge of their accuracy characteristics for capturing different SM signals is significant for many real-world applications in soil sciences. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the following eight satellite-based SM prod-ucts: the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity-Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique and Centre d'Etudes Spatiales de la BIOsphere version 2 (SMOS-IC-V2), the Level 3 (L3) Soil Moisture Active Passive V7 (SMAP-V7), the combined European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative V06.1 (ESA CCI-V06.1), the L3 SMOS V3, the L3 Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) V3 from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the L3 Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) C1-and X-band AMSR2 V001, and the Chinese FengYun-3B V1. By using >1,500 sites from the International Soil Moisture Network and triple collocation analysis, this study aimed to identify not only the relative strengths of the products for detecting original SM signals, short-term SM anomalies, and long-term SM seasonality, but also the impacts of land cover, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil texture on their retrieval accuracy. In terms of capturing the temporal dynamics of SM anomalies, SMAP-V7 outperformed SMOS-IC-V2 and ESA CCI-V06.1. In arid and semi-arid areas, LPRM C1-band AMSR2 V001 out-performed SMOS-ICV2 and SMAP-V7, in terms of detecting SM seasonality. SMAP-V7, SMOS-ICV2, and ESA CCI-V06.1 effectively captured SM seasonality over most forest zones and effectively detected short-term SM anomalies over croplands and grasslands. The L-band products showed the highest accuracy in terms of capturing the temporal dynamics of all the SM signals when the clay fraction was in the range of 20 %-25 %. Most products had difficulties in detecting SM variations over bare deserts, sandy and clay soils, and soils rich in organic matter (SOC content > 8.72 %).

TI  - Monitoring the Sea Surface Microlayer (SML) on Sentinel images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Slicks on the sea surface are usually related to oil spills, algal blooms or organic runoff around coastlines. An extensive network of slicks extending across the English Channel is seen on Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 images and are identified as comprising a film of natural surfactant material within the sea surface microlayer (SML). As the SML represents the interface between ocean and atmosphere, controlling the vital exchange of gases and aerosols, identification of the slicks on images can add a new dimension to climate modelling. Current models use primary productivity often com-bined with wind speed, but quantifying the global extent of surface films spatially and temporally is difficult due to their patchy nature. The slicks are shown to be visible on Sentinel 2 optical images affected by sun glint, due to the wave dampening effect of the surfactants. On a Sentinel 1 SAR image of the same day, they can be identified using the VV polarised band. The paper investigates the nature and spectral properties of the slicks in relation to sun glint, and evaluates the performance of chlorophyll-a, floating algae and floating debris indices on the slick-affected areas. No index was able to distinguish slicks from non-slick areas as successfully as the original sun glint image. This image was used to devise a tentative Surfactant Index (SI) which indicates over 40 % of the study area covered by slicks. As ocean sensors have lower spatial resolution and are generally designed to avoid sun glint, Sentinel 1 SAR may offer a useful alternative for monitoring the global spatial extent of surface films, until dedicated sensors and algorithms can be developed.

TI  - First validation of Earth Reflector Type Index (p) parameter from DSCOVR EPIC VESDR data product using Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network observing sites in Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral invariants theory predicts that amount of radiation scattered by a canopy in a given wavelength is a simple function of the leaf albedo and a spectrally invariant parameter p. This study provides the first assessment of p parameter obtained from the Earth Reflector Type Index (ERTI) provided in Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) Vegetation Earth System Data Record (VESDR) product. Our results suggest that ERTI parameter can possibly deliver information about photon recollision probability, albeit with a risk of lower accuracy, even for conditions that differ from the original assumptions in the spectral invariants theory (non-reflecting soil, dense canopies). We verified the expected link between ERTI p parameter in the EPIC VESDR product, foliage clumping, and canopy cover with empirical data. Importantly, this was done with study sites in Australia that included types of forests that are still relatively unexplored with spectral invariants theory. Our findings contribute to understanding product uncertainty and spatial representativeness of the in situ measurements from the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) SuperSites in Australia.

TI  - Analysis of the evolution and driving forces of tidal wetlands at the estuary of the Yellow River and Laizhou Bay based on remote sensing data cube
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising of the "claiming land from tidal wetlands and sea" has gradually reduced tidal wetlands, resulting in a huge damage to the coastal ecological environment. It is of great significance to monitor tidal wetlands by remote sensing technology. However, due to the influence of tides and weather, monitoring tidal wetlands by remote sensing technology is often inaccurate. In this study, using dense time series images data cube constructed by the spatio-temporal data fusion algorithm, we monitored tidal wetlands at the estuary of the Yellow River and Laizhou Bay; and we analyzed their evolution and driving forces in detail. This study revealed several findings. Firstly, the area of tidal wetlands had shown a decreasing trend; the tidal wetland at the new estuary of the Yellow River had extended to the sea from 1976 to 2021; other tidal wetlands had shrunk year by year. Secondly, a more important finding was that sedimentation, erosion and reclamation had led to the changes of the tidal wetlands; and there were no obvious changing trends of the tidal wetlands' area caused by these three factors in each time period. Finally, we confirmed that salt field driving force, salt field and harbor driving force, aquaculture pond driving force and the erosion of natural factor driving force had reduced tidal wetlands; while the sedimentation of the natural factor driving force had made the tidal wetlands increase; and the newly added area of all driving forces had had no obvious regular changing trends. Our proposing to monitor tidal wetlands by using dense time series images data cube provides a general approach for tidal wetlands' study and our results demonstrate the need for better coastal management of the estuary of the Yellow River and Laizhou Bay.

TI  - Light use efficiency models incorporating diffuse radiation impacts for simulating terrestrial ecosystem gross primary productivity: A global comparison
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating dynamic changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems has always been challenging. Indeed, light use efficiency (LUE) models are extensively employed to capture GPP dynamics. Improved big-leaf LUE models by introducing a cloudiness scalar and two-leaf LUE models by dividing the canopy into shaded and sunlit leaves are two improved families for addressing the widely-recognized effects of diffuse radiation on terrestrial ecosystem GPP. However, the global performance in simulating GPP dynamics between such models has not been evaluated comprehensively. Here, we assess and compare the global per-formance of the ten LUE models considering diffuse radiation impacts (CFLUX, DIFFUSE, CI-LUE, CCW, Wang's Model, CI-EF, TL-LUE, TL-LUEn, DTEC, and RTL-LUE) at 102 flux sites in a standardized framework. Results indicate that LUE models considering diffuse radiation impacts can explain 46.7-63.6% of daily GPP variability obtained by the eddy covariance technique. Seven of the ten models show a better performance across all ecosystems than MOD17, despite the relatively poor performance of three (i.e., DIFFUSE, Wang's Model, and DTEC). The seven improved models exhibiting a similar explanation of GPPEC perform poorly in evergreen broadleaf forests and croplands but well in deciduous broadleaf forests. Although two-leaf models with higher leaf area index (LAI) sensitivity and better model structure have greater potential to describe diffuse radiation fertilization (DRF), their performance in capturing GPP dynamics is limited by the uncertainties of remote sensing data. This study indicates the importance of accurate LAI for two-leaf models and emphasizes the ne-cessity of incorporating diffuse radiation impacts into the global GPP estimates in the future.

TI  - A change type determination method based on knowledge of spectral changes in land cover types
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate information on change types is widely used in areas such as territorial spatial planning and dynamic monitoring of land cover, etc. Change type information is usually obtained using the post-classification comparison method. However, such methods are susceptible to the accumulation of errors due to the classification results, which in turn affects the accuracy of change type information identification. In response to the above problems, a change type determination method based on knowledge of spectral changes in land cover types (KSC-LCT) is proposed. Firstly, the change vector analysis method is used to obtain the change magnitude map, and the threshold value is calculated using the OTSU method to obtain the change regions. Secondly, some samples of land cover types are selected to calculate the mean value of each land cover type, and the spectral knowledge information of different land cover type changes is carved from the perspectives of spectral mean change, spectral angle change and thematic index change. Finally, based on the classification data of the previous moment and spectral change knowledge information, knowledge matching is carried out with the spectral change information of remote sensing images in the changed areas, and the minimum value of the matching result is selected as the judgment criterion to obtain the final change type of land cover. The experimental results show that the KSC-LCT method can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of land cover change type information and further reduce the phenomenon of over-detection in the change areas.

TI  - Surface water changes in China's Yangtze River Delta over the past forty years
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water security is a challenge in highly urbanized, economically active, and high water consumption regions. Exploring the supply and demand of surface water resources in developed is conducive to promoting the sustainable socioeconomic development of these agglomerations. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is one of the most important world-class urban in China. However, it is unclear how surface water has responded to underlying impacts of climate change and anthropogenic water exploitation over the past decades. Here, we monitored the spatiotemporal characteristics of surface water and investigated the driving forces and regional impact of surface water changes. We found that (1) the trend in surface water body area in China's YRD was stable over the past 40 years; (2) precipitation and the digital elevation model best determined the spatial dis-tribution of surface water in the YRD; (3) the construction of reservoirs was the main factor for the increase of surface water area; and (4) the increase in population density was the main driver of the decrease in surface water area. Human activities deplete and artificially increase surface water supply, which tends to offset; human activities have decreased water conservation services and soil and water conservation services of the YRD.

TI  - Superpixel segmentation integrated feature subset selection for wetland classification over Yellow River Delta
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the world's most significant and vulnerable ecosystems. The wetlands of the Yellow River Delta are subject to multiple influences of ocean tidal action and the massive sediment deposits of the Yellow River, resulting in a more complex and unstable composition of land cover types. To better distinguish the wetlands in the region, we conducted the classification using an object-oriented combined with feature preference machine learning approach. To alleviate the pretzel phenomenon in pixel-based classification, a superpixel segmentation method using the watershed algorithm with H-minima labeling was used to segment the images at the optimal scale. The best feature subset for classification was filtered using the recursive feature elimination cross-validation approach, which extracts multiple spectral indices from the images. A random forest classifier combining superpixel segmentation and feature selection methods was proposed for the wetland classification. The model improves the classification accuracy of wetlands compared to three classical pixel-based machine learning classification methods. And the overall accuracy was 91.74% and the kappa coefficient was 0.9078, both of which were improved by about 4.53% and 0.0506, respectively, compared with the best-performing random forest classifier in pixel-oriented. The results showed that this method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of the Yellow River Delta wetlands compared with the previous studies.

TI  - The primary application of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in surgical oncology
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundIndocyanine green (ICG) is a nontoxic, albumin-bound, liver-metabolized fluorescent iodide dye that has been widely utilized in clinical applications since the mid-1950s. However, after the 1970s, in-depth research on the fluorescence properties of ICG greatly expanded its application in the medical field. MethodsIn our mini-review, we searched the relevant literature on common oncology surgeries from PubMed, including lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and pituitary tumors, using keywords such as indocyanine green, fluorescence imaging technology, and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. In addition, the application of targeted ICG photothermal technology in tumor therapy is briefly mentioned. ResultsIn this mini-review, we analyzed studies on ICG fluorescence imaging in common surgical oncology and offered a thorough analysis of each form of cancer or tumor. ConclusionICG has demonstrated significant potential in the detection and treatment of tumors in current clinical practice, although many applications are still in the preliminary stages, and multicenter studies are still required to more precisely define its indications, effectiveness, and safety.

TI  - Improving satellite-based monitoring of the polar regions: Identification of research and capacity gaps
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - We present a comprehensive review of the current status of remotely sensed and in situ sea ice, ocean, and land parameters acquired over the Arctic and Antarctic and identify current data gaps through comparison with the portfolio of products provided by Copernicus services. While we include several land parameters, the focus of our review is on the marine sector. The analysis is facilitated by the outputs of the KEPLER H2020 project. This project developed a road map for Copernicus to deliver an improved European capacity for monitoring and forecasting of the Polar Regions, including recommendations and lessons learnt, and the role citizen science can play in supporting Copernicus' capabilities and giving users ownership in the system. In addition to summarising this information we also provide an assessment of future satellite missions (in particular the Copernicus Sentinel Expansion Missions), in terms of the potential enhancements they can provide for environmental monitoring and integration/assimilation into modelling/forecast products. We identify possible synergies between parameters obtained from different satellite missions to increase the information content and the robustness of specific data products considering the end-users requirements, in particular maritime safety. We analyse the potential of new variables and new techniques relevant for assimilation into simulations and forecasts of environmental conditions and changes in the Polar Regions at various spatial and temporal scales. This work concludes with several specific recommendations to the EU for improving the satellite-based monitoring of the Polar Regions.

TI  - Monitoring canopy-scale autumn leaf phenology at fine-scale using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of deciduous forest phenology is significant for understanding temperate deciduous forest eco-systems. Fine-scale perspectives on vegetation phenology have recently been carried out with the development of near-surface sensors, particularly uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV). However, the capability of UAV-derived indices for canopy-scale phenology monitoring remains under-studied. In this study, a DJI Phantom 4 Multi-spectral (P4-M) UAV was used to evaluate the abilities of drone-derived indices for autumn canopy phenodates (the start (SOF), middle (MOF) and end (EOF) of leaf fall) monitoring in a temperate deciduous forest on the Loess Plateau. Using 104 drone acquisitions acquired in one year, a UAV-derived vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and two color-channel indices (green and red chromatic coordinate, GCC and RCC) were explored for tree-crown scale phenophases estimation. It was found that NDVI exhibited the best matches with visual interpretation in canopy autumn phenodate capture (correlation coefficient (R) = 0.69 for EOF). NDVI and GCC showed a higher consistency (R >= 0.51, root-mean-square-error <= 10.44 days and |bias| <= 6.71 days) in extracting the phenometrics than RCC, except for the MOF and EOF of evergreen trees. RCC ob-tained the earliest SOF due to its sensitivity to red leaves but failed to track canopy phenology, especially EOF, in mountainous areas because of its inability to eliminate illumination effects. Generally, NDVI showed the highest potential for estimating autumn tree-crown scale phenometrics, followed by GCC and RCC. Moreover, topog-raphy indirectly impacts vegetation phenophases by controlling vegetation type and composition. The results of this study indicate the considerable potential of UAV-derived indices, particularly NDVI and GCC, for autumn canopy phenology monitoring at a fine scale.

TI  - Residues of an anthelmintic veterinary drug (closantel) detected in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Scotland
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The contamination of the environment by some veterinary medicines and their impact on wild animals is of increasing concern. However, there is a lack of information about their residues in wildlife. The sentinel animals most commonly used for monitoring the level of environmental contamination are birds of prey, and information on other carnivores and scavengers scarce. This study examined the livers from 118 foxes for residues of a range of 18 veterinary medicines (16 anthelmintic agents and 2 metabolites) used on farm livestock. The samples were collected from foxes, primarily in Scotland, shot during legal pest control activities conducted between 2014 and 2019. Closantel residues were detected in 18 samples, and the concentrations found ranged from 6.5 mu gkg(-1) to 1383 mu gkg(-1). No other compounds were found in significant quantities. The results show a surprising frequency and level of closantel contamination, raising concerns about both the route of contamination and the potential impacts on wild animals and the environment, such as the potential for significant wildlife contamination to contribute to the development of closantel-resistant parasites. The results also suggest that red fox (Vulpes vulpes) could be a useful sentinel species for detecting and monitoring some veterinary medicine residues in the environment.

TI  - Contract Structures for SatCom: How Will Competition from Low Earth Orbit Mega Constellations Change How Communications Services Are Purchased?
T2  - NEW SPACE-THE JOURNAL OF SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Communication satellite operators contract their capacity through service-level agreements (SLAs) to their customers, some of which reserve fixed capacity over multiple years. Relative to current capacity constraints, this market has seen substantial demand growth, as well as number of new entrants such as SpaceX and Amazon. While historically these SLAs have helped matched large capital investments with long-term revenue, the history of communications markets suggests that this leaves significant capacity and revenues underutilized. Our objectives were to review existing SLAs, identify their limitations, and explore new SLAs, some of which leverage the flexibility of new communication satellites. We find that existing SLAs can be characterized into classic, data volume, and dual SLAs. While important historically, these are found to leave significant capacity and revenue potential underutilized while simultaneously failing to meet customer desire for improved flexibility and lower prices. Through 60 interviews with SatCom customers, we find that lower prices and more flexibility for capacity bookings are the 2 most desired characteristic. By examining the history of the cloud computing and telecommunication industries, we propose spot instance, time-of-day pricing, and 2 classes of service SLAs, which address these shortcomings by offering more liquid services accessible to a broader range of customers. We conclude that the classic SLA excels where reliability and speed are essential, traffic volume is high, and variation is low. When consumers are price-sensitive, data volume SLAs, time-of-day pricing SLAs, and 2 classes of service SLAs are affordable options. When the traffic patterns are not repeating on a daily or monthly basis, spot instances offer the desired flexibility.

TI  - Analyzing correlations between GNSS retrieved precipitable water vapor and land surface temperature after earthquakes occurrence
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake is a common and destructive natural disaster. The enormous amount of energy released from seismic events can result in anomalous land surface temperature (LST) and catalyze the accumulation of water vapor in the atmosphere. The majority of previous works are not consensual concerning precipitable water vapor (PWV) and LST after the earthquake. Here, we utilized multi-source data to analyze the changes of PWV and LST anomaly after three Ms 4.0-5.3 crustal earthquakes at low depth (8-9 km) that occurred in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Firstly, PWV re-trieval using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology is performed, showing that its root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 1.8 mm against radiosonde (RS) data or European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Fore-casts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) PWV data. The PWV change derived from the nearest GNSS stations around the hypocenter during the earthquakes shows anomalies, and the results reveal that PWV anomalies occurred after the earthquakes, mainly obeying a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. In addition, LST increases three days be-fore PWV peak with a thermal anomaly of 12 degrees C higher than that of previous days. Robust Satellite Technique (RST) algorithm and ALICE index on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products are introduced to analyze the correlation between the abnormality of LST and PWV. Based on ten-year background field data (2012-2021), the results show that LST during the earthquake has more thermal anomaly occurrences than in previous years. The more severe the LST thermal anomaly is, the higher the probability of a PWV peak occurring.

TI  - High rate of postoperative upstaging of ductal carcinoma in situ when prioritizing ultrasound evaluation of mammography-detected lesions: a single-center retrospective cohort study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe initial diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can be upstaged to invasive cancer after definitive surgery. This study aimed to identify risk factors for DCIS upstaging using routine breast ultrasonography and mammography (MG) and to propose a prediction model.MethodsIn this single-center retrospective study, patients initially diagnosed with DCIS (January 2016-December 2017) were enrolled (final sample size = 272 lesions). Diagnostic modalities included ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (US-CNB), MG-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and wire-localized surgical biopsy. Breast ultrasonography was routinely performed for all patients. US-CNB was prioritized for lesions visible on ultrasound. Lesions initially diagnosed as DCIS on biopsy with a final diagnosis of invasive cancer at definitive surgery were defined as "upstaged."ResultsThe postoperative upstaging rates were 70.5%, 9.7%, and 4.8% in the US-CNB, MG-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and wire-localized surgical biopsy groups, respectively. US-CNB, ultrasonographic lesion size, and high-grade DCIS were independent predictive factors for postoperative upstaging, which were used to construct a logistic regression model. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed good internal validation (area under the curve = 0.88).ConclusionsSupplemental screening breast ultrasonography possibly contributes to lesion stratification. The low upstaging rate for ultrasound-invisible DCIS diagnosed by MG-guided procedures suggests that it is unnecessary to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy for lesions invisible on ultrasound. Case-by-case evaluation of DCIS detected by US-CNB can help surgeons determine if repeating biopsy with vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is necessary or if sentinel lymph node biopsy should accompany breast-preserving surgery.

TI  - Continuous advance in the onset of vegetation green-up in the Northern Hemisphere, during hiatuses in spring warming
T2  - NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have documented substantial advancing trends in the onset date of vegetation green-up (VGD) during the 1980s and 1990s over the Northern Hemisphere, while later studies based on data from the spaceborne advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) have reported this trend stalled during the warming hiatus from the late 1990s to early 2010s. However, there is uncertainty in this finding of a hiatus in VGD advance due to the identification of quality issues associated with the data from AVHRR. Using the high-quality data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, we show VGD significantly advanced despite the warming hiatus due to the high sensitivity of VGD to temperature and the magnitude of VGD advance over 2000-2021 (2.5-2.6 days decade(-1), P < 0.01) is close to that over 1982-1999 or 1982-2002 with intensive warming, which suggests caution be exercised in the inference of climate warming based on advances in spring phenology.

TI  - Worldview literacy as a part of teacher professionalism
T2  - INTERCULTURAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article, based on a mixed-method study, examines which dimensions of worldview are addressed by a group (N = 134) of Finnish students and in-service educators when interpreting a written imaginary case from everyday school life. The findings are interpreted in the framework of worldview literacy, derived from the concept of religious literacy and defined as an ability to decipher situations with aspects of worldview diversity. Data from open responses to a survey were approached in two ways, quantitatively, where worldview literacy was seen as an ability to recognise the impact of worldview in the case and argue for it, and qualitatively, where the different aspects of worldview mentioned by the participants were analysed. In terms of the quantitative analysis, the survey revealed a tendency to avoid explaining situations through worldview. From a qualitative point of view, the participants most often mentioned worldview as beliefs and something deeply significant and emotional. Furthermore, the data raised questions about essentialist attitudes towards worldviews and cultures, and recognising power issues. The case-based open question yielded multifaceted data, pointing to the fact that this method could be developed to measure worldview literacy.

TI  - Trends of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Sentinel Community-Based Surveillance After the Optimization of Prevention and Control Measures - China, December 2022-January 2023
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: On December 7, 2022, Chinaimplemented the "Ten New Measures" to optimize its prevention and control measures for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To provide the latest data after the optimization, we evaluated trends of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among the community population in China. Methods: We utilized data from the NationalSentinel Community-Based Surveillance (NSCS) system in China to assess trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection. NSCS is a national community-based surveillance cohort with 0.42 million participants from all 31 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corp (XPCC). Participants were tested for infection twice a week (a total of eight rounds) from December 16, 2022 to January 12, 2023. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antigen. We calculated the daily average of newly positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: In this national cohort, the daily averagenewly positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased from 4.13% in Round 1 (December 16-19, 2022) to 0.69% in Round 8 (January 10-12, 2023). The epidemic peak occurred in Round 2 (December 20-22, 2022). Similar trends were observed in urban areas (decreasing from 4.65% to 0.73%), rural areas (decreasing from 2.83% to 0.57%), the eastern region (decreasing from 4.18% to 0.67%), the central region (decreasing from 5.43% to 0.61%), and the western region (decreasing from 3.01% to 0.77%). Conclusions: NSCS data showed that the peak ofSARS-CoV-2 infection in China had passed. SARS-CoV-2 infection in community populations in China is currently at a low epidemic level.Since its emergence in late 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global threat for over three years (1). After experiencing a large-scale epidemic in February 2020, China entered a normalization stage of prevention and control that began in May 2020 (1-2). During this normalization stage, comprehensive measures were taken to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on health, the economy, and society (2). With the high coverage of COVID-19 vaccines in China, accumulated experience in prevention and treatment, and the presence of the highly infectious but less virulent Omicron variants BA.5.2 and BF.7, "Ten New Measures" were implemented on December 7, 2022 to further optimize prevention and control measures of COVID-19. A recent modeling study estimated the transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron BF.7 in Beijing (3). However, no study has evaluated national and regional trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general community-based population in late 2022 and early 2023 during the widespread transmission of Omicron variants BA.5.2 and BF.7 throughout China. To fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated national and regional trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general population using a community sentinel surveillance system during December 2022 and January 2023 to provide SARS-CoV-2 infection data during this critical period.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early oral cancers: are we ready for it yet? Results from a survey among Indian surgeons treating oral cancers
T2  - ORAL SURGERY ORAL MEDICINE ORAL PATHOLOGY ORAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Emerging evidence has shown that sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is an oncologically safe option in patients with early oral cancer compared with elective neck dissection (END). However, its use on a routine basis could be associated with many challenges. Study Design. This online survey was conducted among the Indian surgeons treating patients with oral cancer to understand and comprehend the incidence and patterns of usage of SNB in their practice, their approach toward the use of SNB, and the possible challenges they face or perceive in its routine use in patients with early oral cancer.Results. We received 352 responses with a response rate of 47.63%. Most of the respondents (82.6%) were managing N-zero necks with END, only 15.1% (n = 53) respondents practiced SNB currently. Most respondents believed that SNB offered the advantage of better shoulder function compared with END (76.4% [n = 269]). The deterrents considered for routine use of SNB in early oral cancer were additional costs (71.9% [n = 253]), the unavailability of necessary expertise and infrastructure (87.2% [n = 307]), SLNB being a more time-consuming treatment (58.8% [n = 207]), a higher false negative rate (74.1% [n = 261]), and the possible need of a second surgery (82.4% [n = 290]).Conclusions. Though SNB presently could be considered as an alternative treatment option, there seem to be various issues that need to be addressed before it can be adopted as a standard of care across centers.

TI  - COVID-19 induced birth sex ratio changes in England and Wales
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The sex ratio at birth (male live births divided by total live births) may be a sentinel health indicator. Stressful events reduce this ratio 3-5 months later by increasing male fetal loss. This ratio can also change 9 months after major population events that are linked to an increase or decrease in the frequency of sexual intercourse at the population level, with the ratio either rising or falling respectively after the event. We postulated that the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the ratio in England and Wales. Methods. Publicly available, monthly live birth data for England and Wales was obtained from the Office for National Statistics up to December 2020. Using time series analysis, the sex ratio at birth for 2020 (global COVID-19 onset) was predicted using data from 2012-2019. Observed and predicted values were compared. Results. From 2012-2020 there were 3,133,915 male and 2,974,115 female live births (ratio 0.5131). Three months after COVID-19 was declared pandemic (March 2020), there was a significant fall in the sex ratio at birth to 0.5100 in June 2020 which was below the 95% prediction interval of 0.5102-0.5179. Nine months after the pandemic declaration, (December 2020), there was a significant rise to 0.5171 (95% prediction interval 0.5085-0.5162). However, December 2020 had the lowest number of live births of any month from 2012-2020. Conclusions. Given that June 2020 falls within the crucial window when population stressors are known to affect the sex ratio at birth, these findings imply that the start of the COVID-19 pandemic caused population stress with notable effects on those who were already pregnant by causing a disproportionate loss of male fetuses. The finding of a higher sex ratio at birth in December 2020, i.e., 9 months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, could have resulted from the lockdown restrictions that initially spurred more sexual activity in a subset of the population in March 2020.

TI  - Detection of hydrothermal alteration and structural characteristics of Miocene volcanic rocks using remote sensing in the M'sirda region (northwestern Algeria)
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrothermal alteration is the origin of potential mineral deposits. It is the source of different mineralization types and areas of economic interest. Remote sensing techniques are commonly used for identifying and assessing these alterations given their advantages in mineral exploration industry. The Miocene period in western Algeria recorded several volcanic activities resulting from eruptions. The M'sirda massif is the focus of our study. It has exposed potential deposits related to Miocene-age volcanism. M'sirda Massif revealed significant Au-Ag polymetallic mineralization (Pb-Zn-Cu), hosted by andesite subvolcanic rocks, associated with a sequence of altered minerals (Quartz-Kaolinite-Alunite), Adularia-Sericite. To map the altered rocks, geologists use enhanced technologies based on georeferenced remote sensing images. Indeed, detailed and accurate mapping is possible using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS images. In the present study, a complete hydrothermal alteration study is conducted to map the hydrothermal alteration minerals. The combination of structural geological data and remote sensing results allows the determination of a relationship between mineralization and structures. Therefore, the mineral potential of the M'sirda massifs can be identified. This mapping process is based on digital data. Our study focuses on two aspects: structural and polymetallic mineralization. It has been demonstrated that the structural lineaments represent the fault zones extracted using both filter and density line techniques. A strong correlation is seen between mineralization deposits and high fracture density zones, which are expected to be helpful in delineating higher concentration of hydrothermal deposit potential. In addition, the mapping of alteration zones was successfully classed as evidenced by the statistical method.

TI  - Monitoring Arctic thin ice: a comparison between CryoSat-2 SAR altimetry data and MODIS thermal-infrared imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas of thin sea ice in the polar regions not only are experiencing the highest rate of sea-ice production but also are, therefore, important hot spots for ocean ventilation as well as heat and moisture exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. Through co-location of (1) an unsupervised waveform classification (UWC) approach applied to CryoSat-2 radar waveforms with (2) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived (MODIS) thin-ice-thickness estimates and (3) Sentinel-1A/B synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) reference data, thin-ice-based waveform shapes are identified, referenced, and discussed with regard to a manifold of waveform shape parameters. Here, strong linear dependencies are found between binned thin-ice thickness up to 25 cm from MODIS and the CryoSat-2 waveform shape parameters that show the possibility of either developing simple correction terms for altimeter ranges over thin ice or directing adjustments to current retracker algorithms specifically for very thin sea ice. This highlights the potential of CryoSat-2-based SAR altimetry to reliably discriminate between occurrences of thick sea ice, open-water leads, and thin ice within recently refrozen leads or areas of thin sea ice. Furthermore, a comparison to the ESA Climate Change Initiative's (CCI) CryoSat-2 surface type classification with classes sea ice, lead, and unknown reveals that the newly found thin-ice-related waveforms are divided up almost equally between unknown (46.3 %) and lead type (53.4 %) classifications. Overall, the UWC results in far fewer unknown classifications (1.4 % to 38.7 %). Thus, UWC provides more usable information for sea-ice freeboard and thickness retrieval and at the same time reduces range biases from thin-ice waveforms processed as regular sea ice in the CCI classification.

TI  - Representativeness of initial skin biopsies showing pure desmoplastic melanoma: implications for management
T2  - PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is an uncommon subtype of melanoma with distinct clinicopathological features. It is classified into pure desmoplastic melanoma (PDM) when the proportion of desmoplastic melanoma is >90% of the dermally-invasive component, and mixed desmoplastic melanoma (MDM) when the proportion of desmoplastic melanoma is <90%. Studies have reported a lower sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)-positivity rate in PDM compared to MDM and non-DM. As a result, some have recommended not performing SLNB in PDM patients. When PDM is identified in a partial biopsy of a melanoma, there is a risk that sampling bias may under-recognise MDM, but to the best of our knowledge this has not been previously assessed or quantified.The aim of this study was to assess the concordance of the proportion of desmoplastic melanoma in an initial partial biopsy of PDM with the proportion in the entire tumour following complete excision, in patients with cuta-neous melanoma. A secondary aim was to determine how frequently this potentially resulted in a patient not receiving a SLNB.Seventy-eight cases of cutaneous melanoma were identi-fied from the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) database and 23 cases from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC), where an initial biopsy contained PDM and a subsequent wide excision had residual invasive melanoma. Clinicopathological features were analysed in all patients, including whether a SLNB was performed, the results of SLNB, and any subsequent recurrence. Ninety percent (91/101) of cases were still classified as PDM in the complete wide excision specimen while 10% (10/101) of cases were reclassified as MDM, which was a significant change in classification of final desmoplastic melanoma subtype (p<0.001). The proportion of desmo-plastic melanoma was also significantly different between the initial and excisional biopsies (p=0.004). For ty-eight (48/101) patients had a SLNB, of which two (4.5%) were positive for metastatic melanoma; both cases were PDM in the excision specimen. Of the 10 cases demonstrating MDM in the excision specimen, the initial biopsy was a punch biopsy in six cases, shave biopsy in two cases and subcutaneous tissue was sampled in two patients (one punch biopsy, one incisional biopsy). Four of these 10 patients underwent SLNB which was negative in all cases. Twenty-two patients developed recurrence in the follow-up period (median 30 months, range 1-192 months), three with MDM in their excision specimen. One patient did not have a SLNB and developed regional lymph node recurrence.In this study there was a 10% risk that the percentage of desmoplastic melanoma in an initial biopsy of PDM was not representative of the entire lesion, resulting in reclas-sification as MDM in the excision specimen. If a SLNB is not performed in such cases, a positive SLNB may be missed (one patient in our study) which could impact treatment options for the patient. We recommend caution in not offering a SLNB in the setting of an initial biopsy of PDM if the biopsy is small compared with the overall lesion. If a SLNB is not procured at the time of wide excision in such cases, the SLNs should still be mapped by lymphoscintigraphy to facilitate careful follow up and to enable earlier detection and treatment of nodal disease.

T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is subject to location and environmental influ-ences, which makes quantification difficult in terms of timeliness. Based on 10-d geostationary satellite LST TCI products, we quantitatively evaluated the thermal environment differentiation of various ground objects in North, South, and Northwest China from 2017 to 2021. We found that the thermal condition index (TCI) in Northwest China decreased, whereas it increased in North and South China. In contrast, Moran's I index increased in Northwest and South China, with strong spatial agglomeration. The TCI for artificial surfaces decreased from North (0.633) to Northwest (0.554) and South China (0.384). The bare land TCI was always the lowest among the land use/land cover (LULC) types in each region. Our results reflect the LULC thermal environment of China against the background of new urbanization and provide theoretical support for scientific planning to improve the ecological environment.

TI  - Agricultural drought analysis and its association among land surface temperature, soil moisture and precipitation in Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia: a remote sensing approach
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a multifaceted natural hazard that has an impact on various aspects like; agricultural, hydrological, ecological and socio-economic systems. Drought has been a predominant concern for farmers in Gamo Zone over the last decades; hence, monitoring drought is important for soil conservation, water planning and management to mitigate impacts on agriculture in the Zone. The vegetation indices normal difference vegetation index and vegetation condition index are popular since they are based only on satellite images. The present study attempts to monitoring spatiotemporal distribution of agricultural droughts and its association with land surface temperature, precipitation and soil moisture from the period 2000-2020 using remote sensing application method in Gamo Zone. The vegetation condition index (VCI) and Normal difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to evaluate spatial and temporal distribution of agricultural drought in Gamo Zone. The Pearson correlation method was used to identify Normal difference vegetation index association with land surface temperature, soil moisture and precipitation. The results discovered that severe drought to very severe drought was identified in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2015 with the area coverage 39.7%, 28.8%, 33.4%, 24.5%, 61.3% and 23.0%, respectively. Similarly, the findings show that slight to mild droughts have a great chance of occurrence in Gamo Zone. The data also demonstrate that normal difference vegetation index has a strong relationship with land surface temperature (R = - 0.95), precipitation (R = 0.65) and soil moisture (R = 0.85), indicating that normal difference vegetation index is more sensitive to land surface temperature than soil moisture and precipitation, although soil moisture has a positive relationship with precipitation (R = 0.60). Therefore, this study revealed that normal difference vegetation index and vegetation condition index indices are suitable for agricultural drought monitoring and they are strongly associated with precipitation, soil moisture and land surface temperature. This study shall be helpful for decision makers to take the necessary measures by considering the drought risk maps for early warning system and future drought management plans.

TI  - Bioacoustics as Forms of Resistance: Growing Mycelium Instruments and Mushroom Communication in a High-Tech City-State
T2  - EAST ASIAN SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Singapore-based experimental band The Observatory ((sic)(sic)(sic)??) recently showcased their bio-sonification exhibition at Singapore Art Museum: REFUSE (14 January-17 April 2022). Set against imagery of manicured gardens in a celebration of organic growth and decomposition, REFUSE is a critical pun. First, REFUSE means to reject the current anthropocentric worldview in a time of ecological crises, and secondly it embraces inter-media arts that fuse recycled instruments with bio-sounds. Instruments were either the platform to grow mushrooms onto, or even themselves fully bio-fabricated by mushrooms - including a fully playable lap steel mycelium guitar that is simultaneously played by a mushroom. To amaze the audience further, these instruments were all wired to vibrate, their rhythms controlled by a growing mycelium whose organic growth is visually mapped and translated into signals that trigger the vibration. As the humidity and density of the mushroom jar changes, the sounds also vary, each sound unique even during the same day. As Obervatory band-member Yuen Chee Wai (?(sic)?) told En-Chieh Chiao of our cover-image curating team when describing the mycelium's sounds, "They play like a decomposing composition. " The cover team chose this exhibition because it speaks to a research note and to an article in this issue that respectively address the issue of noise control and aging in Singapore. While the city-state endeavors to contain both noise and health in old age as parts of governance, here the artists renounce control over sound and let biological non-human actors set the course of subtle sensory experiences.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Through China Influenza Surveillance Information System - China, December 1, 2022 to February 12, 2023
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed using influenza surveillance systems to carry out coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance due to the similarity between the two diseases in some respiratory symptoms. To assess the prevalence of COVID-19, we analyzed the influenza -like illness (ILI) and positive rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detections in ILI patients reported to the influenza Surveillance Information System (CNISIS) since late 2022.Methods: Data related to ILI were reported by national surveillance sentinel hospitals. Positive testing for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses was conducted using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection by the national influenza surveillance network laboratories. Surveillance data were reported to CNISIS.Results: Beginning on December 12, 2022 (Week 50), the ILI percentage increased dramatically, peaking in Week 51 at 12.1%. Subsequently, the ILI percentage began to decline rapidly from Week 52, 2022, and by Week 6, 2023 (February 6-12), the ILI and ILI percentage had returned to the levels observed at the beginning of December 2022. From December 1, 2022 to February 12, 2023, 115,844 specimens were tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. Of these, 30,381 (26.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1,763 (1.5%) were positive for influenza virus. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 tests peaked at 74.1% around December 23 and 25. Conclusions: Sentinel-based surveillance, previ- ously established for influenza, is an effective way to track the circulation trend of SARS-CoV-2 during community-level epidemics. There was no co -prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, even during the winter influenza season. However, it is important to remain vigilant for the potential rise of influenza activities following the COVID-19 epidemic.

TI  - The relationship between fire severity and burning efficiency for estimating wildfire emissions in Mediterranean forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are exposed to changing climatic conditions reflected by increasing drought and heat waves that increase the risk of wildfire ignition and spread. Climatic variables such as rain and wind as well as vegetation structure, land configuration and forest management practices are all factors that determine the burning potential of wildfires. The assessment of emissions released by vegetation combustion is essential for determining greenhouse gases and air pollutants. The estimation of wildfire-related emissions depends on factors such as the type and fraction of fuel (i.e., live biomass, ground litter, dead wood) consumed by the fire in a given area, termed the burning efficiency. Most approaches estimate live burning efficiency from optical remote sensing data. This study used a data-driven method to estimate live burning efficiency in a Mediterranean area. Burning severity estimations from Landsat imagery (dNBR), which relate to fuel consumption, and quantitative field data from three national forest inventory data were combined to establish the relationship between burning severity and live burning efficiency. Several proxies explored these relationships based on dNBR interval classes, as well as regression models. The correlation results between live burning efficiency and dNBR for conifers (R = 0.63) and broad-leaved vegetation (R = 0.95) indicated ways for improving emissions estimations. Median estimations by severity class (low, moderate-low, moderate-high, and high) are provided for conifers (0 .44 - 0.81) and broad-leaves (0.64 - 0.86), and regression models for the live fraction of the tree canopy susceptible to burning (< 2 cm, 2 - 7 cm, > 7 branches, and leaves). The live burning efficiency values by severity class were higher than previous studies.

TI  - Hospitality SMEs and the circular economy: strategies and practice post-COVID
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThis research evaluates specific circular economy issues in relation to the hospitality sector. This is investigated in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, considering the impact that the experiences of UK hospitality SMEs had on their circular economy activities. Viewed through a resource bricolage lens, for some this was a consequence of the challenges of the pandemic, while others were proactive in pursuing circular economy strategies.Design/methodology/approachA sequential mixed methods research design is established based on a pragmatic worldview. The first phase analyses secondary data from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) to evaluate circular economy aspects on hospitality businesses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 2 collects and analyses qualitative semi-structured interview data from directors of hospitality SMEs to investigate the experiences of businesses in this research context.FindingsResults point to a desire for hospitality SMEs to engage in circular economy activities, especially as a means of achieving financial efficiency, however this is sometimes constrained by increased costs. Resource bricolage theory underlines potential advantages for SMEs to engage with the local community to support circular economy activities and bring mutual benefits.Originality/valueThis research contributes to the under-researched topic of circular economy issues in hospitality SMEs. The focus on SMEs is significant as small businesses are more resource-constrained than larger businesses. The context of the post-COVID period is also notable due to changing attitudes towards circular economy aspects from the experiences of the pandemic.

TI  - A novel approach towards continuous monitoring of forest change dynamics in fragmented landscapes using time series Landsat imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions from forest ecosystems are greatly impacted by the acceleration of fragmentation and edge effects. Understanding these effects requires accurate monitoring of changes in fragmented forest landscapes. However, these changes are often low-intensity and small-scale, making it difficult to detect them using medium spatial resolution satellite images (e.g., Landsat). To address this challenge, this study developed the Pure Forest Index (PFI), which uses a combination of the existing vegetation index (VI) and spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to more effectively detect and characterize the contribution of forests to the observed spectral response of a pixel. The PFI was applied to detect forest changes in the Amazon rainforest from 1986 to 2020 using the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm (hereafter referred to as the CCDC-PFI algorithm). The results showed reliable performance in mapping forest changes, with an overall accuracy of 0.94 (+/- 0.03) at the spatial scale and a temporal accuracy of 91.1 % (within a two-year window). Comparison with other indices revealed that the PFI improves the ability to monitor forest dynamics with an increased overall accuracy of 0.02-0.35. The PFI also demonstrated advantages in enhancing sub-pixel forest information and suppressing non-forest backgrounds in various scenes compared to conventional VIs. The proposed approach is expected to benefit further research on forests and ecosystems.

TI  - Endoscopic fluorescent lymphography for gastric cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymphography by radioisotope or dye is a well-known technique for visualizing the lymphatic drainage pattern in a neoplastic lesion and it is in use in gastric cancer. Indocyanine green (ICG) more recently has been validated in fluorescent lymphography studies and is under evaluation as a novel tracer agent in gastric cancer. The amount and dilution of ICG injected as well as the site and the time of the injection are not standardized. In our unit, endoscopic submucosal injections of ICG are made as 0.5 mg in 0.5 mL at four peritumoral sites the day before surgery (for a total of 2.0 mg in 2.0 mL). Detection instruments for ICG fluorescence are evolving. Near-infrared systems integrated into laparoscopic or robotic instruments (near-infrared fluorescence imaging) have shown the most promising results. ICG fluorescence recognizes the node that receives lymphatic flow directly from a primary tumor. This is defined as the sentinel lymph node, and it has a high predictive negative value at the cT1 stage, able to reduce the extent of gastrectomy and lymph node dissection. ICG also enhances the number of lymph nodes detected during extended lymphadenectomy for advanced gastric cancer. Nevertheless, the practical effects of ICG use in a single patient are not yet clear. Standardization of the technique and further studies are needed before fluorescent lymphography can be used extensively worldwide. Until then, current guidelines recommend an extensive lymphadenectomy as the standard approach for gastric cancer with suspected metastasis.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy: an evidence-based review and recommendations for current practice
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at upfront surgery is the gold-standard surgical method for axillary lymph node staging in early stage breast cancer: the technique provides adequate information regarding axillary status, with similar oncological safety and lower morbidity compared to axillary dissection, despite the false negative rates. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), traditionally used for locally advanced breast cancer, plays an important role in the treatment of early stage breast cancer, making downstaging possible in axillary lymph node and breast cancer, thus minimizing the impact of surgery and reducing morbidity, as well as enabling patients with residual disease to be selected for adjuvant treatment. In this respect, the role of SLNB has proved controversial, particularly in view of the lack of data from randomized clinical trials on this subject. Currently, the de-escalation of axillary surgery after NACT is mainly based on retrospectives studies and false negative rates. This paper reviews current evidence on the management of axillary surgery following NACT under different circumstances, with suggested recommendations in each scenario: clinically negative nodes at diagnosis and SLNB after NACT, clinically positive nodes at diagnosis and SLNB after NACT, positive SLNB following NACT and finally the possibility of omitting axillary surgery in good responders.

TI  - Crop type classification with combined spectral, texture, and radar features of time-series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping visualizes the spatial distribution pattern and proportion of planting areas of different crop types, which is the basis for subsequent agricultural applications. Although optical remote sensing has been widely used to monitor crop dynamics, data are not always available due to cloud and other atmospheric effects on optical sensors. Satellite microwave systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have all-time and all-weather advantages in monitoring ground and crop conditions, combining optical imagery and SAR imagery for crop type classification is of great significance. Our study mainly proposes seven feature combination schemes based on the combination of multi-temporal spectral features and texture features of Sentinel-2 (S2), and radar backscattering features of Sentinel-1 (S1) evaluate the influence of different data sources and different features on classification accuracy, obtains the optimal classification strategy and analyses the contribution of different features to classification result, in the aim of providing a new technical approach for the fine identification of crops from multi-source remote-sensing data. Results show that the crop classification accuracy of combined multi-time series spectral, texture, and radar features is higher than that of combining two types of features. The features subset selected by multi-period spectral, texture, and radar features have the best classification result, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficients reach 96.40% and 0.93, respectively. The study provides a method reference for future research on larger-scale remote-sensing crop precise extraction.

TI  - Beyond Sentinel Lymph Node: Outcomes of Indocyanine Green-Guided Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Endometrial and Cervical Cancer.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Multicenter Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to compare the number of lymph nodes removed during indocyanine green (ICG)-guided laparoscopic/robotic pelvic lymphadenectomy with standard systematic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer (EC) and cervical cancer (CC).METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective comparative study (Clinical Trial ID: NCT04246580; updated on 31 January 2023). Women affected by EC and CC who underwent laparoscopic/robotic systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy, with (cases) or without (controls) the use of ICG tracer injection within the uterine cervix, were included in the study.RESULTS: The two groups were homogeneous for age (p = 0.08), Body Mass Index, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages (p = 0.41 for EC; p = 0.17 for CC), median estimated blood loss (p = 0.76), median operative time (p = 0.59), and perioperative complications (p = 0.66). Nevertheless, the number of lymph nodes retrieved during surgery was significantly higher (p = 0.005) in the ICG group (n = 18) compared with controls (n = 16).CONCLUSIONS: The accurate and precise dissection achieved with the use of the ICG-guided procedure was associated with a higher number of lymph nodes removed in the case of systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy for EC and CC.

TI  - Foredune defending role: Vulnerability and potential risk through combined satellite and hydrodynamics approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents an approach to assessing potential risks for coastal areas, where the foredune acts as the first and main line of defense against storm surges. The local correction technique for satellite data via morphodynamics and hydrodynamics features, applicable for the southern part of the Baltic Sea was developed. The proposed combination of regionally adapted height of the wave run-up and the surge height made it possible to clarify the width of the beach through ana-lyzing ESA Sentinel-2a satellite images. Using digitized shorelines from ESA Sentinel-2a imagery as a reference, together with the results of modeling the near-hydrodynamic conditions, a study of the beach width dynamics between measurements was performed. This is due to the regularity of satellite data being affected by cloud cover and the period of circulation. Identifying hot spots on the shore made it possible to establish areas with a significant excess in the repeatability of small dry beach width and, correspondingly, the erosion rate. The hot spots were detected within the Curonian Spit protective dune ridge, identifying the vulnerable areas, which are able to serve as breach points to flooding. The hydrological analysis of the flood zones under storms of varying frequency was performed, and predictions were made regarding the regional sea level rise by BACC and Team (2015) regional climate analysis. The work shows the possibilities of combining hydrodynamic and hydrological modeling, satellite observations into a single forecasting and as-sessment system, which allows to analyze and model risks of various origins. The results obtained can significantly improve the existing models or become the background for the integrated coastal zone management system, especially in protected natural areas.

TI  - Inter-Calibration of Geostationary Imager Infrared Bands Using a Hyperspectral Sounder on the Same Platform
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary (GEO) imager Infrared (IR) bands are often intercalibrated with hyperspectral IR sounders onboard low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Due to viewing geometry and time differences between GEO and LEO, the inter-calibration is limited to certain viewing angles and times. When a GEO hyperspectral IR sounder and GEO imager are on the same platform, the inter-calibration can be conducted from all angles and at all times. In this study, the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) is used to inter-calibrate the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI), both onboard FengYun-4A. Radiance inter-comparisons between GIIRS and AGRI under homogeneous scenes, including both clear and cloudy situations, indicate that the differences are within 1 K. The differences have obvious dependence on scene radiance, less dependence on the cloudy situation, and the local zenith angle when it is less than 70 degrees. However, they exhibit significant diurnal characteristics.

TI  - Pantropical distribution of zinc in green turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>): marine vertebrates as sentiel species
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution is one of the biggest threats to marine life and trace elements are among the most toxic pollutants in this environment. Zn is an essential trace element for biota but becomes toxic at high concentrations. Sea turtles are good bioindicators of trace element pollution, due to their longevity and cosmopolitan distribution that allow bioaccumulation for years in their tissues. Determining and comparing Zn concentrations in sea turtles from faraway places is relevant for conservation due to the lack of knowledge of geographically broader distribution patterns of Zn in vertebrates. In this study, comparative analyses of bioaccumulation in the liver, kidney, and muscles of 35 C. mydas from Brazil, Hawaii, the USA (Texas), Japan, and Australia of statistically equal sizes were performed. Zn was found in all specimens, with the highest levels in the liver and kidneys. Specimens from Australia (30.58 mu g g(-1)), Hawaii (31.91 mu g g(-1)), Japan (29.99 mu g g(-1)), and the USA (33.79 mu g g(-1)) showed statistically equal means in the liver. Kidney levels were the same in Japan (35.09 mu g g(-1)) and the USA (37.29 mu g g(-1)) and the same in Australia (23.06 mu g g(-1)) and Hawaii (23.31 mu g/g). Specimens from Brazil had the lowest means in both organs (12.17 mu g g(-1) in the liver and 9.39 mu g g(-1) in the kidney). The pattern of equal Zn values for most specimens in the liver is an important finding, demonstrating that there are pantropical patterns in the distribution of this metal even in regions so far from each other. A possible explanation is due to the essential nature of this metal linked to metabolic regulation, in addition to the bioavailability for biological absorption in marine environments, such as RS in Brazil, with a lower standard bioavailability also found in other organisms. Therefore, factors such as metabolic regulation and bioavailability indicate that there is a pantropical distribution of Zn in marine biota and green turtles can be a useful model as a sentinel species.

TI  - The impacts of carbon trading policy on China?s low-carbon economy based on county-level perspectives
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of "carbon peak" and "carbon neutrality", the important role of Carbon Trading Policy (CTP) played in China's micro-level low-carbon economy cannot be ignored. However, discussions on the CTP's impacts on China's county-level low-carbon economic quality are insufficient due to limited data availability. Hence, this paper estimated the quality of China's county-level quality of low-carbon economy based on satellite data during 2006-2018. In particular, the quality of low-carbon economy was evaluated by the ratio of low-carbon GDP to real GDP, which considers forest carbon sinks, CO2 emissions and real gross domestic product revised by the nighttime light data. Subsequently, this study examined how CTP affected China's county-level low-carbon economy using difference-in-difference-in difference (DDD) method. The results show that (1) CTP significantly improved the quality of low-carbon economy in county-level regions with high proportion of high -emissions energy consumption or secondary industry's output; (2) mechanism analysis shows that administrative intervention currently promoted the quality of low-carbon economy, while the market mechanism had lagged and positive effects; and (3) the ratio of forest land cover to total land cover and technological progress were also significant channels for CTP to improve the quality of low-carbon economy.

TI  - Study on the influence of mining disturbance on the variation characteristics of vegetation index: A case study of Lingwu Mining Area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation growth environment has been seriously affected by the high-intensity mining of coal resources in ecologically fragile mining areas in the Western China. To understand the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of vegetation index in mining area is the precondition of exploring the protective mining methods of surface vegetation. Based on the Landsat-8OLI and Sentinel-2A remote sensing image data from 2016 to 2020, the SBAS-InSAR technology and Arcgis spatial anal-ysis tool were employed in this study; the spatial-temporal evolution of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) was analyzed from the mining area scale by regression slope and correlation coefficient. The 10 mm subsidence contour range on the typical working face was extracted as the mining disturbance range. At the scale of the working face, the influence law of mining technical parameters and occurrence conditions on surface vegetation index was revealed. The results show that: (1) Lingwu mining area has relatively low surface vegetation coverage, which conforms to the partial normal distribution; the average NDVI in the southwest of the mining area is greater than that in the northeast. (2) The vegetation growth process in the mining area presents a phenological pe-riodic variation trend, and mining activities have a certain negative impact on the growth of surface vegetation. However, after regional vegetation restoration, the NDVI in the mining area shows a fluctuating growth trend. (3) In the pre-mining stage of the working face, the NDVI change trend of vegetation in the mining area is basically the same; in the mining stage of the working face, the mining influence is relatively small due to the lagging effect of mining subsidence; in the post-mining stage (1-2 years after mining), the growth of vegetation is seriously damaged, and NDVI of the mining area decreases significantly. (4) The mining area of working face is positively correlated with the decline scope of NDVI; the ratio of mining depth to mining thickness and bedrock thickness are negatively related to surface subsidence, which slows down the decline of NDVI; the loose layer on the surface has large thickness, which can also effectively slow down the destruction of vegetation in the subsidence area. The research results are of great significance for further understanding the influence of coal mining on surface vegetation elements in ecologically fragile mining areas in Northwest China.

TI  - Neural networks to retrieve in water constituents applied to radiative transfer models simulating coastal water conditions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of chlorophyll (CHL) using ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) signals in coastal waters is difficult due to the presence of two other constituents altering the light signal: coloured dissolved organic material (CDOM) and mineral suspended sediments (MSS). Artificial neural networks (NNs) have the capacity to deal with signal complexity and are a potential solution to the problem. Here NNs are developed to operate on two datasets replicating MODIS Aqua bands simulated using Hydrolight 5.2. Artificial noise is added to the simulated signal to improve realism. Both datasets use the same ranges of in water constituent concentrations, and differ by the type of logarithmic concentration distributions. The first uses a Gaussian distribution to simulate samples from natural water conditions. The second uses a flat distribution and is intended to allow exploration of the impact of undersampling extremes at both high and low concentrations in the Gaussian distribution. The impact of the concentration distribution structure is assessed and no benefits were found by switching to a flat distribution. The normal distribution performs better because it reduces the number of low concentration samples that are relatively difficult to resolve against varying concentrations of other constituents. In this simulated environment NNs have the capacity to estimate CHL with outstanding performance compared to real in situ algorithms, except for low values when other constituents dominate the light signal in coastal waters. CDOM and MSS can also be predicted with very high accuracies using NNs. It is found that simultaneous retrieval of all three constituents using multitask learning (MTL) does not provide any advantage over single parameter retrievals. Finally it is found that increasing the number of wavebands generally improves NN performance, though there appear to be diminishing returns beyond & SIM;8 bands. It is also shown that a smaller number of carefully selected bands performs better than a uniformly distributed band set of the same size. These results provide useful insight into future performance for NNs using hyperspectral satellite sensors and highlight specific wavebands benefits.

TI  - Midwinter Dry Spells Amplify Post-Fire Snowpack Decline
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing wildfire and declining snowpacks in mountain regions threaten water availability. We combine satellite-based fire detections with snow seasonality classifications to examine fire activity in California's seasonal and ephemeral snow zones. We find a nearly tenfold increase in fire activity during 2020-2021 versus 2001-2019. Accumulation season broadband snow albedo declined 25%-71% at two burned sites (2021 and 2022) according to in-situ data relative to un-burned conditions, with greater declines associated with increased burn severity. By enhancing snowpack susceptibility to melt, both decreased snow albedo and canopy drove midwinter melt during a multi-week dry spell in 2022. Despite similar meteorological conditions in December-February 2013 and 2022-linked to persistent high pressure weather regimes-minimal melt occurred in 2013. Post-fire snowpack differences are confirmed with satellite measurements. With growing geographical overlap between wildfire and snow, our findings suggest California's snowpack is increasingly vulnerable to the compounding effects of dry spells and wildfire.

TI  - Global hourly, 5 km, all-sky land surface temperature data from 2011 to 2021 based on integrating geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a dominant role in the surface energy budget (SEB) and hydrological cycling. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is the primary method of estimating LST globally. However, cloud cover leaves numerous data gaps in satellite LST products, which seriously restricts their applications. Efforts have been made to produce gap-free LST products from polar-orbiting satellites (e.g., Terra and Aqua); however, satellite data from limited overpasses are not suitable for characterizing the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC), which is directly related to heat waves, plant water stress, and soil moisture. Considering the high temporal variability in LST and the importance of the DTC, we refined the SEB-based cloudy-sky LST recovery method by improving its feasibility and efficiency and produced a global hourly, 5 km, all-sky land surface temperature (GHA-LST) dataset from 2011 to 2021. The GHA-LST product was generated using TIR LST products from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Based on ground measurements at the 201 global sites from the Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD), Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), Fluxnet, AmeriFlux, Heihe River basin (HRB), and Tibetan Plateau (TP) networks, the overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the hourly GHA-LST product was 3.31 K, with a bias of -0.57 K and R2 of 0.95. Thus, this product was more accurate than the clear-sky CGLS and MODIS MYD21C1 LST samples. The RMSE value of the daily mean LST was 1.76 K. Validation results at individual sites indicate that the GHA-LST dataset has relatively larger RMSEs for high-elevation regions, which can be attributed to high surface heterogeneity and input data uncertainty. Temporal and spatial analyses suggested that GHA-LST has satisfactory spatiotemporal continuity and reasonable variation and matches the reference data well at hourly and daily scales. Furthermore, the regional comparison of GHA-LST with other gap-free hourly datasets (ERA5 and Global Land Data Assimilation System, GLDAS) demonstrated that GHA-LST can provide more spatial texture information. The monthly anomaly analysis suggests that GHA-LST couples well with global surface air temperature datasets and other LST datasets at daily mean and minimum temperature scales, whereas the maximum temperature and diurnal temperature range of LST and air temperature (AT) have different anomalous magnitudes. The GHA-LST dataset is the first global gap-free LST dataset at an hourly, 5 km scale with high accuracy, and it can be used to estimate global evapotranspiration, monitor extreme weather, and advance meteorological forecasting models.

TI  - Estimation of downwelling surface longwave radiation for all-weather skies from FengYun-4A geostationary satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) is the latest generation of China's geostationary satellite. The Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard FY-4A can provide high-precision, high-frequency observation data, which makes a new possibility for estimating the downwelling surface longwave radiation (DSLR) with high spatial and temporal resolution. This work presents a new method for estimating DSLRs under all-sky conditions using a genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) algorithm based on brightness temperature (BT) from the FY-4A AGRI infrared channels and near-surface air temperature and dew point temperature from ERA5 reanalysis data. Based on the verification results of two independent observation sites, it is shown that the bias and RMSE are - 4.31 W/m(2) and 35.28 W/m(2), respectively. Compared the CERES SYN all-sky DSLR product with the DSLR estimated by the new method, the bias and RMSE are 0.86 W/m(2) and 26.87 W/m(2), respectively, and the new method has a higher spatial resolution (4 km), which can display more details of spatial variation.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of cropland in the Sanjiang Plain from 2014 to 2020 based on annual 30 m crop data layers
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The land cover of the Sanjiang Plain has changed dramatically since the 1950s. Although previous studies have analysed its spatiotemporal dynamics at long time intervals, a near real-time and accurate representation of the interannual evolution of cropping patterns in this region is of far-reaching importance for rationally allocating agricultural resources and ensuring food security. Based on the 30 m and 10 m land cover datasets in 2015 and 2017-2019, the current study used Landsat-8 satellite data in 2014, 2016 and 2020 to identify paddy rice and dryland crops using a decision tree classification approach and constructed the annual cropland datasets of the Sanjiang Plain from 2014 to 2020. The results show that the overall classification accuracies of crop datasets exceeded 95%, and the Kappa coefficients were higher than 0.92. The average annual accuracies of users and producers were 93% and 94% for rice fields and 97% and 95% for dryland crops, respectively. During the 7 years, the total area of paddy fields and dryland crops decreased by 5% and 8%. However, with minor positive and negative variation between years. 24.2% of paddy rice and 42% of dryland crops has been cultivated under 4 years. The centres of gravity for both crops mainly aggregated in the central counties with the migration direction and magnitude varying interannually. The current study emphasizes the importance of establishing annual high-resolution crop datasets to track the detailed spatio-temporal trajectories of cropping patterns that are essential to support sustainable cropland management and agricultural development.

TI  - Long-term sentinel surveillance of enteroviruses in Gwangju, South Korea, 2011-2020
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human enteroviruses (EVs) are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases. To understand EV epidemiology, we present longitudinal data reflecting changing EV prevalence patterns in South Korea. We collected 7160 specimens from patients with suspected EV infections in ten hospitals in Gwangju, Korea during 2011-2020. RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using EV-specific probes and primers were performed. EV genotyping and phylogenetic analysis were performed; EVs were detected in 3076 samples (43.0%), and the annual EV detection rate varied. EV infection rates did not differ with sex, and children aged <= 4 years were the most prone to EV infection; this trend did not change over time. Overall, 35 different EV types belonging to four distinctive species and rhinoviruses were identified. Although serotype distribution changed annually, the most frequently observed EVs were EV-A71 (13.1% of the cases), CVA6 (8.3%), CVB5 (7.6%), CVA16 (7.6%), CVA10 (7.5%), E18 (7.5%), E30 (7.0%), and E11 (5.0%) during 2011-2020. The predominant EV genotypes by clinical manifestation were CVB5 for aseptic meningitis; EV-A71 for hand, foot, and mouth disease cases; and CVA10 for herpangina. These results will aid the development of vaccines against EV infection and allow comprehensive disease control.

TI  - An unmixing-based BRDF correction in spectral remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While extensive research addressed the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effect and ap-proaches to correct it, too few works have considered the influence of spectral mixture on the correction results.This work studies the BRDF effect in spectral data and presents an approach to correct its undesired impact, considering the likely presence of mixed pixels. We propose an unmixing-based semiempirical model, incorpo-rating endmembers' (EMs) fractions within the data correction.To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, we conducted experiments with laboratory and aerial hyperspectral image data. The outcomes from all experiments reveal vital insights into the influence of the spectral mixture on the BRDF correction accuracy. Nevertheless, the results clearly show that the accuracy of the corrected reflectance significantly improved using the proposed model for reducing the BRDF effect, regardless of the pixel's microtopography arrangement.Most importantly, a quantitative assessment of the difference in reflectance values within the overlapping region between two aerial images shows that the unmixing-based model outperforms the commonly used one.While the traditional method reduces the influence of the BRDF in the corrected data by a factor of two, with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximate to 2.5%, the proposed approach reduces it by a factor of four with an average MAE approximate to 1.2%.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundA multicenter, randomized controlled phase III trial was conducted on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and elective neck dissection for T1 (depth of invasion >= 4 mm)-T2N0M0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. This study identified factors associated with poor prognosis in patients who underwent SLNB based on a subgroup analysis of this trial.MethodsWe analyzed 418 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) from 132 patients who underwent SLNB. The metastatic SLNs were classified into three categories based on size-isolated tumor cells: < 0.2 mm, micrometastasis: >= 0.2 mm and < 2 mm, and macrometastasis: >= 2 mm. Three groups were formed based on the number of metastatic SLNs: no metastasis, 1 metastatic node, and >= 2 metastatic nodes. The size and number of metastatic SLNs on survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models.ResultsPatients with macrometastasis and >= 2 metastatic SLNs had worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after adjustment for potential confounders (HR for OS: macrometastasis, 4.85; 95% CI 1.34-17.60; >= 2 metastatic SLN, 3.63; 95% CI 1.02-12.89; HR for DFS: macrometastasis, 2.94; 95% CI 1.16-7.44; >= 2 metastatic SLN, 2.97; 95% CI 1.18-7.51).ConclusionsIn patients who underwent SLNB, a poorer prognosis was associated with macrometastasis or having >= 2 metastatic SLNs.

TI  - On-Orbit Absolute Radiometric Calibration and Uncertainty Analysis of OCM2 Sensor onboard Oceansat-2 Satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes On-Orbit absolute radiometric calibration for the Ocean Colour Monitor2 (OCM2) onboard Oceansat-2 satellite through a vicarious calibration experiment performed at the Great Rann of Kutch calibration site in Gujarat, India, in February 2022. To achieve accurate and consistent calibration for the OCM2 channels, a reflectance-based calibration method was used which relies on synchronous in-situ measurements of surface reflectance and atmospheric parameters at the time of satellite overpass. In this exercise, the 6 SV (Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vector) radiative transfer (RT) model was used to simulate the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance for the OCM2 channels. The on-orbit radiometric performance/changes were derived by comparing the 6 SV simulated TOA radiance with those of the OCM2 Level 1B (L1B) data product. The results indicate that the average gain for band 1 to band 8 was found in the range from 0.88 to 1.23 and the relative error from 1.58% to 18.79% for the OCM2 sensor. However, the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) between the OCM2 measured and the 6 SV simulated TOA radiance data range from 0.17 (mu W cm(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1)) at 443 nm to 2.04 (mu W cm(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1)) at 620 nm. Furthermore, we analysed in detail the various uncertainties in this approach emanating from surface reflectance, atmospheric conditions (ozone, water vapour and aerosol optical depth), aerosol-type assumption in the RT model, BRDF, and inherent accuracy of the 6 SV RT model. The overall uncertainty was within 6% estimated using the reflectance-based calibration method.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-a, TSM and salinity in mangrove dominated tropical estuarine areas of Hooghly River, North East Coast of Bay of Bengal, India using sentinel-3 data
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The study aims to assess variations in spatio-temporal characteristics of water quality parameters from three tropical estuaries, namely Muri-Ganga, Saptamukhi, and Hooghly, in the western portion of the Indian Sundarbans. Reliable retrieval of near-surface concentration of water quality parameters such as Chlorophyll-a, SST & TSM from diverse aquatic ecosystems with broad ranges of tropical requirements has always remained a complex issue. In this study, application of Case 2 Regional Colour Correction (C2RCC) processor has been tested for its accuracy across different bio-optical regimes in both inland and coastal waters. Satellite images for the same period were also collected and analysed using the C2RCC processing sequence to retrieve parameters like the depth of water, surface reflectance, water temperature, inherent optical properties (IOPs), chlorophyll-a, salinity, total suspended matter (TSM), etc., using the SNAP software. In situ sampling from specific locations within these estuaries and water quality analysis were conducted for the period 2017-2019. The OLCI retrieved datasets were compared and corroborated with field survey datasets. It was observed that the highest amount of TSM was recorded at Diamond Harbour during the 2018 pre-monsoon season (301.40 mg/L field-based value and 308.54 mg/L estimated value). Similarly, chlorophyll-a had higher concentrations throughout the monsoon season (3.03 mg m(-3), (field survey), and 2.96 mg m(-3), (estimated) at Fraserganj and Sagar south points. A very good correlation was observed for all seasons for Chl-a (r = 0.829) and TSM (r = 0.924) between the OLCI data and in situ measurements. Higher correlation and significant 'r' values highlight the importance of having both field-based as well as remotely-sensed information in understanding any dynamic system in a sustained manner. Results also confirm that the water quality model using OLCI Chl-a and TSM products outperforms conventional techniques. The study demonstrates the efficacy of using Sentinel 3 OCLI data for shallow marine and estuarine remote sensing applications, especially for monitoring TSM and Chl-a concentrations.

T2  - ACTA CYTOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has been increasingly performed for patients with lymph node (LN)-positive (cN1) breast cancer that converted to LN-negative (ycN0) status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This study aimed to clarify the SNB avoidance rates using fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for mLNs after NAC.Methods: This study included 68 patients with cN1 breast cancer undergoing NAC from April 2019 to August 2021. Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic clip-marked LNs (clipped LNs) underwent eight cycles of NAC. Ultrasonography (US) was performed to evaluate the effect of the treatment on the clipped LNs, and FNAC was performed after NAC. Patients with ycN0 status determined using FNAC underwent SNB. Those with positive results for FNAC or SNB underwent axillary LNs dissection. Histopathology results and FNA were compared for clipped LNs after NAC.Results: Of the 68 cases, 53 were ycN0 and 15 were clinically positive LNs after NAC( ycN1) on US. Further, 13% (7/53) of all ycN0 and 60% (9/15) of all ycN1 cases showed residual metastasis in the LNs on FNAC.Conclusion: FNAC was diagnostically useful for patients with ycN0 status on US imaging. Using FNAC for LNs after NAC helped to avoid unnecessary SNB in 13% of the cases.

TI  - Structurally-controlled Gold Mineralization in the Southern Zuru Schist Belt NW Nigeria: Application of Remote Sensing and Geophysical Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant number of gold occurrences are hosted by hydrothermal alteration zones in the Zuru Schist Belt, Northwestern Nigeria. The aim of this study is to identify the spatial correlation between faults, sheared, hy-drothermally altered zones, and gold mineralized areas using geophysical and remote sensing data. The main structural trends of the schist belt as interpreted from the application of total gradient amplitude and local wavenumber techniques on the aeromagnetic data are in the E-W and NE-SW directions. These trends align with the locations of gold mineralization and key pathfinders such as faults in the Anka-Yauri-Iseyin shear zone. In the radiometric data, magnetic faults occurred in areas with elevated potassium enrichment within the Anka-Yauri-Iseyin shear zone and present evidence for structurally controlled hydrothermal processes. The mapped Anka-Yauri-Iseyin shear zone from the aeromagnetic data further coincides with morphological features such as ridges, valleys, and highlands, signifying that the shear zone is represented by topographical linear indicators. Importantly, the integrated approach and results presented in this work show that the Southern Zuru Schist Belt is fragmented by a NE-SW oriented AYI shear complex. Faults and hydrothermally altered zones in the AYI shear complex are new target areas for direct exploration of gold in the study area.

TI  - Canadian climate change attitudes and energy policy
T2  - CANADIAN REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SOCIOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper uses original Canadian survey data to compare support for and opposition to five energy-related climate policies. Results show that Canadians were very concerned about climate change and supportive of the policies. Variation in support and opposition was investigated using logistic regression. We tested models that associate climate policy support with a combination of one's ecological worldview, climate change attitudes, personal capabilities, contextual influences, and ascription of responsibility to take action on climate change, applying elements of Stern's (2000) theory of environmentally-significant behaviour and Patchen's (2010) model of climate change behaviour. We found that the more abstract policies attracted a different set of predictors than the more concrete policies. Females and parents showed increased support for the more abstract policies. Having an ecological worldview was a significant predictor of support for all policies but was obscured by other factors in a combined model.Cet article utilise des donnees d'enquete canadiennes originales pour comparer le soutien et l'opposition a cinq politiques climatiques liees a l'energie. Les resultats montrent que les Canadiens etaient tres preoccupes par le changement climatique et appuyaient les politiques. La variation du soutien et de l'opposition a ete etudiee a l'aide de la regression logistique. Nous avons teste des modeles qui associent le soutien a la politique climatique a une combinaison de vision du monde ecologique, d'attitudes face au changement climatique, de capacites personnelles, d'influences contextuelles et d'attribution de la responsabilite d'agir sur le changement climatique, en appliquant des elements de la theorie de Stern (2000) sur le comportement significatif pour l'environnement et le modele de comportement face au changement climatique de Patchen (2010). Nous avons constate que les politiques plus abstraites attiraient un ensemble different de predicteurs que les politiques plus concretes. Les femmes et les parents ont montre un soutien accru pour les politiques plus abstraites. Avoir une vision du monde ecologique etait un predicteur significatif du soutien a toutes les politiques, mais etait obscurci par d'autres facteurs dans un modele combine.

TI  - Effects of joint assimilation of FY-4A AGRI and ground-based microwave radiometer on heavy rainfall prediction
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the latest generation of Chinese Geostationary Weather Satellites, Fengyun-4 carries the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI), which has more spectral bands and higher temporal and spatial resolution than the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard geostationary satellite FY-2. Direct assimilation of the FY-4A AGRI datasets has been proved to be an efficient way to improve heavy rainfall simulation. We aim to assess the joint assimilation of AGRI infrared radiance and ground-based MWR (Microwave Radiometer) data on short-duration heavy rainfall prediction. RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder) is used as the observational operator for FY-4A AGRI data assimilation. The data assimilation interface is built in WRFDA 4.3 to achieve direct assimilation of FY4A AGRI radiance. The forecasting effectiveness of the joint assimilation for a typical heavy rainfall event over northern China is analyzed with four simulation experiments. The main conclusions are: 1) Assimilating MWR data can improve the initial humidity condition in the middle-lower layers, while AGRI radiance assimilation favors the initial humidity correction in the middle-upper layers. The joint assimilation of two datasets can remarkably improve the initial humidity condition in the entire column. 2) Data assimilation effectively improves the 6-h accumulated rainfall simulation. The joint assimilation of AGRI radiance and MWR data is superior to assimilating either of them. The joint assimilation significantly improves the rainfall forecast over the Beijing area, where the seven MWRs are distributed. 3) Data assimilation experiments present similar effects on predicted and initial humidity conditions. The MWR_DA experiment (only assimilate MWR data) markedly improves the humidity forecast in the middle-lower layers, while AGRI_DA (only assimilate AGRI data) is effective in the middle-upper layers. The joint assimilation of AGRI radiance and MWR data could skillfully correct the humidity distribution in the entire layers, allowing for more accurate heavy rainfall prediction. This paper provides a valuable basis for further improving the application of FY-4A AGRI radiance in numerical weather models.

TI  - Monitoring COVID-19 and Influenza: The Added Value of a Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance System in Portugal
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES & MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) surveillance is recommended to assess the severity of respiratory infections disease. In 2021, the National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge, in collaboration with two general hospitals, implemented a SARI sentinel surveillance system based on electronic health registries. We describe its application in the 2021/2022 season and compare the evolution of SARI cases with the COVID-19 and influenza activity in two regions of Portugal. Methods. The main outcome of interest was the weekly incidence of patients hospitalized due to SARI, reported within the surveillance system. SARI cases were defined as patients containing ICD-10 codes for influenza-like illness, cardiovascular diagnosis, respiratory diagnosis, and respiratory infection in their primary admission diagnosis. Independent variables included weekly COVID-19 and influenza incidence in the North and Lisbon and Tagus Valley regions. Pearson and cross-correlations between SARI cases, COVID-19 incidence and influenza incidence were estimated. Results. A high correlation between SARI cases or hospitalizations due to respiratory infection and COVID-19 incidence was obtained (rho = 0.78 and rho = 0.82, respectively). SARI cases detected the COVID-19 epidemic peak a week earlier. A weak correlation was observed between SARI and influenza cases (rho = -0.20). However, if restricted to hospitalizations due to cardiovascular diagnosis, a moderate correlation was observed (rho = 0.37). Moreover, hospitalizations due to cardiovascular diagnosis detected the increase of influenza epidemic activity a week earlier. Conclusion. In the 2021/2022 season, the Portuguese SARI sentinel surveillance system pilot was able to early detect the COVID-19 epidemic peak and the increase of influenza activity. Although cardiovascular manifestations associated with influenza infection are known, more seasons of surveillance are needed, to confirm the potential use of cardiovascular hospitalizations as an indicator of influenza activity.

TI  - Simultaneous extracting area and quantity of agricultural greenhouses in large scale with deep learning method and high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouses are an important part of modern facility-based agriculture. While creating well-being for human society, greenhouses also bring negative impacts such as air pollution, soil pollution, and water pollution. Therefore, it is of great signiflcance to obtain information such as the area and quantity of greenhouses. It is still a challenging task to flnd a low-cost, high-efflciency, and easy-to-use method for the dual extraction of greenhouse area and quantity on a large scale. In this study, relatively easy-to-obtain high-resolution Google Earth remote sensing images are used as the experimental data source, and an area and quantity simultaneous extraction framework (AQSEF) is constructed to extract both the area and quantity of greenhouses. The AQSEF uses UNet and YOLO v5 series networks as core op-erators to complete model training and prediction, and main components such as SWP, OSW&NMS and GCA complete data postprocessing. To evaluate the feasibility of our method, we take Beijing, China, as the research area and select multiple accuracy evaluation indicators in the two branches for accuracy veriflcation. The results show that the mIoU, OA, Kappa, Recall and Precision with the best performance model in the area extraction branch can reach 0.931, 0.987, 0.867, 0.91 and 0.914, respectively. Additionally, the Recall, Precision, AP@0.5 and mAP@0.5: 0.95 values of the best performance model are 0.781, 0.891, 0.812 and 0.509, respectively, in the extraction of the quantity of greenhouses. Finally, in Beijing, the area covered by greenhouses is approximately 85.443 km2, and the quantity of greenhouses is approximately 155,464. With the proposed method, the time consumed for area extraction and quan-tity extraction is 6.73 h and 12.97 h, respectively. The experimental results show that AQSEF helps to overcome the spatiotemporal diversity of greenhouses and quickly and accurately map a high-spatial-resolution greenhouse distribu-tion product within the research area.

TI  - Interdecadal glacier inventories in the Karakoram since the 1990s
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal glacier inventories provide key information about the glaciers, their characteristics, and changes and are inevitable for glacier modelling and investigating geodetic mass changes. However, to date, no consistent multi-temporal glacier inventory for the whole of the Karakoram exists, negatively affecting the monitoring of spatio-temporal variations in glaciers' geometric parameters and their related applications. We used a semi-automatic method combining automatic segmentation and manual correction and produced a multi-temporal Karakoram glacier inventory (KGI) compiled from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI (Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager) images for the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s. Our assessments using independent multiple digitisation of 37 glaciers show that the KGI is sufficiently accurate, with an overall uncertainty of +/- 3.68 %. We also performed uncertainty evaluation for the contiguous glacier polygons using a buffer of half a pixel, which resulted in an average mapping uncertainty of +/- 5.21 %. We calculated more than 20 attributes for each glacier, including coordinates, area, supraglacial debris area, date information, and topographic parameters derived from the ASTER GDEM (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer global digital elevation model). According to KGI-2020s, approximately 10 500 alpine glaciers (> 0.01 km(2) each) cover an area of 22 510 +/- 828 km(2) of which 10.18 +/- 0.38 % (2290 +/- 84 km(2)) is covered by supraglacial debris. Over the past 3 decades, the glaciers experienced a loss of clean ice and/or snow area but a gain in supraglacial debris. Supraglacial debris cover has increased by 17.63 +/- 1.44 % (343.30 +/- 27.95 km(2)), while non-debris-covered glaciers decreased by 1.56 +/- 0.24 % (319.85 +/- 49.92 km(2)). The total glacier area was relatively stable and showed only a slight insignificant increase of 23.45 +/- 28.85 km(2) (0.10 +/- 0.13 %). The glacier area has declined by 3.27 +/- 0.24 % in the eastern Karakoram, while the glacier area slightly increased in central (0.65 +/- 0.10 %) and western Karakoram (1.26 +/- 0.11 %). Supraglacial debris has increased over the whole of Karakoram, especially in areas above 4200 m a.s.l. (above sea level), showing an upward shift. The glacier area changes were characterised by strong spatial heterogeneity, influenced by surging and advancing glaciers. However, due to global warming, the glaciers are on average retreating. This is in particular true for small and debris-free glaciers. The multi-temporal KGI data are available at the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center of China: https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.glacier.db2386.2022 (F. Xie et al., 2022).

TI  - Temporal stability and spatial dependency of pixel-specific red-NIR soil lines from multi-temporal satellite remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal stability and spatial dependence of pixel-specific red-NIR soil line coefficients were studied using analyses of geostatistics and covariance. We used time series of MODIS 8-day composite reflectance data from 2000 to 2019 of bare soil surfaces near Kabul, Afghanistan. The goal was to explore the feasibility of reducing the soil background signal in red-NIR vegetation indices (VIs). The results were that 1) Red-NIR pixel-specific soil line coefficients can be obtained using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery; 2) pixel-specific Red-NIR soil line coefficients derived from multi-temporal remote sensing imagery exhibit clear spatial dependency related to the soil line coefficients of soils sampled in the field, and 3) Red-NIR pixel-specific soil line coefficients were stable for years, but showed instability for periods longer than 16 years. These results imply that A) some changes in soil surface characteristics can be deduced using long-term observations, B) pixel-specific Red-NIR soil lines at any location can be estimated by kriging interpolation. Consequently, soil line coefficients derived from multi-temporal satellite observations can be used to derive information about vegetation, such as the germination stages pixel-by-pixel or above-ground biomass in sparsely vegetated lands. The derived values should be valid over wide areas, minimizing soil background effects.

TI  - Retrieval of soil salinity based on multi-source remote sensing data and differential transformation technology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate assessments of soil salinity information surrounding saline lakes are crucial for agricultural development and ecological security in arid regions. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is currently utilized to derive the relationship between environmental covariates and soil salinity to perform remote sensing inversion of regional soil salinity; however, there is still potential for improvement in the existing SVM algorithm. Therefore, this study aims to improve the remote sensing-based soil salinity content (SSC) extraction from the Landsat 8, DEM and HJ-1A CCD satellite data using the Cuckoo Search Algorithms-Support Vector Machines (CS-SVM) model. In addition, the correlation and principal component analysis were conducted to determine the principal components of environmental covariates. The results show that the differential transformation effectively separates the land and water, which helps to reduce the noise in the raw remote sensing image. The analysis of soil and vegetation factors shows that the first three principal components cumulative variance contributed 99.69% on the raw remote sensing image, while the first two principal components cumulative variance contributed 88.01% and 85.28% on the first- and second-order differential transformation remote sensing images, respectively. Interestingly, L-S2 is the only factor correlated with SSC in the third order differential transform remote sensing image, with the R value of 0.325. The slope direction and plane curvature under the topographic factors had negative correlations with SSC, with the R values of -0.521 and -0.325, respectively. Finally, the SSC inversion model was developed using the first order differential transformation remote sensing images, which has high accuracy and good stability (R-2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 3.80 g(-1)). The cuckoo algorithm is helpful for determining the best support vector machine parameters and offers new perspectives in improving the reliability of remote sensing-based soil salinity inversion in arid regions.

TI  - Suitability of Sentinel-3 chlorophyll a products based on optical water types
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the suitability of water colour products for the reliability of subsequent applications, or improvements of the algorithm at later stages, is important. We used three types of water bodies: Type 1 (Southern Ocean and Qinghai Lake) clean oceanic water bodies dominated by chlorophyll and clean inland water bodies dominated by chlorophyll and coloured dissolved organic matter; Type 2 (Taihu Lake and Chagan Lake) turbid inland water bodies dominated by suspended matter and chlorophyll and Type 3 (Xiaoxingkai Lake and Daxingkai Lake) turbid inland water bodies dominated by suspended matter. The accuracies of two Chl a concentration products data for synchronous Sentinel-3 OLCI Neural Network (NN) and ocean colour 4 band ratio (OC4Me) algorithms were verified using two metrics combined with in situ data (to compare the applicability of Chl a concentration algorithms for the three types of water bodies). The optimal Chl-a concentration algorithm was selected to analyse the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of monthly concentrations of Chl a. Based on the analysis, (1) the NN algorithm had better applicability to Type 1 water bodies ; the NN algorithm had better applicability to Type 2 water bodies, ; and both algorithms had poor applicability to Type 3 water bodies, (2) Limitations: An overall low derivation value was obtained for the Sentinel-3 OLCI NN algorithm with water concentrations of Chl a, higher than 25 mg m(-3). The OC4Me Chl a concentration product only applies to the concentrations of Chl a in Type 2 during the summer. (3) When the Sentinel-3 OLCI Chl a concentration product was compared with the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and visible infrared imaging radiometer (VIIRS) Chl a concentration products, the distribution trends of the Chl a concentrations were consistent. Furthermore, the Sentinel-3 OLCI Chl a concentration product was more dominant in spatial resolution.

M3  - Article
AB  - There are several conceptions of man in the history of philosophy. However, two considerable tendencies are recurring throughout modern history. A human being can be perceived as a complex mechanism or as a living organism. The response to the query has essential consequences in different areas. The article aims to provide a view of humankind that builds upon an organic conception of life, nature, and human beings, especially as elaborated by A. N. Whitehead and some of his followers. The article also briefly examines the emergence and development of a mechanistic view. The historical overview exposes the close relationship between the worldview of a given era and the understanding of man. Finally, the article argues that the organic conceptions of life developed in the first half of the 20th century provide an essential alternative to mechanistic views and could help us to deal with several problems we are currently encountering.

TI  - Is global burned area declining due to cropland expansion? How much do we know based on remotely sensed data?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global extent of the amount of burned area seems to have changed substantially in the last two decades. Discussions regarding the main force behind the current trends have dominated research in recent years, with several studies attributing the global decline in wildfires to socio-economic and land-use changes. This review discusses the uncertainties and limitations of remotely sensed data used to determine global trends in burned areas and changes in their potential drivers. In particular, we quantify changes in the amount of burned area and cropland area and illustrate the lack of consistency in the direction and magnitude of the trend in cropland land cover type specifically within sub-Saharan Africa, the region where data show a strong trend in the amount of burned area. We state the limitations of remote-sensed fire and land cover products. We end by demonstrating that based on the currently available data and research methods applied in the literature, it is not possible to unequivocally determine that cropland expansion is the primary driver of the decline in fire activity.

TI  - Networking the forest infrastructure towards near real-time monitoring - A white paper
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Forests account for nearly 90 % of the world's terrestrial biomass in the form of carbon and they support 80 % of the global biodiversity. To understand the underlying forest dynamics, we need a long-term but also relatively high-frequency, networked monitoring system, as traditionally used in meteorology or hydrology. While there are numerous existing forest monitoring sites, particularly in temperate regions, the resulting data streams are rarely connected and do not provide information promptly, which hampers real-time assessments of forest responses to extreme climate events.The technology to build a better global forest monitoring network now exists. This white paper addresses the key structural components needed to achieve a novel meta-network.We propose to complement - rather than replace or unify - the existing heterogeneous infrastructure with standardized, quality-assured linking methods and interacting data processing centers to create an integrated forest monitoring network.These automated (research topic-dependent) linking methods in atmosphere, biosphere, and pedosphere play a key role in scaling site-specific results and processing them in a timely manner. To ensure broad participation from existing monitoring sites and to establish new sites, these linking methods must be as informative, reliable, affordable, and maintainable as possible, and should be supplemented by near real-time remote sensing data.The proposed novel meta-network will enable the detection of emergent patterns that would not be visible from isolated analyses of individual sites. In addition, the near real-time availability of data will facilitate predictions of current forest conditions (nowcasts), which are urgently needed for research and decision making in the face of rapid climate change. We call for international and interdisciplinary efforts in this direction.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater potential zones for urban development site suitability analysis in Srivaikundam region, Thoothukudi district, South India
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - To demarcate groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) for the Srivaikundam region in Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu, India, an effort was made in this study to locate the subsurface basin for groundwater storage and to identify the suitable destination for the urban development, agricultural, and drinking needs. This study using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) with analytical hierarchy process (AHP). According to their respective importance for groundwater occurrence, Saaty's scale was appropriately weighted to give the thematic layers and their attributes. The selected thematic maps were then merged using the weighted linear combination method to produce the final groundwater potential zone map after the layers' assigned weights and their features had been standardized using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and eigenvector approach. Based on Saaty's 9-point scale, each criterion or factor was given the proper weight, and the weights were then normalized using the analytic hierarchy approach (AHP). To create the groundwater potential prediction map for the research area, the method was incorporated into the GIS environment. For the purpose of identifying potential urban residential development sites, the generated GWPZ is combined with eight different thematic layers. Groundwater conditions have been used to define GIS analysis criteria, and each information layer has been assigned an appropriate rank and weightage. Finally, groundwater recharge zones have been selected and classified into low, medium, and high based on cumulative weighted value. The moderate groundwater potential zone covers the majority of the land, with areas of very low 0.5 km2 (0.1%), low 112.3 km2 (17.7%), medium 428.7 km2 (67.6%), high 87.8 km2 (13.8%), and very high 5.1 km2 (0.8%) accordingly. Furthermore, higher groundwater yields are estimated in medium to good zones, indicating greater potentiality of groundwater sources.

TI  - Typhoon-induced destruction and reconstruction of the coastal current system on the inner shelf of East China Sea
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons frequently occur in the East China Sea, which significantly affect the material transport, marine hydrodynamics, and sedimentary environment of coastal currents in a relatively short time scale. Based on the in -situ observation and satellite remote sensing data, this paper analyzes the influence of five typhoons on the coastal currents of East China Sea in 2019 during different seasons. The typhoons Lekima and Mitag, which passed directly, greatly influenced the coastal current, resulting in the disappearance of the tide signal, and stimulated the current to generate new periodic signals of 3-6 days and 1-3 days, respectively. Typically, the wind of Lekima changed the flow field of the East China Sea Coastal Current (ECSCC) from northeastward to southwestward in summer in a short period, and the southwestward volume transport of the ocean current was 4 times that during periods without typhoon occurrence. The remaining water levels of the Haimen, Jiantao, and Damutu tidal level stations showed maximum water level increases during the observation period, whose values were 1.89, 1.26, and 0.90 m, respectively. Mitag only caused a northeastward current transport during autumn, and the water levels of tidal level stations along the coast increased by more than 0.5 m. However, weak and distant typhoons (Danas, Lingling, and Tapah) caused relatively small changes in ocean currents, along with the corresponding change in water transport and deposition. The results show that local wind accompanying typhoons is the main factor affecting the evolution (destruction and reconstruction) of the coastal current system. Therefore, the evolution of the ECSCC under different typhoons can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of typhoons with different paths and intensities on the coastal current.

TI  - PATMOS-x Version 6.0: 40 Years of Merged AVHRR and HIRS Global Cloud Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new version of the PATMOS-x multidecadal cloud record, version 6.0, has been produced and is available from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. A description of the processes and methods used for generating the dataset are presented, with a focus on the differences between version 6.0 and the previous version of PATMOS-x, version 5.3. The new version appears both to be more stable, with less intersatellite variability, and to have more consistent polar cloud detection, phase distribution, and cloud-top height distribution when compared against the MODIS EOS record. Improvements in consistency and performance are attributed to the addition of multidimensional variables for cloud detection, constraining cloud retrievals to radiometric bands available throughout the record, and the addition of data from the HIRS instrument. Significance StatementThe PATMOS-x project produces multidecadal cloudiness records from polar-orbiting satellites. Version 6.0 combines imager and sounder data from 15 satellites and shows significant improvements in accuracy and stability.

TI  - Improving spatial and temporal variation of ammonia emissions for the Netherlands using livestock housing information and a Sentinel-2-derived crop map
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia emissions to the atmosphere have a range of negative impacts on environmental quality, human health, and biodiversity. Despite the considerable efforts in quantifying spatially explicit ammonia emissions, there are significant uncertainties in ammonia emission estimates at regional scales. We aimed to improve the modeling of atmospheric ammonia emission variability in space and time across the Netherlands by updating an agricultural ammonia emission model with a newly derived high-resolution crop map and a livestock housing location database of the Netherlands. To generate a crop map of 12 agricultural land cover classes, we applied random forest classification to the multi-temporal multispectral observations of surface reflectance and vege-tation indices derived from Sentinel-2. The crop statistics were used to calculate ammonia emission distribution based on nitrogen demand (manure and mineral fertilizer needed) of different crop types using the INTEGRATOR model. Next, the crop map was utilized to spatially allocate the ammonia emissions to a high-resolution grid across the Netherlands. In addition, ammonia emissions from livestock housing systems were introduced as point sources using location data from the Geographic Information Agricultural Business system. The temporal emission variability was updated using a recently developed TIMELINES module. After the spatial and temporal distribution of ammonia emission was obtained with the crop map and housing information, it was imported into the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to model ammonia surface concentration for validation with in situ measurements.The performed crop classification has an average accuracy score of 0.73. The derived crop map was compared with Dutch national statistics, and the results showed that the absolute median of the relative difference between Sentinel-2 derived crop areas and national statistical information is around 5%. The newly modeled ammonia monthly surface concentrations compared better with in situ measurements in terms of the magnitude and temporal variability than those derived from the original emission distribution, indicating that the temporal distribution of ammonia emissions was improved. The comparison of modeled and measured annual averaged surface concentrations illustrated that the spatial distribution of ammonia emission was also improved. All model performance indicators significantly improved, and the performance of the updated model was more stable and robust. The improvement was more evident at the stations where livestock housing is the main emission source. This study illustrates that apart from a satellite-derived crop map, information on the locations of animal housing systems also plays an essential role in better estimates of the spatial and temporal distribution of ammonia emissions. It can be worthwhile to extrapolate the method to other regions in Europe and elsewhere.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of coastal ecosystems is of particular importance for sustainable development and environmental management. Remote sensing, using satellite imagery, can play an important role in these studies. In this study, changes of qualitative parameters in Gomishan wetland and Gorgan Bay located in the southeast of the Caspian Sea were investigated using Landsat images. Based on the results of the range of chlorophyll-a and water temperature changes in both ecosystems, there was an increasing trend. Evaluating of Secchi disk (transparency) ranges showed a decreasing trend until 2018. Also, among the studied years, 2009 has the lowest fluctuations. Overall, the findings of this study showed that changes in water quality parameters of Gorgan Bay and Gomishan wetland had been affected by ecological conditions and human activities such as industrial-domestic and agricultural effluents. Also, satellite data in such coastal ecosystems at different time intervals have valuable results and can be given special attention for the study of similar ecosystems.

TI  - Snow avalanche susceptibility mapping from tree-based machine learning approaches in ungauged or poorly-gauged regions
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping avalanche susceptibility is essential for disaster management, especially in ungauged or poorly-gauged regions. Most existing machine-learning methods have a shortfall in multi-source, heterogeneous spatial data requirements and overfitting. Faced with these deficiencies, this study has developed four novel tree-based machine-learning models (Catboost, LightGBM, RF, and XGBoost) to predict avalanche susceptibility, along with the data support of remote sensing images (e.g., Superview-1, Sentinel-2, and Calibrated Enhanced -Resolution Passive Microwave Daily Brightness Temperature), Meteorological data (e.g., WRF simulation), topography, and limited observation in Tianshan Mountains, China. There are 21 causative factors in the se-lection, training, and validation processes. Then, the SHAP value is introduced to quantify the variable-based share of contribution to the possibility of avalanches on both global and local scales. The results demonstrate the following: (1) All four models are potent in assessing avalanche susceptibility due to similar patterns, with Catboost being the best with its eight indices: Accuracy (0.9249), TPR (0.9920), FAR (0.0080), TNR (0.8904), PPR (0.8229), NPR (0.0046), CSI (0.8175), and HSS (0.8404) superior to others; (2) The Catboost provides a reliable susceptibility map illustrating moderate and high susceptible areas up to 54.12% of the total, mainly concentrated in the west and southeast; (3) Topographic factors (distance to rivers, aspect, and relative slope position) and meteorology (precipitation) are the most effective for susceptibility modeling. The results above indicate the significant potential of tree-based machine-learning with multi-source and heterogeneous spatial data in obtaining high-quality susceptibility maps without too much field observation. It is of great importance for avalanche prevention in regions with complex terrain conditions and sparse data.

TI  - Management of Hidden Cutaneous Melanoma of the Umbilicus
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is currently the fifth most common cancer in the United States (US) and most often develop on areas that have increased sun exposure, such as the arms, legs, back or face. The incidence of primary cutaneous melanoma increases each year and curative treatment improves with earlier detection of disease. Primary cutaneous umbilical melanoma is extremely rare with as few as 46 cases reported worldwide. As a result, limited literature is available regarding the management of tumors originating in the umbilicus. By evaluating uncommon areas such as the umbilicus, earlier detection and possible intervention can be provided. We present a rare case of a 33-year-old female with a primary cutaneous melanoma of the umbilicus successfully treated with wide local excision (WLE) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).

TI  - Impact of National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration Tobacco Research Funding: A Bibliometrics Analyses
T2  - NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Conduct bibliometric analyses documenting the output of National Institutes of Health (NIH) tobacco-related and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tobacco regulatory science (FDA-TRS) research portfolios. Aims and Methods PubMed identifiers for publications between 2015 and 2020 citing tobacco funding by NIH and/or FDA were imported into NIH iCite generating measures of productivity and influence, including number of citations, journal, relative citation ratios (RCR), and comparison of research influence across Web of Science (WoS) disciplines. Coauthorship and measures of centrality among and between NIH and FDA-supported investigators gauged collaboration. Results Between FY 2015 and 2020, 8160 publications cited funding from NIH tobacco-related grants, 1776 cited FDA-TRS grants and 496 cited Common funding (ie, both NIH and FDA-TRS funding). The proportion of publications citing NIH grants declined while those citing FDA-TRS or Common funding rose significantly. Publications citing Common funding showed the highest influence (mean RCR = 2.52). Publications citing FDA-TRS funding displayed higher median RCRs than publications citing NIH funding in most WoS categories. Higher translational progress was estimated over time for FDA-TRS and Common publications compared to NIH publications. Authors citing Common funding scored highest across all collaboration measures. Conclusions This study demonstrates the high bibliometric output of tobacco research overall. The rise in publications citing FDA-TRS and Common likely reflects increased funding for TRS research. Higher RCRs across WoS subject categories and trends towards human translation among FDA-TRS and Common publications indicate focus on research to inform regulation. This analysis suggests that FDA support for TRS has expanded the field of tobacco control resulting in sustained productivity, influence, and collaboration. Implications This paper is the first effort to better describe the impact of tobacco research resulting from the addition of FDA funding for TRS in the past decade. The analysis provides impetus for further investigation into the publication topics and their focus which would offer insight into the specific evidence generated on tobacco control and regulation.

TI  - Proposition of LULC mapping in progressive detailing for the surroundings of hydroelectric powerplant reservoirs: Case study for the Batalha (Brazil)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surroundings of hydroelectric powerplant reservoirs have peculiar conditions of land use dynamics. In this sense, the objective of this work is to provide a methodological proposal for mapping the land use and land cover (LULC) in progressive detailing of surroundings of reservoirs of Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP). To achieve this objective, we're mapped Batalha HPP (Brazil) as a case study. The approach to mapping LULC with pro-gressive detailing consisted of three successive and complementary stages: the first, of reconnaissance (1:100,000), is based on the use of secondary cartographic and census data for the period 1985 to 2020, contemplating the Area of Direct Influence (ADI) of the Batalha HPP reservoir; the second stage, of semi-detail (1:25,000), consists of the use of Sentinel 2 images from the year 2021, spectral indices and the incorporation of manually vectorized files, for the spatial clipping of the Direct Contribution Basins (DCBs) and; the third and final step, of detail (1:10,000), made use of merged CBERS 4A images with a spatial resolution of 2 m analyzing the Limit of the Immediate Margins (LIM) of the reservoir. The data from the reconnaissance stage showed a clear dynamic of LULC change between 1985 and 2020 in the ADI of the Batalha HPP reservoir, with reduction and fragmentation of vegetation, due to the incorporation of areas for pasture and mainly, agriculture. In the semi-detail stage, the data showed that the DCBs of the reservoir of Batalha HPP were mainly related to agricultural use. The last step, of detail for the analysis of LIM, portrayed a condition of greater protection of the margins by vegetation cover, due to proximity to reservoirs. Due to the overall accuracy of 0.87, 0.95, and 0.91, respectively, the mapping of LULC changes in the three subsequent steps showed very good performance.

T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we search for negative superhumps (nSHs) in poorly studied cataclysmic variables using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. We find three eclipsing binaries with nSH signatures: HBHA 4204-09, Gaia DR3 5931071148325476992, and SDSS J090113.51+144704.6. The last one exhibits IW And-like behaviour in archival Zwicky Transient Facility data, and appears to have shallow, grazing eclipses. In addition, we detect nSH signatures in two non-eclipsing systems: KQ Mon and Gaia DR3 4684361817175293440, by identifying the orbital period from the superorbital-dependent irradiation of the secondary. We discover nSH signatures in one more system, [PK2008] HalphaJ103959, by using an orbital period from another work. An improved mass ratio-nSH deficit relation q(epsilon(-)) is suggested by us, which agrees with independent measurements on nova-like variables. With this relation, we estimate the mass ratios of all systems in our sample, and determine the orbital inclinations for the three that are eclipsing. All systems with discovered nSHs in this work are excellent targets for follow-up spectroscopic studies.

TI  - Direct cleavage during the first mitosis is a sign of abnormal fertilization in cattle
T2  - THERIOGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct cleavage, a type of abnormal cleavage in which one zygote divides into three or more blastomeres, has been reported in mammals. The incidence of direct cleavage increases in zygotes with three or more pronuclei (multi-PN) and those showing abnormal pronuclei migration. However, there are few reports on the relationship between pronuclei and direct cleavage, and the effects of these relationships on subsequent embryogenesis have not been clarified. It is difficult to observe pronuclei under visible light, especially in bovine zygotes, because of abundant dark lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. We visualized pronuclei by removing lipid droplets from bovine zygotes and analyzed the relationship between the number of pronuclei and direct cleavage using time-lapse cinematography. The direct cleavage rate of multi-PN zygotes was 78.6%, which was significantly higher than that of zygotes with one pronucleus (1 PN, 0.0%) and two pronuclei (2 PN, 8.2%). Observation of pronuclei migration in 2 PN zygotes showed that 3.1% of 2 PN zygotes had non-apposed pronuclei. The direct cleavage rate of zygotes with non -apposed pronuclei was 66.7%, which was significantly higher than that of zygotes with apposed pro -nuclei (6.4%). Among multi-PN zygotes, the proportions of zygotes with apposed pronuclei and non -apposed pronuclei were 37.5% and 64.3%, respectively. The direct cleavage rate of multi-PN zygotes with non-apposed pronuclei was 100.0%, which was significantly higher than that of zygotes with apposed pronuclei (40.0%). Three-dimensional live-cell imaging of bovine zygotes injected with the mRNA-encoding histone H2B-mCherry showed that the direct cleavage rates of 2 PN and multi-PN zy-gotes bypassing syngamy were 63.2% and 75.5%, respectively. These rates were significantly higher than that of 2 PN and multi-PN zygotes that underwent syngamy (5.6% and 20.0%, respectively). Regardless of the number of pronuclei, a high frequency of direct cleavage was observed in zygotes in which the pronuclei did not migrate inward the cytoplasm and bypassed syngamy. These results suggest that abnormal fertilization such as multi-PN and migration error of pronuclei in cattle is the primary reason for direct cleavage during the first mitosis. Assessment of direct cleavage during the first mitosis allows exclusion of embryos with abnormal fertilization and may contribute to in vitro produced embryo transfer success.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - High-frequency time series comparison of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites for mapping open and vegetated water across the United States (2017-2021)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent observations of surface water at fine spatial scales will provide critical data to support the management of aquatic habitat, flood risk and water quality. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites can provide such observations, but algorithms are still needed that perform well across diverse climate and vegetation conditions. We developed surface inundation algorithms for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively, at 12 sites across the conterminous United States (CONUS), covering a total of >536,000 km2 and representing diverse hydrologic and vegetation landscapes. Each scene in the 5-year (2017-2021) time series was classified into open water, vegetated water, and non-water at 20 m resolution using variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as variables derived from topographic and weather datasets. The Sentinel-1 algorithm was developed distinct from the Sentinel-2 model to explore if and where the two time series could potentially be integrated into a single highfrequency time series. Within each model, open water and vegetated water (vegetated palustrine, lacustrine, and riverine wetlands) classes were mapped. The models were validated using imagery from WorldView and PlanetScope. Classification accuracy for open water was high across the 5-year period, with an omission and commission error of only 3.1% and 0.9% for the Sentinel-1 algorithm and 3.1% and 0.5% for the Sentinel-2 algorithm, respectively. Vegetated water accuracy was lower, as expected given that the class represents mixed pixels. The Sentinel-2 algorithm showed higher accuracy (10.7% omission and 7.9% commission error) relative to the Sentinel-1 algorithm (28.4% omission and 16.0% commission error). Patterns over time in the proportion of area mapped as open or vegetated water by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithms were charted and correlated for a subset of all 12 sites. Our results showed that the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithm open water time series can be integrated at all 12 sites to improve the temporal resolution, but sensor-specific differences, such as sensitivity to vegetation structure versus pixel color, complicate the data integration for mixed-pixel, vegetated water. The methods developed here provide inundation at 5-day (Sentinel-2 algorithm) and 12-day (Sentinel-1 algorithm) time steps to improve our understanding of the short- and long-term response of surface water to climate and land use drivers in different ecoregions.

TI  - Study of the impact of reservoir water level decline on the stability treated landslide on reservoir bank
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by the reservoir water and rainfall and other factors, the stability of the landslide changes with the different reservoir water level decline rate. Using the Baota landslide in Yunyang County in Three Gorges Reservoir region as an example, and applying the saturated-unsaturated numerical simulation method, the groundwater seepage field is calculated when the reservoir water level rises and declines. The calculated pore water pressure is used for the ultimate equilibrium analysis of landslide, and the effect of reservoir water level drop on land-slide stability was discussed. The calculation results show that with the water level falling from 159 m to 145 m, and the increase of the rate of decline in the reservoir water level, the decline in groundwater seepage lines has increased somewhat. The landslide stability coefficient calculated under each working condition is larger than that in the original design, and the decrease rate of reservoir water has a qualitative effect on the stability of the landslide, but the influence is very small. Through the SBAS-InSAR time series monitoring of Sentinel-1 data in the 13th period and field verification, it is found that the cumulative deformation of the slope is small, which prove the stability of the landslide.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Feature-based algorithm for large-scale rice phenology detection based on satellite images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of rice phenology is essential for understanding the agricultural practices and studying its impact on ecosystem services. However, so far, available global-scale rice phenology maps do not provide fine spatiotemporal details of rice phenology in a consistent framework because they rely on the compilation of statistical data. Thus, this paper proposes an algorithm that combines the complementary advantages of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images to produce large-scale maps that depict rice phenology dynamics. The novelty of this algorithm lies in the correlation with rice phenology features, i.e., rice in water condition and rice color change. The time series of backscattering at Vertical-Horizontal (VH) polarization and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are proposed to recognize rice planting and heading dates, respectively. For the same time, the Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI) is utilized to detect the rice harvest date for the first time. The proposed algorithm is applied to multiple spatial scales (prefecture, 0.5 degrees gridcell, and site scales) and to multiple rice cropping systems (single, double, and triple croppings) in monsoon Asia. Results reveal that the algorithm is able to accurately detect the rice planting and harvest dates across two rice paddy field distribution maps with moderate-to-high spatial resolution, different validation data, and different rice cropping systems. The bias values of detected planting dates are 2, 0, and 4 days, while that of harvest dates are -2, -5, and -13 days at the prefecture, 0.5 degrees gridcell, and site scales, respectively. These results highlight the potential of this algorithm to generate national, continental, or even global maps of rice phenology dynamics in an efficient manner, which can facilitate research on the impact of rice phenology on rice ecosystem services that echoes environmental and climate change.

TI  - Continuous mapping of aboveground biomass using Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential variable in the study of the carbon cycle, and remote sensing provides the only viable means for mapping and monitoring biomass at large scales in time and space. Still, inconsistencies in biomass estimates are large which necessitates methods to achieve consistent mapping of biomass over time and space. In this study, we combine Lidar-derived biomass-estimates from GLAS measurements, time series analysis of 20 years of Landsat data, and machine learning algorithms to map biomass for a study area in the Amazon basin. The results show that we are able to map AGB consistently over space and time at annual intervals between 1999 and 2019, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 64 to 92 Mg AGB ha-1 (depending on the evaluation methodology used) for the best performing models, with AGB estimates ranging between 0 to 600 Mg AGB ha-1. Models run with the Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) resulted in the lowest errors. The presented methodological approach makes it possible to map biomass over time in large areas with wide biomass ranges, and without saturation below 400 Mg AGB ha-1.

TI  - W-NetPan: Double-U network for inter-sensor self-supervised pan-sharpening
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of remote sensing data allows dealing with spatial-spectral limitations by means of pan-sharpening methods. However, fusing inter-sensor data poses important challenges, in terms of resolution differences, sensor-dependent deformations and ground-truth data availability, that demand more accurate pan-sharpening solutions. In response, this paper proposes a novel deep learningbased pan-sharpening model which is termed as the double-U network for self-supervised pansharpening (W-NetPan). In more details, the proposed architecture adopts an innovative W-shape that integrates two U-Net segments which sequentially work for spatially matching and fusing inter-sensor multi-modal data. In this way, a synergic effect is produced where the first segment resolves intersensor deviations while stimulating the second one to achieve a more accurate data fusion. Additionally, a joint loss formulation is proposed for effectively training the proposed model without external data supervision. The experimental comparison, conducted over four coupled Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 datasets, reveals the advantages of W-NetPan with respect to several of the most important state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods available in the literature.

TI  - Removing invasive giant reed reshapes desert riparian butterfly and bird communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Giant reed (Arundo donax) is a prevalent invasive plant in desert riparian ecosystems that threatens wildlife habitat. From 2008 to 2018, under a United States-Mexico partnership, prescribed burns and herbicide applications were used to remove giant reed and promote native revegetation along the Rio Grande-Rio Bravo floodplain in west Texas, USA, and Mexico. Our goal was to explore the effects of the removal efforts on butterfly and bird communities and their habitat along the United States portion of the Rio Grande-Rio Bravo floodplain in Big Bend National Park, Texas. During spring and summer, 2016-2017, we surveyed butterflies, birds, and their habitat using ground-collected and remotely sensed data. Using a variety of generalized linear and N-mixture modeling routines and multivariate analyses, we found that the initial giant reed removal efforts removed key components of riparian habitat leading to reduced butterfly and bird communities. Within several years following management, giant reed levels remained low, while riparian habitat conditions and butterfly and bird communities largely rebounded, including many disturbance-sensitive butterfly species and riparian-associated bird species. Butterflies were most consistently associated with forb and grass cover, and birds with a remotely sensed index of greenness (the normalized difference vegetation index), several vegetation cover types, and habitat heterogeneity, habitat elements that were most common in locations that had the longest time to recover following management actions. Our results suggest that prescribed burns and herbicide applications, when used following protocols to minimize risk to wildlife, can limit the spread of giant reed in desert riparian systems and introduce habitat conditions that support diverse and abundant butterfly and bird communities.

TI  - Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node mapping with indocyanine green in endometrial cancer: surgeon's learning curve (cumulative sum analysis)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To evaluate surgeons' learning curves for laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer.Methods A prospective observational study was performed at the Oncogynecology Center, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital, from March 2018 to October 2022. Participating surgeons had no previous experience of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green tracer. Cumulative sum analysis was used to create learning curves for the performance of eight surgeons, based on a specific result over a time period. Two different cumulative sum plots were made for each surgeon: successful bilateral sentinel lymph node mapping and removal of sentinel lymph node specimens containing actual lymphatic tissue.Results 190 patients were included. The overall rate of sentinel lymph node mapping was 89.5%: successful bilateral mapping was achieved in 134 (70.5%) patients, while in 36 (19%) patients sentinel lymph nodes were mapped unilaterally. The bilateral detection rate significantly improved in later study periods (from 59.3% in the first year to 85.0% in the last year; p=0.03). Analysis of the performance of the surgeons for bilateral sentinel lymph node mapping showed that the cumulative sum plot crossed the H-0 limit line after 13 consecutive successful bilateral sentinel lymph node biopsies, indicating an acceptable level of competence to achieve the bilateral detection rate of at least 75%. This was accomplished by only one surgeon after 30 surgeries. Analysis of the performance of the surgeons for identification and removal of specimens containing histologically confirmed lymphatic tissue showed that the cumulative sum plots crossed the H-0 limit line after six consecutive successful sentinel lymph node removals. This was accomplished by most of the surgeons (5 of 8).Conclusion At least 30 procedures of indocyanine green traced laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy were needed to reach an acceptable level of competence for a bilateral sentinel lymph node detection rate of at least 75%.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Indian Sundarban is highly susceptible to tropical cyclones and resultant impacts such as storm surge-induced floods, embankment breaching, and saline water intrusion. It affects life and livelihood in severe ways. Mitigation and policy measures are therefore very important, based on information gathered at the grassroots level. Hence, this study is designed to assess inter-village variation in cyclone vulnerability, considering physical vulnerability, social vulnerability, and mitigation capacity. This study also highlights livelihood challenges faced by coastal dwellers. Geospatial and quantitative methods were used to assess the composite vulnerability index (CVI). Remote sensing data and climatic data were integrated to assess physical vulnerability and various socioeconomic data were incorporated to determine the social vulnerability. Moreover, an intensive field survey (2020-2021) was also conducted to understand the livelihood challenges of local people and accordingly suggest mitigation measures to cope with natural hazards. According to this analysis, nearly 18% of the total population living in the southern and eastern parts of the Matla-Bidya inter-estuarine area (MBI) are extremely vulnerable (CVI > 0.544) due to their geographical location and high exposure to coastal hazards. Almost 51% of the total populations inhabited in 46% of the total MBI villages are experiencing high to moderate vulnerability. Conversely, MBI villages in the northern part, where 32% of the total population lives, show low vulnerability (CVI < 0.387) due to less exposure and high resilience. Coastal low-lying villages are often hardest hit by tropical cyclones. Therefore, effective mitigation strategies and coping mechanisms are essentially needed to reduce the adverse impacts of cyclones.

TI  - Comparison between the ASTER and ECOSTRESS global emissivity datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution global land surface emissivity datasets are valuable for various applications. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Emissivity Dataset (GED) is the only accessible global emissivity data with a high spatial resolution (-100 m). Since the launch of the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) in June 2018, another high spatial resolution GED can be generated. A comprehensive comparison is needed to investigate the consistency between the ASTER and ECOSTRESS GEDs before subsequent applications and the release of the ECOSTRESS GED. We conducted a first-ever comparison between the ASTER and ECOSTRESS GEDs in two ways: 1) global spatial comparison and 2) validation using emissivity measurements at 9 sand dune and 2 vegetated sites. The results reveal that the ECOSTRESS emissivities in bands 2 and 4 are in good agreement with ASTER GED, with mean absolute biases (MAB) of - 1 % averaged over the globe. The emissivity difference is the largest for snow and ice in these two bands. For band 5, the discrepancy is relatively larger with a MAB of 1.7 %. The largest emissivity difference is found over evergreen broadleaf forests in humid regions. Comparison with measurements reveals an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ECOSTRESS emissivity of - 3 % among all the nine sand sites for all the 3 bands. At the two vegetated sites, the average RMSE is - 1.5 %. The absolute biases are below 3 % in all the bands. The average RMSE between ASTER and ECOSTRESS GEDs among all sand dune sites is 1.29 %. The evaluation results demonstrate a good agreement between these two emissivity retrievals overall and high accuracy of the ECOSTRESS GED.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Groundwater recharge is essential for managing surface and subsoil water resources. Not only for supplying people with daily drinking water, groundwater use for agricultural land and people's livelihood is also continuously increasing. As a result, there has been a decline in groundwater supply in various parts of the world, and it is highly desirable to identify the potential groundwater zones for specific sustainable development. This study aims to use an easy-to-use tool package named Landslide Sustainability Mapping Tool pack (LSM tool Pack) for preparing potential groundwater zone based on R and ArcGIS software integration. This tool uses five modules for processing. Among them, the Feature selection (FS) module brings a novel approach, determining the best subset feature for demarcating the groundwater potential zone. As a result, this best factor subset is used as an input of this tool pack. Additionally, PE modules evaluate the performance of proposed models in statistical performance metrics. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained with the integration of Performance Evaluation (PE) modules and ARC maps, which helps visual interpretation in evaluating models. This study uses the LSM tool Pack in the Rupnarayan river basin to map the potential groundwater zone based on fourteen controlling factors selected through the FS module, which will further help the local government to make a substitute policy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the compatibility of oxytocin and tranexamic acid injection products when mixed for the purpose of co-administration by intravenous infusion.Design: Compatibility testing.Setting: Hospitals taking part in a multicentre postpartum haemorrhage treatment (E-MOTIVE) trial in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and South Africa.Sample: Oxytocin and tranexamic acid products.Methods: The compatibility of two sentinel products of oxytocin injection and tranexamic acid injection in 200- mL infusion bags of both 0.9% w/v saline and Ringer's lactate solution was assessed. We analysed all tranexamic acid- oxytocin combinations, and each evaluation was conducted for up to 3 h. Subsequently, the compatibility of multiple tranexamic acid products with reference oxytocin products when mixed in 0.9% w/v saline over a period of 1 h was investigated.Main outcome measures: Concentration of oxytocin over time after mixing with tranexamic acid products. Results: We found significant interaction between certain oxytocin and tranexamic acid products after mixing them in vitro and observing for 1 h. The interaction substantially impacted oxytocin content leading to reduction in concentration (14.8%- 29.0%) immediately on mixing (t = 0 min). In some combinations, the concentration continued to decline throughout the stability assessment period. Oxytocin loss was observed in 7 out of 22 (32%) of combinations tested.Conclusions: In a clinical setting, mixing certain oxytocin and tranexamic acid products before administration may result in an underdosing of oxytocin, compromising care in an emergency life-threatening situation. The mixing of oxytocin and tranexamic acid injection products for co-administration with intravenous infusion fluids should be avoided until the exact nature of the observed interaction and its implications are understood.

TI  - Context dependency in interference competition among birds in an endangered woodland ecosystem
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Much research has quantified species responses to human-modified ecosystems. However, there is limited work on how human-modified ecosystems may reshape competitive interactions between species. Using a 19 -year study across 3 million ha, we aimed to answer the question: Are levels of interference competition between bird species context dependent and influenced by habitat structure and productivity? We focussed on the hyper-aggressive behaviour of the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala), which is recognized as a key threatening process for other woodland bird species in Australia. Whether environmental conditions such as amount of forest cover and net primary productivity (NPP) mediate the Noisy Miners' impact remains untested at large spatiotemporal scales.Location: Temperate woodlands of south-eastern Australia.Methods: We gathered data on bird site occupancy from repeated surveys of field sites and assembled satellite data on tree cover and NPP. We constructed Bayesian multi-species occupancy/detection models of bird species in woodland patches and tested the fixed and interactive effects of Noisy Miner presence, the amount of tree cover, NPP, and time. We quantified the responses of 31 species, many with known interactions with the Noisy Miner documented previously at fine spatial scales.Results: We identified negative associations between the Noisy Miner and 18 bird species, including, unexpectedly, both small and large bodied taxa. Site occupancy in some species was influenced by interactions between Noisy Miner presence and increasing amounts of tree cover or productivity. For some species, interference competition by the Noisy Miner is context-dependent and mitigated by increasing tree cover and/or increasing NPP. MainConclusions: Our analyses revealed that woodland bird conservation in our study region will be promoted by protecting refugia characterized by areas of high NPP and high tree cover. Preventing vegetation clearing that reduces tree cover could reduce interference competition by the Noisy Miner on parts of the remaining woodland bird community, including species of conservation concern.

TI  - Declining Trend in Anti-osteoporotic Treatment, Despite a Rise in DEXA Screening Following "Sentinel" Distal Radius Fractures.
T2  - Hand (New York, N.Y.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To understand national trends and costs associated with the utilization of anti-osteoporotic medication and DEXA screening within the year following a sentinel/primary distal radius fracture.METHODS: The 2008-2015Q1 Humana Administrative Claims database was queried to identify patients aged ≥50 years, with a "sentinel" occurrence of a primary closed distal radius fracture. Linear regression models were used to report and assess for significant trends in utilization of anti-osteoporotic medication and DEXA screenings within the year following the fracture. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess for factors associated with receiving or not receiving anti-osteoporotic medication.RESULTS: A total of 14526 sentinel distal radius fractures were included in the study. Only 7.2% (n = 1046) of patients received anti-osteoporosis medication in the year following the distal radius fracture. Treatment with medication for osteoporosis declined from 8.2% in 2008 to 5.9% in 2015, whereas the rate of DEXA screening increased from 14.8% in 2008 to 23.6% in 2015. The most common prescribed treatment was alendronate sodium (n = 835; 79.8%-$49/patient). Factors associated with increased odds of receiving anti-osteoporotic medication were age 70 to 79 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; P = .014), age 80 to 89 years (OR, 1.66; P = .001), Asian (OR, 2.95; P = .002) or Hispanic (OR, 1.77; P = .006) ethnicity, belonging to South (OR, 1.19; P = .029) or West (OR, 1.37; P = .010), and having an Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score of 3 (OR, 2.14; P = .024) or > 3 (OR, 2.05; P = .022).CONCLUSIONS: Despite a rising utilization of DEXA screening following "sentinel" distal radius fractures, the proportion of individuals who receive anti-osteoporotic treatment is decreasing over time.

TI  - Estimation of land surface temperature in agricultural lands using Sentinel 2 images: A case study for sunflower fields
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is usually calculated based on the thermal bands of satellite images. The present study aimed to estimate LST with reasonable accuracy for on-time agricultural management by integrating Sentinel 2 with Landsat 8 or MODIS images. For this purpose, LST was first calculated based on Landsat 8 and MODIS images in the Satar Plain located in the western of Kermanshah province, Iran. Then, three methods for LST estimation using Sentinel 2 images were presented and evaluated. In the first method, a relationship was established between LST and elevation and the normalized difference vegetation index. In the second method, LST was determined based on the relationship between Sentinel 2 spectral bands and Landsat-based LST in sunflower fields and agricultural lands. In the third method, the LST product of the MODIS was downscaled using spectral bands of Sentinel 2. Finally, the results of the three methods were compared with Landsat-based LST. The results showed that the second method (the relationship between LST and spectral bands of Sentinel 2) with coefficient of determination and root mean square error values of 0.9 and 1.48 degrees C in sunflower fields and 0.625 and 3.85 degrees C in agricultural lands, respectively, has better accuracy than the other two methods.

TI  - Psychological distress 12 years following injury in New Zealand: findings from the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study-10 years on (POIS-10)
T2  - INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInjuries can have detrimental impacts on mental health, even after physical recovery. In our Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS), 25% of participants experienced psychological distress (assessed using the Kessler 6) three months after a sentinel injury event (SIE), declining to 16% at 24 months post-SIE. Internationally, studies of hospitalised patients found distress persisted beyond 24 months post-injury and remained higher than the general population. However, most studies only assessed distress at one timepoint, relied on long-term recall, or were limited to small samples or specific injury types. Therefore, we aim to describe the prevalence of psychological distress 12 years post-SIE and to investigate pre-injury, injury-related and early post-injury characteristics associated with long-term distress.MethodsPOIS is a longitudinal cohort study of 2856 New Zealanders injured between 2007 and 2009, who were on the national injury insurer, Accident Compensation Corporation entitlement claims' register. Of these, 2068 POIS participants completed an interview at 24 months and agreed to further contact. They were invited to a follow-up interview 12 years post-SIE which included the Kessler-6 (K6), the psychological distress outcome of interest. Data about a range of pre-injury, injury-related and early (3 months) post-injury characteristics were collected via earlier interviews or administrative data sources (e.g. hospital discharge data).ResultsTwelve years post-SIE, 1543 (75%) people were re-interviewed and 1526 completed the K6; n = 177 (12%) reported psychological distress. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models found pre-injury characteristics were associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant distress at 12 years, i.e. having inadequate income, identifying as Maori, Pacific or Asian and having one mental health condition. Early post-injury psychological distress and dissatisfaction with social relationships also increased risk. However, being older was associated with a reduced risk of distress.ConclusionClinically relevant distress persists long-term post-injury among adults with varying injury severity, types and causes, and at higher prevalence than in the general population. Early identification of injured people at risk of long-term psychological distress provides opportunities for timely interventions to reduce psychological distress.

TI  - Effects of forest degradation classification on the uncertainty of aboveground carbon estimates in the Amazon
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTropical forests are critical for the global carbon budget, yet they have been threatened by deforestation and forest degradation by fire, selective logging, and fragmentation. Existing uncertainties on land cover classification and in biomass estimates hinder accurate attribution of carbon emissions to specific forest classes. In this study, we used textural metrics derived from PlanetScope images to implement a probabilistic classification framework to identify intact, logged and burned forests in three Amazonian sites. We also estimated biomass for these forest classes using airborne lidar and compared biomass uncertainties using the lidar-derived estimates only to biomass uncertainties considering the forest degradation classification as well.ResultsOur classification approach reached overall accuracy of 0.86, with accuracy at individual sites varying from 0.69 to 0.93. Logged forests showed variable biomass changes, while burned forests showed an average carbon loss of 35%. We found that including uncertainty in forest degradation classification significantly increased uncertainty and decreased estimates of mean carbon density in two of the three test sites.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that the attribution of biomass changes to forest degradation classes needs to account for the uncertainty in forest degradation classification. By combining very high-resolution images with lidar data, we could attribute carbon stock changes to specific pathways of forest degradation. This approach also allows quantifying uncertainties of carbon emissions associated with forest degradation through logging and fire. Both the attribution and uncertainty quantification provide critical information for national greenhouse gas inventories.

TI  - A geospatial assessment of flood hazard in north-eastern depressed basin, Bangladesh
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are a frequently occurring calamity in deltaic Bangladesh. This paper aims to assess the temporal expansion of waterbodies during flooding using geospatial techniques. Several water indices were applied to classify the satellite images at various temporal scales. Among them, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) showed the highest correlation (r = 0.831; where p = 0.01) with rainfall data. Specifically, the NDWI results showed that perennial waterbodies measured 37 km(2) and 60 km(2) in Sunamganj District in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The area of waterbodies notably increased 52-fold from March to April (37 km(2) to 1958 km(2)) during the pre-monsoon flash flood of 2017. During the July 2019 monsoon flood, waterbodies started to extend after May and flooded 2784 km(2) in area. NDVI analysis showed that in 2019, floodwater submerged 361.7 km(2) of vegetation cover. At the same time, the Surma River's flooding resulted in a 73.9 per cent inundation of the total area of the Sunamganj District. We hope that this study will provide better understanding of the varying nature of floods that occur in the low lying bowl shaped Haor region which will in turn assist the government with flood mitigation.

TI  - Reliability of resilience estimation based on multi-instrument time series
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many widely used observational data sets are comprised of several overlapping instrument records. While data inter-calibration techniques often yield continuous and reliable data for trend analysis, less attention is generally paid to maintaining higher-order statistics such as variance and autocorrelation. A growing body of work uses these metrics to quantify the stability or resilience of a system under study and potentially to anticipate an approaching critical transition in the system. Exploring the degree to which changes in resilience indicators such as the variance or autocorrelation can be attributed to non-stationary characteristics of the measurement process - rather than actual changes in the dynamical properties of the system - is important in this context. In this work we use both synthetic and empirical data to explore how changes in the noise structure of a data set are propagated into the commonly used resilience metrics lag-one autocorrelation and variance. We focus on examples from remotely sensed vegetation indicators such as vegetation optical depth and the normalized difference vegetation index from different satellite sources. We find that time series resulting from mixing signals from sensors with varied uncertainties and covering overlapping time spans can lead to biases in inferred resilience changes. These biases are typically more pronounced when resilience metrics are aggregated (for example, by land-cover type or region), whereas estimates for individual time series remain reliable at reasonable sensor signal-to-noise ratios. Our work provides guidelines for the treatment and aggregation of multi-instrument data in studies of critical transitions and resilience.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The main objective of this work is to propose a new technique for water quality parameters monitoring by applying artificial intelligence methods to optimize remote sensing data processing. A multiple regression model was developed to create a total suspended solids (TSS) prediction model, using unsupervised machine learning. Currently, water bodies throughout the world are poorly supervised in terms of quality, so it is necessary to implement efficient mechanisms to obtain synoptic information for a good diagnosis in TSS evolution, because they are a key indicator of the biophysical state of lakes and an essential marker for continuous monitoring. Conventional methods used to monitor the physical parameters of water bodies, for example, in situ sampling, have proven impractical due to time, cost and space constraints, and remote sensing tools can help to achieve this purpose more efficiently. The proposed multiple regression model requires calibration and to that end, Lake Chapala data from the monitoring time series collected by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA) were used. Lake Chapala is the largest freshwater body in Mexico, and the human intervention that develops around the lake has caused drastic changes such as decrease in the size of the lake and increase in suspended matter and aquatic vegetation. These changes alter the balance of the system, endangering the health of the lake. This work presents a generalized semi-empirical model that uses Landsat image data and machine learning methods for estimating total suspended solids (TSS) in water bodies, with a good prediction precision (R = 0.81, RMSE = 32.52).

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of soil salinization in China's West Songnen Plain
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Preventing soil salinization and improving soil productivity play vital roles in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the premise of which is understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of soil salinity in various ecosystems. To improve regional ecosystem management decisions, we examined the spatial variations and temporal changes of soil salinity in China's West Songnen Plain by separately developing prediction models of soil salinity for vegetated and non-vegetated areas (VEA and NEVA) through the combination of field samples, LANDSAT series images, and the partial least square regression (PLSR) method. Twelve variables, encompassing spectral bands, vegetation, and soil salinity indices, were extracted from LANDSAT satellite images. Among the investigated variables, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), red band, and digital elevation model (DEM) yielded the best results for assessing the soil salinity in VEA. In contrast, the green band and SI2 exhibited the most significant correlation with soil salinity for NEVA. Based on 10-fold cross-validation, models predicted soil salinity with R-2 values of 0.812 and 0.803. Results reveal that the salt-affected areas in the West Songnen Plain were estimated at 1.23 x 10(6) hm(2) in 2016 with evident heterogeneous distribution. Intensively salt-affected area (IA) and moderately salt-affected area (MA) are mainly distributed in the low-lying central and northern regions of the plain. From 1991 to 2016, the salt-affected area experienced a rapid increase followed by a slight decline with a peak in 2000. This suggests effective soil amelioration due to ecological projects and a wetter climate, however, the salt-affected area still had a net increase of 0.32 x 10(6) hm(2). The variation of different salt-affected levels was characterized by an increase in slightly salt-affected area (SA), MA, and IA. Cropland was the dominant land cover type affected by soil salinization, with the affected area expanding from 0.39 x 10(6) hm(2) in 1991 to 0.57 x 10(6) hm(2) in 2016. MA and SA were the dominant levels of soil salinization in grassland, with MA expanding by 1.3-times from 1991 to 2016. Although the area of soil salinization increased from 1991 to 2016, the salt-affected area was reduced, and the salt-affected level was downgraded in some parts of the study area after 2000. These results could provide support for monitoring soil salinization in other regions, with the findings expected to benefit ecosystem conservation and restoration for regional sustainable development and provide support for evaluating SDGs.

TI  - A Bayesian Partial Membership Model for Multiple Exposures with Uncertain Group Memberships
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a Bayesian partial membership model that estimates the associations between an outcome, a small number of latent variables, and multiple observed exposures where the number of latent variables is specified a priori. We assign one observed exposure as the sentinel marker for each latent variable. The model allows non-sentinel exposures to have complete membership in one latent group, or partial membership across two or more latent groups. MCMC sampling is used to determine latent group partial memberships for the non-sentinel exposures, and estimate all model parameters. We compare the performance of our model to competing approaches in a simulation study and apply our model to inflammatory marker data measured in a large mother-child cohort of the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS). In simulations, our model estimated model parameters with little bias, adequate coverage, and tighter credible intervals compared to competing approaches. Under our partial membership model with two latent groups, SCDS inflammatory marker classifications generally aligned with the scientific literature. Incorporating additional SCDS inflammatory markers and more latent groups produced similar groupings of markers that also aligned with the literature. Associations between covariates and birth weight were similar across latent variable models and were consistent with earlier work in this SCDS cohort. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

TI  - A 250 m annual alpine grassland AGB dataset over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2000-2019) in China based on in situ measurements, UAV photos, and MODIS data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine grassland ecosystem accounts for 53 % of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) area and is an important ecological protection barrier, but it is fragile and vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, continuous monitoring of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is necessary. Although many studies have mapped the spatial distribution of AGB for the QTP, the results vary widely due to the limited ground samples and mismatches with satellite pixel scales. This paper proposed a new algorithm using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a bridge to estimate the grassland AGB on the QTP from 2000 to 2019. The innovations were as follows: (1) in terms of ground data acquisition, spatial-scale matching among the traditional ground samples, UAV photos, and MODIS pixels was considered. A total of 906 pairs between field-harvested AGB and UAV sub-photos and 2602 sets of MODIS pixel-scale UAV data (over 37 000 UAV photos) were collected during 2015-2019. Therefore, the ground validation samples were sufficient and scale-matched. (2) In terms of model construction, the traditional quadrat scale (0.25 m(2)) was successfully upscaled to the MODIS pixel scale (62 500 m2) based on the random forest and stepwise upscaling methods. Compared with previous studies, the scale matching of independent and dependent variables was achieved, effectively reducing the impact of spatial-scale mismatch. The results showed that the correlation between the AGB values estimated by UAV and MODIS vegetation indices was higher than that between field-measured AGB and MODIS vegetation indices at the MODIS pixel scale. The multi-year validation results showed that the constructed MODIS pixel-scale AGB estimation model had good robustness, with an average R-2 of 0.83 and RMSE of 34.13 g m(-2). Our dataset provides an important input parameter for a comprehensive understanding of the role of the QTP under global climate change. The dataset is available from the National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center (; H. Zhang et al., 2022).

TI  - Spaceborne Observations of Lightning NO2 in the Arctic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic region is experiencing notable warming as well as more lightning. Lightning is the dominant source of upper tropospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are precursors for ozone and hydroxyl radicals. In this study, we combine the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with Vaisala Global Light-ning Dataset 360 to evaluate lightning NO2 (LNO2) production in the Arctic. By analyzing consecutive TROPOMI NO2 observations, we determine the lifetime and production efficiency of LNO2 during the summers of 2019-2021. Our results show that the LNO2 production efficiency over the ocean is similar to 6 times higher than over continental regions. Additionally, we find that a higher LNO2 production efficiency is often correlated with lower lightning rates. The summertime lightning NOx emission in the Arctic (north of 70 degrees N) is estimated to be 219 +/- 116 Mg of N, which is equal to 5% of anthropogenic NOx emissions. However, for the span of a few hours, the Arctic LNO2 density can even be comparable to anthropogenic NO2 emissions in the region. These new findings suggest that LNO2 can play an important role in the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere atmospheric chemical processes in the Arctic, particularly during the summer.

AB  - Optimal health from a Native Hawaiian worldview is achieved by being pono (righteous) and maintaining lokahi (balance) with all our relations, including our relationships as Kanaka (humankind) with 'Aina (land, nature, environment, that which feeds) and Akua (spiritual realm). The purpose of this study is to explore the role of 'Aina connectedness in Native Hawaiian health and resilience to inform the development of the 'Aina Connectedness Scale. Qualitative methods were conducted with 40 Native Hawaiian adults throughout Hawai'i. Three themes emerged: (1) 'Aina is everything; (2) Connection to 'Aina is imperative to health; and (3) Intergenerational health, healing, and resilience are reflected through intergenerational connectedness with 'Aina. Qualitative findings, supplemented with a scoping review of land, nature, and cultural connectedness scales, led to the development of the 'Aina Connectedness Scale, which examined the degree to which people feel connected to 'Aina, with implications for future research. 'Aina connectedness may address concerns related to health disparities that stem from colonization, historical trauma, and environmental changes and better our understanding of Native Hawaiian health by fostering stronger ties to land. Resilience- and 'Aina-based approaches are critically important to health equity and interventions that aim to improve Native Hawaiian health.

TI  - Atmospheric correction algorithm based on the interpolation of ultraviolet and shortwave infrared bands
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional atmospheric correction algorithms of ocean color remote sensing are mostly based on the extrapolation of aerosol scattering radiance from a reference band (near infrared, shortwave infrared, or ultraviolet bands), which inevitably leads to the problem of extrapolation error amplification with the increase of extrapolation spectral distance. In this study, we propose a practical interpolation-based algorithm (named the UV-SWIR-AC algorithm) using three reference bands (one ultraviolet and two shortwave infrared bands) for turbid waters. According to 6SV radiative transfer simulations with 15 customized aerosol types, we establish a fitting function framework for the aerosol scattering radiance in the wavelength range of 322-1643 nm. We apply the UV-SWIR-AC algorithm to the real satellite ocean color data observed by the Second-Generation Global Imager aboard the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (SGLI/GCOM-C) and compare the retrieved remote sensing reflectance with the in-situ data from the observation platform of Hangzhou Bay in the East China Sea and typical bays. The results show that the UV-SWIR-AC algorithm can achieve a better performance than the traditional, extrapolation-based algorithm in turbid waters. Moreover, in the typical regional analysis, this new algorithm also demonstrates a high applicability. The UV-SWIR-AC algorithm should be helpful to improve the atmospheric correction accuracy for next-generation ocean color missions (e.g., NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission and China's Haiyang-1E/F (HY-1E/F) mission) with wider spectral ranges from the ultraviolet to shortwave infrared wavelengths.

TI  - Review of the establishment of trauma network of Ghana (TRANET): one-year review and implementation experience in a lower middle-income country
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - IntroductionGlobally, injuries account for about 5 million deaths every year out of which 90% occur in low- and middle-income countries. Injuries, particularly trauma, place a lifelong burden on affected individuals, families and society. In Ghana and most African countries particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, there is no effective surveillance system or registry of trauma. Where they exist, they are often poorly developed and incomplete.ObjectiveThe study was set out to document long bone fracture injuries which will be used for research, education, policy and public health prevention programmes as well as documenting the experience in setting up trauma registries in a LMIC.MethodsThe study is being conducted at the four Teaching Hospitals in Ghana which are situated in Cape Coast, Kumasi, Accra and Tamale. Persons of any age (from birth) who reports to any of the sentinel sites with an incident of trauma to long bones are eligible for recruitment into the surveillance data collection. Data were captured using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), cleaned and exported to Stata for analysis.ResultsCumulatively, the sites had enrolled 3493 cases at one year of implementation. A total of 678 (19.41%) paediatric and 2815 (80.59%) adult cases were recorded over the period. In the establishment of the TRANET, we identified challenges in the planning, during data collection, data entry, follow-ups, support from local health authorities, and administrative issues. Quality improvement interventions were put in place, and it resulted in improved data quality.ConclusionThe established trauma registry of Ghana is assuring as it offers a timely, accurate, and comprehensive data source which will be useful for continuous monitoring of trauma care in Ghana. This first-year review information/findings will serve as a relevant information for stakeholders working to strengthen the health system.

TI  - European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) consensus on Indocyanine Green (ICG) fluorescence-guided surgery
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In recent years, the use of Indocyanine Green (ICG) fluorescence-guided surgery during open and laparoscopic procedures has exponentially expanded across various clinical settings. The European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) initiated a consensus development conference on this topic with the aim of creating evidence-based statements and recommendations for the surgical community.Methods An expert panel of surgeons has been selected and invited to participate to this project. Systematic reviews of the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane libraries were performed to identify evidence on potential benefits of ICG fluorescence-guided surgery on clinical practice and patient outcomes. Statements and recommendations were prepared and unanimously agreed by the panel; they were then submitted to all EAES members through a two-rounds online survey and results presented at the EAES annual congress, Barcelona, November 2021.Results A total of 18,273 abstracts were screened with 117 articles included. 22 statements and 16 recommendations were generated and approved. In some areas, such as the use of ICG fluorescence-guided surgery during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the perfusion assessment in colorectal surgery and the search for the sentinel lymph nodes in gynaecological malignancies, the large number of evidences in literature has allowed us to strongly recommend the use of ICG for a better anatomical definition and a reduction in post-operative complications.Conclusions Overall, from the systematic literature review performed by the experts panel and the survey extended to all EAES members, ICG fluorescence-guided surgery could be considered a safe and effective technology. Future robust clinical research is required to specifically validate multiple organ-specific applications and the potential benefits of this technique on clinical outcomes.

TI  - Inter-Island production variability and Pre-Contact carrying capacity estimates: A geospatial analysis of taro farming in Rurutu, (Austral Islands, French Polynesia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study explores pre-contact taro cultivation in pondfield irrigation systems on Rurutu (Austral Islands, French Polynesia). Understanding the size and extent of these systems is critical for estimating pre-contact human population, the ability to produce surplus, and socio-political dynamics. Since peak taro cultivation occurred across Polynesia prior to its historic documentation, the extent of wetland cultivation must be estimated from other sources. We explore pre-contact ecology and population levels on Rurutu using Landsat imagery and geospatial suitability analysis to estimate the maximum extent of the island's pondfield irrigation systems. A primary goal was to develop an intra-island comparison of probable annual yields of taro to model pre-contact population sizes and their distribution at the system and socio-political district scales. Our model indicates the likely presence of 20 dormant taro systems on Rurutu. Our results point to significant intra-island differences of taro production on the island in the pre-contact era. We suggest that Rurutu's Open socio-political structure was maintained, in part, by unequally dispersed arable taro land throughout the island which contributed to intra-island differences in annual yields and population densities resulting in endemic pre-contact warfare. We end by linking our data to ongoing conversations regarding resilience in Oceania and beyond.

TI  - Couple relational ethics: From theory to lived practice
T2  - FAMILY PROCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Distressed couples often become polarized and caught up in power struggles, with competing claims and perspectives. When escalated, partners may become reactive and unkind. The competitive-individualistic worldview of the Euro-American culture feeds polarization between partners. This article explores relational views of the self and relational ethics developed in philosophy, psychology, feminist theory, neurobiology, and couple and family therapy that counter this individualistic view. A major focus is on the ways in which partners impact each other's identity and well-being for better or worse, and the ethical responsibility this entails. The discussion addresses couple relational ethics within the larger sociocultural context that privileges power and competition. The paper offers applications to couple relationships and couple therapy, with interventions to promote mutual responsibility, fairness, dialogue, and care-helping partners to identify their higher values and interact with greater intentionality. A case example is offered to illustrate therapeutic techniques to enhance relational ethics in couples.

TI  - Is climate really changing? Insights from analysis of 30-year daily CHIRPS and station rainfall data in Zimbabwe
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change debate has been ongoing for at least two decades world over. However, an understanding of how much change has occurred in developing countries remains limited. Using a combination of daily Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and gauge rainfall data, this study analysed whether rainfall characteristics over 30 years (1989 to 2018) in Zimbabwe exhibited any significant trends. Firstly, Kappa statistic and a confusion matrix were used to test the appropriateness of CHIRPS satel-lite derived rainfall estimates for carrying out trend analysis. Thereafter, the Mann Kendall test, Sen's slope and kriging were used, to detect trends, ascertain magnitude of change and map the spatial variation in rainfall characteristics, respectively. The rainfall charac-teristics included: Total Number of Wet Days (TNWD), Maximum Number of Consecutive Wet Days (MNCWD), Maximum Number of Consecutive Dry Days (MNCDD) and Maximum Rainfall per Day (MRD). Validation results showed that overall accuracy ranged from 0.862 to 0.897 while kappa statistic ranged from 0.739 to 0.81, suggesting a substantial agree-ment between satellite derived-and gauge rainfall. No statistically significant trends were detected for the four rainfall characteristics analysed at 95% confidence interval. Although no significant trends were detected at 95% confidence interval to signal climate change it was observed that MNCDD, MRD and TNWD were increasing while MNCWD was generally decreasing. This key finding opens new opportunities for geographically targeted and in-tegrated intervention strategies for agricultural and water management in Zimbabwe. This is particularly important considering that Zimbabwe mainly depends on rain fed agricul-ture and understanding of the key rainfall characteristics can enable proper planning and decision making in terms of adaptation that which can ensure water availability and food security. Food security is fundamental in achieving national security. In addition, this study opens opportunities for further studies on the factors that influence the trends through using sub-daily and daily satellite data for a relatively longer period i.e., > 30 years. It is therefore our contention that fine spatial and temporal scales adopted in this study yield better characterisation of changes in rainfall regimes, hence brings out better insights on understanding intra-seasonal fluctuations for climate change detection studies.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Quantitative assessment of shoreline changes along the tropical West Coast, Maharashtra, India: A remote sensing and GIS approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline changes have been monitored for the tropical West Coast of Maharashtra using the Survey of India (SOI) toposheet, Remote Sensing (RS) data, and its incorporation in the Geographical Information System (GIS) for the time period from 1980 to 2013. Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Resource Sat (P6-R2) satellite data of 2013 year were geocoded using an image-to-image rectification process with the help of permanent points on the ground. The registered satellite imageries were added in Arc GIS 10.3 software with a false colour composite (FCC) band combination (3:2:1) to get clear contrast of the land-water boundary. The toposheet and satellite imagery waterlines were digitised using the line feature in Arc GIS 10.3 software. The shorelines digitised for different years were overlaid, and polygons were created for every changed location to compute shoreline changes from 1980 to 2013 to quantify the rate of erosion or accretion along the shoreline under investigation. Computed results were validated through detailed ground observations. The obtained results indicate that similar to 265 km (45.28%) of the coast is under erosion, similar to 234.17 km (40.02%) under deposition and similar to 85.97 km (14.70%) of the coast is stable. Maximum shoreline erosion is observed in the northern part extent from the Alibag to Shrivardhan and the deposition in the southern part of the coastal tract. The Maharashtra coast lost similar to 1.65 km(2) net area during 1980-2013. In some places, sand spits are growing or receding in response to coastal currents and storm events. The present pattern of shoreline changes is related to physical setting of the shoreline, varying wind and wave climate and anthropogenic activity.

TI  - Soil moisture mapping for different land-use patterns of lower Bhavani river basin using vegetative index and land surface temperature
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil moisture is the significant hydrologic factor deals with energy balance between the land and the atmosphere. Since the observation of soil moisture at point scale is infrequent and expensive, remote sensing determines the distribution of soil moisture in large scale. In this study, remote sensing techniques have been used to calculate the soil moisture index in the lower Bhavani river basin, Tamil Nadu, India. Landsat 8 satellite data were used for deriving soil moisture in reference with land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI). The derived soil moisture was compared to the in situ soil moisture measurements, which were taken at 83 sites at the field level. When a linear regression model was fit between in situ observations and derived soil moisture, a high coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.83 was found which can be efficiently used for the moisture estimation across greater areas. Since the land-use patterns influences the LST and soil moisture, the variations of these parameters in each land-use classes were studied using independent t test and found that LST demonstrated statistical non-significance (p > 0.05) for each of the studied groups, indicating that each land-use classes temperature were similar, whereas soil moisture in water bodies versus fallow land (p = 0.019), built-ups versus water bodies (p = 0.023), forest versus fallow land (p = 0.018), vegetation versus built-ups (p = 0.028), and built-ups versus forest (p = 0.011) has statistical significance value, which indicates that soil moisture between these compared classes was not similar.

TI  - Spatially lagged predictors from a wider area improve PM2.5 estimation at a finer temporal interval-A case study of Dallas-Fort Worth, United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, has many adverse impacts on human health. However, there are few ground monitoring stations measuring PM2.5. Satellite data help fill the gaps in ground measurements, but most studies focus on estimating daily PM2.5 levels. Studies examining the effects of environmental exposome need accurate PM2.5 estimates at fine temporal intervals. This work developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate the PM2.5 concentration at an hourly average using high-resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from the MODIS MAIAC algorithm and meteorological data. Satellite-acquired AOD data are instantaneous measurements, whereas stations on the ground provide an hourly average of PM2.5 concentration. The current work aimed to refine PM2.5 estimates at temporal intervals from 24-h to 1-h averages. Our premise posited the enabling effects of spatial convolution on temporal refinements in PM2.5 estimates. We trained a CNN to estimate PM2.5 corresponding to the hour of AOD acquisition in the Dallas-Fort Worth and surrounding area using 10 years of data from 2006-2015. The CNN accepts images as input. For each PM2.5 station, we strategically subset temporal MODIS images centering at the PM2.5 station. Hence, the resulting image-patch size represented the size of the area around the PM2.5 station. It thus was analogous to spatial lag in spatial statistics. We systematically increased the image-patch size from 3 x 3, 5 x 5, horizontal ellipsis , to 19 x 19 km2 and observed how increasing the spatial lag impacted PM2.5 estimation. Model performance improved with a larger spatial lag; the model with a 19 x 19 km2 image-patch as input performed best, with a correlation coefficient of 0.87 and a RMSE of 2.57 g/m3 to estimate PM2.5 at in situ stations corresponding to the hour of satellite acquisition time. To overcome the problem of a reduced number of image-patches available for training due to missing AOD, the study employed a data augmentation technique to increase the number of samples available to train the model. In addition to avoiding overfitting, data augmentation also improved model performance.

TI  - Study of land subsidence by radar interferometry and hot spot analysis techniques in the Peshawar Basin, Pakistan
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence caused by anthropogenic activities is frequently reported in many megacities world-wide, affecting over 500 million residents. For the first time, this work is reporting substantial ground subsidence in the fifth largest city of Pakistan. Observation of surface deformation using the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique on Sentinel-1A data -sets from 2015 to 2019 show subsidence up to 3.23 cm. Geologically, this region is going through active deformation associated with Himalayan orogeny. From August 1973 till December 2018, around ten thousand low-to moderate-magnitude earthquakes are reported.We used the emerging hot spot analysis on InSAR and earthquake data to assess the role of seismicity on subsidence. Four variables were analyzed; ground displacement measured by InSAR, earthquake count, earthquake depth, and earthquake magnitude. Analysis of InSAR data indicates that the vast majority of the area is subsiding. This investigation also reveals that earthquake activity near Peshawar is decreasing. In contrast, the earthquake activity is unstable but high in the direction of Tarbela Dam, which is the world's largest earth-filled dam.No systematic groundwater monitoring program has been implemented, and limited published data suggest that the water demand quadrupled in the last decade. A decline in the water table is also reported. Optimized hot spot analysis of water pumping data for 2017 shows a few isolated mild hot spots in the urban center. Excessive groundwater demand and Land-use change from agriculture to urban may have played a significant role in land subsidence in this region.(c) 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Mechanisms of vegetation restoration at landslides caused by a catastrophic earthquake in Central Taiwan
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation restoration of a large-scale landslide, triggered by the catastrophic earthquake on 21 September 1999, in Jiujiu Peaks, Central Taiwan with an impacted area of 821 ha recovered 80% by 2020 was studied using self-organizing map (SOM) coupled with multi-temporal SPOT satellite images and a terrain-based distribution index for a 20-year period. Although disturbed by several typhoons during two decades of natural vegetation succession, the landslide restoration rate has reached 87.5% with the invasion or regrowth of vegetation gradually. A predicted logarithmic model with statistically significant difference was derived to estimate the restoration trend of the landslide in the studied area. Most of the poorly vegetated areas are located along the ridgelines, as verified by field surveys. Landslide restoration was carried out in three stages, (1) vulnerable landslides and fast-growing invasive vegetation (1999/9 - 2005/9); (2) stabilized landslides and slow-growing vegetation toward the vegetated strips (2005/9 - 2009/11); and (3) more stabilized landslides and vegetation toward secondary forest (2009/11-2020/2). Topographic location, water supply, typhoon disturbance, invasive or residual vegetation patterns and succession time are the main factors of landslide restoration. The evaluated results indicate that nature itself is a complex ecological balance system with a strong capacity for vegetation recovery at landslides, and can be used by government agencies to add in the recovery of landslide areas.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - PremiseThe long-term potential for acclimation by lichens to changing climates is poorly known, despite their prominent roles in forested ecosystems. Although often considered "extremophiles," lichens may not readily acclimate to novel climates well beyond historical norms. In a previous study (Smith et al., 2018), Evernia mesomorpha transplants in a whole-ecosystem climate change experiment showed drastic mass loss after 1 yr of warming and drying; however, the causes of this mass loss were not addressed. MethodsWe examined the causes of this warming-induced mass loss by measuring physiological, functional, and reproductive attributes of lichen transplants. ResultsSevere loss of mass and physiological function occurred above +2 degrees C of experimental warming. Loss of algal symbionts ("bleaching") and turnover in algal community compositions increased with temperature and were the clearest impacts of experimental warming. Enhanced CO2 had no significant physiological or symbiont composition effects. The functional loss of algal photobionts led to significant loss of mass and specific thallus mass (STM), which in turn reduced water-holding capacity (WHC). Although algal genotypes remained detectable in thalli exposed to higher stress, within-thallus photobiont communities shifted in composition toward greater diversity. ConclusionsThe strong negative impacts of warming and/or lower humidity on Evernia mesomorpha were driven by a loss of photobiont activity. Analogous to the effects of climate change on corals, the balance of symbiont carbon metabolism in lichens is central to their resilience to changing conditions.

TI  - Calibration to maximize temporal radiometric repeatability of airborne hyperspectral imaging data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies provide insight into calibration of airborne remote sensing data but very few specifically address the issue of temporal radiometric repeatability. In this study, we acquired airborne hyperspectral optical sensing data from experimental objects (white Teflon and colored panels) during 52 flight missions on three separate days. Data sets were subjected to four radiometric calibration methods: no radiometric calibration (radiance data), empirical line method calibration based on white calibration boards (ELM calibration), and two atmospheric radiative transfer model calibrations: 1) radiometric calibration with irradiance data acquired with a drone-mounted down-welling sensor (ARTM), and 2) modeled sun parameters and weather variables in combination with irradiance data from drone-mounted down-welling sensor (ARTM+). Spectral bands from 900-970 nm were found to be associated with disproportionally lower temporal radiometric repeatability than spectral bands from 416-900 nm. ELM calibration was found to be highly sensitive to time of flight missions (which is directly linked to sun parameters and weather conditions). Both ARTM calibrations outperformed ELM calibration, especially ARTM2+. Importantly, ARTM+ calibration markedly attenuated loss of radiometric repeatability in spectral bands beyond 900 nm and therefore improved possible contributions of these spectral bands to classification functions. We conclude that a minimum of 5% radiometric error (radiometric repeatability<95%), and probably considerably more error, should be expected when airborne remote sensing data are acquired at multiple time points across days. Consequently, objects being classified should be in classes that are at least 5% different in terms of average optical traits for classification functions to perform with high degree of accuracy and consistency. This study provides strong support for the claim that airborne remote sensing studies should include repeated data acquisitions from same objects at multiple time points. Such temporal replication is essential for classification functions to capture variation and stochastic noise caused by imaging equipment, and abiotic and environmental variables.

TI  - Paddy rice mapping in Red River Delta, Vietnam, using Sentinel 1/2 data and machine learning algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study focuses on building a paddy rice map for the Red River Delta region (Vietnam) during the spring crop of 2019. Experiments were conducted with traditional machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM) and deep learning models (U-Net, Linknet, DeeplabV3+) based on satellite data from Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, and topographic maps. The experimental models all gave good evaluation results. The rice maps have good agreements with statistics from the government. The results highlighted that the combination of synthetic aperture radar and optical data with machine learning, deep learning models is an effective approach for short-term high-resolution paddy rice mapping.

TI  - Long-term legacy of sowing legume-rich mixtures in Mediterranean wooded grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The oversowing of legume-rich mixtures is a management practice gaining importance in Mediterranean silvo-pastoral farms due to enhanced forage production, quality, and ecosystem service provision. However, the oversowing of legume species can be expensive in silvopastoral farms due to the high cost of legume seeds and seeding operations and low persistence under inadequate management. The study aimed to assess the long-term impacts of legume-rich mixtures oversowing on pasture production of Mediterranean wooded grasslands with a remote sensing approach. The study was conducted on six Dehesa farms in Western Spain, where legume mix-tures had been sown in different years from 2002 to 2015 in part of the farms. The effects of legume species oversowing were assessed by analyzing the variation across years of a set of derived vegetation indices in sown and unsown areas of each farm. Among all considered vegetation indices, the Simple Ratio (SR) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed the highest capacity in estimating grassland yield (Pearson's r = 0.58 and 0.52, P < 0.01, respectively) and N content (r = 0.52 and 0.48, P < 0.05, respectively). All normalized vegetation indices increased after the sowing and remained significantly higher than before sowing (P < 0.001) for the whole monitoring period. Furthermore, the sowing also positively affected the temporal stability of each vegetation index, being interannual variability significantly higher (P < 0.01) before the sowing than after. The study confirmed the hypothesis that the oversowing of legume-rich mixtures in Mediterranean wooded grasslands effectively improves intra-and interannual biomass production and stability. Remote sensing using Landsat images proved to be an effective tool to assess the impacts of grassland man-agement practices in the long term in silvopastoral systems.

TI  - Enhancing flood susceptibility modeling using multi-temporal SAR images, CHIRPS data, and hybrid machine learning algorithms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood susceptibility maps are useful tool for planners and emergency management professionals in the early warning and mitigation stages of floods. In this study, Sentinel-1 dB radar images, which provide Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used to delineate flooded and non-flooded locations. 12 input parameters, including elevation, lithology, drainage density, rainfall, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), curvature, ground slope, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), soil, Land Use Land Cover (LULC), and distance from the river, were selected for model development. The importance of each input parameter on flood occurrences was assessed via the Mutual Information (MI) technique. Several machine learning models, including Radial Basis Function (RBF), and three hybrid models of Bagging (BA-RBF), Random Committee (RC-RBF), and Random Subspace (RSS-RBF), were developed to delineate flood susceptibility areas at Goorganrood watershed, Iran. The performance of each model was evaluated using several error indicators, including correlation coefficient (r), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC). The results showed that the hybrid techniques enhanced the modeling performance of the standalone model, and generally, all hybrid models are more accurate than the standalone model. Although all developed models have performed well, RC-RBF outperforms all of them (AUC = 0.997), followed by BA-RBF (AUC = 0.996), RSS-RBF (AUC = 0.992), and RBF (AUC = 0.975). Generally, about 12 % of the study area has high and very high susceptibility to future flood occurrences.

TI  - The factors driving land cover transitions and land degradation and the potential impacts of the proposed developments in the Isiolo dam watershed, LAPSSET corridor, Kenya
T2  - DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Isiolo dam is planned to be constructed along the Ewaso Nyiro River to provide water to the planned Isiolo resort city, one of the Lamu Port and Southern Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor projects. This paper evaluates the factors driving land cover transitions and their effects, as a consequence of the proposed infrastructure developments with a view to providing evidence-based information for formulating policies and approaches for sustainable land management and development. Landsat images were used to assess Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change, while land degradation was evaluated based on the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification guidelines (2000-2020). Spatial overlays of land degradation, LULC change, population, and land tenure were performed to establish their interrelations. The results revealed that water, bareland, built-up, and forest increased by 2043%, 83%, 35%, and 17%, respectively, while shrubland and cropland decreased by 26% and 6%, respectively. Further, 61% of the watershed remained stable, 31% experienced degradation and 8% improved. The main drivers of LULC transitions, and land degradation are population pressure, land tenure, climate change and economic growth. With the development of the LAPSSET projects, it is projected that built-up areas, cropland, and bareland will increase mainly due to population increase, while the forest and shrubland will reduce mainly as a consequence of an increase in built-up areas and potentially poor land management. To achieve sustainable development with net zero loss of natural resources, proper planning for economic investments as well as inclusive land-use planning should be enhanced in drylands such as the Isiolo watershed and similar landscapes.

TI  - Environment-ichthyofauna relations in a neotropical reservoir through a joint remote sensing/field sampling approach
T2  - ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH
M3  - Article
AB  - The damming of rivers for the formation of reservoirs causes a discontinuity in the physical and biological characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem. Changes in processes related to sedimentation and nutrients create a longitudinal gradient in water characteristics and productivity. Both the zonation and the differential distribution of primary production exert a strong influence on the other communities of these ecosystems. We hypothesised that spatiotemporal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and turbidity, driven by a longitudinal gradient, influence the ichthyofauna distribution in Sobradinho Reservoir. Using field surveys and geospatial tools, we tested the presence of a longitudinal concentration gradient for these variables, and then, its association with fish abundance (total and by trophic guilds). We used field samples between April 2008 and July 2009 and the reflectance data of Landsat 5 bands 2 and 3 to perform interpolations for each variable. The gradient was tested by extracting longitudinal profiles from the interpolation products. We tested the associations between ichthyofauna abundance and chlorophyll-a and turbidity concentrations using Spearman correlation. Sobradinho exhibited a longitudinal zonation consistent with the typical pattern of large reservoirs. Furthermore, our results highlighted the seasonal instability of this zonation. In the lacustrine zone, fish abundance was associated with seasonal productivity increase, caused by floods, whereas the fluvial zone showed lower abundances in these periods. Despite that, the fluvial zone exhibited higher fish abundance, demonstrating the common pattern for large reservoirs. The presence of favourable characteristics in this zone, such as seasonal flooding and higher environmental heterogeneity, may have corroborated the results.

TI  - An improved framework for assessing the impact of different urban development strategies on land cover and ecological quality changes -A case study from Nanjing Jiangbei New Area, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) change has been highly valued by policy makers for driving the evolution of regional ecological and environmental quality. The core area of Nanjing Jiangbei New Area (NJNA) has undergone the development process from traditional urbanization to new-type urbanization (NTU), however the impacts of different urban development strategies or pathways on the change pace and direction of land cover and ecological quality are not adequately understood in a quantitative manner which is not conducive for similar regions to learn lessons from past development processes. Based on RapidEye, GF-1 and SPOT-6 images acquired in 2009, 2015 and 2021, a Modified Mask-RCNN framework was devised and implemented to create a high accuracy LC dataset first in this analysis. Then, the applicability or efficacy of the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) model and the Regional Optimized Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RO-RSEI) model, developed from the Landsat observa-tions was compared in characterizing the ecological quality. Finally, the attribution analysis of spatio-temporal changes in LC and their induced ecological quality evolutions was carried out in conjunction with socio-economic factors. The results showed that the overall accuracies of the LC classifications were estimated at 91.50 % (2009), 91.25 % (2015), and 92.75 % (2021), respectively. The mean values of RO-RSEI analyses were at 0.652, 0.649, and 0.656, respectively, indicating that in the past 12 years, the ecological quality first got degraded then got ameliorated along with the urbanization. The urban green spaces got restored and increased in the NTU process, and protecting the forest and cropland was also reinforced thanks to the strict enforcement of related policies. These positive changes are attributed to the popularization of ecological civilization philosophy and the escalation of social awareness of environmental protection and low carbon development. The proposed framework can provide technical reference for ecological quality monitoring under the progress of NTU.

AB  - The present mixed methods study investigated personal meanings of death, i.e., concepts, views, and expectations associated with one's own death, and explored their relation to worldview. To this end, a sample of 202 young, German-speaking adults completed the Death Statements Test, a new qualitative assessment tool, as well as quantitative measures of religiosity, spirituality, atheism, and agnosticism. Qualitative data was transformed to enable quantitative analyses. Results indicated that the spectrum of personal meanings of death is generally broad and multifaceted. The most prevalent view on death was "death as source of motivation and meaning in life." The frequencies of emotionally positive and negative death meanings were relatively balanced, while neutral statements dominated. Relationships between participants' death meanings and worldview dimensions turned out to be small but existent. The Death Statements Test proved to be a valuable and economic assessment tool, eliciting rich qualitative material on personal meanings of death.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation in surface water in Punjab, Pakistan from 1985 to 2020 using machine-learning methods with time-series remote sensing data and driving factors
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pakistan is home to many natural and artificial bodies of water, which are inevitable for agriculture, domestic use, recreation, etc. In the arid, semi-arid, and wet areas of the land, the distribution, spatio-temporal variations, and the impacts on water dynamics of climate and anthropogenic drivers were studied. In this study, we used Landsat, 5, 7, and 8 satellite images to generate annual and seasonal water frequency maps per pixel for the 1985-2020 period. The analysis findings have shown substantial inter-and intra-annual variability in rainfall and temperature. In addition, results revealed significant zonal disparities in water patterns, with the arid zone displaying the most drastic variations. We found out that the area (2530.42 km2) is occupied by water bodies, of which 1322.24 km2 (52.25%) seasonal and 1208.18 km2 (47.75%) are permanent water zones. There is a dramatic decline rate of 1.02 +/- 1.84 km2/year in contrast to permanent water (0.97 +/- 1.99 km2/year), total inland seasonal water has increased. During July and August, Punjab has the highest seasonal water area (1822.30 km2) and declines to the lowest (523.20 km2) in October to December and February to May when permanent water (708.12 km2) is greater than that of seasonal water. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and rainfall were positively related to the surface water areas, while the temperature was inversely related. The outcome of our research offers valuable insights into future spatio-temporal variations, the supply of surface water in Punjab in the context of such anthropogenic and climate change activities.

TI  - <i>Ex-vivo</i> exploration of an endobronchial sentinel lymph node procedure in lung cancer for optimizing workflow and evaluating feasibility of novel imaging tools
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Early-stage lung cancer is treated with curative intent by surgery or radiotherapy. However, upstaging is frequently seen after surgery in clinical N0 lung cancer patients, and despite curative intent, 2-year recurrence rates of 9-28% are reported. A sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure could improve the staging accuracy. We explored the feasibility of performing a navigation bronchoscopy based SLN procedure in human ex-vivo lung cancer specimens to optimize procedural parameters and assess a novel injection tool. Methods: Ten lung resection specimens were included and allocated to either peri-or intratumoral injection of a tracer combining 99mTc-nanocolloid and indocyanine green (ICG) while varying the injection volume. A Pioneer Plus catheter with a pre-angulated 24G needle and an ultrasound (US)-element was used to perform real-time US guided transbronchial injections at multiple locations. Thereafter, single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT)-scanning was performed to image injection depots and to assess their location relative to the tumor.Results: An average volume of 0.7 mL (range, 0.3-1.2 mL) with an average activity of 89.5 MBq 99mTc (range, 35.4-188.0 MBq) was injected. Intratumoral injections in non-solid and solid tumors were successful in 100% and 64.3% respectively, while 100% of peritumoral injections in solid tumors were successful. The US-element of the catheter allowed real-time imaging and was able to visualize all tumors and 67.4% of all injections. SPECT/CT-scanning visualized 76.7% of the injection depots.Conclusions: A navigation bronchoscopy mediated SLN procedure seems technically feasible. The Pioneer Plus is a suitable catheter to place tracer depots at multiple intra-/peri-tumoral sites, while receiving real-time feedback on the needle localization in relation to the tumor. The next step of in-vivo injections will determine if tracer drainage to the SLN can also be detected on pre-and per-operative imaging.

TI  - Study on the Relationship between Urban Street-Greenery Rate and Land Surface Temperature Considering Local Climate Zone.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Relationship exploration between the street-greenery rate (SGR) of different street types and land surface temperature (LST) is of great significance for realizing regional sustainable development goals. Given the lack of consideration of the local climate zone concept (LCZ), Chongqing's Inner Ring region was selected as a case to assess the relationship between SGR and LST. Firstly, the LST was retrieved based on Landsat 8 imagery, which was calibrated by the atmospheric correction method; next, the street-greenery rates of different streets were calculated based on the semantic segmentation method; finally, street types were classified in detail by introducing LCZ, and the relationship between SGR and LST was investigated. The results showed that: (1) The LST spatial distribution pattern was closely related to human activity, with the high-temperature zones mainly concentrated in the core commercial areas, dense residential areas, and industrial cluster areas; (2) The average SGR values of expressways, main trunk roads, secondary trunk roads, and branch roads were 21.70%, 22.40%, 24.60%, and 26.70%, respectively. The level of SGR will decrease when the street width increases; (3) There is a negative correlation between the SGR and the LST in most streets. Among them, the LST of secondary trunk roads in low-rise and low-density built-up areas with a south-north orientation had a strong negative correlation with the SGR. Moreover, the wider the street, the higher the cooling efficiency of plants. Specifically, the LST of streets in low-rise and low-density built-up areas with south-north orientation may decrease by 1°C when the street-greenery rate is increased by 3.57%.

TI  - Land surface phenology indicators retrieved across diverse ecosystems using a modified threshold algorithm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of the seasonal vegetation dynamics from remote sensing imagery, provides crucial information for plant monitoring and reflects the responses of ecosystems to climate change. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) phenology product (MCD12Q2) provides global LSP information, but it has large spatial gaps in many regions, especially in ecosystems where rainfall influences phenology more than temperature. This study aimed to improve spatial coverage of LSP retrieval in these eco-systems. To do so, we used a regionally modified threshold algorithm for LSP retrievals, which were tested over continental Australia as it includes diverse landscapes of arid, mesic, and forest environments. We generated LSP metrics annually from 2003 to 2018 using satellite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series at 500 m res-olution, including the start, peak, end, and length of growing seasons, the minimum EVI value prior to and after the peak date, the seasonal maximum EVI value, the integral EVI value during the growing season (an approximation of productivity), and seasonal amplitude (maximum EVI value minus minimum EVI). Our regionally optimised algorithm improved the spatial coverage of LSP information in Australia from only 26 % of the continent to 70 % averaged across 16 years. Our results showed that the growing season amplitude was low (EVI < 0.1) over arid/semi-arid shrublands and savannas, tropical and subtropical savannas, and temperate evergreen forests, whose LSP metrics were captured by our regional algorithm and not by the global product. Some ecosystems, such as arid/semi-arid shrublands and savannas, showed more irregular phenology with low seasonal dynamics, and the growing seasons could skip a year or occur more than once in a year depending on climate conditions. Our algorithm was more sensitive to ecosystems with low seasonal amplitudes. We found that the detectability of LSP increases as the growing season amplitude increases, regardless of vegetation cover. Evaluation of the LSP metrics using eddy covariance flux tower measurements of gross primary productivity (GPP) demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of the algorithm. These improved LSP retrievals provide a greater understanding of the vegetation phenology across diverse ecosystems, especially savanna, shrubland, and evergreen forest ecosystems that cover more than 30 % of the land globally. The LSP provides essential infor-mation for ecological and agricultural studies such as quantifying bushfire fuel accumulation and forest carbon cycling, whilst enhancing our capacity for quantifying ecological responses to climate change.

TI  - Variations of Urban Thermal Risk with Local Climate Zones.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Due to the differences in land cover and natural surroundings within cities, residents in various regions face different thermal risks. Therefore, this study combined multi-source data to analyze the relationship between urban heat risk and local climate zones (LCZ). We found that in downtown Shenyang, the building-type LCZ was mainly found in urban centers, while the natural- type LCZ was mainly found in suburbs. Heat risk was highest in urban centers, gradually decreasing along the suburban direction. The thermal risk indices of the building-type LCZs were significantly higher than those of the natural types. Among the building types of LCZs, LCZ 8 (open middle high-rise) had the highest average thermal risk index (0.48), followed by LCZ 3 (0.46). Among the natural types of LCZs, LCZ E (bare rock and paved) and LCZ F (bare soil and sand) had the highest thermal risk indices, reaching 0.31 and 0.29, respectively. This study evaluated the thermal risk of the Shenyang central urban area from the perspective of LCZs and combined it with high-resolution remote sensing data to provide a reference for thermal risk mitigation in future urban planning.

TI  - Arctic sea ice melt pond fraction in 2000-2021 derived by dynamic pixel spectral unmixing of MODIS images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic has experienced extensive sea ice retreat in recent decades, as observed from satellite remote sensing and simulated by general circulation models. The significant low albedo of melt pond compared with snow and ice results in more absorption of radiation compared with sea ice without melt pond, which will then enhance sea ice melt to form more melt pond. This so-called positive feedback of melt pond is crucial for sea ice thermal and physical properties. The melt pond coverage varies significantly spatially and temporally and satellite remote sensing provides a possible solution in determining the spatial coverage of melt pond. This work aims to develop a new physically based algorithm for retrieving the cover fraction of melt ponds on sea ice using remote sensing data. In the newly developed algorithm, dynamic sea ice and melt pond reflectances are used in the pixel spectral unmixing for melt pond fraction (MPF) estimation. Radiative transfer models for sea ice and melt pond reflec-tance modeling are developed for MPF retrieval algorithm. The validation of retrieved MPF and its comparison with static pixel spectral unmixing results show that the dynamic algorithm proposed in this study has the po-tential of application in wide range of situations by considering dynamic spectral reflectances of melt pond and sea ice. The Arctic MPF and sea ice cover fraction (SIF) in 2000-2021 are generated by applying the proposed algorithm. The spatial and temporal characteristics of MPF and SIF are analyzed. Time series trend analysis of MPF in 2000-2021 reveals the significant increasing trend of relative MPF in the Arctic. The melt pond expansion in 2000-2021 is more obvious in the marginal areas, especially the marginal areas close to Russia coast. Trend analysis for typical regions such as Beaufort Sea, Greenland Sea, the Baffin Bay, Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara seas and center Arctic also reveals that the relative MPF and SIF show contrasting trend.

TI  - Optimal deployment of cultivated land quality monitoring points based on satellite image-driven assessment and improved spatial simulated annealing
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The deployment of scientific and reasonable cultivated land quality (CLQ) monitoring points can provide timely and accurate information on the current situation and changes in CLQ. The conventional method of selecting CLQ monitoring points are based on the CLQ of land use patches including different grades of large patches, which reduces the reliability of monitoring CLQ. Moreover, the conventional method mainly considers only CLQ, resulting in the inaccessibility of some monitoring points. There exist knowledge gaps in deploying reliable CLQ monitoring sites in the present. Thus, to improve the reliability of CLQ monitoring, this study presented a novel approach for deploying CLQ monitoring points. The pixel-scale CLQ was firstly estimated using the genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network (GA-BPNN) model and LANDSAT image-derived predictors. Then, the stratified sampling model and the improved spatial simulated annealing algorithm (ISSA), considering both slope and road accessibility were applied to deploy monitoring points. The results highlighted that (1) the pixel-scale CLQ data were more reasonable than the patch-scale CLQ data with different grades. (2) A total of 132 monitoring points using the stratified sampling model and ISSA were finally identified in the study area, which can effectively avoid the inaccessible places. Thus, the results based on the novel approach proposed in this study provide a scientific basis and technical support for obtaining the optimal CLQ monitoring points.

TI  - "Just Be White (JBW)": Incels, Race and the Violence of Whiteness
T2  - AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Largely operating online, incels are predominantly male individuals who are frustrated by their involuntary celibacy-their inability to get a romantic or sexual partner. Their worldview is grounded in hostile sexism largely directed at women and shared contempt for mainstream dating standards and feminism. Some incels posit that they can undertake specific racially-defined actions (i.e., skin bleaching, lying about one's ethnicity, cosmetic surgery) to increase their access to women by appearing more white and, hence, more desirable. By thematically analyzing 10 online incel forums on the topic of race, this research identifies the role of race as a sustaining facilitator of networked misogyny and white supremacy. Despite these racialized efforts to appear more white, many incels conclude that these efforts to change themselves are largely ineffective in increasing their access to women. Seeing as over half of incels seek counseling and social work services, this research puts forth several implications for social workers supporting incel clients and highlights the importance of understanding the role that race plays in incel clients' rhetoric-not only in reproducing racism, but also in provoking violence-sustaining affects (e.g., anger, disappointment, resentment) that generate a shared sense of betrayal and reinforce gender-based violence.

TI  - Automatic detection and update of landslide inventory before and after impoundments at the Lianghekou reservoir using Sentinel-1 InSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an urgent demand for continuous detection and monitoring of active slopes in wide reservoir areas, as reservoir impoundments may activate unstable slopes. Although satellite time-series InSAR has been widely used in mapping active landslides, the tedious artificial interpretation of InSAR results limits the efficiency and reliability of landslides detection. We propose a set of procedures for deformation monitoring and continuous automatic landslide identification in wide reservoir areas. The local time window estimation can extract the nonlinear deformation in the time series InSAR signal, thus enhancing the deformation field. Spatial adaptive clustering enables the effective extraction of unstable slopes. The abnormal deformation trends of landslides can be updated through the continuous identification of new results and comparison with historical results. The procedure is used to continuously detect unstable slopes in the Lianghekou reservoir area before and after the impoundment. Combining the ascending and descending SAR data of Sentinel-1, 109 historically active land-slides were found and 18 new landslides were activated within one year after the first water storage. The dis-tribution and types of unstable slopes were analyzed, followed by two case studies. The first case shows the different effects of the two-stage water storage on slope deformations, indicating rising water levels' critical role in landslide activation. The second case shows the consolidation settlement of the embankment dam and the influence of water storage on slope deformation monitoring. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the InSAR automatic landslide identification and this study provides a technical reference for similar reservoir area.

TI  - Interannual changes in winter-spring zooplankton estuarine community forced by hydroclimatic variability- With special reference to bioindicator species Eurytemora americana
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic variability and anthropogenic pressures impact the structure and dynamics of pelagic ecosystems and copepods are good indicators of such changes. This investigation aims to explore the interannual pattern of the mesozooplankton community, in relation to environmental variables in the Bahia Blanca Estuary during winter-spring from last two decades focusing on the dominant species Eurytemora americana. Main changes recorded include increased temperature, alteration of the nutrient balance, a decrease in chlorophyll-a, modifications in the abundance-structure of the phytoplankton assemblages, and changes in the abundance-structure of the mesozooplankton community. A significant decrease was observed in species richness of the mesozooplankton over time. Alterations in abundance and reproductive traits of E. americana, were also found. The population of E. americana dropped from mean relative abundance of 47% in first years to 20-12% in lasts one, accompanied with an increase of copepod species characterized by higher trophic plasticity in eutrophic conditions, like Acartia tonsa and Euterpina acutifrons.

TI  - Spatial-temporal dynamics of decaying stages of pelagic<i> Sargassum</i> spp. along shorelines in Puerto Rico using Google Earth Engine
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal social-ecological systems in the Caribbean are affected by pelagic Sargassum spp. influxes and decom-position, but most satellite monitoring efforts focus on offshore waters. We developed a method to detect and spatial-temporally assess sargassum accumulations and their decaying stages along the shoreline and nearshore waters. A multi-predictor Random Forest model combining Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument reflectance bands and several vegetation, seaweed, water, and water quality indices was developed within the online Google Earth Engine platform. The model achieved 97 % overall accuracy and identified both fresh and decomposing sargassum, as well as the Sargassum-brown-tide generated from decomposing sargassum. We identified three hotspots of sargassum accumulation in La Parguera, Puerto Rico and found that sargassum was present every month in at least one of its forms during the entire time series (September 2015-January 2022). This research provides information to understand sargassum impacts and areas where mitigation efforts need to focus.

TI  - Spatial and deep learning analyses of urban recovery from the impacts of COVID-19
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates urban recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on three main types of working, commercial, and night-life activities and associating them with land use and inherent socio-economic patterns as well as points of interests (POIs). Massive multi-source and multi-scale data include mobile phone signaling data (500 m x 500 m), aerial images (0.49 m x 0.49 m), night light satellite data (500 m x 500 m), land use data (street-block), and POIs data. Methods of convolutional neural network, guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping, bivariate local indicator of spatial association, Elbow and K-means are jointly applied. It is found that the recovery in central areas was slower than in suburbs, especially in terms of working and night-life activities, showing a donut-shaped spatial pattern. Residential areas with mixed land uses seem more resilient to the pandemic shock. More than 60% of open spaces are highly associated with recovery in areas with high-level pre-pandemic social-economic activities. POIs of sports and recreation are crucial to the recovery in all areas, while POIs of transportation and science/culture are also important to the recovery in many areas. Policy implications are discussed from perspectives of open spaces, public facilities, neighborhood units, spatial structures, and anchoring roles of POIs.

TI  - Non-linearity in lipase assays: A multicentric comparison on different analysers
T2  - CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Non-linearity in lipase assays and the ensuing gaps in results distribution have been described on Roche analysers, but have yet to be studied on other analysers.Design and methods: Eighteen lithium-heparinized plasma pools of lipase activities decreasing from 1700 to <4 U/ L were prepared for multicentric evaluation on several analysers. Non-linearity was modelled as the difference between the polynomial regression of lipase activities depending on relative dilutions over the primary measuring range, and the linear regression of the same variables above the manufacturer's limit of linearity (MLL). Gaps in lipase distribution resulting from non-linearity were graphically evidenced through histograms. Upper limits of gaps were calculated, which are lipase activities where non-linearity biases no longer impact the diluted lipase results.Results: MLLs and lipase (U/L) calculated at MLL (%biases versus MLL) were respectively: 1200 and 1124 (-6.3%) on the Architect C16000 (Abbott); 300 and 248 (-17.3%) on the Cobas c503 (Roche); 1500 and 1458 (-2.8%) on the Dimension Vista (Siemens); and 700 and 659 (-5.9%) on the Atellica CH930 (Siemens). Using Sentinel Lipase reagents on Abbott analysers, these measurements were respectively: 300 and 294 (-2.0%) on the Architect C16000, and 300 and 298 (-0.7%) on the Alinity. Setting Randox Lipase reagents on the Alinity, MLL and lipase at MLL were 953 and 776 (-18.6%), respectively.Conclusions: Considering the desirable (+/- 14.2 %) and optimal (+/- 7.1 %) allowable total error for lipase (EFLM/ EuBIVAS), biases at manufacturer's limit of linearity were acceptable, except for Roche Cobas c503 method and Randox method on Abbott Alinity.

TI  - Study of snow cover/depth evolution characteristics in Tianshan region of China based on geographical partition
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the digital elevation data, snow depth and snow cover remote sensing data, this paper divides six snow evolution areas and geographical partitions, extracts the geographical partitions of each evolution area and obtains the geographical characteristics of the evolution area for analysis. The results show that: (1) From 2003 to 2017, the average snow area decreased at a rate of - 0.004, and the average snow depth increased at a rate of 0.03. (2) The snow in the middle altitude hill with shady gentle slope area is the most obvious in the seasonal evolution, and the percentage of this region in the seasonal snow evolution area is 5.46%, the snow depth in the middle altitude hill with sunny and gentle slopes area increased and decreased significantly in the past 15 years, and the percentage of this region in the SD significant changes evolution area was 6.32%. The snow in the low relief middle altitude mountain with shady and moderate slope area not only shows obvious seasonal evolution, but also increases and decreases significantly in snow depth. And the percentage of this region in the seasonal snow significant evolution area is 5.82%. (3) The geographical partitions with the largest area in all evolution areas is the middle altitude hill with sunny and gentle slopes area (4.75%). (4) The geographical partition with the largest variation of snow depth in Tianshan region is the low relief middle altitude mountain with shady and moderate slope area (12.02 cm). (5) The snow accumulation and melting are obvious in the range of 1000-3500 m above altitude, different geomorphology types lead to obvious differences in snow characteristics. The snow melting is most obvious in the gentle slope area of the low topographic relief geomorphology types, and the snow accumulation is most obvious in the steep slope area of the middle relief geomorphology types.

TI  - A Statistical Algorithm for Retrieving Background Value of Absorbing Aerosol Index Based on TROPOMI Measurements
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) is essential for monitoring the absorbing aerosols during aerosol events. UVAI depends on the absorbing aerosol concentration, the viewing geometry, and the temporal drift of radiometric sensitivity. To efficiently detect absorbing aerosols with the highest precision and to improve the accuracy of long-term UVAI estimates, the background UVAI must be examined through the UVAI retrieval. This study presents a statistical method that calculates the background value of UVAI using TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observation data over the Pacific Ocean under clear-sky scenes. Radiative transfer calculations were performed to simulate the dependence of UVAI on aerosol type and viewing geometry. We firstly applied the background UVAI to reducing the effects of viewing geometry and the degradation of the TROPOMI irradiance measurements on the UVAI. The temporal variability of the background UVAI under the same viewing geometry and aerosol concentration was identified. Radiative transfer calculations were performed to study the changes in background UVAI using Aerosol Optical Depth from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and reflectance measurements from TROPOMI as input. The trends of the temporal variations in the background UVAI agreed with the simulations. Alterations in the background UVAI expressed the reflectance variations driven by the changes in satellite state. Decreasing trends in solar irradiance at 340 and 380 nm due to instrument degradation were identified. Our findings are valuable because they can be applied to future retrievals of UVAI from the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) onboard the Chinese GaoFen-5 satellite.

TI  - Drylands contribute disproportionately to observed global productivity increases
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands cover about 40% of the terrestrial surface and are sensitive to climate change, but their relative contributions to global vegetation greening and productivity increase in recent decades are still poorly known. Here, by integrating satellite data and biosphere modeling, we showed that drylands contributed more to global gross primary productivity (GPP) increase (65% +/- 16%) than to Earth greening (33% +/- 15%) observed during 1982-2015. The enhanced productivity per unit leaf area, i.e., light-use efficiency (LUE), was the mechanism behind this pattern. We also found that LUE was more sensitive to soil moisture than to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in drylands, while the opposite was observed (i.e., LUE was more sensitive to VPD) in humid areas. Our findings suggest the importance of using different moisture stress metrics in projecting the vegetation productivity changes of dry versus humid regions and high-light the prominent role of drylands as key controllers of the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Study of decadal variations in width and mangrove cover of the Thane remote sensing
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study depicts decadal variations in the area, width and mangrove cover of Thane Creek, Mahara-shtra, India, using the remote sensing technique. The study is significant because the Creek has lush-green mangrove cover on its vast intertidal region and consi-derable urban developmental activities are occurring around it. Landsat datasets were used for different years from 1972 to 2014 and Sentinal 2A satellite data were used for the year 2020. To understand the variations in width from mouth to upstream, the Creek was divided into three zones, viz. mouth, middle and upstream. For mangrove cover estimation, supervized classification analysis was used for images from 2005 to 2014, while object-based image classification analysis with multi -spectral resolution was used for images from 2020. From the results, it can be confirmed that there is an overall increase in the spatial extent of mangroves and a reduc-tion in the width of Thane Creek. The study also shows that creek width had decreased by 1.15 km at the mouth and 0.08 km at the upstream end from 1972 to 2020, while mangrove cover had increased by 14.1 km2 from 2005 to 2020 (15 years). The overall reduction in the area between the west and east banks of the Creek was around 15.3 km2 from 1972 to 2020. This study shows that Thane Creek is rapidly narrowing at its northern end.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present study aims at discriminating the rock units and mapping the alteration zones from their host rocks, as promised targets for mineral exploration in Um El-Rus area using the widely considered ASTER data. Several remote sensing techniques were integrated for the lithological discrimination and alteration zone delineation. The approach methodology was able to map the various rock units and define the contacts between them precisely. Moreover, the spatial abundances of the alteration minerals (e.g., alunite, iron oxides, chlorite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, and sericite) were mapped as an indication of the occurrence of alteration zones. More addition, the lineaments in the study area were extracted automatically using the PCI Geomatics software. Areas with considerable lineament density may indicate high potentiality for mineralization as these lineaments may represent faults and fractures that are the main channel ways for hydrothermal solutions to migrate through. This study yielded a modified geological map with enhanced lithological boundaries depending on the remote sensing data. Five localities were delineated and regarded as alteration zones with high potentiality for mineralization. A field visit was conducted to the study area through which the obtained results were validated. Field observations maintained the high accuracy of the obtained enhanced lithological map. During the field study, several alteration indicators were observed, including, quartz veins/veinlets, kaolinitization, chloritization, sericitization, and carbonatization types of alteration. The adopted alteration mapping methodology enabled the delineation of the already existing Um El-Rus gold mine; this validates the results as well.

TI  - High production of transfer RNAs identifies the presence of developing oocytes in ovaries and intersex testes of teleost fish
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - 5S rRNA is highly transcribed in fish oocytes and this transcription levels can be used to identify the presence of oocytes in the intersex testes of fish exposed to xenoestrogens. Similar to 5S rRNA, tRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol-III) in eukaryotes, so this study focuses in the analysis of the levels of expression of tRNAs in the gonads (ovaries and testes) of eight teleost species as a possible new oocyte molecular marker. Total RNA extracted from gonads of six commercial teleost species in the Biscay Bay, from the pollution sentinel species thicklip grey mullet (Chelon labrosus) known present intersex testes in response to xenoestrogens in Gernika estuary and from the laboratory model species Danio rerio were analysed through capillary electrophoresis. Bioanalyzer electropherograms were used to quantify the concentrations of tRNAs, 5S and 5.8S rRNA. All studied ovaries expressed significantly higher levels of tRNAs and 5S rRNA than testes. A tRNA to 5.8S rRNA index was calculated which differentiates ovaries from testes, and identifies some intersex testes in between testes and ovaries in mullets. The tRNA/5.8S ratio was highest in ovaries in previtellogenic stage, decreasing towards maturity. Thus, strong oocyte expression of tRNAs is an additional proof of high activity levels of Pol-III during early stages of oocyte development in teleost ovaries. Incidentally, we observed that miRNA concentrations were always higher in testes than ovaries. The indexing approach developed in the present study could have multiple applications in teleost reproduction research and in the development of early molecular markers of intersex condition.

TI  - Detection of marine oil-like features in Sentinel-1 SAR images by supplementary use of deep learning and empirical methods: Performance assessment for the Great Barrier Reef marine park
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of oil discharges in coastal and open ocean waters using Earth Observation (EO) has undeniably contributed to diminishing their occurrence wherever a detection system was in place, such as in Europe (EMSA's CleanSeaNet) or in the United States (NOAA's OR&R). This study describes the development and testing of a semi-automated oil slick detection system tailored to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) marine park solely based on EO data as no such service was routinely available in Australia until recently. In this study, a large, curated, historical global dataset of SAR imagery acquired by Sentinel-1 SAR, now publicly available, is used to assess classification techniques, namely an empirical approach and a deep learning model, to discriminate between oil-like features and look-alikes in the scenes acquired over the marine park. An evaluation of this detection system on 10 Sentinel-1 SAR images of the GBR using two performance metrics - the detection accuracy and the false-positive rate (FPR) - shows that the classifiers perform best when combined (accuracy >98 %; FPR 0.01) rather than when used separately. This study demonstrates the benefit of sequentially combining classifiers to improve the detection and monitoring of unreported oil discharge events in SAR imagery. The workflow has also been tested outside the GBR, demonstrating its robustness when applied to other regions such as Australia's Northwest Shelf, Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

TI  - <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-rituximab tracer injection for guiding internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes biopsy in primary breast cancer: A prospective observational study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo explore the use of Tc-99m-rituximab tracer injection for internal mammary sentinel lymph node (IM-SLN) detection in patients with primary breast cancer. MethodsThis prospective observational study enrolled female patients with primary breast cancer between September 2017 and June 2022 at Fujian Provincial Hospital. The participants were divided into the peritumoral group (two subcutaneous injection points on the surface of the tumor), two-site group (injections into the glands at 6 and 12 o'clock around the areola area), and four-site group (injections into the gland at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock around the areola area). The outcomes were the detection rates of the IM-SLNs and axillary sentinel lymph nodes (A-SLNs). ResultsFinally, 133 patients were enrolled, including 53 in the peritumoral group, 60 in the two-site group, and 20 in the four-site group. The detection rate of the IM-SLNs in the peritumoral group (9.4% [5/53]) was significantly lower than in the two-site (61.7% [37/60], P<0.001) and four-site (50.0% [10/20], P<0.001) groups. The detection rates of A-SLNs among the three groups were comparable (P=0.436). ConclusionThe two-site or four-site intra-gland injection of Tc-99m-rituximab tracer might achieve a higher detection rate of IM-SLNs and a comparable detection rate of A-SLNs compared with the peritumoral method. The location of the primary focus has no impact on the detection rate of the IM-SLNs.

TI  - Evaluation of the nitrogen oxide emission inventory with TROPOMI observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To compensate for the emissions missed or underestimated in the national bottom-up emission inventories, we apply the high spatial resolution satellite data from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to esti-mate the top-down nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in regional scales. The NOx chemical lifetime is derived based on ground-based measurements of ozone photolysis rate, ultra-violet (UV) index, and temperature. For five designated regions of western Taiwan, the derived lifetime is about 1-2 h in summer and 2-4 h in winter. The retrieved 2021 annual emissions for regions near two major pollution sources, Taichung thermal power plant and Mailiao Industrial Zone, are comparable with the emission from the Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS), with a difference of 6% and-12%, respectively. After validating the data and methods, the NOx emissions for five regions of western Taiwan are derived and applied to evaluate the bottom-up inventories. For northern and southern Taiwan, the top-down emissions agree well with emission inventories. The top-down emissions are 12%, 23%, and 16% higher than emission inventories for north-central, central, and south-central Taiwan, respectively. This indicates that the bottom-up inventories are underestimated from north -central to south-central Taiwan, which may be associated with the uncertainties from traffic sources. Given the various complex pollution sources, deriving NOx emissions from space allows us to acquire a better under-standing of emissions on urban scales and improve the bottom-up emission inventories.

TI  - Sentinel-1 P-SBAS data for the update of the state of activity of national landslide inventory maps
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The redaction of landslide inventory is a fundamental task for risk management and territorial planning activities. The availability of synthetic aperture radar imagery, especially after the launch of Sentinel-1 mission, enables to systematically update landslide inventories covering wide areas in a reduced time frame and at different scales of analysis. In this work, SAR data processed from the fully automatic P-SBAS pipeline have been adopted to update the Italian national landslide database. Specifically, a matrix has been introduced by comparing past landslide state of activity obtained with Envisat data (2003-2010) and that computed with Sentinel-1 (2014-2018). The state of activity was defined by obtaining the projected velocity along the slope dip direction. The analysis involved about 56,000 landslides which showed at least one Sentinel-1 measurement point, of which 74% were classified as dormant, having annual average velocity < 7 mm/year (considering a value of two times the standard deviation) and 26% as active (mean velocity > 7 mm/year). Furthermore, a landslide reliability matrix was introduced on the landslide inventory updated with S1 data, using the measurement point (MP) density within each landslide and the standard deviation of the mean V-slope value of each landslide. In this case, the analysis revealed that more than 80% of landslides has values of reliability from average to very high. Finally, the 2D horizontal and vertical components were computed to characterize magnitude and direction of every type of landslides included in this work, showing that spreadings, deep-seated gravitation slope deformations, and slow flows showed a main horizontal movement, while complex and translational/rotational slides had more heterogeneity in terms of deformation direction. Hence, the work demonstrated that the application of fast and automatically nationwide Sentinel-1 MTInSAR (multi-temporal interferometry SAR) may provide a fundamental aid for landslide inventory update.

TI  - Assessing the consistency of crop leaf area index derived from seasonal Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery over Manitoba, Canada
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To take full advantage of cloud-free optical remote sensing data for crop leaf area index (LAI) retrieval throughout the growing season, integration of multi-sensor satellite data is increasingly resorted. However, the consistencies of LAI products derived from different satellites using different retrieval approaches should be assessed. This study aimed at understanding the spatiotemporal consistency of crop LAI derived from S2/MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument, Sentinel-2) and L8/OLI (Operational Land Imager, Landsat 8) data using two retrieving approaches, a field-data-driven (FDD) approach driven by field measured LAI and a hybrid approach based on simulations of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. Results from the two approaches were assessed using field measured LAI for six types of crops in 2016 over Manitoba, one of the major agricultural provinces in the Canadian Prairies. LAI estimates from S2/MSI data obtained unbiased root-mean-square-error (ubRMSE) of 0.39 and 0.51 cm(2) cm(-2) for the FDD and hybrid approaches respectively. For the L8/OLI, ubRMSE of LAI estimates were 0.82 and 0.92 cm(2)cm(-2) for the FDD and hybrid approaches, respectively. To evaluate the temporal consistency of crop LAI derived from the two satellites, daily crop LAI was reconstructed using the Parametric Double-Hyperbolic Tangent model (PDHT) with the aid of Bayesian statistical approach. Time series crop LAI of the hybrid approach had lower variability of estimated parameters in the PDHT and reconstructed daily LAI compared with that of the FDD approach. Based on the Spatial Efficiency Metric (SPAEF) that is a spatial performance metric for assessing spatial pattern similarity, the hybrid approach obtained relatively strong spatial consistency of LAI derived from the two satellites compared with the FDD approach. The study revealed that hybrid approach can achieve good spatiotemporal consistencies in seasonal LAI estimates from the two satellites combined when large numbers of field measurements are not available.

TI  - How time consuming are general practitioners' home visits? Insights from a cross-sectional study in Switzerland
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the number of home visits has been decreasing over past decades. Lack of time and long journeys have been reported to hinder general practitioners (GPs) from conducting home visits. In Switzerland also, home visits have declined. Time constraints in a busy GP practice could be one reason. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the time requirements of home visits in Switzerland.METHODS: A one-year cross-sectional study involving GPs from the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance System (Sentinella) was conducted in 2019. GPs provided basic information on all home visits performed throughout the year and additionally detailed reports of up to 20 consecutive home visits. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were run to identify factors affecting journey and consultation duration.RESULTS: In total, 95 GPs conducted 8489 home visits in Switzerland, 1139 of which have been characterised in detail. On average, GPs made 3.4 home visits per week. Average journey and consultation duration were 11.8 and 23.9 minutes, respectively. Prolonged consultations were provided by GPs working part-time (25.1 minutes), in group practice (24.9 minutes) or in urban regions (24.7 minutes). Rural environments and short journey to patient's home were both found to lower the odds of performing a long consultation compared to a short consultation (odds ratio [OR] 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.44 and OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.77, respectively). Emergency visits (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.21-4.01), out-ofhours appointments (OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.36-3.97) and day care involvement (OR 2.78, 95% CI 2.13-3.62) increased the odds of having a long consultation. Finally, patients in their 60s had markedly higher odds of receiving long consultations than patients in their 90s (OR 4.13, 95% CI 2.27-7.62), whereas lack of chronic conditions lowered the odds of a long consultation (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.00-0.43).CONCLUSION: GPs perform rather few but long home visits, especially for multimorbid patients. GPs working part-time, in group practice or in urban regions devote more time to home visits.

TI  - The retinoid metabolism of<i> Gammarus</i><i> fossarum</i> is disrupted by exogenous all-trans retinoic acid, citral, and methoprene but not by the technical formulation of glyphosate
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, fluctuations of retinoids (RETs), also known as vitamin A and derivatives, have proved to be useful biomarkers to assess the environmental chemical pressure on a wide variety of non-target vertebrates. This use of RET-based biomarkers is of particular interest in the non-target sentinel species Gammarus fossarum in which RETs were shown to influence crucial physiological functions. To study and probe this metabolism in this crustacean model, a UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed to 1) identify and 2) monitor several endogenous RETs in unexposed females throughout their reproductive cycle. Then, females were exposed in controlled conditions to exogenous all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and citral (CIT), a RA synthesis inhibitor, to simulate an excess or deficiency in RA. Perturbation of vitamin A metabolism by pesticides was further studied in response to methoprene (MET), a juvenile hormone analog as well as glyphosate (GLY). The developed method allowed, for the first time in this model, the identification of RA metabolites (all-trans 4-oxo and 13-cis 4-oxo RA), RA isomers (all-trans and 13-cis RA) as well as retinaldehyde (RALD) isomers (all-trans, 11-cis, and 13-cis RALD) and showed two distinct phases in the reproductive cycle. Retinoic acid successfully increased the tissular concentration of both RA isomers and CIT proved to be efficient at perturbating the conversion from RALD to RA. Methoprene perturbed the ratios between RA isomers whereas GLY had no observed effects on the RET system of G. fossarum females. We were able to discriminate different dynamics of RET perturbations by morphogens (atRA or CIT) or MET which highlights the plausible mediation of RETs in MET-induced disorders. Ultimately, our study shows that RETs are influenced by exposure to MET and strengthen their potential to assess aquatic ecosystem chemical status.

AB  - Informal housing refers to the unauthorized residential use of public or private land. In this paper, we study housing supply in markets where informal housing is common. Using a combination of census and satellite data, we estimate housing supply for more than 90 metropolitan areas in Brazil. We find that widespread informal housing increases the housing supply elasticity, partially offsetting the downward pressure of geographical constraints. Our empirical approach is guided by a monocentric city model that includes informal housing. Our identification strategy relies on the use of two novel instruments, combining demographic data and public land ownership.

TI  - Evaluation of E3SM land model snow simulations over the western United States
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow has crucial impacts on climate, ecosystems, and humans, but it is vulnerable to global warming. The land component (ELM) of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) mechanistically simulates snow processes from accumulation, canopy interception, compaction, and snow aging to melt. Although high-quality field measurements, remote sensing snow products, and data assimilation products with high spatio-temporal resolution are available, there has been no systematic evaluation of the snow properties and phenology in ELM. This study comprehensively evaluates ELM snow simulations over the western United States at 0.125(?)degrees resolution during 2001-2019 using the Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) in situ networks, MODIS remote sensing products (i.e., MCD43 surface albedo product), the spatially and temporally complete (STC) snow-covered area and grain size (MODSCAG) and MODIS dust and radiative forcing in snow (MODDRFS) products (STC-MODSCAG/STC-MODDRFS), and the snow property inversion from remote sensing (SPIReS) product and two data assimilation products of snow water equivalent and snow depth - i.e., University of Arizona (UA) and SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). Overall the ELM simulations are consistent with the benchmarking datasets and reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns, interannual variability, and elevation gradients for different snow properties including snow cover fraction (f(sno)), surface albedo (alpha(sur)) over snow cover regions, snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow depth (D-sno). However, there are large biases of f(sno) with dense forest cover and alpha(sur) in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada in winter, compared to the MODIS products. There are large discrepancies of snow albedo, snow grain size, and light-absorbing particle-induced snow albedo reduction between ELM and the MODIS products, attributed to uncertainties in the aerosol forcing data, snow aging processes in ELM, and remote sensing retrievals. Against UA and SNODAS, ELM has a mean bias of -20.7 mm (-35.9 %) and -20.4 mm (-35.5 %), respectively, for spring, and -13.8 mm (-27.8 %) and -10.2 mm (-22.2 %), respectively, for winter. ELM shows a relatively high correlation with SNOTEL SWE, with mean correlation coefficients of 0.69 but negative mean biases of -122.7 mm. Compared to the snow phenology of STC-MODSCAG and SPIReS, ELM shows delayed snow accumulation onset dates by 17.3 and 12.4 d, earlier snow end dates by 35.5 and 26.8 d, and shorter snow durations by 52.9 and 39.5 d, respectively. This study underscores the need for diagnosing model biases and improving ELM representations of snow properties and snow phenology in mountainous areas for more credible simulation and future projection of mountain snowpack.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), "What I Know (WIK)", to provide additional information to verify the reliability of a deep learning model by showing an example of an instance in a training dataset that is similar to the input data to be inferred and demonstrate it in a remote sensing image classification task. One of the expected roles of XAI methods is verifying whether inferences of a trained machine learning model are valid for an application, and it is an important factor that what datasets are used for training the model as well as the model architecture. Our data-centric approach can help determine whether the training dataset is sufficient for each inference by checking the selected example data. If the selected example looks similar to the input data, we can confirm that the model was not trained on a dataset with a feature distribution far from the feature of the input data. With this method, the criteria for selecting an example are not merely data similarity with the input data but also data similarity in the context of the model task. Using a remote sensing image dataset from the Sentinel-2 satellite, the concept was successfully demonstrated with reasonably selected examples. This method can be applied to various machine-learning tasks, including classification and regression.

Particulate matter (2.5 mu m and 10 mu m) exposure had deleterious impacts on the foraging performances of Apis mellifera in the treated area, hence expressing an average foraging rate and speed of 3.0 +/- 0.13 flowers/min and 4.53 +/- 0.45 sec/flower respectively in non-caged plots. Apis dorsata showed a similar pattern in the experimental area and indicated an average rate and speed of 3.39 +/- 0.19 flowers/min and 4.46 +/- 0.21 sec/flower respectively. A depressed bee population was observed in particulate matter simulated hives, hence reflecting smaller broods and lesser honey storage. The rate of non-emerging offspring cells was high (333.2 +/- 48.92 and 200.8 +/- 36.63) than non-incense controlled hive boxes (2.6 +/- 0.58 and 1.1 +/- 0.32) during experimental seasons. The statistical results elucidated a significant relation of PM with larval emergence in incense controlled colonies. The PM substantially degraded the olfaction and flight performance of Apis mellifera visiting bowl traps installed near incense controlled colonies. Comparison between bee visitation rate and bowls installed at 4 feet height asides the boxes were well marked with a high bee visiting rates towards blue and white bowls installed at 4 and 2.5 feet height in controlled territories. An increasing trend of Na (38.51 +/- 0.14 and 43.56 +/- 0.23) and K (24.99 +/- 0.13 and 45.35 +/- 0.35) was evidenced in body fluids of Apis mellifera exposed to agro-industrial PM. The interpretations of experimental findings for PM effects on bees' behaviour and development are discussed for the prevention of these vital pollinators.

TI  - Application of remote sensing data integration in detecting mineralized granitic zones: A case study of the Gabal Al-Ijlah Al-Hamra, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gabal Al-Ijlah Al-Hamra granites in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt are rich in rare metal-bearing minerals. The enhanced Senetinal-2-Planet fused image with 3 m spatial resolution using Gram-Schmidt fused technique was successfully used in detailed discrimination of the rock units in the study area. Various enhanced remote sensing data of Sentinel-2, Landsat-9, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and fused ASTER-Sentinel-2 datasets were used in the mapping process and verified by field investigation and petrographic analysis. The hydrothermal mineralized alteration zones related to rare metal-bearing granites were identified using ASTER and Sentinel-2 fused images. According to petrographic and ASTER mineral indices, various types of alteration zones, including sericitization, chloritization, carbonatization, kaolinitization and silicification were detected. The surface structural features were well detected using Soble directional filtering of Sentinel-1 enhanced image. The major structural directions that have been detected in Al-Ijlah Al-Hamra granitic pluton are NW-SE and NE-SW. These major trends were used to detect potential pathways for migration and concentration of rare-metals. The hyperspectral TerraSpec Halo mineral identifier (ASD) as well as petrographical investigation successfully identified the rock-forming minerals (i.e. quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, biotites, muscovite, chlorite, kaolinite, sericite) of syenogranites and alkali feldspar granites in the Gabal Al-Ijlah Al-Hamra area. Rare metal-bearing minerals including zircon, rutile, allanite, parisite and xen-otime were identified using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spec-troscopy (EDS). The results of remote sensing data, field observations and petrographic investigation are successfully used in exploration for rare metal-bearing minerals in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt and similar areas worldwide.

TI  - The thermal performance of urban form-An analysis on urban structure types in Berlin
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing urban heat issues induced by climatic changes and growing urban populations exacerbate the need for adaptation. The present study intends to foster the so far quite rarely realized transfer from research to real-world planning. Subject of investigation is the thermal performance and characterization of urban structure types (USTs) in Berlin, Germany. Applying Landsat 8 derived land surface temperatures (LSTs), we first determine differences in the temperature patterns of the regarded USTs. Second, after running correlation analyses with LST and potentially influencing factors (NDVI - normalized difference vegetation index, imperviousness, building ratio, and building height), we fit ordinary least square (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. Finally, we relate the GWR results to the USTs and determine the effect of each variable on the respective LST regime. We find significant differences in the thermal performance of USTs, strong correlations between explaining variables and LST, and a sophisticated picture concerning GWR coefficients at various locations. Quasi-global r2 for the GWR (0.83) improves the OLS model value (0.53) considerably. The spatially explicit GWR method in combination with results aggregated on the planning-relevant UST-level provides crucially important information for climate adaptation and planning while being adaptable and transferable to other urban areas.

TI  - Snow and land cover induced surface albedo changes in Northeast China during recent decades
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface albedo in Northeast China has been significantly changed by global climate change and anthropogenic activities over the past several decades. To determine the magnitude and causes of these albedo changes, we evaluated the land surface albedo trends and their causes in Northeast China from 1982 to 2015 using satellite-derived albedo, snow cover, and land cover/use data. The results show that the regional mean trend of the land surface albedo in Northeast China exhibited a strong increasing trend (0.0035 decade(-1)) in spring. Significant increasing trends in land surface albedo were identified in the Hulunbuir Grasslands, Sanjiang Plain, and western and central Songnen Plain, while significant decreasing albedo trends were identified in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the Liaoxi Hills. Our results indicate that the increase in the land surface albedo in Northeast China was primarily driven by the snow cover extent (SCE) and snow cover phenology. The increase in the land surface albedo in spring can be explained by the expansion of the SCE and the delay of the snow end date (SED). Moreover, the land surface albedo in winter and spring was enhanced by the land cover changes (e.g., deforestation and reclamation) due to the vegetation-masking effect on the snow cover. The results of this study can improve our understanding about the impacts of global climate change and human influences on the land surface albedo, and provide theoretical and policy bases for environmental protection and climate engineering.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes and driving forces of reclamation based on remote sensing: A case study of the Guangxi Beibu Gulf
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2000, coastal reclamation projects have been implemented in the Guangxi Beibu Gulf to alleviate the shortage of coastal land resources. As a result, the reclamation area has increased significantly. In this study, based on the Landsat program, we tracked coastal reclamation in the coastal waters of Guangxi in the 21st century. An indicator system was proposed to assess the driving forces of reclamation synthetically. Our results showed that 98.6 km(2) of coastal waters of the Guangxi Beibu Gulf was reclaimed from 1997 to 2017, in which three regions underwent great changes: Fangcheng Bay, Tieshan Bay, and Qiznhou Bay. Furthermore, spatio-temporal changes of reclamation were affected by the combination of population growth, economic development, and marine industry development in coastal cities. These results provide an important historical reference for tracking the human development processes of the Guangxi Beibu Gulf, and also offer some suggestions for the rational allocation of reclamation resources.

TI  - Modelling spatial-temporal expansion of Lilongwe City using Shannon's entropy model through semi-dynamic environmental mapping and analysis
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study involves analysis of the urban spatial-temporal expansion of Lilongwe City from 1973 to 2020 using Shannon's entropy model through time-series satellite mapping. Landsat images from 1973 to 2020 in a nearly 10-year interval are used to determine spatial-temporal land use/cover changes. The city is zoned into 1 km concentric rings and four pie sections to determine both directional and spatial urban expansion trends while Shannon's entropy model is employed to determine the degree of dispersity of the city's sprawl. A linear regression model incorporating population as an explanatory variable is then applied to predict the spatial expansion trends for Lilongwe City. Results show that the built-up area in Lilongwe City expanded by 465.4% (9.9% per year) from 1973 to 2020, making it the second-largest land use/cover type in the city, after vegetation. Consequently, vegetation cover decreased by - 32.7% (- 0.7% per year) during the same period. High relative entropy indices (> 0.9) obtained from Shannon's entropy model indicate a dispersed urban development for the city during the entire period of study. The North-West quadrant of the city has the highest proportion of urban expansion while the North-East quadrant has the lowest proportion, in a relative sense. Regression model predictions show that the city will most likely continue to expand by the year 2023 and then increase exponentially by the year 2033, due to high population growth. The results of this study will assist city authorities to control the expansion of the city and anticipate patterns for future urban sprawl.

TI  - Biomass burning CO, PM and fuel consumption per unit burned area estimates derived across Africa using geostationary SEVIRI fire radiative power and Sentinel-5P CO data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first top-down CO fire emissions inventory for Africa based on the direct relation between geostationary satellite-based fire radiative power (FRP) observations and polar-orbiting satellite observations of total column carbon monoxide (TCCO). This work significantly extends the previous Fire Radiative Energy Emissions (FREM) approach that derived total particulate matter (TPM) emission coefficients from FRP and aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations. The use of satellite-based CO observations to derive biome-specific CO emission coefficients, ECCOb, addresses key uncertainties in the use of AOD observations to estimate fire-generated CO emissions including the requirement for a smoke mass extinction coefficient in the AOD to TPM conversion and the large variation in TPM emission factors - which are used to convert TPM emissions to CO emissions. We use the FREM-derived CO emission coefficients to produce a pan-African CO fire emission inventory spanning 2004 to 2019. Regional CO emissions are in close agreement with the most recent version of GFED(v4.1s), despite the two inventories using completely different satellite datasets and methodologies. Dry matter consumed (DMC) and DMC per unit burned area are generated from our CO emission inventory - the latter using the 20 m resolution Sentinel-2 FireCCISFD burnt area (BA) product for 2019. We carry out an evaluation of our FREM-based CO emissions by using them as input in the WRF-CMAQ chemical transport model and comparing simulated TCCO fields to independent Sentinel-5P TROPOMI TCCO observations. The results of this evaluation show FREM CO emissions to generally be in good agreement with these independent measures - particularly in the case of individual fire-generated CO plumes, where modelled in-plume CO was within 5 % of satellite observations with a coefficient of determination of 0.80. Modelled and observed total CO, aggregated over the full model domain, are within 4 % of each other, though localised regions show an overestimation of modelled CO by up to 50 %. When compared to other evaluations of current state-of-the-art fire emissions inventories, the FREM CO emission inventory derived in this work shows some of the best agreement with independent observations. Updates to previously published FREM TPM emissions coefficients based on this methodology are also provided, along with a similar evaluation as conducted for CO. The methodology described in this work is forming the basis of a forthcoming near-real-time fire emissions product from Meteosat to be issued by the EUMETSAT LSA SAF (https://landsaf.ipma.pt/en/, last access: 19 December 2022).

AB  - This study uses novel evolutionary algorithms and computational techniques to analyze wind potential on flat, complex coastal, and offshore sites utilizing mast as well as remote sensing data. The wind data were recorded using remote sensing technique and conventional technique. The optimum Weibull parameters are estimated using nine methods. The genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and TLBO algorithms are compared and evaluated. The goodness of fit test, such as root mean square error test (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and chi-square test (X-2), is used to evaluate the accuracy of the selected methods. Parameter estimates are used to compute wind densities. The TLBO and PSO algorithms outperformed genetic algorithms in terms of efficiency. This research compares remote sensing measurements to cup anemometer measurements.

TI  - Object-based classification of urban plant species from very high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are facing too many challenges. Urban vegetation, in particular trees, are essential as they provide services in terms of air pollution mitigation, freshness, biodiversity, and citizens' well-being. Accurate data on location, species, and structural characteristics are essential for quantifying their benefits. However, the cost of measuring thousands of individual trees through field campaigns can be prohibitive and reliable information on domestic gardens is lacking due to difficulties in acquiring systematic data. The main objective of this study was to investigate the suitability of very-high resolution satellite imagery, e.g., WorldView-2, for detecting, delineating, and classifying the urban plant species in both public and private areas. The characterization of urban vegetation is difficult due to the complexity of the urban environment (buildings, shadows, open courtyards), the diversity of species and the spatial proximity between trees. To overcome these constraints, an object-based classification was developed with the selection of new relevant spectral and texture-based features for each plant species. Four spectral bands (blue, green, yellow, red) and four texture features (i.e., energy, entropy, inverse difference moment, Haralick correlation) were found to be the most efficient attributes for object-based classification from WV-2 images. Then, a classification of plant species, by using a Random Forest classifier, and ground validation were performed. In the two study areas, Aix-en-Provence (France) and Florence (Italy), 22 and 20 dominant plant species, and grassland, were identified and classified with an overall accuracy of 84% and 83%, respectively. The highest classification accuracy was obtained for Pinus spp. and Platanus acerifolia in Aix-en-Provence, and for Celtis australis and Cupressus sempervirens in Florence. The lowest classification accuracy was obtained for Quercus spp. in Aix-en-Provence, and Magnolia grandiflora in Florence.

TI  - The effects of meteorology and biomass burning on urban air quality: The case of Bangkok
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangkok, one of the biggest metropolitan cities in Asia, has been experiencing poor (PM10 > 50 mu g/m(3) annual average) air quality for decades. Major sources of air pollution are traffic emissions, biomass burning, and non-combustible sources. In this study, the impact of meteorology and biomass burning on the concentration of particulate matter was assessed. Data from three monitoring stations and remotely sensed fire count between 2017 and 2020 was used to investigate the association. Moreover, the spatiotemporal pattern of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fire count derived from remotely sensed data were investigated to observe their association. This study found that temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction have a significant negative relationship with particulate matter concentration. In contrast, atmospheric pressure and fire count have a significant positive correlation with particulate matter concentration. Moreover, the pollution rose diagram for particulate matter indicated that the northeasterly wind is the prevailing wind direction that carries the most pollutants. Furthermore, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and AOD indicated that biomass burning in neighboring regions significantly (p < 0.05) affected the particulate matter concentration in Bangkok. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis established that atmospheric pressure has the highest negative impact on the city air quality, followed by biomass burning, while heavy rainstorms were the most substantial parameter that reduced particulate matter concentration. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of meteorological factors in understanding air pollution mechanisms in Bangkok. Equally important, the insights gained from this study may assist in addressing the long-range transport of air pollutants from biomass burning, which requires a coordinated engagement with neighboring countries.

TI  - Mapping retrogressive thaw slumps using deep neural networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are thermokarst features in ice-rich hillslope permafrost terrain, and their occurrence in the warming Arctic is increasingly frequent and has caused dynamic changes to the landscape. RTS can significantly impact permafrost stability and generate substantial carbon emissions. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of RTS is a critical step to understanding and modelling greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost thaw. Mapping RTS using conventional Earth observation approaches is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature and often small scale of RTS in the Arctic. In this study, we trained deep neural network models to map RTS across several landscapes in Siberia and Canada. Convolutional neural networks were trained with 965 RTS features, where 509 were from the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas in Siberia, and 456 from six other pan-Arctic regions including Canada and Northeastern Siberia. We further tested the impact of negative data on the model performance. We used 4-m Maxar commercial imagery as the base map, 10-m NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 and 2-m elevation data from the ArcticDEM as model inputs and applied image augmentation techniques to enhance training. The best-performing model reached a validation Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.74 and a test IoU score of 0.71. Compared to past efforts to map RTS features, this represents one of the best-performing models and generalises well for mapping RTS in different permafrost regions, representing a critical step towards pan-Arctic deployment. The predicted RTS matched very well with the ground truth labels visually. We also tested how model performance varied across different regional contexts. The result shows an overall positive impact on the model performance when data from different regions were incorporated into the training. We propose this method as an effective, accurate and computationally undemanding approach for RTS mapping.

TI  - Retrieve of total suspended matter in typical lakes in China based on broad bandwidth satellite data: Random forest model with Forel-Ule Index
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Total Suspended Matter is the core parameter of water color remote sensing and the important indicator for water quality evaluation of lakes. Rapid and high-precision monitoring of TSM is an important guarantee for water quality remote-sensing applications. China has launched many broad-bandwidth remote sensing satellites, all of which have similar bandwidth. The coordinated observation of multiple satellites can effectively meet the large-scale and high-frequency dynamic monitoring requirements of TSM concentration in lakes. This study proposed a machine-learning model to retrieve the TSM concentration from broad bandwidth satellites. The reliability and accuracy of various retrieve models (i.e., linear regression model, support vector regression model, random forest model, and back propagation neural networks model) were evaluated through the in-situ datasets of TSM concentration in lakes. The RF model was selected as the retrieved model of TSM concentration using broad bandwidth satellites. The results showed that 1) Compared with four machine learning models, the RF model can provide better performance ( R 2 = 0.88 , Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 22.5%). Similarly, compared with the documented six TSM retrieve model, the RF retrieve model also has substantial advantages. 2) the Forel-Ule Index (FUI) can effectively enhance the precision and accuracy of the TSM retrieve model. 3) The RF model has good generalization ability and accuracy in the validation datasets (Lake Chagan: MAPE = 3.7%, Lake Changdang: MAPE = 4.3%). 4) The RF model was applied to the broad bandwidth satellites retrieve of TSM concentrations in Lake Bosten, Lake Chagan, and Lake Changdang, and the MAPEs were 5.3%, 8.1%, and 12.1%, respectively. This study showed that the RF model could effectively improve the retrieve performance and generalization ability of the broad bandwidth satellite's TSM concentration, which meets the accuracy requirements of high-frequency dynamic monitoring of TSM concentration.

TI  - Discover the Desirable Landscape Structure of Urban Parks for Mitigating Urban Heat: A High Spatial Resolution Study Using a Forest City, Luoyang, China as a Lens.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Urban parks can mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) and effectively improve the urban microclimate. In addition, quantifying the park land surface temperature (LST) and its relationship with park characteristics is crucial for guiding park design in practical urban planning. The study's primary purpose is to investigate the relationship between LST and landscape features in different park categories based on high-resolution data. In this study, we identified the land cover types of 123 parks in Luoyang using WorldView-2 data and selected 26 landscape pattern indicators to quantify the park landscape characteristics. The result shows that the parks can alleviate UHI in most seasons, but some can increase it in winter. While the percentage of bare land, PD, and PAFRAC have a positive impact on LST, AREA_MN has a significant negative impact. However, to deal with the current urban warming trend, a compact, clustered landscape configuration is required. This study provides an understanding of the major factors affecting the mitigation of thermal effects in urban parks (UP) and establishes a practical and feasible urban park renewal method under the idea of climate adaptive design, which provides valuable inspiration for urban park planning and design.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of NO2 and its driving factors in the coastal ports of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is one of the major air pollutants in coastal ports of China. Understanding the spatiotemporal varying effects of driving factors of NO2 is vital for the implementation of differentiated air pollution control measures for different port areas. Based on the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data, we adopted a Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model to explore the influences of meteorological and socioeconomic factors on the NO2 Vertical Column Concentrations (VCDs) in coastal ports of China from 2015 to 2021. The results indicate that NO2 VCD in most ports has decreased since 2016 and the ports with serious NO2 pollution are mainly dis-tributed in northern China. The associations between NO2 VCD levels and their drivers exhibit obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Higher wind speed and relative humidity are more helpful to alleviate NO2 pollution in ports of the Bohai Rim and the Pearl River Delta. Cargo throughput has more closely associated with NO2 pollution in Beibu Gulf in recent years, yet there is no significant association found for Shanghai ports. The positive relationship between transportation emissions and NO2 VCD is more significant in southern ports. This work provides some implications for the formulation of targeted emission reduction policies for different ports along the Chinese coast.

TI  - Conflict or Coordination? measuring the relationships between urbanization and vegetation cover in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relationship between urbanization and vegetation is essential for sustainable urban devel-opment. Over the last few decades, China has experienced rapid and dramatic urbanization along with impressive land transformations. However, the dynamic relationship between urban expansion and vegetation cover lacks enough understanding. We proposed an urbanization-vegetation cover coordination index (UVCI) by combining the physical boundaries of cities at 10-year intervals and the 250 m vegetation index, and measured the conflict or coordination relationships between urbanization and vegetation cover for 338 cities in China from 1990 to 2018. The results show that China has experienced a process of rapid, large-scale, but uneven urban expansion over the past 30 years, with urban areas expanding by approximately 556 %. Urbanization has made China's urban areas less green, yet vegetation cover changes vary between newly developed and older urban areas. There is a substantial tendency for vegetation degradation in the newly urbanized areas, whereas vege-tation cover has generally improved in the older urban areas. The vegetation in non-urban areas has been showing a noticeable greening trend after 2010, with NDVI maintaining an annual growth rate of 0.89 %. The relationship between urbanization and urban vegetation cover in China is becoming increasingly coordinated. The proportion of conflict cities decreased from 93 % in 1990-2000 to 15 % in 2010-2018. The spatial het-erogeneity of the UVCI is apparent, with northern Chinese cities having achieved a largely coordinated urban-vegetation relationship, while most southern cities still face challenges. The methodology of this study can be used as a reference for subsequent research, and the findings can help shape government policies that will support green and sustainable urban development in China.

TI  - Global agricultural ammonia emissions simulated with the ORCHIDEE land surface model
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is an important atmospheric constituent. It plays a role in air quality and climate through the formation of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate particles. It has also an impact on ecosystems through deposition processes. About 85 % of NH3 global anthropogenic emissions are related to food and feed production and, in particular, to the use of mineral fertilizers and manure management. Most global chemistry transport models (CTMs) rely on bottom-up emission inventories, which are subject to significant uncertainties. In this study, we estimate emissions from livestock by developing a new module to calculate ammonia emissions from the whole agricultural sector (from housing and storage to grazing and fertilizer application) within the ORCHIDEE (Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems) global land surface model. We detail the approach used for quantifying livestock feed management, manure application, and indoor and soil emissions and subsequently evaluate the model performance. Our results reflect China, India, Africa, Latin America, the USA, and Europe as the main contributors to global NH3 emissions, accounting for 80 % of the total budget. The global calculated emissions reach 44 TgNyr(-1) over the 2005-2015 period, which is within the range estimated by previous work. Key parameters (e.g., the pH of the manure, timing of N application, and atmospheric NH3 surface concentration) that drive the soil emissions have also been tested in order to assess the sensitivity of our model. Manure pH is the parameter to which modeled emissions are the most sensitive, with a 10 % change in emissions per percent change in pH. Even though we found an underestimation in our emissions over Europe (-26 %) and an overestimation in the USA (+56 %) compared with previous work, other hot spot regions are consistent. The calculated emission seasonality is in very good agreement with satellite-based emissions. These encouraging results prove the potential of coupling ORCHIDEE land-based emissions to CTMs, which are currently forced by bottom-up anthropogenic-centered inventories such as the CEDS (Community Emissions Data System).

TI  - EVI and NDVI as proxies for multifaceted avian diversity in urban areas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most ecological studies use remote sensing to analyze broad-scale biodiversity patterns, focusing mainly on taxonomic diversity in natural landscapes. One of the most important effects of high levels of urbanization is species loss (i.e., biotic homogenization). Therefore, cost-effective and more efficient methods to monitor biological communities' distribution are essential. This study explores whether the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can predict multifaceted avian diversity, urban tolerance, and specialization in urban landscapes. We sampled bird communities among 15 European cities and extracted Landsat 30-meter resolution EVI and NDVI values of the pixels within a 50-m buffer of bird sample points using Google Earth Engine (32-day Landsat 8 Collection Tier 1). Mixed models were used to find the best associations of EVI and NDVI, predicting multiple avian diversity facets: Taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, specialization levels, and urban tolerance. A total of 113 bird species across 15 cities from 10 different European countries were detected. EVI mean was the best predictor for foraging substrate specialization. NDVI mean was the best predictor for most avian diversity facets: taxonomic diversity, functional richness and evenness, phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic species variability, community evolutionary distinctiveness, urban tolerance, diet foraging behavior, and habitat richness specialists. Finally, EVI and NDVI standard deviation were not the best predictors for any avian diversity facets studied. Our findings expand previous knowledge about EVI and NDVI as surrogates of avian diversity at a continental scale. Considering the European Commission's proposal for a Nature Restoration Law calling for expanding green urban space areas by 2050, we propose NDVI as a proxy of multiple facets of avian diversity to efficiently monitor bird community responses to land use changes in the cities.

TI  - Archaeological prospection using WorldView-3 short-wave infrared (SWIR) satellite imagery: Case studies from the Fertile Crescent
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Geologists have long valued satellite imagery in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) part of the electromagnetic spectrum (1100-2500 nm) because it can reveal subtle differences in minerology and soil moisture that are otherwise invisible, but the low spatial resolution (20-30 m) of publicly available SWIR imagery has limited its utility for archaeological investigations. As part of a NASA-funded research project, this paper presents results of an effort to evaluate the potential of higher resolution (3.7 m), 8-band SWIR imagery from the WorldView-3 satellite programme to aid in the identification and mapping of archaeological sites and landscape features in the Fertile Crescent. With case studies in the Amuq Plain of southern Turkey, the Khabur Plain of eastern Syria, and the Diyala Plain of southern Iraq, we utilize several methods including experiments with numerous band combinations, production of band ratios designed for crop cover analysis and support vector machine (SVM) classification techniques to enhance site visibility in multispectral SWIR imagery. Results reveal some of the seasonal, land use/cover and other factors that can impact the visibility of archaeological sites and features, demonstrating the potential and pitfalls of this emerging remote sensing resource.

TI  - Multiple spatial and temporal scales of deformation from geodetic monitoring point to active transcrustal magma system at Uturuncu volcano, Bolivia
T2  - GEOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Uturuncu volcano in southern Bolivia last erupted around 250 ka but is exhibiting signs of recent activity, including over 50 yr of surface uplift, elevated seismic activity, and fumarolic activity. We studied the spatial and temporal scales of surface deformation from 1992 to 2021 to better understand sub surface activity. We tracked Uturuncu's recent deformation using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) station UTUR, located near Uturuncu's summit. We observed a spatially coherent signal of uplift from 2014 to 2021 from Sentinel-1 A/B satellites that indicates the Altiplano-Puna magma body, located 19-24 km below ground level, and previously noted as the source of the large region of deformation, is still active. The ground is now uplifting at a rate of similar to 3 mm/yr compared to prior rates of similar to 10 mm/yr. We corroborated this waning uplift with in situ data from station UTUR. We combined the Sentinel-1 data with TerraSAR-X interferograms to constrain an similar to 25 km(2) region of subsidence located 11 km SSW of Uturuncu, with a source depth of 2.1 km below ground level to an active period of similar to 2.5 yr with similar to 5 mm/yr subsidence. We developed a conceptual model that relates these varying depths and time scales of activity in a transcrustal magmatic system. We associate the surface uplift with pressurization from ascending gases and brines from magmatic reservoirs in the midcrust. We infer the existence of brine lenses in the shallow hydrothermal system based on low subsurface resistivity correlated with surface subsidence.

TI  - Increasing the accuracy and efficiency of wildlife census with unmanned aerial vehicles: a simulation study
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Context. Manned aerial surveys are an expensive endeavour, which is one of the core reasons for insufficient data coverage on wildlife monitoring in many regions. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a valid, cost-efficient alternative, but the application of UAVs also comes with challenges.Aim. In this explorative simulation study, our aim was to develop an efficient layout of UAV surveys that could potentially overcome challenges related to double counts of individuals and even area coverage, and that would minimise off-effort travel costs.Methods. Based on different simulated survey layouts we developed hypothetically for the Katavi National Park in Tanzania, we quantified the advantages that UAVs might offer. We then compared these findings with manned aerial surveys.Key results. The proposed new survey design and layout indicated an increase in survey efficiency of up to 21% when compared with conventional survey designs using parallel transect lines. Despite the complex flight pattern, the accuracy of the flight paths of the UAV outcompeted those of manned aerial surveys. The adapted survey layout enabled a team of two operators with a small battery-powered UAV to cover an area of up to 1000 km(2) per day, without specific infrastructural requirements.Conclusion. Our calculations may serve as a vital spark for innovation for future UAV survey designs that may have to deal with large areas and complex topographies while reducing operational effort. Implications. UAV applications, if well designed, provide useful complementation, if not replacement, for manned aerial surveys and other remotely sensed data collections. Our suggested survey design is transferable to other study regions, and may be useful for applying UAVs efficiently.

TI  - Genomic selection models substantially improve the accuracy of genetic merit predictions for fillet yield and body weight in rainbow trout using a multi-trait model and multi-generation progeny testing
T2  - GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn aquaculture, the proportion of edible meat (FY = fillet yield) is of major economic importance, and breeding animals of superior genetic merit for this trait can improve efficiency and profitability. Achieving genetic gains for fillet yield is possible using a pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) model with direct and indirect selection. To investigate the feasibility of using genomic selection (GS) to improve FY and body weight (BW) in rainbow trout, the prediction accuracy of GS models was compared to that of PBLUP. In addition, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the traits. All analyses were performed using a two-trait model with FY and BW, and variance components, heritability, and genetic correlations were estimated without genomic information. The data used included 14,165 fish in the pedigree, of which 2742 and 12,890 had FY and BW phenotypic records, respectively, and 2484 had genotypes from the 57K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array.ResultsThe heritabilities were moderate, at 0.41 and 0.33 for FY and BW, respectively. Both traits were lowly but positively correlated (genetic correlation; r = 0.24), which suggests potential favourable correlated genetic gains. GS models increased prediction accuracy compared to PBLUP by up to 50% for FY and 44% for BW. Evaluations were found to be biased when validation was performed on future performances but not when it was performed on future genomic estimated breeding values.ConclusionsThe low but positive genetic correlation between fillet yield and body weight indicates that some improvement in fillet yield may be achieved through indirect selection for body weight. Genomic information increases the prediction accuracy of breeding values and is an important tool to accelerate genetic progress for fillet yield and growth in the current rainbow trout population. No significant QTL were found for either trait, indicating that both traits are polygenic, and that marker-assisted selection will not be helpful to improve these traits in this population.

TI  - Development of a deep convolutional neural network model for detection and delineation of coal mining regions
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present study aims to design a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model for the detection and delineation of coal mining regions. The study also examined the effect of the image size of the training dataset and the validation dataset using three different image size databases [DB6 is an element of (6 x 6 x 3), DB12 is an element of (12 x 12 x 3), and DB24 is an element of (24 x 24 x 3)]. The results indicated that the classification accuracies of DB6, DB12, and DB24 training datasets are 99.89%, 99.96%, and 99.91%, respectively, and that of validation datasets are 99.60%, 99.50%, and 99.87%, respectively. The results indicated that the classification accuracies with DB6, DB12, and DB24 training and validation datasets are nearly the same (> 99%) in each case but the boundary delineation with lower size image training dataset was more smooth. Therefore, the dataset of DB6 is an element of (6 x 6) was further used for change detection analysis through transfer learning. Landsat series data for 1989, 2000, 2011, and 2022 were selected for classification using the proposed model. The results indicate that the coverage area of the coal mining region increased by 2% (= 0.04 Sq.km) in 1989-00, and 22.37% (= 0.58 Sq.km) in 2011-22, and thereafter decreased by 3.36% (= 0.07 Sq.km) in 2000-11. Therefore, proper land management practices and active organization of coal production should be advanced to protect against undesirable land-use change. The results of the study on change detection could provide valuable information for decision-makers to land-use planners in mining regions.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of grassland vegetation on the Mongolian Plateau and its response to climate change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mongolian Plateau is an arid and semi-arid region with grassland as its main vegetation. It has a fragile ecosystem and is a sensitive area for global warming. The study is based on MODIS NDVI data and growth season meteorological data from 2000 to 2018, this study examined the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of grassland vegetation on the Mongolian Plateau during the growing season using trend analysis, partial correlation analysis, and residual analysis, and it explores the dual response of NDVI changes to climate and human activities. The study's findings demonstrated that the growing season average NDVI of grassland vegetation on the plateau gradually increased from southwest to northeast during the growing season; the growing season average NDVI demonstrated a significant overall increase of 0.023/10a (p < 0.05) from 2000 to 2018, with an increase rate of 0.030/10a in Inner Mongolia and 0.019/10a in Mongolia; the area showing a significant increase in NDVI during the growing season accounted for 91.36% of the entire study area. In Mongolian Plateau grasslands during the growing season of 2000-2018, precipitation and downward surface shortwave radiation grew significantly at rates of 34.83mm/10a and 0.57 W/m2/10a, respectively, while average air temperature decreased slightly at a rate of -0.018 degrees C/10a. Changes in meteorological factors of grassland vegetation varied by region as well, with Inner Mongolia seeing higher rates of precipitation, lower rates of average air temperature, and lower rates of downward surface shortwave radiation than Mongolia. On the Mongolian Plateau, the NDVI of grassland vegetation in the growing season showed a significant positive correlation with precipitation (0.31) and a significant negative correlation with average air temperature (-0.09) and downward surface shortwave radiation (-0.19), indicating that increased in NDVI was driven by an increase in precipitation paired with a decrease in air temperature and a decrease in surface shortwave radiation. The overall increase in NDVI caused by human activity in the grasslands of the Mongolian Plateau was primarily positive, with around 18.37% of the region being beneficial. Climate change and human activity both affect NDVI variations in Mongolian Plateau grasslands, which are spatially heterogeneous. Moderate ecological engineering and agricultural production activities are crucial for vegetation recovery. This work is crucial to further understanding surface-atmosphere interactions in arid and semi-arid regions in the context of global climate change.

TI  - Characteristics of ringed seal Pusa hispida ('natchiq') denning habitat in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, during a year of limited sea ice and snow
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice and snow are essential to Arctic ecosystems, playing key roles in the lives of Arctic marine mammals and the Indigenous Peoples who rely on them. Ringed seals Pusa hispida ('natchiq' in Inupiaq) use snow-covered dens on sea ice for pupping, but quantitative information on denning habitat requirements is limited, and it is unknown how changes in snow depth and sea-ice extent will impact ringed seals. Here, an Indigenous Elder Advisory Council and a multidisciplinary group of scientists used knowledge co-production to quantify fine-scale ringed seal habitat selection patterns in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska (USA), during a year of unprecedentedly limited snow and sea-ice availability. Together, we conducted unoccupied aerial vehicle-based surveys during spring 2019 and related seal counts to survey date, bathymetry, and novel proxies for snow depth and surface roughness that we derived from Landsat 8 surface reflectance and validated with on-ice measurements. Generalized additive models showed that counts of seal groups (all age classes) and pups were associated with later survey dates, deeper water, and habitat with bright Landsat 8 pixel values and intermediate pixel variability, which in turn were correlated with deep snow and surface roughness. We observed shallow snow depths, early sea-ice breakup, and high seal densities consistent with the extreme lack of ice available in 2019. Indigenous Knowledge, intentionally woven with scientific data, provided novel and more nuanced understandings of snow and sea-ice conditions for seals. Our results may give a glimpse at future ringed seal habitat and selection in a warming Arctic.

TI  - Dreaming On: Dying Behaviour and the Romantic-Individualist Ethos
T2  - SECULARISM & NONRELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades and, most recently because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying topics related to dying and death in various fields of research. Research has started to explore, in more detail, death and bereavement among nonreligious people in contemporary Western societies. It is now well established that this large social group finds its own meaningful ways to come to terms with grief, loss and finitude. However, these studies typically do not include the perspectives of those living with life-threatening illness and facing death. Drawing on one and a half years of ethnographic research conducted among patients receiving palliative care in Switzerland, this study explores how a nonreligious orientation and other facets of human existence influence emotions and meaning making while dying. This is exemplified by the case of an atheist who I picked from the totality of fieldwork encounters in order to illuminate the nuances and complexities of living with terminal illness. The study found that secular and individualist values make it difficult to find closure and accept death. At the same time, the results show that the identification with the secular features of a worldview can increase well-being by ensuring a sense of permanence in actions and meaning-making habits in dying. Furthermore, this article makes the case for studying attitudes towards dying and death in relation to time and life situation.

AB  - The effects of climate change and rapid population growth increase the demand for freshwater, particularly in arid and hyper-arid environments, considering that groundwater is an essential water resource in these regions. The main focus of this research was to generate a groundwater potential map in the Center Eastern Desert, Egypt, using a random forest classification machine learning model. Based on satellite data, geological maps and field survey, fifteen effective features influencing groundwater potentiality were created. These effective features include elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, terrain ruggedness index, curvature, lithology, lineament density, distance from major fractures, topographic wetness index, stream power index, drainage density, rainfall, as well as distance from rivers and channels, soil type and land use/land cover. Collinearity analysis was used for feature selection. A 100 dependent points (57 water points and 43 non-potential mountainous areas) were labeled and classified according to hydrogeological conditions in the three main aquifers (Basement, Nubian and Quaternary Aquifers) in the study area. The random forest algorithm was trained using (70%) of the dependent points. Then, it was validated using (30%) and the hyper-parameters were optimized. Groundwater potential map was predicted and classified as good (5.1%), moderate (0.1%), poor (4.2%) and non-potentiality (90.6%). Sensitivity (92%), F1-score (94%) and accuracy (97%) are validation methods used due to the imbalanced dataset problem. The most important effective features for groundwater potential map were determined based on the random forest and the receiver operating characteristics curve. Groundwater management sustainability was discussed based on the predicted groundwater potential map and aquifer conditions. Therefore, the random forest model is helpful for delineating groundwater potential zones and can be used in similar locations all over the world.

TI  - A pilot sentinel surveillance system to monitor treatment and treatment outcomes of chronic hepatitis B and C infections in clinical centres in three European countries, 2019
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization European Action Plan 2020 targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis are that > 75% of eligible individuals with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) are treated, of whom > 90% achieve viral suppression. Aim: To report the results from a pilot sentinel surveillance to monitor chronic HBV and HCV treatment uptake and outcomes in 2019. Methods: We undertook retrospec-tive enhanced data collection on patients with a con-firmed chronic HBV or HCV infection presenting at one of seven clinics in three countries (Croatia, Romania and Spain) for the first time between 1 January 2019 and 30 June 2019. Clinical records were reviewed from date of first attendance to 31 December 2019 and data on sociodemographics, clinical history, labora-tory results, treatment and treatment outcomes were collected. Treatment eligibility, uptake and case out-come were assessed. Results: Of 229 individuals with chronic HBV infection, treatment status was reported for 203 (89%). Of the 80 individuals reported as eligi-ble for treatment, 51% (41/80) were treated of whom 89% (33/37) had achieved viral suppression. Of 240 individuals with chronic HCV infection, treatment sta-tus was reported for 231 (96%). Of 231 eligible indi-viduals, 77% (179/231) were treated, the majority of whom had received direct acting antivirals (99%, 174/176) and had achieved sustained virological response (98%, 165/169). Conclusion: Treatment tar-gets for global elimination were missed for HBV but not for HCV. A wider European implementation of sen-tinel surveillance with a representative sample of sites could help monitor progress towards achieving hepati-tis control targets.

TI  - Intermediate-thickness melanoma: A population-based study of surgical quality metrics
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Variability in guideline compliance for melanoma lymph node surgery is partially attributable to controversy about patient selection. Prior data has indicated suboptimal practice of sentinel lymph node biopsy and undertreatment of clinically node-positive disease, predating Multicenter Se-lective Lymphadenectomy Trial II publication. To minimize bias, we studied compliance with lymph node surgery guidelines in T2/T3 (intermediate-thickness) melanoma patients, where the greatest agreement exists.Methods: T2/T3 and metastasis 0 melanoma cases were identified from 2004 to 2018 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Analysis used Cochran-Armitage test for trends, multivariable logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.Results: Of 66,319 eligible T2/T3 patients, 57,211 were clinically node negative; 2,191 were clinically node positive; 6,197 were clinical node unreported; and 19,044/66,319 (28.8%) had no lymph node surgery. Among clinically node-negative patients, 36,433 (63.7%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and 31,026 (85.2%) were pathologically node negative; 1,499 clinically node-positive patients (68.4%) had a lymph node dissection. Lymph node dissection rates declined from 2004 to 2018, 79.8% to 32.0% for clinically node-negative/pathologically node-positive patients and 80.4% to 61.2% for clinically node-positive/pathologically node-positive patients (both P < .0001). For clinically node-negative patients, lymph node surgery compliance improved from 63.7% (2004) to 70.4% (2018) (P < .0001). Compliance correlated with younger age, male sex, tumor mitotic rate, and site (extremity > trunk/head/neck) in multivariable analysis and improved 5-year cancer-specific survival (90.0% vs 83.4%) (all P < .0001).Conclusions: Despite clear guidelines, one-third of intermediate-thickness melanoma patients in a recent cohort did not have recommended lymph node surgery. Lymph node status is a key determinant of the relative benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy and the need for active surveillance of pathologically node-positive/clinically node-negative patients. These data highlighted a clinical care gap. Efforts to improve guideline compliance are a logical strategy to improve cancer outcomes for intermediate-thickness melanoma patients.

TI  - National wetland mapping using remote-sensing-derived environmental variables, archive field data, and artificial intelligence
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - While wetland ecosystem services are widely recognized, the lack of fine-scale national in-ventories prevents successful implementation of conservation policies. Wetlands are difficult to map due to their complex fine-grained spatial pattern and fuzzy boundaries. However, the increasing amount of open high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data and accurately georefer-enced field data archives, as well as progress in artificial intelligence (AI), provide opportunities for fine-scale national wetland mapping. The objective of this study was to map wetlands over mainland France (ca. 550,000 km2) by applying AI to environmental variables derived from remote sensing and archive field data. A random forest model was calibrated using spatial cross-validation according to the precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) index using ca. 135,000 soil or flora plots from archive databases, as well as 5 m topographical variables derived from an airborne DTM and a geological map. The model was validated using an experimentally designed sampling strategy with ca. 3000 plots collected during a ground survey in 2021 along non-wetland/wetland transects. Map accuracy was then compared to those of nine existing wetland maps with global, European, or national coverage. The model-derived suitability map (PR-AUC 0.76) highlights the gradual boundaries and fine-grained pattern of wetlands. The bi-nary map is significantly more accurate (F1-score 0.75, overall accuracy 0.67) than existing wetland maps. The approach and end-results are of important value for spatial planning and environmental management since the high-resolution suitability and binary maps enable more targeted conservation measures to support biodiversity conservation, water resources mainte-nance, and carbon storage.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of slope-type debris flow activity in Horlachtal, Austria, based on orthophotos and lidar data since 1947
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to get a better understanding of the future development of alpine slope-type debris flows in the frame of climate change, complete and gapless records of the last century for this type of geomorphologic process are necessary. However, up to now such records have been scarce. Here, the slope-type debris flow activity in Horlachtal, Austria, has been investigated since 1947 with the help of historic and recent area-wide remote sensing data. Using geomorphological mapping, both spatial and temporal variabilities in debris flow dynamics can be shown. The results indicate short-term variations rather than consistent increasing or decreasing trends of slope-type debris flow activity in Horlachtal. Specifically, three active periods between 1954 and 1973, 1990 and 2009, as well as 2015 and 2018, can be registered. Analyses of the deposited debris flow volumes show that for parts of the study area the largest volumes appeared in the early 1990s, which might have even influenced the dynamics in the following years. Studies on the spatial variabilities revealed differences of slope-type debris flow activity within the study area and point to local rainfall events as triggers. However, long-term precipitation data of high temporal resolution of two alpine meteorological stations do not reveal increasing or decreasing trends in the occurrence of such events.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Assessment of Land Use Land Cover Changes and Their Impact on Variations of Land Surface Temperature in Aligarh Municipality
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon. However, it has been rapid in the developing world since the late twentieth century. This anthropogenic process is largely responsible for modifying earth's surface, causing substantial transformations in land use land cover (LULC) and resulting in considerable changes in land surface temperature (LST) and increasing intensity of urban heat islands (UHIs). Aligarh city in Uttar Pradesh is also observing rapid urbanization since the last few decades due to its proximity to the national capital, i.e. (Delhi), and thus experiencing a notable shift in land use land cover and LST. Using Landsat TM and OLI data for the years 2000, 2010 and 2019, this article attempts to assess modifications in land use and land cover and also how they influence land surface temperature in the present study. The results indicate that among all the LULC classes, area under the built-up class has increased dramatically over the span of nineteen years from 1900.8 ha in 2000 to 2680.11 ha in 2019. However, all other classes except vegetation, i.e. open land, agriculture and water bodies, have recorded a reduction in their area by - 9.99%, - 7.17% and - 0.5%, respectively, from 2000 to 2019. LST is extracted for the month of May and December during the same time period and depicts that the maximum temperature for both months is reported around the built-up area and open land. UHIs are also created which reveal a close relationship with LULC and LST. Various statistical techniques like correlation, regression and scatter plots are utilized to show the relationship of each LULC with LST and UHIs and also with three spatial indices, i.e. NDBI, NDVI and NDWI.

TI  - Impacts of urbanization, LULC, LST, and NDVI changes on the static water table with possible solutions and water policy discussions: A case from Islamabad, Pakistan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization, coupled with land use land cover changes (LULC), has caused stress on freshwater resources around the globe. As in the case of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, the population has increased significantly, creating a deficit of natural resources and affecting the environment adversely. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of urbanization and LULC on the decline of the static water table in Islamabad. It also seeks to analyze water policy issues in order to achieve sustainable water resource development. The excessive pumping of the existing groundwater has exceeded the safe limit, which is justified by the constantly growing population. However, the changes in the LULC of the study area have turned many green pastures into barren land. Our research data were obtained from the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), and Landsat Satellite images. After analyzing PMD and CDA data for the last 20 years (2000-2020), the results were interpreted using Arc GIS. It has been observed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value increases as the Land Surface Temperature (LST) decreases. Therefore, the overall observation is a decreasing trend in Islamabad temperatures due to the increased vegetation in the study area during the period of 2000-2020. It was observed that there has been a considerable drop in water levels due to over-pumping in a few areas. It is primarily associated with the increasing population of the capital in the last 2 decades. This study uses a survey to explore the potential locations for check dams to enhance and recharge the groundwater aquifers in the capital, Islamabad. It suggests catchment areas throughout the Margalla Hills along with different localities, such as Rumli Village, Trail 5, and Shahdara.

TI  - Global patterns of water storage in the rooting zones of vegetation
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global estimations of the water-storage capacity in the rooting zone from satellite data reveal plant access to deep water across a third of Earth's vegetated surface.The rooting-zone water-storage capacity-the amount of water accessible to plants-controls the sensitivity of land-atmosphere exchange of water and carbon during dry periods. How the rooting-zone water-storage capacity varies spatially is largely unknown and not directly observable. Here we estimate rooting-zone water-storage capacity globally from the relationship between remotely sensed vegetation activity, measured by combining evapotranspiration, sun-induced fluorescence and radiation estimates, and the cumulative water deficit calculated from daily time series of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Our findings indicate plant-available water stores that exceed the storage capacity of 2-m-deep soils across 37% of Earth's vegetated surface. We find that biome-level variations of rooting-zone water-storage capacities correlate with observed rooting-zone depth distributions and reflect the influence of hydroclimate, as measured by the magnitude of annual cumulative water-deficit extremes. Smaller-scale variations are linked to topography and land use. Our findings document large spatial variations in the effective root-zone water-storage capacity and illustrate a tight link among the climatology of water deficits, rooting depth of vegetation and its sensitivity to water stress.

TI  - The CALIPSO version 4.5 stratospheric aerosol subtyping algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate classification of aerosol types injected into the stratosphere is important to properly characterize their chemical and radiative impacts within the Earth climate system. The updated stratospheric aerosol subtyping algorithm used in the version 4.5 (V4.5) release of the Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) level 2 data products now delivers more comprehensive and accurate classifications than its predecessor. The original algorithm identified four aerosol subtypes for layers detected above the tropopause: volcanic ash, smoke, sulfate/other, and polar stratospheric aerosol (PSA). In the revised algorithm, sulfates are separately identified as a distinct, homogeneous subtype, and the diffuse, weakly scattering layers previously assigned to the sulfate/other class are recategorized as a fifth "unclassified " subtype. By making two structural changes to the algorithm and revising two thresholds, the V4.5 algorithm improves the ability to discriminate between volcanic ash and smoke from pyrocumulonimbus injections, improves the fidelity of the sulfate subtype, and more accurately reflects the uncertainties inherent in the classification process. The 532 nm lidar ratio for volcanic ash was also revised to a value more consistent with the current state of knowledge. This paper briefly reviews the previous version of the algorithm (V4.1 and V4.2) then fully details the rationale and impact of the V4.5 changes on subtype classification frequency for specific events where the dominant aerosol type is known based on the literature. Classification accuracy is best for volcanic ash due to its characteristically high depolarization ratio. Smoke layers in the stratosphere are also classified with reasonable accuracy, though during the daytime a substantial fraction are misclassified as ash. It is also possible for mixtures of ash and sulfate to be misclassified as smoke. The V4.5 sulfate subtype accuracy is less than that for ash or smoke, with sulfates being misclassified as smoke about one-third of the time. However, because exceptionally tenuous layers are now assigned to the unclassified subtype and the revised algorithm levies more stringent criteria for identifying an aerosol as sulfate, it is more likely that layers labeled as this subtype are in fact sulfate compared to those assigned the sulfate/other classification in the previous data release.

TI  - Assessing the effect of strong wind events on the transport of particulate organic carbon in the Changjiang River estuary over the last 40 years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global climate change, the frequency of strong wind events are increasing. These extreme events have more significantly altered the marine environment than normal events; however, relevant in-situ measurements are usually lacking for such extreme events. In our previous study, we established a method to estimate particulate organic carbon (POC) flux by combining satellite data with a numerical model. Based on this method, this study aimed to quantify the impact of typhoons and strong seasonal winds (with a wind speed of >10.8 m/s) on POC flux and transport outside the Changjiang River estuary (CRE). Wind data in CRE during 2010-2019 revealed that the annual durations of strong winds (849.7 +/- 111.7 h/yr) and typhoons (204.4 +/- 64.5 h/yr) increased by 15.3% and 143.3%, respectively, compared to those during 1980-2009. The seasonal durations of typhoons and strong winds during 2010-2019 increased in autumn and in winter and spring, respectively. Considering northward Typhoon Bolaven as an example, we found that its passage strengthened the southward POC transport and the POC erosion outside CRE. Four scenarios with special wind characteristics were further simulated to analyze the annual effect of strong winds on POC transport. The proportion of northerly winds in strong winds affected the southward POC transport, whereas strong winter winds triggered 23.0% of the southward transport of POC flux. Finally, based on eight groups of numerical simulation experiments, the increasing proportion of northerly winds in strong wind events during 2010-2019 enhanced the southward POC transport and POC erosion by 15.9% and 2.8%, respectively, compared with the transport and erosion during 1980-2009. The increased durations of typhoons in autumn and strong winds in winter are expected to increase the proportion of northerly winds in extreme winds, thus enhancing the southward POC transport in CRE and affecting the southeastern coast of China. The combination of high-spatiotemporal-resolution satellite data and the numerical model provides novel insights into the impact of short-term wind extremes on POC transport in the estuary, with important implications for relevant biogeochemical processes, in particular, carbon cycle, in the coastal ocean.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are a major global public health concern and mosquito surveillance systems are essential for the implementation of effective mosquito control strategies. The objective of our study is to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of vector mosquito species in Maricopa County, AZ from 2011 to 2021, and to identify the hotspot areas for West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis Encephalitis virus (SLEV) transmission in 2021. The Maricopa County Mosquito Control surveillance system utilizes BG-Sentinel and EVS-CDC traps throughout the entire urban and suburban areas of the county. We estimated specific mosquito species relative abundance per unit area using the Kernel density estimator in ArcGIS 10.2. We calculated the distance between all traps in the surveillance system and created a 4 km buffer radius around each trap to calculate the extent to which each trap deviated from the mean number of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex tarsalis collected in 2021. Our results show that vector mosquito species are widely distributed and abundant in the urban areas of Mar-icopa County. A total of 691,170Cx. quinquefasciatus, 542,733 Cx. tarsalis, and 292,305 Aedes aegypti were collected from 2011 to 2022. The relative abundance of Ae. aegypti was highly seasonal peaking in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Culex quinquefasciatus, on the other hand, was abundant throughout the year with several regions consistently yielding high numbers of mosquitoes. Culex tarsalis was abundant but it only reached high numbers in well-defined areas near irrigated landscapes. We also detected high levels of heterogeneity in the risk of WNV and SLEV transmission to humans disregarding traps geographical proximity. The well-defined species-specific spatiotemporal and geographical patterns found in this study can be used to inform vector control operations.

TI  - HyFormer: Hybrid Transformer and CNN for Pixel-Level Multispectral Image Land Cover Classification.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - To effectively solve the problems that most convolutional neural networks cannot be applied to the pixelwise input in remote sensing (RS) classification and cannot adequately represent the spectral sequence information, we propose a new multispectral RS image classification framework called HyFormer based on Transformer. First, a network framework combining a fully connected layer (FC) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed, and the 1D pixelwise spectral sequences obtained from the fully connected layers are reshaped into a 3D spectral feature matrix for the input of CNN, which enhances the dimensionality of the features through FC as well as increasing the feature expressiveness, and can solve the problem that 2D CNN cannot achieve pixel-level classification. Secondly, the features of the three levels of CNN are extracted and combined with the linearly transformed spectral information to enhance the information expression capability, and also used as the input of the transformer encoder to improve the features of CNN using the powerful global modelling capability of the Transformer, and finally the skip connection of the adjacent encoders to enhance the fusion between different levels of information. The pixel classification results are obtained by MLP Head. In this paper, we mainly focus on the feature distribution in the eastern part of Changxing County and the central part of Nanxun District, Zhejiang Province, and conduct experiments based on Sentinel-2 multispectral RS images. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of HyFormer for the study area classification in Changxing County is 95.37% and that of Transformer (ViT) is 94.15%. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of HyFormer for the study area classification in Nanxun District is 95.4% and that of Transformer (ViT) is 94.69%, and the performance of HyFormer on the Sentinel-2 dataset is better than that of the Transformer.

TI  - Hyperspectral response and monitoring study of soil moisture content based on the optimized spectral index
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture controls the exchange of energy between the land surface and the atmosphere and significantly affects plant growth and productivity. Hyperspectral (350-2500 nm) monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) could provide a theoretical basis for the real-time estimation of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture. During this study, we have developed SMC prediction models in different soil moisture ranges by using the combination of spectral preprocessing methods and optimized spectral indices. Results indicated that first-order derivative (FD) preprocessing method can highlight the effective information of the spectra and improve the correlation between spectral reflectance and SMC. The spectral reflectance exhibited a strong correlation with SMC near 1400, 1700, 1900, and 2200 nm. The FD-NDSI-W0-model had the best SMC prediction and applicability (R-2 = 0.977, root mean square error = 3.413%, relative percent deviation = 6.171) to predict SMCs. Overall, pretreatment methods, combined with the two-band random combination to optimize the spectral index to build a prediction model of SMC, could be applied for accurate monitoring of SMC.

TI  - A review on street view observations in support of the sustainable development goals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - With limited time to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world needs effective, scalable approaches to measure and monitor global progress toward the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given that many SDGs are closely related to the environment in which people live, satellite data are commonly used for SDG assessment, but they are only based on a top-down view and have inherent technical issues (e.g., insufficient spatial resolution and cloud coverage). In recent years, street view imagery (SVI), as an emerging source of remote sensing data, has been an indispensable supplement to monitor SDGs, by recording the environment from an eye-level view. However, the systematic and comprehensive understanding of SVI applications to promote SDGs is insufficient. We reviewed SVI-related studies of SDGs and found that SVI is mainly used for good health and well-being (SDG 3), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), zero hunger (SDG 2), and climate action (SDG 13). The SVI-based greenery view index was the most common element feature related to SDGs. The SVIderived human perception features were also often used to assess SDG 3 and SDG 11. Future studies may further investigate the potential mechanisms between SVI-based features and SDGs. This review provides a comprehensive summary and guidance for governments and scholars worldwide to assess SDGs based on SVI in the future.

TI  - Contralateral lymph node metastasis in recurrent ipsilateral breast cancer with Lynch syndrome: a locoregional event
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionContralateral axillary lymph node metastasis (CALNM) in breast cancer (BC) is considered a distant metastasis, marking stage 4cancer. Therefore, it is generally treated as an incurable disease. However, in clinical practice, staging and treatment remain controversial due to a paucity of data, and the St. Gallen 2021 consensus panel recommended a curative approach in patients with oligometastatic disease. Aberrant lymph node (LN) drainage following previous surgery or radiotherapy is common. Therefore, CALNM may be considered a regional event rather than systemic disease, and a re-sentinel procedure aided by lymphoscintigraphy permits adequate regional staging.Case reportHere, we report a 37-year-old patient with Lynch syndrome who presented with CALNM in an ipsilateral relapse of a moderately differentiated invasive ductal BC (ER 90%, PR 30%, HER2 negative, Ki-67 25%, microsatellite stable), 3 years after the initial diagnosis. Lymphoscintigraphy detected a positive sentinel LN in the contralateral axilla despite no sign of LN involvement or distant metastases on FDG PET/CT or MRI. The patient underwent bilateral mastectomy with sentinel node dissection, surgical reconstruction with histological confirmation of the CALNM, left axillary dissection, adjuvant chemotherapy, and anti-hormone therapy. In addition to her regular BC follow-up visits, the patient will undergo annual colonoscopy, gastroscopy, abdominal, and vaginal ultrasound screening. In January 2023, the patient was free of progression for 23 months after initiation of treatment for recurrent BC and CALNM.ConclusionThis case highlights the value of delayed lymphoscintigraphy and the contribution of sentinel procedure for local control in the setting of recurrent BC. Aberrant lymph node drainage following previous surgery may be the underlying cause of CALNM. We propose that CALNM without evidence of systemic metastasis should be considered a regional event in recurrent BC, and thus, a curative approach can be pursued. The next AJCC BC staging should clarify the role of CALNM in recurrent BC to allow for the development of specific treatment guidelines.

TI  - <i>TreeSatAI</i><i> Benchmark</i><i> Archive:</i> a multi-sensor, multi-label dataset for tree species classification in remote sensing
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Airborne and spaceborne platforms are the primary data sources for large-scale forest mapping, but visual interpretation for individual species determination is labor-intensive. Hence, various studies focusing on forests have investigated the benefits of multiple sensors for automated tree species classification. However, transferable deep learning approaches for large-scale applications are still lacking. This gap motivated us to create a novel dataset for tree species classification in central Europe based on multi-sensor data from aerial, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. In this paper, we introduce the TreeSatAI Benchmark Archive, which contains labels of 20 European tree species (i.e., 15 tree genera) derived from forest administration data of the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany. We propose models and guidelines for the application of the latest machine learning techniques for the task of tree species classification with multi-label data. Finally, we provide various benchmark experiments showcasing the information which can be derived from the different sensors including artificial neural networks and tree-based machine learning methods. We found that residual neural networks (ResNet) perform sufficiently well with weighted precision scores up to 79 % only by using the RGB bands of aerial imagery. This result indicates that the spatial content present within the 0.2 m resolution data is very informative for tree species classification. With the incorporation of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, performance improved marginally. However, the sole use of Sentinel-2 still allows for weighted precision scores of up to 74 % using either multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models. Since the dataset is derived from real-world reference data, it contains high class imbalances. We found that this dataset attribute negatively affects the models' performances for many of the underrepresented classes (i.e., scarce tree species). However, the class-wise precision of the best-performing late fusion model still reached values ranging from 54 % (Acer) to 88 % (Pinus). Based on our results, we conclude that deep learning techniques using aerial imagery could considerably support forestry administration in the provision of large-scale tree species maps at a very high resolution to plan for challenges driven by global environmental change.

TI  - IT-SNOW: a snow reanalysis for Italy blending modeling, in situ data, and satellite observations (2010-2021)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present IT-SNOW, a serially complete and multi-year snow reanalysis for Italy (similar to 301 x 10(3) km(2)) - a transitional continental-to-Mediterranean region where snow plays an important but still poorly constrained societal and ecological role. IT-SNOW provides similar to 500 m daily maps of snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, bulk snow density, and liquid water content for the initial period 1 September 2010-31 August 2021, with future updates envisaged on a regular basis. As the output of an operational chain employed in real-world civil protection applications (S3M Italy), IT-SNOW ingests input data from thousands of automatic weather stations, snow-covered-area maps from Sentinel-2, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and H SAF products, as well as maps of snow depth from the spatialization of over 350 on-the-ground snow depth sensors. Validation using Sentinel-1-based maps of snow depth and a variety of independent, in situ snow data from three focus regions (Aosta Valley, Lombardy, and Molise) show little to no mean bias compared to the former, and root mean square errors are of the typical order of 30-60 cm and 90-300 mm for in situ, measured snow depth and snow water equivalent, respectively. Estimates of peak SWE by IT-SNOW are also well correlated with annual streamflow at the closure section of 102 basins across Italy (0.87), with ratios between peak water volume in snow and annual streamflow that are in line with expectations for this mixed rain-snow region (22 % on average and 12 % median). Examples of use allowed us to estimate 13.70 +/- 4.9 Gm3 of water volume stored in snow across the Italian landscape at peak accumulation, which on average occurs on 4 March +/- 10 d. Nearly 52 % of the mean seasonal SWE is accumulated across the Po river basin, followed by the Adige river (23 %), and central Apennines (5 %). IT-SNOW is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7034956 (Avanzi et al., 2022b) and can contribute to better constraining the role of snow for seasonal to annual water resources - a crucial endeavor in a warming and drier climate.

TI  - Geodetic evidence of land subsidence in Cirebon, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The subsidence phenomena occur in numerous cities in Indonesia (Jakarta, Bandung, and Semarang) and have been observed over the last few decades using geodetic techniques such as interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Three variables are considered the leading causes of substantial subsidence in those cities: urban development, excessive groundwater removal, and geological context. Considering these considerations, we assess surface displacement in the surrounding area of Cirebon, Indonesia, which has similar background circumstances. We used 43 Sentinel-1A images covering from 2014 to 2021 and processed them using the small baseline subset (SBAS) method obtaining 78 interferograms for time series analysis. A weighted correction from two weather models was used to correct tropospheric errors. The results from the InSAR time series were compared with the continuous GNSS time series (2010-2021) processed using GAMIT/GLOBK GNSS processing softwares. Cirebon experienced a slow land subsidence rate with an average magnitude of-2.6 mm/yr. Furthermore, we underline that more significant subsidence rates were found in several locations. Conic-shaped subsidence with a diameter of around 1 km was observed in a highly inhabited area, with a maximum rate of up to-17 mm/yr near the cone's center. We also found more prominent land subsidence along the coastline with magnitudes up to-25 mm/yr. Surface lowering with a magnitude of up to-32 mm/yr also affects power plant regions close to Cirebon city. Meanwhile, the fastest subsidence rate was observed over the salt evaporation field area of about-50 mm/yr. We attribute the natural and anthropogenic factors to causing the subsidence in this area.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-3A altimetry over Songhua river Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimetry is an important tool for monitoring water levels of inland water bodies, particularly in poorly gauged or ungauged areas. This study reveals for the first time the performance of water levels derived from Sentinel-3A altimetry in the Songhua River Basin in northeast China. This study compares water levels derived via different retrackers (SAMOSA+, OCOG, Ocean, MWaPP, and NPPR) from altimetry in virtual stations (VSs) to water levels measured by gauges. To improve the influence of sandbars or islands and surrounding land cover, a modified retracker called AMPD-PF (Automatic Multiscale-based Peak Detection retracker using Physically-based model Fitting) is implemented here, by combing the physical modeling of SAR altimeter waveform with a shortest-path algorithm to find the best possible sub-waveform representing the signal of water bodies. The accuracy assessment is based on comparing water level anomalies from 26 VSs and those from the nearest adjacent gauges with an average distance of 8.98 km in the Songhua River Basin from 2016 to 2019. The median of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) differences at the virtual stations ranges from 0.46 to 0.82 m, and the median of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) among different retracker varies from 0.49 to 0.85 among different retracker. The performance of Sentinel-3A altimetry in the Songhua River Basin is not poor. Results also show a highest accuracy of water levels from AMPD-PF, especially for the non-flood season (January to June and October to December). In addition, we find that, especially for the virtual stations unaffected by the sand bars and islands, AMPD-PF give the best performance with a median RMSE value of 0.33 m and a median NSE value of 0.86. Factor analysis indicates that the variations of these metrics can not be directly related to the river width but might be related to the cultivated land types and the presence of sand bars and islands in the vicinity of rivers over the Songhua River Basin. Moreover, it is confirmed that a near-parallel orientation of the river with respect to the satellite ground track often leads to poorer performance at virtual stations. This suggests that if one is aiming at calibrating a hydrodynamic or hydrological model by combining altimetry, the VSs with the near -parallel orientation are not necessary to be considered when the percentage of the non-parallel crossings of all crossings is big enough.

TI  - Inka <i>Unku</i>: Imperial or provincial? State-local relations
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Standardized Inka tunics, or unku, were created under the auspices of the state as symbolic expressions of its expansionist power. To ensure these textiles acquired the status of effective insignias of power and territorial control, the Inka established and imposed technical and stylistic canons for their production (techne) by means of highly-skilled state weavers. In the provinces, social groups that came under imperial rule, local expert weaving agents adopted the conventions of the state and included meaningful symbolic elements of the idiosyncrasies, traditions, and experiential knowledge of the local community (metis). We therefore propose that this was not a unidirectional process and that the Caleta Vitor Inka unku (hereon referred to as the CV unku), presented here, reflects a syncretism promoted by local weavers. In terms of methods, we have developed a decoding tool for the unku, with the aim of distinguishing state from local hallmarks, thereby revealing the syncretic complexity of these iconic tunics. This methodological tool is based on a series of standard analytical parameters and attributes linked to morphological, technological, and stylistic features, which we applied to the CV unku. Unlike others, this unku does come from a looted tomb but was scientifically excavated in a cemetery located in the Caleta Vitor Bay in northern Chile. By deconstructing the CV unku we determined the steps in the chaine operatoire at which local technical and stylistic elements were incorporated, thus affecting or transforming, in part, its emblematic imperial imagery. This study also marks a step forward in our understanding of a syncretic landscape that combines the state worldview and organized production system (imperial Inka) with craft-production practices that were rooted in provincial and local communities (provincial Inka).

TI  - Dynamics of green spaces- Land surface temperature intensity nexus in cities of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the dynamics of green spaces and land surface temperature patterns in four cities in Ethiopia were investigated using Landsat imagery. The typical characteristics of LST over the past three decades (1990-2020) in relation to green space dynamics were first investigated; subse-quently, the spatial distribution of LST was characterized based on hybrid geospatial techniques and mono-window algorithm analysis, in which the contributions of green spaces to LST were studied. In addition, the multiple linear regression method and spatial regression models (SRMs) were employed to investigate and predict the spatial dependence of LST and urbanization-induced green space dynamics. Results show that cities horizontally expanded unceasingly from 1990 to 2020, with a substantial discrepancy in expansion rates and the spatial patterns of UHI intensities among the cities (p < 0.05). Moreover, the area proportion of the UHI is signif-icantly larger than that of the UGS, and the differences in the UGS cooling contribution were found in different land uses and zones of the cities. In the study periods, the spatial pattern of LST was significantly controlled by NDBI, and its coefficient in the OLS followed the pattern NDVI > MNDWI > latitudes > longitudes > population density > DEM. Due to the large proportions of buildings While green land and water bodies show significant capability to mitigate UHI effects, cooling effects are not apparent when their sizes are small. Besides, the SRMs show that UHI intensities were significantly influenced by MNDWI in Bahir Dar and Hawassa (p < 0.01).Cities' LAMBDA coefficients have a positive relationship with UHII (p < 0.01). Our study could help city planners and the government understand the current cooling potential of existing UGS to mitigate the dynamics of UHI and sustain the sustainability of green space management in cities.

TI  - Intraday forecast of global horizontal irradiance using optical flow method and long short-term memory model
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecast methodologies are routinely employed to mitigate the instability of photovoltaic power and, more importantly, to secure early participation in the energy auction market. The intra-day forecast model substantially consists of the combination of a cloud motion vector (CMV) derivation and a GHI extraction model. This study utilized optical flow (OF) method to calculate CMV from two subsequent satellite images and predict cloud displacement up to 180 min ahead. Meanwhile, the conventional GHI extraction models (Hammer and the fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) models) were employed to extract future GHI. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have been dedicated to combining OF method with deep learning model. Hence, this study proposed a novel combination based on OF method and long short-term memory model (LSTM) to enhance temporal horizon and accuracy. After all combinations of OF method and GHI models were simulated and assessed under all-sky conditions, the OF method that combined with LSTM outperformed the OF method combined with conventional models across all time horizons. For root mean square error (RMSE) and forecast skill (FS), the accuracy of OF and LSTM models for all time horizon ranges from 59.64 W/m2 to 120.63 W/m2 and 16.40 % to 54.42 %, respectively. The study findings are expected to encourage the inclusion of satellite data in GHI forecast as well as the optimization of energy management systems that integrate with a photovoltaic system.

TI  - The many shades of red tides: Sentinel-2 optical types of highly-concentrated harmful algal blooms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have severe environmental and economic impacts worldwide. Improving HAB detection is crucial because massive blooms are likely to increase in both frequency and amplitude in the next decades due to global warming and escalating coastal eutrophication. While satellite remote sensing has proved useful to detect red tides and support HAB monitoring, the discrimination of the dominant bloom-forming species is still a challenge, all the more as the observation of highly concentrated phytoplankton patches can be hampered by a too coarse spatial resolution. Moreover, the majority of HAB studies generally had a regional focus, and a limited number of species were separately documented so far. Here, we provide a broader perspective for red tides remote sensing to better resolve HAB optical and taxonomical diversity. The main objective of the present study was to identify how many optical bloom types could be recognized with the high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite mission. For that purpose, an extensive database of massive, nearly monospecific blooms, both documented in situ and using synchronous S2 observation was compiled. More than 100 S2 images of various red tides were selected worldwide. Altogether, the S2 database covered the typical reflectance spectra of 27 red tide forming species. The remote-sensing reflectance of each red tide was analysed to evaluate S2 ability to distinguish the dominant species of the bloom. A hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that six optical bloom types could be identified: (1) surface accumulation of cyanobacteria or of green Noctiluca scintillans, (2) surface accumulation of red N. scintillans (a purely heterotrophic plankton devoid of chlorophyll a), (3) red tides of Mesodinium rubrum (a phycoerythrin-bearing ciliate), (4) green seawater discolorations of Lepidodinium chlorophorum (a dinoflagellate with unusual carotenoids), (5) blooms dominated by a dinoflagellate such as Prorocentrum, Gymnodinium, Lingulodinium polyedra, Gonyaulax or Alexandrium, and (6) brown tides dominated by a dinoflagellate (such as Karenia, Karlodinium veneficum, Protoceratium reticulatum, Margalefidinium polykrikoides, or Tripos fusus), a prymnesiophyte (Phaeocystis), or a pelagophyte (Aureococcus anophagefferens). While the results presented here are inherently limited by the concomitant availability of in situ and S2 observations, as well as by S2 spectral resolution, it is a step forward to an improved understanding of HAB bio-optical diversity.

TI  - Coral Gardens Reef, Belize: An <i>Acropora</i> spp. refugium under threat in a warming world
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Live coral cover has declined precipitously on Caribbean reefs in recent decades. Acropora cervicornis coral has been particularly decimated, and few Western Atlantic Acropora spp. refugia remain. Coral Gardens, Belize, was identified in 2020 as a long-term refugium for this species. This study assesses changes in live A. cervicornis coral abundance over time at Coral Gardens to monitor the stability of A. cervicornis corals, and to explore potential threats to this important refugium. Live coral cover was documented annually from 2012-2019 along five permanent transects. In situ sea-surface temperature data were collected at Coral Gardens throughout the study period and compared with calibrated satellite data to calculate Maximum Monthly Mean (MMM) temperatures and Degree Heating Weeks (DHW). Data on bathymetry, sediment, substrate, herbivore abundance, and macroalgal abundance were collected in 2014 and 2019 to assess potential threats to Coral Gardens. Live coral cover declined at all five transect sites over the study period. The greatest loss of live coral occurred between 2016 and 2017, coincident with the earliest and highest maximum average temperatures recorded at the study site, and the passage of a hurricane in 2016. Structural storm damage was not observed at Coral Gardens, though live coral cover declined after the passage of the storm. Uranium-thorium (Th-230) dating of 26 dead in situ fragments of A. cervicornis collected in 2015 from Coral Gardens revealed no correlation between coral mortality and tropical storms and hurricanes in the recent past. Our data suggest that several other common drivers for coral decline (i.e. herbivory, predation, sedimentation, pH) may likely be ruled out for Coral Gardens. At the end of the study period, Coral Gardens satisfied most criteria for refugium status. However, the early onset, higher mean, and longer duration of above-average temperatures, as well as intermittent temperature anomalies likely played a critical role in the stability of this refugium. We suggest that temperature stress in 2016 and perhaps 2015 may have increased coral tissue vulnerability at Coral Gardens to a passing hurricane, threatening the status of this unique refugium.

TI  - A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Water Body Segmentation from Satellite Images
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning techniques became crucial in analyzing satellite images for various remote sensing applications such as water body detection. Water body segmentation helps identify and analyze the statistics of various water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Remote sensing-based real-time water body detection aids in providing a proper response during crises such as floods and course changes in rivers. However, the need for high-resolution multichannel satellite images is the main challenge in achieving a highly accurate water body segmentation. Most water body extraction methods described in the literature use multi-band satellite data that gather extra information from additional bands. However, the lack of such a dataset poses a significant challenge to the analysis. As a result, the research in this field is considerably weaker compared with the other related disciplines. The current study focuses on a research problem for segmenting water body regions from relatively low- to moderate-resolution RGB images without using additional multispectral channels. The overall segmentation pipeline uses a customized encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model enhanced with attention gates. The architecture uses a customized deep supervised U-Net architecture with residual connections. The network is also integrated with convolution block attention module (CBAM) gates to focus the target region on improving segmentation performance. The main contributions of the proposed model include the use of satellite image sample selection with a customized pre-processing pipeline use of a novel CNN segmentation architecture by integrating various boosting modules such as attention units, deep supervision, and residual blocks. The overall performance is tested with a public satellite dataset, and the results are evaluated on standard benchmark metrics. The segmentation results show improved performance compared with state-of-the-art water body approaches for low-resolution satellite images. The proposed model outperformed the best state-of-the-art model in precision, sensitivity, Dice score, specificity, and accuracy by 3%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and 5% respectively.

TI  - Investigation of the similarities between NDVI maps from different proximal and remote sensing platforms in explaining vineyard variability
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices (VI), especially the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), are used to determine management units (MU) and to explain quantity and quality of vineyard production. How do NDVI maps from different sensing technologies differ in a production context? What part of the variability of yield and quality can they explain? This study compares high-resolution multispectral, multi-temporal data from CropCircle, SpectroSense + GPS, Parrot Sequoia + multispectral camera equipped UAV, and Sentinel-2 imagery over two seasons (2019 and 2020). The objective was to assess whether the date of data collection (phenological growth stage) influences the correlations between NDVI and crop production. The comparison of vineyard NDVI data from proximal and remote sensing in both a statistical and a productive context showed strong similarities between NDVI values from similar sensors (0.69 < r < 0.96), but divergences between proximal and airborne/spaceborne observations. Exploratory correlation analysis between NDVI layers and grape yield and total soluble solids data (TSS) showed high correlations (maximum |r|= 0.91 and |r|= 0.74, respectively), with correlations increasing as the season progressed. No relationship with must titratable acidity or pH was found. Finally, proximal sensors explained better the variability in yield and quality for grapes in the early and late growth stages. The UAV's MUs described the yield of both years better than the other sensors. In 2019, the PCA-based MUs explained the TSS variability better than the UAV-related zones. Due to their coarse spatial resolution, the satellite data proved inconsistent in explaining the variability.

TI  - Nitrogen dioxide as proxy indicator of air pollution from fossil fuel burning in New Delhi during lockdown phases of COVID-19 pandemic period: impact on weather as revealed by Sentinel-5 precursor (5p) spectrometer sensor
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There has been a long-lasting impact of the lockdown imposed due to COVID-19 on several fronts. One such front is climate which has seen several implications. The consequences of climate change owing to this lockdown need to be explored taking into consideration various climatic indicators. Further impact on a local and global level would help the policymakers in drafting effective rules for handling challenges of climate change. For in-depth understanding, a temporal study is being conducted in a phased manner in the New Delhi region taking NO2 concentration and utilizing statistical methods to elaborate the quality of air during the lockdown and compared with a pre-lockdown period. In situ mean values of the NO2 concentration were taken for four different dates, viz. 4th February, 4th March, 4th April, and 25th April 2020. These concentrations were then compared with the Sentinel (5p) data across 36 locations in New Delhi which are found to be promising. The results indicated that the air quality has been improved maximum in Eastern Delhi and the NO2 concentrations were reduced by one-fourth than the pre-lockdown period, and thus, reduced activities due to lockdown have had a significant impact. The result also indicates the preciseness of Sentinel (5p) for NO2 concentrations.

TI  - Important role of precipitation in controlling a more uniform spring phenology in the Qinba Mountains, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Under global warming, the gradual pattern of spring phenology along elevation gradients (EG) has significantly changed. However, current knowledge on the phenomenon of a more uniform spring phenology is mainly focused on the effect of temperature and neglected precipitation. This study aimed to determine whether a more uniform spring phenology occurs along EG in the Qinba Mountains (QB) and explore the effect of precipitation on this pattern. We used Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering to extract the start of season (SOS) of the forest from the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) during 2001-2018 and determined the main drivers of the SOS patterns along EG by partial correlation analyses. The SOS showed a more uniform trend along EG in the QB with a rate of 0.26 +/- 0.01 days 100 m(-1) per decade during 2001-2018, but there were differences around 2011. A delayed SOS at low elevations was possibly due to the reduced spring precipitation (SP) and spring temperature (ST) between 2001 and 2011. Additionally, an advanced SOS at high elevations may have been caused by the increased SP and reduced winter temperature (WT). These divergent trends contributed to a significant uniform trend of SOS with a rate of 0.85 +/- 0.02 days 100 m(-1) per decade. Since 2011, significantly higher SP (especially at low elevations) and rising ST advanced the SOS, and the SOS at lower altitudes was more advanced than at higher altitudes, resulting in greater SOS differences along EG (0.54 +/- 0.02 days 100 m(-1) per decade). The SP determined the direction of the uniform trend in SOS by controlling the SOS patterns at low elevations. A more uniform SOS may have important effects on local ecosystem stability. Our findings could provide a theoretical basis for establishing ecological restoration measures in areas experiencing similar trends.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The current generation of children must grow up with different competencies to thrive in this highly complex and interconnected world. Amongst others, we need to equip them with twenty-first century skills that include curiosity, self-direction, creativity, innovation, and an inquiring mindset. We are short-changing our children if we teach them the way we were taught. In this era, education must emphasise discovery and facilitate inquiry and problem-solving, and learning should be self-directed and collaborative, as well as meaningful and transferable. From this perspective, teacher education cannot be about teacher training. It must be about developing professional leaders in the field of education. Drawing from Singapore's experience of preparing teachers for the twenty-first century, this paper will touch on the four pillars of teacher education in the recent development of the Nanyang Technological University-National Institute of Education Teaching Scholars Programme, the enhanced Bachelor of Arts/Science (Education), and the 16-month Postgraduate Diploma in Education Programmes. The four pillars are deepening professionalism, strengthening practice, broadening pedagogies, and developing perspectives. In essence, the paper will focus on developing thinking professionals through (1) ownership of learning and inquiry that deepen professionalism; (2) reflective practice and focused conversations that strengthen teaching competencies and crystallise teacher identity; (3) pedagogical innovations and technology-enabled learning that develop facilitators of learning and architects of learning environment; and (4) a three-pronged approach of the 'community as coach', the 'industry as partner', and the 'world as our classroom' that facilitates a worldview and fosters new ways of thinking.

TI  - Deep learning and data fusion to estimate surface soil moisture from multi-sensor satellite images
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a new architecture based on a fully connected feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to estimate surface soil moisture from satellite images on a large alluvial fan of the Kosi River in the Himalayan Foreland. We have extracted nine different features from Sentinel-1 (dual-polarised radar backscatter), Sentinel-2 (red and near-infrared bands), and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (digital elevation model) satellite products by leveraging the linear data fusion and graphical indicators. We performed a feature importance analysis by using the regression ensemble tree approach and also feature sensitivity to evaluate the impact of each feature on the response variable. For training and assessing the model performance, we conducted two field campaigns on the Kosi Fan in December 11-19, 2019 and March 01-06, 2022. We used a calibrated TDR probe to measure surface soil moisture at 224 different locations distributed throughout the fan surface. We used input features to train, validate, and test the performance of the feed-forward ANN model in a 60:10:30 ratio, respectively. We compared the performance of ANN model with ten different machine learning algorithms [i.e., Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Radial Basis Network (RBN), Exact RBN (ERBN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Boosting Ensemble Learning (Boosting EL), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Binary Decision Tree (BDT), and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)]. We observed that the ANN model accurately predicts the soil moisture and outperforms all the benchmark algorithms with correlation coefficient (R = 0.80), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.040 m(3)/m(3)), and bias = 0.004 m(3)/m(3). Finally, for an unbiased and robust conclusion, we performed spatial distribution analysis by creating thirty different sets of training-validation-testing datasets. We observed that the performance remains consistent in all thirty scenarios. The outcomes of this study will foster new and existing applications of soil moisture.

M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Korean peninsula Study focus: Although heavy rainfall systems over Korea were known to be characterized by warm-type heavy rainfall associated with a relatively low cloud top, this feature can vary under climate change. This study primarily investigated the mean climatology and linear trends of heavy rainfall and cloud top distributions over the Korean peninsula. The rainy seasons from June to September for the period of 1983-2021 were analyzed in this study. To understand the climatology and changes of heavy rainfall events, thermodynamic variables and synoptic forcings were analyzed. New hydrological insights for the region: Long-term consistent geostationary satellite data provides a unique opportunity to understand the global cloud variations associated with climate change. This study examined the mean climatology and decadal trends of cloud tops inferred from geo-stationary satellite observations, along with heavy rainfall events over the Korean Peninsula. Rainfall and cloud top heights exhibited a decreasing trend in June, whereas an increase in vigorous deep convection was observed in August/September, mainly in southern Korea. The decadal trends in August and September were associated with large-scale circulation changes, while the trend in September was attributed to increasing typhoon visits over the Korean Peninsula. The cloud top changes, with lowered cloud tops in June and elevated cloud tops in August, suggested a shift of deep convective systems toward the late summer over Korea.

TI  - Landsat, MODIS, and VIIRS snow cover mapping algorithm performance asvalidated by airborne lidar datasets
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover mapping algorithms utilizing multispectral satellite data at various spatial resolutions are available, each treating subpixel variation differently. Past evaluations of snow mapping accuracy typically relied on satellite data collected at a higher spatial resolution than the data in question. However, these optical data cannot characterize snow cover mapping performance under forest canopies or at the meter scale. Here, we use 3 m spatial resolution snow depth maps collected on 116 d by an aerial laser scanner to validate band ratio and spectral-mixture snow cover mapping algorithms. Such a comprehensive evaluation of sub-canopy snow mapping performance has not been undertaken previously. The following standard (produced operationally by an agency) products are evaluated: NASA gap-filled Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A1F, NASA gap-filled Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) VNP10A1F, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 8 Level-3 Fractional Snow Covered Area. Two spectral-unmixing approaches are also evaluated: Snow-Covered Area and Grain Size (SCAG) and Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS), both of which are gap-filled MODIS products and are also run on Landsat 8. We assess subpixel snow mapping performance while considering the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA), canopy cover, sensor zenith angle, and other variables within six global seasonal snow classes. Metrics are calculated at the pixel and basin scales, including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and F statistic (a detection measure). The newer MOD10A1F Version 61 and VNP10A1F Version 1 product biases (- 7.1 %, -9.5 %) improve significantly when linear equations developed for older products are applied (2.8 %, -2.7 %) to convert band ratios to fSCA. The F statistics are unchanged (94.4 %, 93.1 %) and the VNP10A1F RMSE improves (18.6 % to 15.7 %), while the MOD10A1F RMSE worsens (12.7 % to 13.7 %). Consistent with previous studies, spectral-unmixing approaches (SCAG, SPIReS) show lower biases (-0.1 %, -0.1 %) and RMSE (12.1 %, 12.0 %), with higher F statistics (95.6 %, 96.1 %) relative to the band ratio approaches for MODIS. Landsat 8 products are all spectral-mixture methods with low biases (-0.4 % to 0.3 %), low RMSE (11.4 % to 15.8 %), and high F statistics (97.3 % to 99.1 %). Spectral-unmixing methods can improve snow cover mapping at the global scale.

AB  - A generic methodology is presented to cross-calibrate satellite ocean-color sensors in polar orbit via an intermediary geostationary sensor of reference. In this study, AHI onboard Hiwamari-8 is used as the intermediary sensor to cross-calibrate SGLI onboard GCOM-C and MODIS onboard Aqua and Terra (MODIS-A and MODIS-T) after system vicarious calibration (SVC). Numerous coincidences were obtained near the Equator using 3 days of imagery, i.e., 11 May 2018, 22 January 2019, and 25 January 2020. Spectral matching to AHI spectral bands was first performed for a wide range of angular geometry, aerosol conditions, and Case 1 waters using a single band or multiple bands of SGLI, MODIS-A and MODIS-T, yielding root mean square differences of 0.1-0.7% in the blue and green and 0.7%-3.7% in the red depending on the band combination. Limited by the inherent AHI instrument noise and the system vicarious calibration of individual polar-orbiting sensors, cross-calibration was only performed for equivalent AHI bands centered on at 471, 510, and 639 nm. Results show that MODIS-A and MODIS-T are accurately cross-calibrated, with cross-calibration ratios differing by 0.1%-0.8% in magnitude. These differences are within or slightly outside the estimated uncertainties of & PLUSMN;0.6% to & PLUSMN;1.0%. In contrast, SGLI shows larger cross-calibration differences, i.e., 1.4%, 3.4%, and 1.1% with MODIS-A and 1.5%, 4.6%, and 1.5% with MODIS-T, respectively. These differences are above uncertainties of & PLUSMN;0.8-1.0% at 471 and 510 nm and within uncertainties of & PLUSMN;2.3% and & PLUSMN;1.9% at 639 nm. Such differences may introduce significant discrepancies between ocean-color products generated from SGLI and MODIS data, although some compensation may occur because different atmospheric correction schemes are used to process SGLI and MODIS imagery, and SVC is based on the selected scheme. Geostationary sensors with ocean color capability have potential to improve the spectral matching and reduce uncertainties, as long as they provide imagery at sufficient cadence over equatorial regions. The methodology is applicable to polar-orbiting optical sensors in general and can be implemented operationally to ensure consistency of products generated by individual sensors in establishing long-term data records for climate studies.

T2  - POST-MEDIEVAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper reports on new research into the previously poorly-documented post-medieval sarsen stone industry of southern England. Two significant centres of the trade are explored using complimentary methodologies. In Buckinghamshire, where a major quarry has been lost to redevelopment, archaeological features are mapped from historical aerial photographs and other remotely-sensed data. In Wiltshire, analytical earthworks survey at two quarries records different stone-working practices. The interpretation goes beyond a conventional industrial archaeological focus on commodity production, to examine the complexity of the relationships between people, materials and technology in three different taskscapes.

TI  - [Detecting Influencing Factor of Vegetation NPP in Southwest China Based on Spatial Scale Effect].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is an important parameter for evaluating the quality of terrestrial ecosystems. It is of great importance to study the spatio-temporal evolution of vegetation NPP and its driving force for regional ecological environment protection and sustainable development. On the basis of MODIS NPP data, meteorological data, DEM data, population density data, GDP data, and land use type data, this study used linear regression analysis, R/S analysis, and a Geodetector model to analyze the spatio-temporal variation in vegetation NPP and its future changing trend on both regional and landform scales and to detect the influencing factors that affect the spatial differentiation of vegetation NPP. The results showed that the vegetation NPP exhibited an extremely significant upward trend in southwest China from 2000 to 2020. On the landform scale, the vegetation NPP had showed an upward trend in all landforms, except for the southern Tibet Plateau; among them, the vegetation NPP in the Sichuan Basin showed the most obvious upward trend. The variation in vegetation NPP exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity in southwest China, with the changing rate of "high in the east and low in the west." The areas with an upward trend of vegetation NPP were greater than the areas with a downward trend, but the changing trend was dominated by a decreasing trend in the future, both in southwest China and each landform unit. The Geodetector results showed that elevation was the dominant factor controlling the spatial differentiation of vegetation NPP in southwest China and all landform units, except for the Yunan-Guizhou Plateau, in which the spatial differentiation of vegetation NPP was mostly dominated by temperature. The interaction detection results showed that the interaction between the influencing factors was manifested as two-factor enhancement or nonlinear enhancement. The interaction between elevation and temperature showed the highest impact on vegetation NPP distribution. On the landform scale, the spatial differential of vegetation NPP was dominated by the interaction between elevation and climate factors or elevation and GDP in the Guangxi Hills, Sichuan Basin, Zoige Plateau, Hengduan Mountains, and southern Tibet Plateau and between climate factors in the Yunan-Guizhou Plateau. The above results indicated that vegetation NPP variation and the influencing factors that dominate its spatial differential in southwest China showed obvious scale effects. Therefore, exploring the dynamic variation in vegetation NPP and its influencing factors at different spatial scales has practical significance for a comprehensive understanding of the vegetation cover situation and formulating regional ecological restoration plans in southwest China.

TI  - Scenarios of land use and land cover change in the Colombian Amazon to evaluate alternative post-conflict pathways
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastures and crops have been expanding at an accelerated rate in the forests of the Colombian Amazon since the peace accords were signed in 2016. The rapid loss of tropical rainforests is threatening the integrity of protected areas and connectivity in the Amazon and other natural regions. In the context of the post-conflict stage, a set of land use and land cover change scenarios were constructed for the Colombian Amazon for the year 2040, using expert coherent narratives. Three scenarios were designed: trend, extractivist, and sustainable development. Historic land use change and driving factors were analyzed throughout 14 transitions between the years 2002 and 2016, based on the interpretation of Landsat images and their relationship with 29 driving factors using artificial neural networks. The Markov chain model was calculated for the transitions, and the change allocation model was parameterized to spatially simulate the scenarios. The results showed that the LULC model calibration and validation were satisfactory (0.91). The sustainable development scenario that considers strong policies for the conservation of forests and implementation of sustainable production projects was the option with greater values for conserved forests and secondary vegetation in recovery, adding similar to 42 million hectares by 2040. The other scenarios showed that the Colombian Amazon will lose similar to 2 million hectares of forests in the trend scenario and similar to 4.3 million hectares in the extractivist scenario, based on the reference year (2016). In the trend scenario, pastures and crops could increase by 48%; and, in the extractivist scenario, these would increase by 117%, changing from similar to 3.9 to similar to 8.6 million hectares. We hope that the scientific contribution of this study will be relevant for informed discussion in decision-making and provide a framework for building a peaceful territory.

TI  - Effects of precipitation changes and land-use alteration on streamflow: A comparative analysis from two adjacent catchments in the Qilian Mountains, arid northwestern China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparative analysis of the impacts of precipitation and land use on streamflow from adjacent catchments is critical to exploring pathways toward water security and sustainable development. In this work, two adjacent catchments (the Mayinghe and Xidahe, abbreviated as MYC and XDC, respectively) in northwestern China were selected to compare the impacts of precipitation change and land use alteration on streamflow change during 1956-2019 using field observation streamflow data and satellite data. An opposite trend of streamflow was found for the two catchments from 1956 to 2019: the streamflow decreased significantly in the MYC (-0.63 x 10(7)m(3)/10a, p < 0.05), while it increased in the XDC (0.71 x 10(7)m(3)/10a, p < 0.05). Land conversion dominated the streamflow reduction in the MYC, with a contribution of about 68.3%. In the XDC, precipitation was confirmed to be the major factor driving the increase in streamflow. The streamflow for farmland irrigation reached 27.97 x 10(4) m(3)/km(2) in the MYC, which was the leading factor of streamflow reduction in the basin. The findings obtained from this work can shed light on the quantitative understanding of streamflow changes in small catchments and offer a scientific basis for sustainable water management in other inland river basins.

TI  - Classification of lava lakes based on their heat and SO<sub>2</sub> emission: Implications for their formation and feeding processes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lava lakes are a fascinating but somewhat rare form of volcanic activity. Lava lakes are large free surfaces of hot lava that discharge continuously, and almost quietly, heat and volcanic gases into the atmosphere. They are thought to be fed by convection processes that bring hot gas-rich magma to the surface and back downward, after its cooling and outgassing. A lava lake represents a latent threat for the populations living nearby, as it can drain suddenly through fissures and generate dangerously fast lava flows. We present time series of Volcanic Radiative Power (VRP) and SO2 flux measured from satellites (MODIS and OMI, respectively) from several lava lakes on Earth (Erta Ale, Nyiragongo, Kilauea, Nyamuragira, Ambrym, and Villarrica). Based on long-term trends plotted in a simple VRP versus SO2 flux diagram, we propose a new classification of lava lakes in three categories: small lakes, large foam-dominated lakes, and large melt-dominated lakes. Small lakes show a long-term correlation between VRP and SO2 emissions, while large lakes seem to show an anticorrelation between VRP and SO2 emissions. This at-first-glance surprising anticorrelation probably results from the limited heat transport capacity of the gas-rich foam that initially feeds the convection of these lakes. We also show that the formation of three large lava lakes in the last 2 decades at the rift and hotspot volcanoes followed a similar trend of transitioning, in a few months, from foam-dominated to melt-dominated. We deduce that lava lake formation at these volcanoes follows a common sequence of processes that includes the formation of a large shallow magma reservoir and its outgassing through a newly formed pit crater.

TI  - Response of the soft scale insect<i> Parthenolecanium</i><i> corni</i> and its natural enemies on honeylocust trees to urban conditions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban habitats can alter tree physiology in ways that make trees more susceptible to insect pests. We examined how urban conditions (e.g., impervious surfaces and warming) affected the soft scale insect, European fruit lecanium, Parthenolecanium corni Bouche ' (Hemiptera: Coccidae) and the health of thornless honeylocust trees (Gleditsia tricanthos L. var. inermis) in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Hot and cool study sites were selected based on surface air temperatures obtained from thermal LANDSAT-8 images overlaid against a map of honeylocust tree locations. Based on temperature probe data, study trees located in hot sites had mean average daily temperatures up to 1.56 degrees C and 1.79 degrees C warmer than cool sites in 2019 and 2020, respectively. We hypothesized that abundance and fecundity of scale insects would be higher on trees in hot sites and those surrounded by more impervious surface cover within a 20 m radius. Although our data supported these hypotheses, impervious surface cover predicted more of the variation in abundance and fecundity of scale insects in hot sites compared to cool sites. Rates of parasitism were not affected by impervious surface cover or whether the site was from a hot or cool location. However, we found strong density dependence in parasitism of scale insects in both hot and cool sites when scale densities were at or below the levels present in cool sites. This suggests that lower densities of scale insects were associated with a positive numerical response of parasitoids, a necessary prerequisite for population regulation by top-down effects. In contrast, this numerical response was lacking at the higher den-sities of scales found on trees located in hot sites where, presumably bottom-up factors like water-stress increased the fecundity of scale insects. These findings add to a growing body of evidence linking rising global tempera-tures with increased pest abundance in ways that cannot be mitigated by local populations of natural enemies.

TI  - Ship velocity estimation in SAR images using multitask deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR satellites are used for monitoring ships worldwide. Moving ships are Doppler shifted by an amount proportional to their velocity. An offset between the ship and its wake is then produced during SAR processing. We present a novel automatic method for calculating the ship velocity. The method relies on multitask deep learning to estimate the offset and ship heading. From these parameters, the ship velocity can be obtained. A convolutional neural network is trained using a coupled loss function. The loss function allows both parameters to be estimated at the same time. We show the methods' effectiveness for ships in Sentinel-1 SAR images. For this purpose, a large dataset of 30,000 AIS annotated SAR ship images is collected. These images have 20 x 22 m pixel resolution and ships do not have a clear wake. The AIS provides the true ship velocity and allows the method to be evaluated. As a result, we can determine the ship speed with an accuracy of 1.1 m/s. The offset disappears near the azimuth direction of the SAR image. Yet, our method is reliable except for ships sailing within 2.5 degrees of the azimuth direction.

TI  - Surface temperature comparison of the Arctic winter MOSAiC observations, ERA5 reanalysis, and MODIS satellite retrieval
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric model systems, such as those used for weather forecast and reanalysis production, often have significant and systematic errors in their representation of the Arctic surface energy budget and its components. The newly available observation data of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition (2019/2020) enable a range of model analyses and validation in order to advance our understanding of potential model deficiencies. In the present study, we analyze deficiencies in the surface radiative energy budget over Arctic sea ice in the ERA5 global atmospheric reanalysis by comparing against the winter MOSAiC campaign data, as well as, a pan-Arctic level-2 MODIS ice surface temperature remote sensing product. We find that ERA5 can simulate the timing of radiatively clear periods, though it is not able to distinguish the two observed radiative Arctic winter states, radiatively clear and opaquely cloudy, in the distribution of the net surface radiative budget. The ERA5 surface temperature over Arctic sea ice has a conditional error with a positive bias in radiatively clear conditions and a negative bias in opaquely cloudy conditions. The mean surface temperature error is 4 degrees C for radiatively clear situations at MOSAiC and up to 15 degrees C in some parts of the Arctic. The spatial variability of the surface temperature, given by 4 observation sites at MOSAiC, is not captured by ERA5 due to its spatial resolution but represented in the level-2 satellite product. The sensitivity analysis of possible error sources, using satellite products of snow depth and sea ice thickness, shows that the positive surface temperature errors during radiatively clear events are, to a large extent, caused by insufficient sea ice thickness and snow depth representation in the reanalysis system. A positive bias characterizes regions with ice thickness greater than 1.5 m, while the negative bias for thinner ice is partly compensated by the effect of snow.

TI  - InSAR-derived surface deformation of Chaoshan Plain, China: Exploring the role of human activities in the evolution of coastal landscapes
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the characteristics of different human-induced coastal surface deformation will improve our understanding of recent temporal-spatial evolution trends of the coastal terrain, and help better predict the risks of coastal disasters. However, few surface deformation studies have focused on the distinction between different types of anthropogenic ground deformation. Based on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, this study employs the hybrid multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) method to extract the surface deformation of Chaoshan Plain from 2015 to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m. A series of historical optical satellite images and groundwater extraction data are used to help distinguish different types of human activities that have induced surface deformation. The characteristics of ground deformation induced by different types of anthropogenic activities are explored in the space and time dimensions. Results show that InSAR ground deformation in the study area is mainly caused by three types of human activities: groundwater extraction, land reclamation, and construction. Groundwater extraction has impacted >50% of the regional surface deformation by area. The interannual variability of the surface deformation rate corresponds well to that of groundwater extraction, and the subsidence effect can last for more than five years with seasonal variability. The maximum surface subsidence rate in land reclamation areas reaches similar to 100 mm/year, with a linear decreasing trend against time. Without extra compaction, the reclamation area can continue to deform almost at the same rate for several years. The rapid increase of overlying loads caused by construction in the reclamation area has led to a sharp decrease in the deformation rate within 2-3 years after the completion of the construction. In areas absent of other human-induced deformation, construction activities are shown to cause surface subsidence of 10-20 mm/year in a relatively short period. In areas experiencing a combination of construction and groundwater extraction, land subsidence rates of >50 mm/year are observed. This study shows that the spatial and temporal analysis of the correlations between human activities and InSAR surface deformation is an effective way to attribute the driven factors of coastal plain deformation.

TI  - Attributing salmonellosis cases to foodborne, animal contact and waterborne routes using the microbial subtyping approach and exposure weights
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Salmonella is a major cause of enteric disease in Canada. Cases of salmonellosis were attributed to retail meats, food animal manure contact, and surface water sources using a microbial subtyping approach coupled with adjustments for exposure. Results indicated that 64.7% of cases were attributed to chicken breast meat, followed by frozen raw breaded chicken products (12.9%), ground chicken (9.1%), water (3.0%), pork chops and sausage (1.3%), ground beef and veal (0.7%), turkey parts (0.5%), and molluscs (0.0%). The salmonellosis incidence rate in the FoodNet Canada sentinel sites fell by one third with a parallel drop of one third in the percent of cases attributed to chicken breast meat between 2015 and 2019. Decreases in the contribution of many of the top serovars to the percentage of cases attributed to chicken breast meat indicates some emerging success with broiler breeder chicken vaccination programs. In addition, preliminary prevalence results for frozen raw chicken products in late 2019 suggests the Canadian Food Inspection Agency intervention in 2019 requiring any Sal-monella on these products to be below a detectable amount may be having an impact, though more data post intervention is needed to be more conclusive.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The goal of this study was to compare the outcomes of preoperative brachytherapy followed by radical surgery versus radical surgery alone in cervical cancer with tumor between 2 and 4 cm (FIGO 2018 IB2).Material and methods. SENTICOL I and SENTICOL II were two French prospective multicentric trials evaluating sentinel node biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer between 2005 and 2012. Preoperative brachytherapy (low -dose rate or pulse-dose rate at the dose of 60Gy) could be performed 6 to 8 weeks prior to the radical hysterec-tomy, at the discretion of each center. SENTICOL I and SENTICOL II cohorts were retrospectively analysed to com-pare the outcomes of preoperative brachytherapy or upfront surgery in patients with IB2 cervical tumor.Results. A total of 104 patients were included: 55 underwent upfront radical hysterectomy and 49 underwent preoperative brachytherapy followed by radical hysterectomy. Patients with preoperative brachytherapy were more likely to have no residual disease (71.4% vs. 25.5%, p < 0.0001) and to be defined as low risk according to Sedlis criteria (83.3% vs. 51.2%, p < 0.0001). Adjuvant treatments were required less frequently in case of preop-erative brachytherapy (14.3% vs. 54.5%, p < 0.0001). Patients with preoperative brachytherapy experienced more postoperative complications grade >= 3 (24.5% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.03). Patients with preoperative brachytherapy had better 5-year disease-free survival compared to patients who underwent surgery alone, 93.6% and 74.4% respectively (p = 0.04).Conclusion. Although preoperative brachytherapy was significantly associated with more severe postopera-tive complications, better pathologic features were obtained on surgical specimens and led to a better 5-year disease-free survival in IB2 cervical cancer.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Mapping Pu'er tea plantations from GF-1 images using Object-Oriented Image Analysis (OOIA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea is the most popular drink worldwide, and China is the largest producer of tea. Therefore, tea is an important commercial crop in China, playing a significant role in domestic and foreign markets. It is necessary to make accurate and timely maps of the distribution of tea plantation areas for plantation management and decision making. In the present study, we propose a novel mapping method to map tea plantation. The town of Menghai in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, was chosen as the study area, andgg GF-1 remotely sensed data from 2014-2017 were chosen as the data source. Image texture, spectral and geometrical features were integrated, while feature space was built by SEparability and THresholds algorithms (SEaTH) with decorrelation. Object-Oriented Image Analysis (OOIA) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was utilized to map tea plantation areas. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient ofh the proposed method were 93.14% and 0.81, respectively, 3.61% and 0.05, 6.99% and 0.14, 6.44% and 0.16 better than the results of CART method, Maximum likelihood method and CNN based method. The tea plantation area increased by 4,095.36 acre from 2014 to 2017, while the fastest-growing period is 2015 to 2016.

TI  - Different approaches make comparing studies of burn severity challenging: a review of methods used to link remotely sensed data with the Composite Burn Index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Composite Burn Index (CBI) is commonly linked to remotely sensed data to understand spatial and temporal patterns of burn severity. However, a comprehensive understanding of the tradeoffs between different methods used to model CBI with remotely sensed data is lacking. To help understand the current state of the science, provide a blueprint towards conducting broad-scale meta-analyses, and identify key decision points and potential rationale, we conducted a review of studies that linked remotely sensed data to continuous estimates of burn severity measured with the CBI and related methods. We provide a roadmap of the different methodologies applied and examine potential rationales used to justify them. Our findings largely reflect methods applied in North America - particularly in the western USA - due to the high number of studies in that region. We find the use of different methods across studies introduces variations that make it difficult to compare outcomes. Additionally, the existing suite of comparative studies focuses on one or few of many possible sources of uncertainty. Thus, compounding error and propagation throughout the many decisions made during analysis is not well understood. Finally, we suggest a broad set of methodological information and key rationales for decision-making that could facilitate future reviews.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of land use/land cover change and urban growth dynamics of Silchar City, India using very high-resolution satellite data and the Shannon entropy model
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Silchar City and its surrounding areas have witnessed massive population growth in the last few decades due to local and migrated peoples, which led to the rapid transformation of its land use/land cover (LU/LC) pattern. The spatio-temporal very high-resolution satellite data (VHRS) and on-screen visual interpretation techniques were used for detailed large-scale LU/LC analysis. The LU/LC classification of the City has been prepared for 2005, 2011, and 2018 with five primary and a further 17 sub-classes. In the present study use was made of the Census of India reports from 1991 to 2011, and the geometrical increase method was used to evaluate the ward-level population, population density, and land requirements for residential purposes; these have been predicted from 2021 to 2051 with every 10 years interval. The ity's wards have been classified into five zones, and the Shannon entropy model has been applied to analyze the degree of randomness and trends of urban built-up growth. The obtained results indicate that Silchar City is compact near the center, which follows the infill built-up growth trend. However, as the distance increased from its center, the scattering with an infill growth pattern was observed. The accuracy assessment techniques are used to validate the results of the classification. The results of this study can provide detailed information for land-use planners, researchers, policy-decision makers, and municipal authorities.

TI  - Improving the MODIS LAI compositing using prior time-series information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) long-term leaf area index (LAI) products have significantly contributed to global energy fluxes, climate change, and biogeochemistry research. However, the maximum fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (Max-FPAR) compositing strategy of the Collection 6 (C6) products dictates that the main or backup algorithm is always triggered by observations of different quality, which indirectly causes the observed instability in the LAI time-series. Based on MODIS daily LAI retrievals, this study develops a prior knowledge time-series compositing algorithm (PKA) using a linear kernel driven (LKD) model. Our results show that the newly proposed PKA can significantly improve the LAI composites compared to the Max-FPAR strategy using ground-based observations for validation. We found that the PKA performs better than Max-FPAR in various aspects (different sites, seasons, and retrieval index (RI) ranges), with R2 increasing from 0.69 to 0.76 and root means square error (RMSE) decreasing from 1.01 to 0.84 compared to GBOV ground truth. The same improvement was shown for the ground truth LAIs measured at the Honghe and Hailun sites in northeastern China, with R2 increasing from 0.23 to 0.41 and RMSE decreasing from 1.27 to 1.25. In addition, three newly proposed temporal uncertainty metrics (time-series stability, TSS and time -series anomaly, TSA and reconstruction error metric, RE (the proximity to the main RT-based retrievals)) were applied to compare the stability of LAI time-series before and after PKA implementation. We found that the time series stability of PKA LAI was improved, the time series anomalies were reduced, and the retrieval rates of the main algorithm were also greatly enhanced compared to Max-FPAR LAI. A case intercomparison for Max-FPAR-MODIS, Max-FPAR-VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite), and PKA-MODIS LAIs in the Amazon Forest region showed that the PKA is also effective in improving the LAI retrieval over large regions with few qualified observations due to poor atmospheric conditions (RE decreased from 2.37/2.35 (Max-FPAR-MODIS/Max-FPAR-VIIRS) to 2.25 (PKA-MODIS) and RI increased from 61.94%/59.62% to 66.88%). The same improvement was seen in the BELMANIP 2.1 sites for almost all biomes except deciduous broadleaf forest, where the RE decreased from 1.85/2.13 to 1.15 overall. We note that the PKA has the potential to be easily implemented in the oper-ational algorithms of subsequent MODIS and MODIS-like LAI Collections.

TI  - Long-term changes in precipitable water vapour over India derived from satellite and reanalysis data for the past four decades (1980-2020)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - India has a tropical monsoon climate with significant regional variability in rainfall and temperature, where precipitation is closely connected to precipitable water vapour (PWV). Here, the satellite and reanalysis data are considered to study the spatial and temporal changes of PWV over India in 1980-2020. We have also analysed its potential drivers such as precipitation, surface temperature and evapotranspiration during the same period. The distribution of annual PWV depicts the highest values over the east coast (40-50 mm) and lowest in Western Himalaya (<10 mm). The seasonal distribution shows highest PWV during monsoon (June-July-August-September, about 40-65 mm). Similarly, the monthly cycle of PWV shows the lowest amount in January, which gradually increases with time until it peaks in July, and then decreases thereafter. Inter-annual changes show a peak in 1997-1998, which can be attributed to the strong El Nino event (Nino 3.4 region), during which the increase in temperature leads to more evapotranspiration and thus, enhanced PWV. Among the sources and sinks, evapotranspiration (0.6-0.9), precipitation (0.7-0.9) and surface temperature (0.5-0.6) are highly correlated with PWV across the regions in India. The PWV trends in India are found to be significantly positive (0.6-0.9 mm per year), which can be linked to the recent increase in surface temperature and thus, the increase in atmospheric moisture. This is a concern for regional climate change as PWV is directly connected to water vapour and, thus, to temperature and climate.

TI  - Characteristics of systematic lymph node dissection and influencing factors of sentinel lymph node biopsy using carbon nanoparticles in endometrial carcinoma: a single-center study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundCarbon nanoparticles (CNPs) are a new tracer for lymph node mapping, which can quickly reach and develop lymph nodes through a lymphatic network. This research investigated the characteristics of systematic lymph node dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy mapped with CNPs in endometrial carcinoma.MethodsWe first applied CNPs to systematic lymph node dissection in 18 endometrial carcinoma patients as the study group and another 18 endometrial carcinoma patients who were not injected with anything served as the control group. Then, we applied CNPs to sentinel lymph nodes biopsy in 54 endometrial carcinoma patients. All 54 patients received systematic lymph node dissection after sentinel lymph node biopsy. The detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of systematic lymph node dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy by CNPs were respectively analyzed. A nomogram model for predicting the success of sentinel lymph node mapping was established.ResultsThe average number of lymph nodes removed in the CNP-labeled study group was higher than that in the control group (p<0.001). CNPs improved the number of lymph nodes with a diameter <= 0.5cm. The detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of sentinel lymph nodes biopsy by CNPs for endometrial carcinoma were 70.4%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The nomogram model included factors of long menopause time, cervical cyst, and hard cervical texture, and the area of ROC curve was 0.816.ConclusionsCNPs improve the detection rate of small lymph nodes. CNPs can trace sentinel lymph nodes in evaluating lymph node metastasis in endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - Long-range transport of CO and aerosols from Siberian biomass burning over northern Japan during 18-20 May 2016
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - High CO concentration and dense aerosol layers at 1-6 km altitude in the free troposphere were observed over Rikubetsu, Japan, in ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and lidar measurements during 18-20 May 2016, days after intense wildfires east of Lake Baikal, Siberia. The column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO (XCO) was observed to be similar to 150 ppb from 11:15 to 13:50 JST on 19 May, and peak aerosol optical depths (AODs) of 1.41 and 1.28 were observed at 15:40 JST 18 May and 11:20 JST 19 May, respectively. We used the HYSPLIT model to calculate five-day backward trajectories from Rikubetsu on May 18, 2016 at 2, 3 and 5 km altitude. The results show that the air parcels passed over the Siberian wildfires during 16-17 May. It was found that the high CO concentrations originated from forest fires were transported to the upper layers of Hokkaido. This will contribute to the understanding of the regional effects of air pollution in northern Japan due to air masses originating from forest fires. By combining these independent datasets such as AERONET aerosol optical thickness (AOT), MODIS fire data, and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) total CO columns, we confirmed that the lidar measurements of enhanced aerosol concentrations and FTS measurements of maximum XCO over Rikubetsu resulted from a persistent smoke plume transported from Siberian wildfires. Relatively large-scale forest fires have been frequently occurring in Siberia recently. However, the effects of CO and other gases released from them over northern Japan are not well known. We observed high concentrations of CO over the TCCON station in Rikubetsu, Japan, which we believe to be of forest fire origin. Therefore, we analyzed it as a case study to confirm its origin and impact on the upper atmosphere over northern Japan.

TI  - Analysis of the relationship among land surface temperature (LST), land use land cover (LULC), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with topographic elements in the lower Himalayan region
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) affects exchange of energy between earth surface and atmo-sphere which is important for studying environmental changes. However, research on the rela-tionship between LST, Land Use Land Cover (LULC), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with topographic elements in the lower Himalayan region has not been done. Therefore, the present study explored the relationship between LST and NDVI, and LULC types with topo-graphic elements in the lower Himalayan region of Pakistan. The study area was divided into North-South, West-East, North-West to South-East and North-East to South-East directions using ArcMap 3D analysis. The current study used Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) data from May 2021 for LULC and LST analysis in the study area. The LST data was obtained from the thermal band of Landsat 8 (TIRS), while the LULC of the study areas was classified using the Maximum Likelihood Classi-fication (MLC) method utilizing Landsat 8 (OLI) data. TIRS collects data for two narrow spectral bands (B10 and B11) with spectral wavelength of 10.6 mu m-12.51 mu m in the thermal region formerly covered by one wide spectral band (B6) on Landsat 4-7. With 12-bit data products, TIRS data is available in radiometric, geometric, and terrain-corrected file format. The effect of elevation on LST was assessed using LST and elevation data obtained from the USGS website. The LST across LULC types with sunny and shady slopes was analyzed to assess the influence of slope directions. The relationship of LST with elevation and NDVI was examined using correlation analysis. The results indicated that LST decreased from North-South and South-East, while increasing from North-East and South-West directions. The correlation coefficient between LST and elevation was negative, with an R-value of-0.51. The NDVI findings with elevation showed that NDVI increases with an increase in elevation. Zonal analysis of LST for different LULC types showed that built-up and bare soil had the highest mean LST, which was 35.76 degrees C and 28.08 degrees C, respectively, followed by agriculture, vegetation, and water bodies. The mean LST difference between sunny and shady slopes was 1.02 degrees C. The correlation between NDVI and LST was negative for all LULC types except the water body. This study findings can be used to ensure sustainable urban development and minimize urban heat island effects by providing effective guidelines for urban planners, policymakers, and respective authorities in the Lower Himalayan region. The current thermal remote sensing findings can be used to model energy fluxes and surface processes in the study area.

TI  - Assessment of using spaceborne LiDAR to monitor the particulate backscatter coefficient on large, freshwater lakes: A test using CALIPSO on Lake Michigan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite was launched in 2006 with the primary goal of measuring the properties of clouds and aerosols in Earth's atmosphere using LiDAR. Since then, numerous studies have shown the viability of using CALIPSO to observe day/night differences in subsurface optical properties of oceans and large seas from space. To date no studies have been done on using CALIPSO to monitor the subsurface optical properties of large, freshwater-lakes. This is likely due to the limited spatial resolution of CALIPSO, which makes the mapping of subsurface properties of regions smaller than large seas impractical. Still, CALIPSO does pass over some of the world's largest, freshwater-lakes, yielding important information about the water. Here we use the entire CALIPSO data record (approximately 15 years) to measure the particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp, m-1) across Lake Michigan. We then compare the LiDAR derived values of bbp to optical imagery values obtained from MODIS and to in situ measurements. Critically, we find that the LiDAR derived bbp aligns better in non-summer months with in situ values when compared to the optically imagery. However, due to both high cloud coverage and high wind speeds on Lake Michigan, this comes with the caveat that the CALIPSO product is limited in its usability. We close by speculating on the roll that spaceborne LiDAR, including CALIPSO and other satitlites, have on the future of monitoring the Great Lakes and other large bodies of fresh water.

TI  - A Report of <i>Pectobacterium carotovorum</i> subsp. <i>actinidiae</i> Causing Kiwifruit Bacterial Canker in Guangxi, China
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - A bacterial pathogen strain was isolated from susceptible tissue of Hongyang variety kiwifruit in Zhongfeng Town, Ziyuan County, Guilin City, Guangxi, China. Due to the relatively single variety of kiwifruit in Guangxi, the control technology of fruit farmers is backward, and the climate is humid, which is suitable for the growth of pathogenic bacteria, resulting in frequent occurrence of diseases. In this study, the pathogen strain was identified based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical tests; 16S rRNA gene; PCR detection with specific primers; and Biolog analysis. The results showed that a tobacco allergic reaction could be induced by inoculation with the pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, brown necrotic plaques appeared on kiwifruit leaves, necrotic phloem lesions appeared, and wounds on kiwifruit branches turned brown. The characteristics identified by morphological, physiological, biochemical, and Biolog identification were similar to those caused by Pectobacterium sp. Through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and PCR identification with specific primers, bands with a size corresponding to target bands indicated that the pathogen was Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. actinidiae. This is the first report of kiwifruit canker disease caused by P. carotovorum subsp. actinidiae in Guangxi, China. In addition, through this study, a preliminary understanding of the pathogen has been obtained, which will lay the foundation for the prevention and control of the disease in the future.

TI  - Investigation on the use of ensemble learning and big data in crop identification
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The agriculture sector in Egypt faces several problems, such as climate change, water storage, and yield variability. The comprehensive capabilities of Big Data (BD) can help in tackling the uncertainty of food supply occurs due to several factors such as soil erosion, water pollution, climate change, socio-cultural growth, governmental regulations, and market fluctuations. Crop identification and monitoring plays a vital role in modern agriculture. Although several machine learning models have been utilized in identifying crops, the performance of ensemble learning has not been investigated extensively. The massive volume of satellite imageries has been established as a big data problem forcing to deploy the proposed solution using big data technologies to manage, store, analyze, and visualize satellite data. In this paper, we have developed a weighted voting mechanism for improving crop classification performance in a large scale, based on ensemble learning and big data schema. Built upon Apache Spark, the popular DB Framework, the proposed approach was tested on El Salheya, Ismaili governate. The proposed ensemble approach boosted accuracy by 6.5%, 1.9%, 4.4%, 4.9%, 4.7% in precision, recall, F-score, Overall Accuracy (OA), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) metrics respectively. Our findings confirm the generalization of the proposed crop identification approach at a large-scale setting.

TI  - Bahamian seagrass extent and blue carbon accounting using Earth observation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses are among the world's most productive ecosystems due to their vast 'blue' carbon sequestration rates and stocks, yet have a largely untapped potential for climate change mitigation and national climate agendas like the Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement. To account for the value of seagrasses for these agendas, spatially explicit high-confidence seagrass ecosystem assessments guided by nationally aggregated data are necessary. Modern Earth Observation advances could provide a scalable technological solution to assess the national extent and blue carbon service of seagrass ecosystems. Here, we developed and applied a scalable Earth Observation framework within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to account the national extent, blue carbon stock and sequestration rate of seagrass ecosystems across the shallow waters of The Bahamas-113,037 km(2). Our geospatial ecosystem extent accounting was based on big multi-temporal data analytics of over 18,000 10-m Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2017-2021, and deep feature engineering of multi-temporal spectral, color, object-based and textural metrics with Random Forests machine learning classification. The extent accounting was trained and validated using a nationwide reference data synthesis based on human-guided image annotation, recent space-borne benthic habitat maps, and field data collections. Bahamian seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates were quantified using region-specific in-situ seagrass blue carbon data. The mapped Bahamian seagrass extent covers an area up to 46,792 km(2), translating into a carbon storage of 723 Mg C, and a sequestration rate of 123 Mt CO2 annually. This equals up to 68 times the amount of CO2 emitted by The Bahamas in 2018, potentially rendering the country carbon-neutral. The developed accounts fill a vast mapping blank in the global seagrass map-29% of the global seagrass extent-highlighting the necessity of including their blue carbon fluxes into national climate agendas and showcasing the need for more cost-effective conservation and restoration efforts for their meadows. We envisage that the synergy between our scalable Earth Observation technology and near-future nation-specific in-situ observations can and will support spatially-explicit seagrass and ocean ecosystem accounting, accelerating effective policy-making, blue carbon crediting, and relevant financial investments in and beyond The Bahamas.

TI  - Airborne multispectral imagery and deep learning for biosecurity surveillance of invasive forest pests in urban landscapes
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban and peri-urban trees in major cities provide a gateway for exotic pests and diseases (hereafter "pests") to establish and spread into new countries. Consequently, they can be used as sentinels for early detection of exotic pests that could threaten commercial, environmental and amenity forests. Biosecurity surveillance for exotic forest pests relies on monitoring of host trees - or sentinel trees - around high-risk sites, such as airports and seaports. There are few publicly available spatial databases of urban street and park trees, so locating and mapping host trees is conducted via ground surveys. This is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and generally does not provide complete coverage. Advances in remote sensing technologies and machine learning provide an opportunity for semi-automation of tree species mapping to assist in biosecurity surveillance. In this study, we obtained high resolution (>= 12 cm), 10-band, multispectral imagery using the ArborCamTM system mounted to a fixed-wing aircraft over Sydney, Australia. We mapped 630 Pinus trees and 439 Platanus trees onfoot, validating their exact location on the airborne imagery using an in-field mapping app. Using a machine learning, convolutional neural network workflow, we were able to classify the two target genera with a high level of accuracy in a complex urban landscape. Overall accuracy was 92.1% for Pinus and 95.2% for Platanus, precision (user's accuracy) ranged from 61.3% to 77.6%, sensitivity (producer's accuracy) ranged from 92.7% to 95.2%, and F1-score ranged from 74.6% to 84.4%. Our study validates the potential for using multispectral imagery and machine learning to increase efficiencies in tree biosecurity surveillance. We encourage biosecurity agencies to consider greater use of this technology.

TI  - Spectral features of ocean colour radiometric products in the presence of cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria blooms are recurrent in the Baltic Sea with frequency and intensity increasing with temperature. By relying on autonomous multispectral measurements from the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC), this study exploited an unprecedented dataset of in situ remote sensing reflectance RRS(lambda) spectra (with wavelength lambda in the interval 400-667 nm) acquired during filamentous cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea. The study investigated the temporal evolution of the in situ RRS(lambda) during these blooms with particular emphases on those spectral features that may show potential to identify cyanobacteria and their development stages. Additionally, it assessed operational satellite Ocean Colour RRS(lambda) products from the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the presence of cyanobacteria, for which only qualitative evaluations are available from previous studies. To ascertain to what extent satellite operational data products could be used for cyanobacteria detection in the Baltic Sea, the comparison of in situ and satellite derived RRS(lambda) showed poor agreement with differences particularly pronounced at the blue centre-wavelengths. Nevertheless, band-differences in the green-red spectral region for OLCI and for MODIS exhibited less dependence on atmospheric correction issues with mean absolute relative differences between 8.3% and 9.6% for OLCI and between 12.6% and 12.9% for MODIS in the presence of cyanobacteria. Additionally, they showed potential to indicate the presence and development stage of cya-nobacteria blooms in Baltic Sea waters while not being sensitive to other algal blooms.

TI  - Dependence of ocean surface filaments on wind speed: An observational study of North Atlantic right whale habitat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coherent filaments at the ocean surface often appear to be transient watermass boundaries, where currents converge, surfactants accumulate, and frontal structure at depth can possibly delineate enhanced biological activity in the upper water column. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) permits filaments to be observed at O[1-km] resolution, but extensive coherent structures are more apparent in weaker winds. A wind speed adjustment is proposed for filaments (i.e., contiguous SAR contrasts) of at least 10 km in length. Measures of dependence (distance correlation and the linear and nonlinear components of Pearson correlation) are examined to identify a broad peak in the relationship between filament contrast and weak or moderate values of surface wind speed, where a variable wind speed exponent is employed to maximize these measures. Three locations of recent North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) sightings in the Gulf of St. Lawrence are sampled between 2008 and 2020 by 324 Radarsat-2 SAR scenes and 10-m wind speed from the ERA5 reanalysis. The inverse relationship between SAR contrast magnitude and wind speed is quantified, and a reduced correlation is obtained for all three domains when SAR contrast is weighted by wind speed to the power of 0.8. A more uniform emphasis on ocean surface structure within a SAR scene, or across multiple scenes, can thus be considered in the search for prey aggregations of the North Atlantic right whale.

TI  - CARTOGRAPHY AND ANALYSIS OF THE URBAN GROWTH, CASE STUDY: INTER-COMMUNAL GROUPING OF BATNA, ALGERIA
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the analysis of the urban macroform in terms of urban compactness and dispersion (urban sprawl) in the inter-communal grouping of Batna, which is composed of four adjacent interconnected communal districts: Batna, Tazoult, Oued Chaaba and Fesdis. First, the urban macroform is examined by mapping the urban areas that are characterised by morphological changes over a period of 36 years utilising remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) through satellite images taken from Landsat TM and ETM +, Sentinel 2 (1984, 1996, 2008 and 2020). Next, the Shannon entropy method is utilised to determine compactness or dispersion of urban growth over time. In addition, a fractal analysis based on the box-counting method is used to assess the complexity and to explain the morphological reality of the macroform through urban changes. In order to predict the future change scenarios and spatial distributions of land use and land cover in the coming years the hybrid cellular automata (CA) - Markov method is used. The results of the remote sensing, Shannon entropy values and fractal indices demonstrate that Batna inter-municipal grouping has experienced moderate urban development according to the observed urban sprawl between 1984 and 2020. These data are helpful in the urban planning and to provide decision-making tools.

TI  - Shifts in vegetation activity of terrestrial ecosystems attributable to climate trends
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is expected to impact the functioning of the entire Earth system. However, detecting changes in ecosystem dynamics and attributing such change to anthropogenic climate change has proved difficult. Here we analyse the vegetation dynamics of 100 sites representative of the diversity of terrestrial ecosystem types using remote-sensing data spanning the past 40 years and a dynamic model of plant growth, forced by climate reanalysis data. We detect a change in vegetation activity for all ecosystem types and find these changes can be attributed to trends in climate-system parameters. Ecosystems in dry and warm locations responded primarily to changes in soil moisture, whereas ecosystems in cooler locations responded primarily to changes in temperature. We find that the effects of CO2 fertilization on vegetation are limited, potentially due to masking by other environmental drivers. Observed trend switching is widespread and dominated by shifts from greening to browning, suggesting many of the ecosystems studied are accumulating less carbon. Our study reveals a clear fingerprint of climate change in the change exhibited by terrestrial ecosystems over recent decades.An analysis fusing satellite data with a process-based model of plant growth attributes changes in vegetation activity across terrestrial ecosystems to climatic changes.

TI  - Estimation of high spatial resolution all-weather near-surface air temperature using FY-4A AGRI observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (Tair) at high spatiotemporal resolution is critical to meteorological, hydrological, and ecological processes. At present, the satellite based Tair estimation is generally restricted to clear skies, while the Tair estimation method under cloudy skies needs further development. In this study, a neural network-based approach was proposed to estimate the instantaneous all-weather Tair with high spatial resolution (i.e., 250 m). The approach includes two independent Tair estimation models for clear and cloudy sky conditions. The inputs of the model mainly include FY-4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) products, Global Forecast System (GFS) Tair forecasts, elevation, MODIS normalized difference vegetative index and other auxiliary pa-rameters. The AGRI land surface temperature was used to estimate Tair under clear skies (Ta,clear), while cloud top height and temperature were used to estimate Tair under cloudy skies (Ta,cloudy). Validation using the in-situ Tair revealed that the correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.986 and 1.42 degrees C for Ta, clear, and 0.983 and 1.46 degrees C for Ta,cloudy, respectively. In addition, the AGRI estimated Tair was compared with ERA5-Land product, and the accuracy of AGRI Tair was better than the ERA5-Land data (RMSE = 2.2 degrees C, R = 0.984). The proposed model has good potential for all-weather Tair estimation with high spatiotemporal reso-lution and can be easily applied to other geostationary satellites.

TI  - Identification of high-risk patients with a seven- biomarker prognostic signature for adjuvant treatment trial recruitment in American Joint Committee on Cancer v8 stage I-IIA cutaneous melanoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Many patients with resected American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) early-stage cutaneous melanoma nonetheless die of melanoma; additional risk strat-ification approaches are needed.Patients and methods: Using prospectively-collected whole-tissue sections, we assessed in consecutive stage I-IIA patients (N Z 439), a previously-validated, immunohistochemistry-based, 7-biomarker signature to prognosticate disease-free survival (DFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS; primary end-point) and overall survival (OS), independent of AJCC classification.Results: Seven-marker signature testing designated 25.1% of patients (110/439) as high-risk (stage IA, 13.3% [43/323], IB, 53.2% [42/79], and IIA, 67.6% [25/37]). A Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated high-risk patients to have significantly worse DFS, MSS and OS versus low-risk counterparts (P < 0.001). In multivariable Cox regression modelling also including key clinico-pathological/demographic factors, 7-marker signature data independently prognosticated the studied end-points. Models with the 7-marker signature risk category plus clinicopathological/ demographic covariates substantially outperformed models with clinicopathological/demo-graphic variables alone in predicting all studied outcomes (areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve 74.1% versus 68.4% for DFS, 81.5% versus 71.2% for MSS, 80.9% versus 73.0% for OS; absolute differences 5.7%, 10.3% and 7.9%, respectively, favouring 7-marker signature risk category-containing models). Conclusion: In patients with AJCC early-stage disease, the 7-marker signature reliably prognos-ticates melanoma-related outcomes, independent of AJCC classification, and provides a valu-able complement to clinicopathological/demographic factors.

TI  - Validation of the TROPOMI/S5P aerosol layer height using EARLINET lidars
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of the Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to derive accurate geometrical features of lofted aerosol layers, selecting the Mediterranean Basin as the study area. Comparisons with ground-based correlative measurements constitute a key component in the validation of passive and active satellite aerosol products. For this purpose, we use ground-based observations from quality-controlled lidar stations reporting to the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET). An optimal methodology for validation purposes has been developed and applied using the EARLINET optical profiles and TROPOMI aerosol products, aiming at the in-depth evaluation of the TROPOMI aerosol layer height (ALH) product for the period 2018 to 2022 over the Mediterranean Basin. Seven EARLINET stations were chosen, taking into consideration their proximity to the sea, which provided 63 coincident aerosol cases for the satellite retrievals. In the following, we present the first validation results for the TROPOMI/S5P ALH using the optimized EARLINET lidar products employing the automated validation chain designed for this purpose. The quantitative validation at pixels over the selected EARLINET stations illustrates that the TROPOMI ALH product is consistent with the EARLINET lidar products, with a high correlation coefficient R = 0.82 (R = 0.51) and a mean bias of -0.51 +/- 0.77 km and -2.27 +/- 1.17 km over ocean and land, respectively. Overall, it appears that aerosol layer altitudes retrieved from TROPOMI are systematically lower than altitudes from the lidar retrievals. High-albedo scenes, as well as low-aerosol-load scenes, are the most challenging for the TROPOMI retrieval algorithm, and these results testify to the need to further investigate the underlying cause. This work provides a clear indication that the TROPOMI ALH product can under certain conditions achieve the required threshold accuracy and precision requirements of 1 km, especially when only ocean pixels are included in the comparison analysis. Furthermore, we describe and analyse three case studies in detail, one dust and two smoke episodes, in order to illustrate the strengths and limitations of the TROPOMI ALH product and demonstrate the presented validation methodology. The present analysis provides important additions to the existing validation studies that have been performed so far for the TROPOMI S5P ALH product, which were based only on satellite-to-satellite comparisons.

TI  - Land use/land cover change and its implication on soil erosion in an ecologically sensitive Himachal Himalayan watershed, Northern India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a major environmental problem that affects land and w ater resources. It has many negative implications that lead to deforestation, poor agricultural practices, loss of soil fertility, and siltation that hinder socio-economic development. In view of this, the present study was conducted with the aim of estimating soil loss in relation to long-term land use/land cover change (LULC) in the Dehar watershed, Himachal Himalaya, North India. The study was carried out using Landsat and Sentinel imageries for the years 1999, 2010, and 2020. A GIS-based Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was applied to assess the potential soil risk. The parameters used as input for computing the spatiotemporal changes of soil loss were rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topographic, crop management, and conservation support practice factors. The results showed a mean soil loss of 63.71, 60.99, and 66.71 t/ha/yr for the years 1999, 2010, and 2020, respectively. In the LULC class defined as Built-up Land, the mean soil loss decreased from 32.19 t/ha/yr in 1999 to 18.77 t/ha/yr in 2010, and in the year 2020 the mean soil loss slightly increased to 20.15 t/ha/yr. Moreover, the LULC class Barren Land registered a decrease in mean soil loss for the years 1999, 2010, and 2020 of 86.43, 74.60, and 73.19 t/ha/yr, respectively. Regarding the Agriculture Land class, the rate of mean soil loss slightly increased from 32.55 t/ha/yr in 1999 to 33.35 t/ha/yr in 2010, and the mean soil loss decreased to 25.43 t/ha/yr in the year 2020. Areas covered under Forest Land experienced an increase in mean soil loss from 65.30 t/ha/yr in 1999 to 65.87 in 2010 and 74.72 t/ha/yr in 2020. The study demonstrated that LULC changes apparently influenced the soil loss in the Dehar watershed. Therefore, urgent interventions are required with the involvement of scientists, policymakers, and the general public for conservation and management of soil resources.

TI  - Modeling of land surface temperature (LST) in Ardabil plain using NDVI index and Bayesian neural network approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the relationship between vegetation cover and land surface temperature (LST) and modeling of this relationship in Ardabil plain. To achieve this goal, Landsat images for the years 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020 prepared from the USGS site and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST calculated from these images for Ardabil plain. The spatial changes of the indicators investigated during 2010 to 2020; then the relationship between them was obtained by Pearson correlation. Finally, using the Bayesian neural network, the average LST of Ardabil Plain was used as the dependent variable and the NDVI index was used as the independent variable. The results showed that the most vegetation cover was in the central areas of Ardabil plain, which belongs to agricultural use, and the NDVI index in these areas varied between 0.55 and 0.67. The maximum LST was 83 degrees Kelvin in the northern mountains and the minimum LST was 37 degrees Kelvin in the of Ardabil plain. The most changes in the NDVI index were between + 0.43 and - 0.47, with the most negative index occurring in the center of Ardabil plain, where agricultural lands have been converted into man-made lands. The most difference in the LST was in the central part of Ardabil plain, which increased up to 26 degrees Kelvin. Pearson's correlation coefficient between NDVI indices and LST was significant (- 0.52) in Ardabil plain, which indicates an inverse relationship between them. The Bayesian neural network model showed that the R coefficient was 0.75 for the test data, 0.74 for the validation and 0.75 for the whole model, which indicates the appropriate fit of the model in predicting the LST with NDVI is used, which means that the NDVI index can estimate up to 75% of the LST changes.

AB  - As one of the most important components of terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation is essential for maintaining ecosystem functions. Excavating the independent effect and coupling of climate and topography on vegetation variation is conducive to the high-quality development of the regional ecological environment. Based on the remote sensing data of Landsat 5/7/8 and Sentinel-2, the spatiotemporal evolution of Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) from 1990 to 2020 is explored with the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The individual effect and coupling of climate and topography factors are discussed through the geographic detector model, taking the Yellow River Basin of Henan Province (YRBHP) as the study area. The results show that: (1) The eastern and western parts of the YRBHP are densely covered with vegetation, and the central area is scarce. The FVC of the YRBHP has improved significantly from 1990 to 2020, and the proportion of improved areas is 67.7%. (2) Elevation is the strongest driving factor of FVC in the YRBHP, and the contribution rate to FVC was 0.3. (3) The coupling effect of climate and topography factors enhances the effect on FVC, among which the strongest coupling effect is elevation and precipitation. The results could dig deeper by analyzing the coupling relationship among the driving factors for providing the suitable environment condition for vegetation restoration.

T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Accurately capturing the changing patterns of ecological quality in the urban agglomeration on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM) and researching its significant impacts responds to the requirements of high-quality sustainable urban development. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) were obtained by normalization and PCA transformation of four basic indicators based on Landsat images. It then employed geographic detectors to analyze the factors that influence ecological change. The result demonstrates that: (1) In the distribution of land use conversions and degrees of human disturbance, built-up land, principally urban land, and agricultural land, represented by dry land, are rising, while the shrinkage of grassland is the most substantial. The degree of human disturbance is increasing overall for glaciers. (2) The overall ecological environment of the northern slopes of Tianshan is relatively poor. Temporally, the ecological quality changes and fluctuates, with an overall rising trend. Spatially, ecological quality is low in the north and south and high in the center, with high values concentrated in the mountains and agriculture and low values in the Gobi and desert. However, on a large scale, the ecological quality of the Urumqi-Changji-Shihezi metropolitan area has worsened dramatically compared to other regions. (3) Driving factor detection showed that LST and NDVI were the most critical influencing factors, with an upward trend in the influence of WET. Typically, LST has the biggest influence on RSEI when interacting with NDVI. In terms of the broader region, the influence of social factors is smaller, but the role of human interference in the built-up area of the oasis city can be found to be more significant at large scales. The study shows that it is necessary to strengthen ecological conservation efforts in the UANSTM region, focusing on the impact of urban and agricultural land expansion on surface temperature and vegetation.

TI  - Dynamic Analysis of Risk to Water Quality in the Baimei Reservoir Conservation Area, Fujian Province, China
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The security of drinking water resources is an important concern for human survival. The extensive use of geographic information system and remote sensing data in risk assessments of water quality from a spatiotemporal perspective can complement water resource management. In this study, we investigated Baimei reservoir conservation area, Fujian Province, China. The quantitatively inversed leaf area index was used to represent the vegetation growth condition in simulations of the hydrological process using soil and water assessment tool. According to the simulation results, the spatial distribution of the risk to water quality was mainly related to the land-use condition, and the temporal distribution of the risk to water quality was mainly related to the precipitation dynamics. Single factor analysis of various scenarios showed that uncontrolled expansion of agricultural land (scenario A) would lead to an overall average increase of 231.9% in the total nitrogen (TN) load in the basin. By contrast, if agricultural lands are all transformed into forests (scenario B), then the overall TN load in the basin would decrease by an average of 20.8%. In practical terms, conversion of sloping agricultural lands to forests (scenario C) could reduce the overall TN load by 17.0%. Thus, moderate conversion of agricultural lands to forests can reduce the pollution load effectively. The simulation results obtained for scenarios with adjustments to the fertilization time and amount showed that applying fertilizer on rainy days would increase the risk to water quality compared with days without rain. The method developed in this study can be applied for dynamic analysis in water quality risk assessments of water conservation areas and can provide a scientific reference for promoting ecological management strategies and sustainable development at the regional scale.

TI  - A series of spatio-temporal analyses and predicting modeling of land use and land cover changes using an integrated Markov chain and cellular automata models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For sustainable land cover planning, spatial land cover models are essential. Deforestation, loss of agriculture, and conversion of pasture land to urban and industrial uses are only some of the negative consequences of human kind's insatiable need for more land. Using remote sensing multi-temporal data, spatial criteria, and prediction models can effectively monitor these changes and plan for sustainable land use. This research aims to predict the land use and land cover (LULC) with cellular automata (CA) and Markov chain models. Landsat TM, ETM + , and OLI/TIRS data were used for mapping LULC distributions for the years 1990, 2006, and 2022. A CA-Markov chain was developed for simulating long-term landscape changes at 16-year time steps from 2022 to 2054. Analysis of urban sprawl was carried out by using the support vector machine (SVM). Through the CA-Markov chain analysis, we expect that built-up area will grow from 285.68 km(2) (22.59%) to 383.54 km(2) (30.34%) in 2022 and 2054, as inferred from the changes that occurred from 1990 to 2022. Therefore, substantial deforestation area reduction will result if existing tendencies in change continue despite sustainable development efforts. The findings of this research can inform land cover management strategies and assist local authorities in preparing for the present and the future. They can balance expanding the city and preserving its natural resources.

TI  - Validation and calibration of partitioned integral ocean wave parameters from co-polarized synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The inversion of wave spectrum is the embodiment of the fine observation of ocean swells by synthetic aperture radar. Due to the nonlinear distortion from velocity bunching, the operational Sentinel-1 Wave Mode (WV) level-2 (L2) Ocean (OCN) wave products retrieved by quasi-linear inversion are still quite different from the real wave spectrum, requiring further calibration. Limited by the azimuth cut-off, the quasi-linear inversed wave spectrum mostly concentrates on swells with a wavelength longer than 150 m. 2D spectral partitioning separates different swell systems, denoted as partitions in the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN product. We compared and calibrated the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products' swell partitions (More specifically partitioned integral ocean wave parameters: partitioned wave height, partitioned wavelength, and partitioned wave direction) with WAVEWATCH III (WW3) in different polarization modes (HH and VV polarization) and different incidence angles (-23 degrees -WV1 and - 36 degrees- WV2).The accuracy of swell partitions in the OCN products varies with peak wave direction relative to the Sentinel-1 flight direction, and it is difficult to calibrate the partitions derived from quasi-linear inversion unless deleting partitions severely distorted by nonlinearity and large-scale features. A machine learning method is proposed to calibrate the wave partitions. Spectral distances of collocated Sentinel-1 and WW3 partition pairs larger than two are considered "bad" partitions to be filtered. Inputting high-dimensional features (twenty-one features) derived from Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products into the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model can effectively reduce the bias (root-mean-square error, RMSE) of significant wave height (SWH) of all the partitions from-0.10 m (-0.70 m) to-0.00 m (-0.46 m) and the bias (RMSE) of wavelengths of all the partitions from-20 m (-35 m) to-0.20 m (-26 m) compared with WW3 swell partitions. This method improves the precision of the wave partition and retains more partitions in the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products than previous studies, especially for wave partitions with moderate wave height (< 4 m), potentially improving the understanding of swell dynamics globally.

TI  - Cytoskeletal orchestration of glucose uptake in Sertoli cell to support efferocytosis of apoptotic germ cells
T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Efferocytosis of non-viable germ cells by Sertoli cells (SCs) constitutes a sentinel for testis homeostasis, yet how SCs signal for the metabolic and cytoskeletal adaption to this energetically costly process remains unexplored. Spectrin is membrane-associated periodic skeleton assembled into an actin-spectrin-based cytoskeletal structure with an interaction with glucose transporter Glut1. The contribution of spectrin to glucose uptake and effer-ocytosis is unknown. In this study, we identified a cross-regulation between glucose metabolism and efferocytosis in SCs. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of glucose uptake or glycolysis compromises efferocytosis activity. We further found that beta II-spectrin is a hitherto unappreciated regulator of glucose metabolism and cytoskeletal architecture. beta II-spectrin deficiency impairs glucose uptake and lactate production in SCs. Moreover, a defective assembly of cytoskeleton and a loss of blood-testis barrier integrity are also featured by SCs deficient in beta II-spectrin. The disruption in glucose metabolism and cytoskeletal organization synergistically lead to a defective efferocytosis. In vivo siRNA-mediated targeting of beta II-spectrin in testis causes an obvious morphological aber-ration in seminiferous epithelium with the presence of exfoliated germ cells and multinucleated giant cells. Importantly, a decrease in expression of alpha II/beta II-spectrin was observed in testes of Adjudin-induced infertility model. By exploring the functional relevance of beta II-spectrin to the metabolic and cytoskeletal regulation of efferocytosis, our study proposes a potential link between beta II-spectrin deregulation and male infertility.

TI  - Remote sensing technology for rapid extraction of burned areas and ecosystem environmental assessment
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are one of the significant disturbances in forest ecosystems. It is essential to extract burned areas rapidly and accurately to formulate forest restoration strategies and plan restoration plans. In this work, we constructed decision trees and used a combination of differential normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index and OTSU threshold method to extract the heavily and mildly burned areas. The applicability of this method was evaluated with three fires in Muli County, Sichuan, China, and we concluded that the extraction accuracy of this method could reach 97.69% and 96.37% for small area forest fires, while the extraction accuracy was lower for large area fires, only 89.32%. In addition, the remote sensing environment index (RSEI) was used to evaluate the ecological environment changes. It analyzed the change of the RSEI level through the transition matrix, and all three fires showed that the changes in RSEI were stronger for heavily burned areas than for mildly burned areas, after the forest fire the ecological environment (RSEI) was reduced from good to moderate. These results realized the quantitative evaluation and dynamic evaluation of the ecological environment condition, providing an essential basis for the restoration, decision making and management of the affected forests.

T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study elicits the main development challenges for the indigenous social-ecological system (SES) of the Guna people in Panama, which is characterized by rapid change and a unique governance system. We elicit the key challenges in the region through a combination of expert interviews with key actors in Gunayala's development and surveys with local communities. Current development centred on tourism and government support provide new livelihood opportunities, access to better education and healthcare. However, the shift from a subsistence-based economy characterized by strong community cohesion to a lifestyle characterized by capital accumulation has had undesirable consequences. The current modernization and development trends have degraded some of the core values within the Guna belief system and worldview, and ultimately degraded elements of the SES. This is despite the strong institutions and self-determination in Gunayala, which are commonly identified as strong buffers against unsustainable change in indigenous settings. Our study shows that merging the perspectives of national experts and Indigenous communities can help provide complementary lenses to identify how modernization processes, development aspirations and socioeconomic and environmental change intersect. Arguably this can provide valuable insights to inform effective and sensitive development programmes and mitigate unintended consequences.

TI  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA)-based gully erosion dynamics, sediment loading rate and sediment yield study in Lake Hawassa Sub-basin, Ethiopia
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is a serious environmental issue in Lake Hawassa Sub-basin. It has affected a large portion of the catchment, and a large amount of sediment has been transported into the lake. This condition needs to be addressed. However, before conservation techniques are implemented, the gully systems should be mapped, their extent and changes over time need to be measured, and their capacity to produce sediment from their catchments should be determined. The objective of this study were, therefore, to map and analyse the change in gully erosion and quantify the sediment loading rate and sediment yield from the active and connected gullies in Lake Hawassa Sub-basin using object-based image analysis (OBIA) with high-resolution SPOT 5 satellite image of the years 2011 and 2020. This method was integrated with field observation for mapping gully features of the study area, in comparison with automatic digitization carried out with the help of eCogenition Developer Version 9.1 and ArcGIS tools. Overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were determined and were found to be 85.2% and 0.81, respectively, for the image of year 2020 and 81.1% and 0.76, respectively, for the image of year 2011. Based on the OBIA method, the extent of gullies (in area) were found to be 63.5 km(2) in 2011 and 79.9 km(2) showing a rapid increase between 2011 and 2020 (an increase of 16.4 km(2) (24.4%) in the 10 years considered). The later result shows that 5.53% of the area of the Lake Hawassa Sub-basin is affected by gully erosion. The maximum gully density in the study area was found to be 589 km/km(2) in 2011 and this increased to 884 km/km(2) in 2020. The sediment loading rate from the Lake's catchment was found to be in the range of 12.62 to 38.59 ton per hectare per year. The sediment yield from the Lake's catchment was 8.83 to 27.02 t/ha/year. The total annual volume-based sediment yield at the Lake generated from the gully was 2.39 million cubic meter considering sediment delivery ratio of 70% for fully connected gullies. This result shows that 0.21% of the storage capacity of the Lake was being lost due to sedimentation from the gully system every year. From the result by dividing the total volume of the sediment by the surface area of the lake, one can see that a silt thickness of 2.51 cm was being deposited in the Lake every year.

TI  - A Rare Case of Invasive Cribriform Carcinoma in Male Breast
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Rare diseaseBackground: Male breast cancer is a very rare disease that represents 0.6% of all breast carcinomas. Among breast carcino-mas, invasive cribriform carcinoma (ICC) is a rare type of breast carcinoma and is more common in older wom-en, with only a few cases in men reported. We present a case of male breast cancer with ICC.Case Report: A 58-year-old man presented with a painful and palpable mass in the left breast, which was diagnosed as breast cancer of the ICC type. The patient underwent total mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy. On the microscope, the tumor was composed of more than 90% cribriform glands with comedo necrosis and dys-trophic calcification. On immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, it appeared to be a luminal breast cancer. The IHC staining for c-erb B2 was equivocal (2 positive); hence fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed, and showed no amplification of the HER2/neu oncogene. The Ki-67 labeling index was 30%. The patient re-ceived radiotherapy and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (4 cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide), and has been on antiestrogen therapy (daily tamoxifen, 20 mg) for 30 months with no evidence of disease.Conclusions: ICC is a rare type of invasive carcinoma of the breast, and ICC from the male breast is extremely rare. We re-port, in this case, the final pathologic results of a male patient diagnosed with ICC breast cancer and treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.

TI  - A framework for estimating all-weather fine resolution soil moisture from the integration of physics-based and machine learning-based algorithms
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the effects of radio frequency interference and the limitations of algorithms under specific conditions, most of the currently available microwave-based soil moisture (SM) products are spatially discontinuous and have coarse spatial resolution, whereas optical observations also reveal various data gaps due to cloud contamination. Hence, the prediction of SM over invalid pixels and disaggregation from coarse to high scales are two main processes for obtaining SM at fine spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., daily/1-km). In the present study, two methods with respect to disaggregation-first or prediction-first were investigated from the synergetic use of the widely recognized European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) SM product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region. Specifically, the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) algorithm and the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) were implemented in the disaggregation and prediction, respectively. In DisPATCh, spatially complete land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) were provided as essential inputs to downscale the microwave-based ESA-CCI to a spatial resolution of 1 km, whereas MODIS-derived LST, NDVI, land surface albedo and DEM were considered in the GRNN prediction. Following the two methods, the daily/1-km SM dataset over a period of three years was finally estimated. Assessments with ground in-situ SM measurements over the TP region reveal an acceptable accuracy with unbiased root mean square errors of similar to 0.06 m3/m3, indicating the potential to obtain operational daily/1-km spatially continuous SM products in future developments.

TI  - Contrasting responses of peak vegetation growth to asymmetric warming: Evidences from FLUXNET and satellite observations
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The peak growth of plant in summer is an important indicator of the capacity of terrestrial ecosystem productivity, and ongoing studies have shown its responses to climate warming as represented in the mean temperature. However, the impacts from the asymmetrical warming, that is, different rates in the changes of daytime (T-max) and nighttime (T-min) warming were mostly ignored. Using 60 flux sites (674 site -year in total) measurements and satellite observations from two independent satellite platforms (Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies [1982- 2015]; MODIS [2000- 2020]) over the Northern Hemisphere (>= 30 degrees N), here we show that the peak growth, as represented by both flux -based maximum primary productivity and the maximum greenness indices (maximum normalized difference vegetation index and enhanced vegetation index), responded oppositely to daytime and nighttime warming. T-T-max+(min) (peak growth showed negative responses to T-max, but positive responses to T-min) dominated in most ecosystems and climate types, especially in water-limited ecosystems, while T+T-max-(min) (peak growth showed positive responses to T-max, but negative responses to T-min) was primarily observed in high latitude regions. These contrasting responses could be explained by the strong association between asymmetric warming and water conditions, including soil moisture, evapotranspiration/potential evapotranspiration, and the vapor pressure deficit. Our results are therefore important to the understanding of the responses of peak growth to climate change, and consequently a better representation of asymmetrical warming in future ecosystem models by differentiating the contributions between daytime and nighttime warming.

TI  - Simulating the impact of natural disasters on urban development in a sample of earthquake
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Natural disasters have been increased in areas, where people live densely, day by day. Istanbul 1999, Van 2011, and Izmir 2020 earthquakes were just some of the tragic events in the near past in Turkiye. The aim of this study was to define Van 2011 earthquakes effects as a sample on urban development by using land use/land cover projecting techniques. In this case, Van urban development (in urban macroform scale) was simulated without Van 2011 earthquakes based on existing urban development using the Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MARKOV) approach for the year 2018. Effects of the earthquake were determined on urban development by comparing modeling results with observed 2018 built up areas. So that significant physical and social driving factors were evaluated including road distance, slope, hillshade, ground stability, and land use ability, and weighting values on urban development were calculated under the influence of the natural disaster. Van urban built up areas were mapped using high-spatial resolution remote sensing instruments such as SPOT, ASTER, RapidEye, and Gokturk 2 satellite dataset for 1988-2002-2011, and 2018 images applying an object-based classification approach (OBC). First of all, the model was validated using 1988, 2002, and 2011 urban development maps. The Kappa accuracy was found to be 0.85, respectively, for the model. Defined urbanization drivers were applied to the 2002-2011 time period to simulate 2018 urban areas without any earthquake. The results indicated that urban areas were affected by earthquakes. If there was no earthquake, urban development to the periphery would be 30% less. Additionally, 10% more built up areas would be constructed on ground sensitive areas, and only 2% of the new constructions would be established on suitable lands. Today this ratio is around 8%. As a result, urban development has been a trend to move from flat land to slight slopes and has been moved away from roads and settlements. It was determined that the spread into the city was accelerated as well as spread toward the periphery due to the earthquake.

TI  - Evaluation of distributed process-based hydrologic model performance using only a priori information to define model inputs
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fully distributed, integrated surface-subsurface hydrological models (ISSHMs) have seen renewed interest due to availability of better software, high performance computing facilities, and high-resolution, spatially extensive data products. ISSHMs are valuable as tools for advancing system understanding as they can resolve multiple processes defined on the plot scale including three-dimensional interaction of surface water and groundwater. Here, we evaluated the performance of an ISSHM, the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), on seven diverse catchments across the continental US using widely available data products to define model inputs without calibration. We compare the ATS-simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with gauge observations and MODIS-derived evapotranspiration, respectively. Using the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as metric, ATS with default data products performed reasonably well at 6 of 7 catchments for streamflow. However, in one of those 6 catchments ATS had poor performance on baseflow and ATS's overall performance was thus judged to be inadequate despite the acceptable KGE. ATS performance for evapotranspiration was good in all 7 catchments using default data products. In the two catchments where ATS streamflow performance using default data products was not acceptable, the performance was significantly improved by using local information on sub-surface properties below the soil. We also compare the model-simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with the Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SAC-SMA) model, a semi-distributed model that was calibrated on a catchment-by-catchment basis. Uncalibrated ATS performance is comparable to the calibrated SAC-SMA model in terms of streamflow while ATS performance is similar to or better (much better in certain catchments) in reproducing MODIS-derived evapotranspiration. Reasonably good performance of ATS without catchment -specific calibration provides new confidence in the ISSHM class of models and community data products as tools for advancing understanding of watershed function in a changing environment.

TI  - One year of near-continuous fire monitoring on a continental scale: Comparing fire radiative power from polar-orbiting and geostationary observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary and polar-orbiting remote sensors have different opportunities to observe wildfires. While polar-orbiting sensors have been favoured in wildfire observations, geostationary sensors offer a higher observation frequency. Here, we assess the utility of the Himawari-8 AHI geostationary product and compare it to established polar-orbiting observations from TERRA/AQUA MODIS and SNPP VIIRS for 12 months of fire activity in Australia (2019-2020). Fire Radiative Power (FRP) estimates from AHI (BRIGHT/AHI) are compared to the MODIS (MOD14/MYD14) and VIIRS (VNP14IMG) polar-orbiting products, through varying spatial and temporal aggregations. Results suggest that all products capture similar wildfire dynamics across the continent. For near-simultaneously observed hotspots, the agreement is high between BRIGHT/AHI and the individual polar-orbiting products (r = 0.74-0.77, p < 0.01). Land cover and region-specific comparisons show similar FRP estimate distributions between products, although with scale differences due to the varying spatial resolutions. Derived diurnal FRP cycles on the other hand, highlight the dense temporal information that BRIGHT/AHI offers in contrast to the other products. This is further emphasized with individual event comparisons, where BRIGHT/ AHI reports fire activity continuously while the polar-orbiting products only offer fragmented observations when available. In conclusion, AHI observes similar spatiotemporal patterns and FRP estimation distributions to MODIS and VIIRS during different seasons across Australia. While BRIGHT/AHI's coarser spatial resolution underestimates the FRP estimations captured by its counterparts, its higher observation frequency demonstrates significant advantages. This analysis further raises the confidence in BRIGHT/AHI for continuous wildfire monitoring across Australia while revealing new opportunities that take advantage of its denser observation record.

TI  - Do cats mirror their owner? Paired exposure assessment using silicone bands to measure residential PAH exposure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been suggested that domestic animals can serve as sentinels for human exposures. In this study our objectives were to demonstrate that i) silicone collars can be used to measure environmental exposures of (domestic) animals, and that ii) domestic animals can be used as sentinels for human residential exposure. For this, we simultaneously measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using silicone bands worn by 30 pet cats (collar) and their owner (wristband). Collars and wristbands were worn for 7 days and analyzed via targeted Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Demographics and daily routines were collected for humans and cats. Out of 16 PAHs, 9 were frequently detected (>50% of samples) in both wristbands and collars, of which Phenanthrene and Fluorene were detected in all samples. Concentrations of wristbands and collars were moderately correlated for these 9 PAHs (Median Spearman's r = 0.51 (range 0.16-0.68)). Determinants of PAH concentrations of cats and humans showed considerable overlap, with vacuum cleaning resulting in higher exposures and frequent changing of bed sheets in lower exposures. This study adds proof-of-principle data for the use of silicone collars to measure (domestic) animal exposure and shows that cats can be used as sentinels for human residential exposure.

TI  - Bayesian Latent Variable Co-kriging Model in Remote Sensing for Quality Flagged Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data products often include quality flags that inform users whether the associated observations are of good, acceptable or unreliable qualities. However, such information on data fidelity is not consistently considered in remote sensing data analyses. Motivated by observations from the atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) instrument on board NASA's Aqua satellite, we propose a latent variable co-kriging model with separable Gaussian processes to analyze large quality-flagged remote sensing data sets together with their associated quality information. We augment the posterior distribution by an imputation mechanism to decompose large covariance matrices into separate computationally efficient components taking advantage of their input structure. Within the augmented posterior, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure that mostly consists of direct simulations from conditional distributions. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient recursive prediction procedure. We apply the proposed method to air temperature data from the AIRS instrument. We show that incorporating quality flag information in our proposed model substantially improves the prediction performance compared to models that do not account for quality flags.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

TI  - Inversion of river discharge from remotely sensed river widths: A critical assessment at three-thousand global river gauges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating river discharge from satellite-derived river hydraulic variables (e.g., width, height, and slope) is the overarching goal of the remote sensing of discharge (RSQ) community. Numerous past studies have developed and intercompared different RSQ algorithms to demonstrate their feasibility, yet relatively few have focused on assessing how the RSQ algorithms are adapted to a wide range of rivers globally. As the community is now ready to expand to the global scale given advances in computing power, sensors, and the launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, a much broader geographic view of RSQ ac-curacy should be prioritized toward "better generalizability" instead of "higher accuracy at limited places". To help close this gap, we extracted multi-temporal river widths from >350 K Landsat scenes at >3 K river reaches globally, and used them to estimate discharge using the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm and the geomorphologically-enhanced variant (geoBAM). We use this framework to demonstrate how to apply an 'off the shelf'RSQ algorithm and test it globally without methodological intervention and answer: does it live up to its promise? Our daily discharge inversions (1984-2019) showed positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) at 27% of the gauges for BAM and 39% for geoBAM, and this percentage increased to 46-65% after feeding richer priors on flow seasonality and monthly variability, amounting to 1400-2000 successful inversions. Exploratory analyses showed that the inversion is the most sensitive to a channel geomorphological parameter b and climate aridity, where the optimal conditions are high -b, humid environments, as well as moderate width variability, leaf area index (LAI), and river width. Although specific to BAM/geoBAM, constraining the factors to their optimal ranges led to a median KGE of 0.33 for >600 gauges, which highlights the promising potential for global RSQ. We further discussed the optimal configuration of the RS/priors by analyzing results derived from different infor-mation content in priors. Overall, our critical assessment of BAM/geoBAM reveals a successful global imple-mentation of an existing algorithm that SWOT will improve. We suggest similar large-scale assessments for other RSQs be prioritized to identify the emerging challenges as we move into a new era with global river monitoring capability from space.

TI  - Acceptance for Income Inequality in Poland
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the contemporary theory of income inequality, the impact of this phenomenon on other economic categories is determined by the way it is perceived and accepted. Therefore, it is worth deepening knowledge on income disparity by identifying the factors that most influence acceptance for the latter. The main purpose of the article is to identify the factors affecting acceptance for income inequality in Poland. The basis for estimations conducted to verify the research hypotheses was a set of microdata from a survey conducted in Poland in 2019. Models were estimated using the Generalized Structural Equation Modelling approach. Our study revealed the endogeneity issues resulting from inclusion attitudes towards redistribution in the model of acceptance for income inequality. We have also revised results obtained in other research concerning similar problems-only income, age, sense of empowerment, conservative worldview and attitude towards redistribution proved to have direct significant impact on acceptance for income inequality.

TI  - Retrieval of Mangrove leaf area index and its response to typhoon based on WorldView-3 image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, mangroves have become one of the world's most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems due to human disturbance and climate change. Remote sensing techniques have helped to obtain biophysical parameters of forests on a large scale. However, to our knowledge, mangrove leaf area index (LAI) inversion using texture features and its scale dependency is rarely discussed. Whether the dynamics of remotely sensed LAI could reveal the responses of mangrove species to typhoon disturbance remain unknown. In this study, we classified mangrove species, estimated the LAI of each species based on high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV-3) images, and evaluated the performance of different object-based classifiers and the effects of texture features and scale dependency on the LAI model. We characterized typhoon disturbance on different species using interannual LAI variation. Random forest (RF) has the highest accuracy in man-grove species classification, with an overall accuracy of 82.29% after post-classification, com-pared with naive Bayes (NB), classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM). Texture features significantly increased the accuracy of LAI estimates, and the optimal prediction result was generated at a 2-m resampling rate (R2 = 0.52; MSE = 0.56). The mean LAIs of B. gymnorrhiza and S. apetala assemblages were sig-nificantly higher than those of K. obovata, S. caseolaris, and A. marina. LAI variation demonstrates a disturbance pattern caused by Typhoon Mangkhut. This typhoon had the greatest impact on K. obovata, while S. apetala and S. caseolaris showed good resistance to wind damage. We concluded that RF was the best classifier for mapping mangrove species distribution using object-based clas-sification algorithms with WV-3 image. The texture features play a key role in constructing the es-timation model of mangrove LAI with scale dependency.

TI  - Combining thermal, tri-stereo optical and bi-static InSAR satellite imagery for lava volume estimates: the 2021 Cumbre Vieja eruption, La Palma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining outline, volume and effusion rate during an effusive volcanic eruption is crucial as it is a major controlling factor of the lava flow lengths, the prospective duration and hence the associated hazards. We present for the first time a multi-sensor thermal-and-topographic satellite data analysis for estimating lava effusion rates and volume. At the 2021 lava field of Cumbre Vieja, La Palma, we combine VIIRS + MODIS thermal data-based effusion rate estimates with DSMs analysis derived from optical tri-stereo Pleiades and TanDEM-X bi-static SAR-data. This multi-sensor-approach allows to overcome limitations of single-methodology-studies and to achieve both, high-frequent observation of the relative short-term effusion rate trends and precise total volume estimates. We find a final subaerial-lava volume of 212 x 10(6) +/- 13 x 10(6) m(3) with a MOR of 28.8 +/- 1.4 m(3)/s. We identify an initially sharp eruption-rate-peak, followed by a gradually decreasing trend, interrupted by two shortlived-peaks in mid/end November. High eruption rate accompanied by weak seismicity was observed during the early stages of the eruption, while during later stage the lava effusion trend coincides with seismicity. This article demonstrates the geophysical monitoring of eruption rate fluctuations, that allows to speculate about changes of an underlying pathway during the 2021 Cumbre Vieja eruption.

TI  - A market-based mechanism for long-term groundwater management using remotely sensed data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater markets improve the agricultural economy by transferring water entitlements from low-efficient users to high-efficient ones to maximize productivity. Aiming at developing an efficient groundwater market, the environmental effects of the market mechanism should be assessed, and a reliable method for monitoring water consumption needs to be employed. Toward this end, this paper proposes three annual smart groundwater market mechanisms to maximize water net benefits, minimize groundwater withdrawal, and precisely measure water consumption in agricultural fields. To guarantee the aquifer's safe yield in each mechanism, a groundwater simulation model (i.e., Groundwater Modeling System (GMS)) is used to control groundwater table drawdown at the end of the planning horizon. In addition, the fields' evapotranspiration (ET) is estimated using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) algorithm to measure the net groundwater consumption during the market. In this regard, we evaluated the algorithms' performances using observed data from a local lysimeter. They are applied to the Nough plain in Iran to assess the effectiveness of the proposed market framework. The findings illustrate their efficiency in recovering approximately 80% (23.33 million cubic meters (MCM)) of groundwater loss due to overexploitation in the study area and increasing the users' annual benefits by 10.6% compared to the non -market condition. In addition, results imply that the METRIC model approximates daily crop ET with a higher accuracy level than the SEBAL model with RMSE, MAE, and Percentage Error of 0.37 mm/day, 0.32 mm/day, and 14.92%, respectively. This research revealed that the proposed market framework is a powerful tool for reallocating water entitlements and increasing water productivity in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Machine learning models fed with optimized spectral indices to advance crop nitrogen monitoring
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Remotely estimating plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) at the vegetative growth stage plays a crucial role in the precision N management of field crops. However, the great challenges still remain on how to over-come the impact of canopy structure variation and the 'N-dilution' effect on the accuracy of PNC assessment using spectral indices (SIs).Objective: This study was to apply machine learning (ML) algorithms fed with the optimized spectral indices (OSI), sensitive spectral bands (SSB), and full-spectrum (FS) to improve the prediction accuracy of PNC in critical vegetative growth stages of wheat, maize, rice, potato and the across crops. Methods: Four ML algorithms including the partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were compared for their efficacies in predicting PNC from ten field trials in different locations from 2005 to 2016.Results: The input variable had a non-negligible influence on the performance of ML models. The OSI was the most efficient input variable for the tested ML algorithms in predicting PNC. The OSI-based RF models showed consistent outperformance compared to other models regardless of crops. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.51-0.85 and the root means square error (RMSE) was 0.15% -0.34% in the experimental validation datasets. By choosing PNC-related spectral features across crops, the OSI-based RF models increased prediction accuracy by 10-31% compared with the best OSI-simple regression models, which was because the OSI-based RF models may be independent of canopy structure or the "N-dilution" impact. The simulated datasets based on the PROSAIL model and satellite multispectral bands further validated the results. Conclusions: Our study concludes that the OSI-based RF is a robust and effective model to predict crop PNC at the vegetative growth stage. Significance: The results of this study may provide insights into how to improve PNC assessment using the OSI-based RF models and deploy ML-based N recommendation models in the next generation of crop sensors.

TI  - A temporal-spectral value and shape change detection method integrating thematic index information and spectral band information
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery time series change detection methods are effective in avoiding pseudochange due to vegetation phenology to a certain extent. Traditional time series change detection methods use thematic indexes (e.g., NDVI, RVI) to obtain time series information for corresponding change detection. However, change detection methods using several thematic index time series may not make full use of other spectral band information in remotely sensed images and may still suffer from over- and under-detections. To address this challenge, a temporal-spectral value and shape change detection method integrating thematic index information and spectral band information (TISB) is proposed. Possible clouds and cloud shadowing phenomena are removed according to the changes in the spectral values of the remotely sensed images to avoid the generation of pseudochanges in clouds. The spectral and time series information is used to obtain change information from the value perspective, and then, further possible enhanced change regions from a shape perspective to obtain the final change detection results through the expectation-maximization (EM) method. Experiments with Landsat images have shown that the TISB method improves detection results by approximately 1-4% compared to the comparison method.

TI  - Research on land cover type classification method based on improved MaskFormer for remote sensing images
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing images have the characteristics of wide imaging coverage, rich spectral information and unobstructed by terrain and features. All of them provide convenient conditions for people to study land cover types. However, most existing remote sensing image land cover datasets are only labeled with some remote sensing images of low elevation plain areas, which is highly different from the topography and landscape of highland mountainous areas. In this study, we construct a Qilian County grassland ecological element dataset to provide data support for highland ecological protection. To highlight the characteristics of vegetation, our dataset only includes the RGB spectrum fused with the near-infrared spectrum. We then propose a segmentation network, namely, the Shunted-MaskFormer network, by using a maskbased classification method, a multi-scale, high-efficiency feature extraction module and a data-dependent upsampling method. The extraction of grassland land types from 2 m resolution remote sensing images in Qilian County was completed, and the generalization ability of the model on a small Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) verified. Results: (1) The MIoU of the optimised network model in the Qilian grassland dataset reached 80.75%, which is 2.37% higher compared to the suboptimal results; (2) the optimized network model achieves better segmentation results even for small sample classes in data sets with unbalanced sample distribution; (3) the highest MIOU of 72.3% is achieved in the GID dataset of open remote sensing images containing five categories; (4) the size of the optimized model is only one-third of the sub-optimal model.

TI  - A river basin spatial model to quantitively advance understanding of riverine tree response dynamics to water availability and hydrological management
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological condition continues to decline in arid and semi-arid river basins globally due to hydrological over-abstraction combined with changing climatic conditions. Whilst provision of water for the environment has been a primary approach to alleviate ecological decline, how to accurately monitor changes in riverine trees at fine spatial and temporal scales, remains a substantial challenge. This is further complicated by constantly changing water availability across expansive river basins with varying climatic zones. Within, we combine rare, fine-scale, high frequency temporal in-situ field collected data with machine learning and remote sensing, to provide a robust model that enables broadscale monitoring of physiological tree water stress response to environmental changes via actual evapotranspiration (ET). Physiological variation of Eucalyptus camaldulensis (River Red Gum) and E. largiflorens (Black Box) trees across 10 study locations in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, was captured instantaneously using sap flow sensors, substantially reducing tree response lags encountered by monitoring visual canopy changes. Actual ET measurement of both species was used to bias correct a national spatial ET product where a Random Forest model was trained using continuous timeseries of in-situ data of up to four years. Precise monthly AMLETT (Australia-wide Machine Learning ET for Trees) ET outputs in 30 m pixel resolution from 2012 to 2021, were derived by incorporating additional remote sensing layers such as soil moisture, land surface temperature, radiation and EVI and NDVI in the Random Forest model. Landsat and Sentinal-2 correlation results between in-situ ET and AMLETT ET returned R-2 of 0.94 (RMSE 6.63 mm period(-1)) and 0.92 (RMSE 6.89 mm period(-1)), respectively. In comparison, correlation between in-situ ET and a national ET product returned R-2 of 0.44 (RMSE 34.08 mm period(-1)) highlighting the need for bias correction to generate accurate absolute ET values. The AMLETT method presented here, enhances environmental management in river basins worldwide. Such robust broadscale monitoring can inform water accounting and importantly, assist decisions on where to prioritize water for the environment to restore and protect key ecological assets and preserve floodplain and riparian ecological function.

TI  - Clinical Impact and Accuracy of Shave Biopsy for Initial Diagnosis of Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Effective treatment of malignant melanomas is dependent upon accurate histopathological staging of preoperative biopsy specimens. While narrow excision is the gold standard for melanoma diagnosis, superficial shave biopsies have become the preferred method by dermatologists but may transect the lesion and result in inaccurate Breslow thickness assessment. This is a retrospective cohort study evaluating an initial method of biopsy for diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma and indication for reoperation based on inaccurate initial T-staging. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients referred to the Medical College of Wisconsin, a tertiary cancer center, with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma. Adult patients seen between 2015 and 2018 were included. Fisher's exact test was used to assess the association between method of initial biopsy and need for unplanned reoperation. Results: Three hundred twenty three patients with cutaneous melanoma from the head and neck (H&N, n = 101, 31%), trunk (n = 90, 15%), upper extremity (n = 84, 26%), and lower extremity (n = 48, 28%) were analyzed. Median Breslow thickness was 0.54 mm (inter-quartile range = 0.65). Shave biopsy was the method of initial biopsy in 244 (76%), excision in 23 (7%), and punch biopsy in 56 (17%). Thirty nine (33%) shave biopsies had a positive deep margin, as did seven (23%) punch biopsies and 0 excisional biopsies. Residual mela-noma at definitive excision was found in 131 (42.5%) of all surgical specimens: 95 (40.6%) shave biopsy patients, 32 (60.4%) punch biopsy patients, and four (19.0%) excision biopsy patients. Recommendations for excision margin or sentinel lymph node biopsy changed in 15 (6%) shave biopsy patients and five (9%) punch biopsy patients. Conclusions: Shave biopsy is the most frequent method of diagnosis of cutaneous mela-noma in the modern era. While shave and punch biopsies may underestimate true T-stage, there was no difference in need for reoperation due to T-upstaging based on initial biopsy type, supporting current diagnostic practices. Partial biopsies can thus be used to guide appropriate treatment and definitive wide local excision when adjusting for understaging. 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of 23 flowering phenology traits and 4 floral agronomic traits in tree peony (Paeonia section Moutan DC.) reveals five genes known to regulate flowering time
T2  - HORTICULTURE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree peony is a unique traditional flower in China, with large, fragrant, and colorful flowers. However, a relatively short and concentrated flowering period limits the applications and production of tree peony. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to accelerate molecular breeding for the improvement of flowering phenology traits and ornamental phenotypes in tree peony. A diverse panel of 451 tree peony accessions was phenotyped for 23 flowering phenology traits and 4 floral agronomic traits over 3 years. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was used to obtain a large number of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (107 050) for the panel genotypes, and 1047 candidate genes were identified by association mapping. Eighty-two related genes were observed during at least 2 years for flowering, and seven SNPs repeatedly identified for multiple flowering phenology traits over multiple years were highly significantly associated with five genes known to regulate flowering time. We validated the temporal expression profiles of these candidate genes and highlighted their possible roles in the regulation of flower bud differentiation and flowering time in tree peony. This study shows that GWAS based on GBS can be used to identify the genetic determinants of complex traits in tree peony. The results expand our understanding of flowering time control in perennial woody plants. Identification of markers closely related to these flowering phenology traits can be used in tree peony breeding programs for important agronomic traits.

AB  - Background: Ecosystems are in constant transformation by ecological and anthropic processes. The use of satellite images through remote sensing helps to understand and study the dynamics and space-time changes of the vegetation. Question: What are the dynamics of mangrove cover in the municipality of Alvarado, Veracruz, Mexico using a long time series? Data description: All available Landsat images. Study site and dates: The municipality of Alvarado, Veracruz from 1985 to 2021. Methods: We compute and create NDVI composites for all Landsat satellite images at 30 m spatial resolution. We identify patterns in mangrove dynamics based on the annual trajectory of NDVI using a long time series. Results: The annual average of the mangrove NDVI in the municipality of Alvarado increased linearly during the study period. 50 % of the mangrove cover of the study area (118 km2) is made up of areas where the mangrove cover has not been disturbed since the beginning of the period studied, accumulating between 25 and 36 years without change. The areas with the highest biomass represent only 0.2 % of the mangrove cover in the municipality. We identified areas with excellent quality mangrove cover, and priority conservation sites. Conclusions: The municipality of Alvarado requires urgent plans and actions to create conservation initiatives. In addition, the areas with a higher quality of mangroves that remain in the municipality should be protected due to their importance for the conservation of biodiversity and because they are threatened by urban and agricultural expansion.

TI  - Evolution of the dynamics, area, and ice production of the Amundsen SeaPolynya, Antarctica, 2016-2021
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Polynyas are key sites of ice production during the winter and areimportant sites of biological activity and carbon sequestration during thesummer. The Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) is the fourth largest Antarcticpolynya, has recorded the highest primary productivity, and lies in anembayment of key oceanographic significance. However, knowledge of itsdynamics, and of sub-annual variations in its area and ice production, islimited. In this study we primarily utilize Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, sea ice concentration products, and climate reanalysis data, along with bathymetricdata, to analyze the ASP over the period November 2016-March 2021.Specifically, we analyze (i) qualitative changes in the ASP'scharacteristics and dynamics, as well as quantitative changes in (ii) summerpolynya area, and (iii) winter polynya area and ice production. From ouranalysis of SAR imagery we find that ice produced by the ASP becomes stuckin the vicinity of the polynya and sometimes flows back into the polynya,contributing to its closure and limiting further ice production. The polynyaforms westward off a persistent chain of grounded icebergs that are locatedat the site of a bathymetric high. Grounded icebergs also influence theoutflow of ice and facilitate the formation of a "secondary polynya" attimes. Additionally, unlike some polynyas, ice produced by the polynya flowswestward after formation, along the coast and into the neighboring seasector. During the summer and early winter, broader regional sea iceconditions can play an important role in the polynya. The polynya opens inall summers, but record-low sea ice conditions in 2016/17 cause it to becomepart of the open ocean. During the winter, an average of 78 % of iceproduction occurs in April-May and September-October, but large polynyaevents often associated with high, southeasterly or easterly winds cancause ice production throughout the winter. While passive microwave data ordaily sea ice concentration products remain key for analyzing variations inpolynya area and ice production, we find that the ability to directlyobserve and qualitatively analyze the polynya at a high temporal and spatialresolution with Sentinel-1 imagery provides important insights about thebehavior of the polynya that are not possible with those datasets.

TI  - Reducing workload in malignant melanoma sentinel node examination: a national study of pathology reports from 507 melanoma patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - AimsEven though extensive melanoma sentinel node (SN) pathology protocols increase metastasis detection, there is a need for balancing high detection rates with reasonable workload. A newly tested Danish protocol recommended examining nodes at six levels 150 mu m apart (six-level model) and using SOX10 and Melan-A immunohistochemistry (IHC). We explored if a protocol examining 3 levels 300 mu m apart (three-level model) combined with IHC would compromise metastasis detection. The study aim was to optimise the protocol to reduce workload without compromising detection rate. Methods8 months after protocol implementation, we reviewed the pathology reports of SNs from 507 melanoma patients nationwide, including 117 SN-positive patients. Each report was reviewed to determine histopathological features, including detection of metastasis, exact levels with metastasis, exact levels with metastasis >1 mm in diameter and IHC results. ResultsThe six-level model detected metastases in 23% of patients, whereas the three-level model would have detected metastases in 22% of patients. The three-level model would have missed a few small metastases (n=4), measuring <0.1 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.4 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively. The six-level model detected metastases >1 mm in 7% of patients. One of these metastases (measuring 1.1 mm) would have been detected by the three-level model, but not as >1 mm. SOX10 and Melan-A had equal sensitivity. ConclusionsReducing the number of levels examined to three levels 300 mu m apart combined with IHC does not have significant impact on metastasis detection rate, and we will therefore recommend that the future melanoma SN guideline takes this into consideration to reduce overall workload.

TI  - Exploring the threshold for the start of respiratory syncytial virus infection epidemic season using sentinel surveillance data in Japan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAn unusual seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Japan is observed in recent years after 2017, becoming challenging to prepare for: a seasonal shift from autumn-winter to summer-autumn in 2017-2019, no major epidemic in 2020, and an unusually high number of cases reported in 2021. MethodsTo early detect the start-timing of epidemic season, we explored the reference threshold for the start-timing of the epidemic period based on the number of cases per sentinel (CPS, a widely used indicator in Japanese surveillance system), using a relative operating characteristic curve analysis (with the epidemic period defined by effective reproduction number). ResultsThe reference values of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, and Aichi Prefectures were 0.41, 0.39, 0.42, and 0.24, respectively. DiscussionThe reference CPS value could be a valuable indicator for detecting the RSV epidemic and may contribute to the planned introduction of monoclonal antibody against RSV to prevent severe outcomes.

AB  - Global warming and the ecological burden it causes affect people and the environment negatively and make adaptation difficult. For people to adapt to the environment and vice versa, they need to do extensive research and planning. Planning, on the other hand, is taking an easy form with the technology that has recently developed. GIS infrastructures and supporting satellite images along with software help with provincial-scale planning. This study has been handled on a scale covering the provincial borders of Nevsehir. The thermal data of the 10-year-old Landsat 7 satellite was analyzed and mapped in the Arc-GIS 10.2 package program. In the same way, maps of wind, air temperature, topography, and land use were created and the relationship between them was revealed by "Spearman's correlation" method. According to the results obtained, the average surface temperature in the study area was determined as 34.4 degrees C. When evaluated in terms of land use, natural grasslands have the highest surface temperature of 40.6 degrees C, while city structures have the highest average surface temperature of 33.3 degrees C. At the same time, the lowest surface temperature measured in the study area, 13.8 degrees C, is also found in natural grassland areas. A significant positive correlation was measured between the wind speed and the land use pattern, while a significant negative correlation emerged between the wind speed and the air temperature. In addition, there is another significant negative correlation between height and land surface temperature (LST). Furthermore, a high degree of positive significance was determined between altitude and wind speed. Finally, between air temperature and LST, a positive significance was observed.

TI  - Triple collocation-based multi-source evaporation and transpiration merging
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to combine three reanalysis-based evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) es-timates (i.e., ERA5-Land, GLDAS, and MERRA2) to improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration (ET) over East Asia. Here, we calculate the uncertainty of E and T separately through triple collocation (TC), which then used as a weighting factor to produce merged estimates of E and T. The combination of the two was quantitatively evaluated by comparing it with ground-based measurements. Before assessing the merged ET estimates, the error standard deviation (sigma mean) of TC was analyzed. ERA5-Land showed the smallest sigma mean for E for most of the study region, although MERRA2 achieved superior performance for T compared with ERA5-Land. This behavior further resulted in the highest weighting factors of ERA5-Land (59%) and MERRA2 (49%) for E and T, respectively. An evaluation of merged ET estimates by comparison with flux tower measurements revealed the close agreement of the two datasets in crop and forest regions. For croplands, the merged ET estimates showed better statistics compared with the two worst original products. However, the merged ET showed limitation in reflecting crop rotation due to the uncertainty of ERA5-Land E, which yielded the largest weighting factor over cropland. At forest sites, merged ET estimates yielded better statistical performance than the three individual ET products as well as the ET estimated through TC without separating E and T. Detailed analysis of the ratio of T and ET revealed that the merged ET was similar in magnitude to ground-based measurements. Spatial distribution of annual and seasonal ET indicated that the overall improvement of merged ET resulted from superior estimates of T during the spring and summer. These results confirm that separate error characterization of E and T through TC can enhance the accuracy of terrestrial ET estimates.

TI  - Global Corrections to Reference Irradiance Spectra for Non-Clear-Sky Conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Photochemical reactions in surface waters play important roles in element cycling and in the removal of organic contaminants, among other processes. A central environmental variable affecting photochemical processes in surface waters is the incoming solar irradiance, as this initiates these processes. However, clear-sky incident irradiance spectra are often used when evaluating the fate of aquatic contaminants, leading to an overestimation of contaminant decay rates due to photochemical transformation. In this work, incident irradiance satellite data were used to develop global-scale non-clear-sky correction factors for commonly used reference irradiance spectra. Non-clear-sky conditions can decrease incident irradiance by over 90% depending on the geographic location and time of the year, with latitudes above 40 degrees N being most heavily affected by seasons. The impact of non-clear-sky conditions on contaminant half-lives was illustrated in a case study of triclosan in lake Greifensee, which showed a 39% increase in the triclosan half-life over the course of a year under non-clear-sky conditions. A global annual average correction factor of 0.76 was determined as an approximate way to account for non-clear-sky conditions. The correction factors are developed at monthly and seasonal resolutions for every location on the globe between 70 degrees N and 60 degrees S at a 4 km spatial resolution and can be used by researchers, practitioners, and regulators who need improved estimates of incident irradiance.

TI  - High-spatial-resolution retrieval of cloud droplet size distribution from polarized observations of the cloudbow
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud droplet size distribution is often described by a gamma distribution defined by the effective radius and the effective variance. The effective radius is directly related to the cloud's optical thickness, which influences the radiative properties of a cloud. The effective variance affects, among other things, the evolution of precipitation. Both parameters can be retrieved from measurements of the cloudbow. The cloudbow (or rainbow) is an optical phenomenon that forms due to the single scattering of radiation by liquid cloud droplets at the cloud edge. The polarized radiance of the cloudbow crucially depends on the cloud droplet size distribution. The effective radius and the effective variance can be retrieved by fitting model simulations (stored in a lookup table) to polarized cloudbow observations. This study uses measurements from the wide-field polarization-sensitive camera of the spectrometer of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (specMACS) aboard the German "High Altitude and LOng range research aircraft " (HALO). Along with precise cloud geometry data derived by a stereographic method, a geolocalization of the observed clouds is possible. Observations of the same cloud from consecutive images are combined into one radiance measurement from multiple angles. Two case studies of trade-wind cumulus clouds measured during the EUREC4A (ElUcidating the RolE of Cloud-Circulation Coupling in ClimAte) field campaign are presented, and the cloudbow technique is demonstrated. The results are combined into maps of the effective radius and the effective variance with a 100m x 100m spatial resolution and large coverage (across-track swath width of 8km). The first case study shows a stratiform cloud deck with distinct patches of large effective radii up to 40 mu m and a median effective variance of 0.11. specMACS measures at a very high angular resolution (binned to 0.3 degrees) which is necessary when large droplets are present. The second case study consists of small cumulus clouds (diameters of approximately 2km). The retrieved effective radius is 7.0 mu m, and the effective variance is 0.08 (both median values). This study demonstrates that specMACS is able to determine the droplet size distribution of liquid water clouds even for small cumulus clouds, which are a problem for traditional droplet size retrievals based on total reflectances.

TI  - Long short term memory deep net performance on fused Planet-Scope and Sentinel-2 imagery for detection of agricultural crop
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the challenges faced by organizations and departments concerned with agricultural capacity observations, we collected In-Situ data consisting of diverse crops (More than 11 consumable vegetation types) in our pilot region of Harichand Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. Our proposed Long Short-Term Memory based Deep Neural network model was trained for land cover land use statistics generation using the acquired ground truth data, for a synergy between Planet-Scope Dove and European Space Agency's Sentinel-2. Total of 4 bands from both sentinel-2 and planet scope including Red, Green, Near-Infrared (NIR) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used for classification purpose. Using short temporal frame of Sentinel-2 comprising 5 date images, we propose an realistic and implementable procedure for generating accurate crop statistics using remote sensing. Our self collected data-set consists of a total number of 107,899 pixels which was further split into 70% and 30% for training and testing purpose of the model respectively. The collected data is in the shape of field parcels, which has been further split for training, validation and test sets, to avoid spatial auto-correlation. To ensure the quality and accuracy 15% of the training data was left out for validation purpose, and 15% for testing. Prediction was also performed on our trained model and visual analysis of the area from the image showed significant results. Further more a comparison between Sentinel-2 time series is performed separately from the fused Planet-Scope and Sentinel-2 time-series data sets. The results achieved shows a weighted average of 93% for Sentinel-2 time series and 97% for fused Planet-Scope and Sentinel-2 time series.

TI  - Radial Orbit Errors of Contemporary Altimetry Satellite Orbits
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise orbits of altimetry satellites are a prerequisite for the investigation of global, regional, and coastal sea levels together with their changes, since accurate satellite positions in the radial direction are required for the reliable determination of the water surface height (distance between the altimeter position in space and the water surface). Significant progress in the improvement of altimetry satellite orbit quality has been achieved in the last 30 years increasing the orbit accuracy in the radial direction from decimeter to centimeter and even sub-centimeter level. That was possible due to the improvements in the modeling of Earth's time variable gravity field, ocean tides, terrestrial and celestial reference frames, but also due to the accomplishments reached in the observation methods used for altimetry satellites, namely Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS), and Global Positioning System (GPS-used for some satellites). In this paper, we review the main improvements in the models used for the determination of orbits of altimetry satellites, namely, in so called Geophysical Data Records (GDR) orbit standards from GDR-C to Precise Orbit Ephemeris-F (POE-F), illustrate the impact of the improvements in precise orbit determination of these satellites on the orbit accuracy in the radial direction. Additionally we investigate orbit differences in the radial direction, single-satellite crossover differences, radial, and geographically correlated orbit errors of contemporary orbits of various altimetry satellites namely Cryosat-2, Envisat, ERS-1, ERS-2, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, SARAL, Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B, and TOPEX/Poseidon derived by different institutions.

TI  - Advances in retrieving XCH<sub>4</sub> and XCO from Sentinel-5 Precursor: improvements in the scientific TROPOMI/WFMD algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite enables the accurate determination of atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) abundances at high spatial resolution and global daily sampling. Due to its wide swath and sampling, the global distribution of both gases can be determined in unprecedented detail. The scientific retrieval algorithm Weighting Function Modified Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFMD) has proven valuable in simultaneously retrieving the atmospheric column-averaged dry-air mole fractions XCH4 and XCO from TROPOMI's radiance measurements in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral range. Here we present recent improvements of the algorithm which have been incorporated into the current version (v1.8) of the TROPOMI/WFMD product. This includes processing adjustments such as increasing the polynomial degree to 3 in the fitting procedure to better account for possible spectral albedo variations within the fitting window and updating the digital elevation model to minimise topography-related biases. In the post-processing, the machine-learning-based quality filter has been refined using additional data when training the random forest classifier to further reduce scenes with residual cloudiness that are incorrectly classified as good. In particular, the cloud filtering over the Arctic ocean is considerably improved. Furthermore, the machine learning calibration, addressing systematic errors due to simplifications in the forward model or instrumental issues, has been optimised. By including an additional feature associated with the fitted polynomial when training the corresponding random forest regressor, spectral albedo variations are better accounted for. To remove vertical stripes in the XCH4 and XCO data, an efficient orbit-wise destriping filter based on combined wavelet-Fourier filtering has been implemented, while optimally preserving the original spatial trace gas features. The temporal coverage of the data records has been extended to the end of April 2022, covering a total length of 4.5 years since the start of the mission, and will be further extended in the future. Validation with the ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) demonstrates that the implemented improvements reduce the pseudo-noise component of the products, resulting in an improved random error. The XCH4 and XCO products have similar spatial coverage from year to year including high latitudes and the oceans. The analysis of annual growth rates reveals accelerated growth of atmospheric methane during the covered period, in line with observations at marine surface sites of the Global Monitoring Division of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory, which reported consecutive annual record increases over the past 2 years of 2020 and 2021.

TI  - Unmanned aerial vehicle outputs and associated field measurements of the herbaceous and tree layers of the Senegalese savannah
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used to assess the vegetation of an ecosystem. This report presents three data sets from UAVs used on a savannah-type ecosystem in Senegal. Two data sets contain an orthomosaic and a surface and terrain digital model (UAV outputs), along with associated field measurements on the tree and herbaceous layers, while the third data set contains an orthomosaic and digital surface model, along with field measurements on the herbaceous layers. One data set was compiled over the entire rainy season on the same plot (plot dataset). One was compiled across a landscape at the 7000 ha Dahra Djoloff research center (CRZ-dahra Centre de recherche zootechnique de Dahra). The third data set was compiled across Senegal from the North to the Southeast of the country with wide variability in climate and soil conditions. All the data sets are in Open Access in the Zenodo repository. These data sets could be used in many different studies: calibration between field measurements and UAV outputs on a large scale, or used as an intermediate step between field and satellite images.

TI  - In Vivo Evaluation of a Gallium-68-Labeled Tumor-Tracking Cyanine Dye for Positron Emission Tomography/Near-Infrared Fluorescence Carcinoma Imaging, Image-Guided Surgery, and Photothermal Therapy
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infra-red fluorescence (NIRF) dual-modal imaging presents an enticing prospect for tumor diagnosis and surgical navigation. In this study, we developed a novel probe IR808-DOTA for tumor-targeted PET/NIRF imaging, image-guided surgery, and photothermal therapy. This construct had better water solubility and pharmacokinetics than IR808 and had similar photophysical properties, tumor targeting ability, and photothermal anticancer effect to IR808. By a simple labeling process, IR808-DOTA was labeled with gallium-68 and applied as a PET probe for tumor imaging in MCF-7 tumor xenografted mice. IR808-DOTA itself acted as an NIRF imaging agent in the following surgery for intraoperative navigation to aid surgeons in the delineation of tumor margins and visualizing sentinel lymph nodes to facilitate a more thorough tumor resection. Irradiation by laser, IR808-DOTA could prominently inhibit tumor growth in MCF-7 subcutaneous tumor model mice by directly ablating tumor cells, inhibiting tumor proliferation, and promoting tumor cell apoptosis. In summary, 68Ga-DOTA-IR808 could enable a convenient and user-friendly workflow for tumor imaging and guided surgery, and therefore, it may have great prospects for clinical translation as a PET/ NIRF dual-modal probe.

TI  - Sulfide disseminations and hydrothermal alteration haloes in the Gabal Monqul area, Egypt: Field, mineralogical, and remote sensing studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Field and mineralogical studies are integrated with multispectral and radar satellite data to unravel the occur-rence of sulfide dissemination in the Gabal Monqul area (Eastern Desert, Egypt). This study was motivated by the strong belief that the widespread hydrothermal alteration haloes and sulfide disseminations in this area were ambiguously deciphered as a porphyry-style mineralisation. NE-Elongate bodies of silicified and sulfidized rocks frequently occur at the contacts between andesite-dacite, granodiorite, and porphyritic biotite granite intrusions. Hydrothermal alteration zones are best identified and outlined by employing band ratios (BR) and indepen-dent component analysis (ICA) techniques for the distinction between ferric and ferrous iron minerals. If fused with the clay and OH-bearing minerals maps, ferric iron oxides may characterise epithermal and porphyry mineralisation in which ore formation occurs under oxidising conditions. Iron-hydroxide, copper hydro-carbonate (malachite), and hydrous copper phosphate (pseudomalachite) are supergene mineral phases.The resultant processed images show that alteration extends beyond unit boundaries and overlaps different crosscutting lithologies. This observation implies that hydrothermal alteration of the host rock represents a secondary overprint, yet gypsum (+/- anhydrite) and barite in association with iron oxides and pyrite dissemi-nations pinpoint a porphyry-related alteration assemblage. The poor metal endowment in the potassic alteration zones goes against the supergene enrichment typical of the porphyry mineralisation system and is coupled with the lack of hydrothermal breccia bodies, implying a rather epithermal sulfidation genesis. However, a thorough assay program is required to outline the potential metal-rich lithological unit(s) using XRD and remote sensing investigations that point to zonal alteration anomalies.

TI  - Modeling and spatial characterization of aerosols at Middle East AERONET stations
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we employed an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to simulate aerosol optical depth time series from the ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) from 2012 to 2021. To test the validity and applicability of the developed ARIMA model, we correlated the ARIMA predicted for 2021 with AERONET network data and obtained a correlation coefficient of similar to 0.9. Additionally, we compared the results with the space-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the Middle East and obtained a considerable correlation coefficient of similar to 0.5. We employ the threshold of the Angstrom exponent (AE) as a measure of the spectral dependence of aerosol optical depth (AOD), which ranges between 0 and 1, to characterize aerosol types. The results show weighted averages of AOD >= 0.2 and AE >= 1.0 for fine-mode aerosol spray in IASBS (36.705 N, 48.507 E), AOD > 0.2 and AE < 1.0 for dust aerosols in Nes_Ziona (31.922 N, 34.789 E), AOD > 0.4, 0.5 < AE < 1.0 for dust and maritime aerosol for Masdar _Institute station (24.442 N, 54.617 E) and AE < 1, AOD <= 0.5 for dust and maritime aerosol in Hada_El-Sham (21.802 N, 39.729E).

TI  - Assessing the utilization potential of pumped-out minewater for potability in the water-stressed coal mining region of Jharia, India: a quantitative, qualitative and probabilistic health risk assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Extensive mining operations coupled by a steady rise in local population have rendered the Jharia Coalfield water-stressed with limited access to potable water, risking the outbreak of waterborne diseases from prolonged inaccessibility. A quantitative assessment was done to utilize the pumped-out minewater by harvesting it in mine voids underlying the coalfield, preventing further loss as surface runoff. A total void volume of 13 billion gallons was identified and mapped using Digital Elevation Model-CARTOSAT. Analysis of minewater in the region revealed variations in hydrochemical parameters, indicating heterogeneity in the underlying hydrosystems of the region due to the synergistic influence of geological formations and anthropogenic processes on the region's water chemistry. Qualitative evaluation of the hydrochemical parameters of minewater using Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) and a novel Integrated Water Quality Index (IWQI) revealed mostly poor minewater quality across the region, barring Shatabdi (IWQI-1.97; HPI-25.30). A comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of utilizing harvested minewater for potability in a water-stressed region while appraising its probabilistic risk to the local populace formed the theme of this study. Monte Carlo simulation-based health risk assessment revealed that children were more prone to non-carcinogenic risk from As and Mn, with hazard index (HI) values reaching up to 5.33 in some locations. The contribution of carcinogenic risk from the trace/heavy metals were in the order Ni > As > Cr > Pb > Cd and exceeded the maximum acceptable level (10(-6)) in majority of the locations, warranting continual monitoring and appropriate treatment to ameliorate health risks.

TI  - Confronting turbidity, the major challenge for satellite-derived coastal bathymetry
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the complex seafloor morphology that drives the functioning of shallow coastal ecosystems is vital for assessing marine activities. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can provide a crucial dataset for creating the bathym-etry maps needed to understand hazards and impacts produced by climate change in vulnerable coastal zones. SDB is effective in clear water, but still has limitations in application to areas with some turbidity. Here, using the twin satel-lites Sentinel-2A/B, we integrate water quality information from the satellite with a multi-temporal compositing method to demonstrate a potential for comprehensively operational bathymetric mapping over a range of environ-ments. The automated compositing method diminishes the turbidity impact in addition to inferring the maximum de-tectable depth and removing optically deep-water areas. Examining a wide range of conditions along the Caribbean and eastern coast of the U.S. shows detailed bathymetry as deep as 30 m at 10 m spatial resolution with median errors <1 m when compared to high-resolution lidar surveys. These results demonstrate that the model adopted can provide useful bathymetry in areas that do not have consistently clear water and can be extended across multiple geographic regions and optical conditions at local, regional, and national scales.

TI  - Snow depth estimation at country-scale with high spatial and temporal resolution
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring snow depth is important for applications such as hydrology, energy planning, ecology, and safety evaluation for outdoor winter activities. Most methods able to estimate snow depth for large regions can only do so in a spatial resolution of up to 1 km ground sampling distance (GSD). This limits their usage in high alpine areas, where this resolution fails to capture local snow distribution patterns caused by the pronounced topographical features. In this work we use a recurrent convolutional neural network to estimate snow depth at high spatial resolution (10 m GSD), weekly, and at large scale based on satellite data sources and elevation maps, without the need for measurement stations on the ground. The proposed method achieves unprecedented results for large-scale, high-resolution snow depth mapping. The resulting maps are evaluated over a period of three years against high-fidelity snow depth maps obtained with airborne photogrammetry. Finally, we also produce well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for every individual snow depth estimate via a probabilistic regression framework.

TI  - Prediction of spatio-temporal (2030 and 2050) land-use and land-cover changes in Koch Bihar urban agglomeration (West Bengal), India, using artificial neural network-based Markov chain model
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land is one of the most exigent natural resources and is dynamic in nature. Land use and land cover refer to the categorization and classification of human activities and natural elements on the landscape within a specific time frame. Thus, land cover is the physical material on the Earth's surface, whereas land use describes how people utilize the land. The change in land use and land cover (LULC) is a significant issue from a global perspective. This article aims to evaluate changes in the LULC in the past (1990-2020) and to predict the future LULC (2030 and 2050) in Koch Bihar urban agglomeration (West Bengal). The present study uses Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) remote sensing data, ASTER DEM, open street map, and the Census of India data. The Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm is used for the supervised classification of land, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) model has been used to predict the future LULC pattern in 2030 and 2050. The overall accuracy of the classified images (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020) is 90%, 92%, 93%, and 91%, respectively. The Kappa coefficient is more than 0.80 (0.873 (1990), 0.899 (2000), 0.911 (2010), and 0.887 (2020). The result shows that the amount of agricultural land would decrease to a great extent, from 50.89 km(2) in 1990 to 22.30 km(2) in 2050. At the same time, the built-up area would increase significantly from 5.91 km(2) in 1990 to 32.91 km(2) in 2050. The findings of the present study guide planners and resource managers in designing a roadmap for long-term sustainable land-use and land-cover management in the Koch Bihar urban agglomeration.

TI  - Aerial and ground-based phenotyping of an alfalfa diversity panel to assess adaptation to a prolonged drought period in a Mediterranean environment of central Chile
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing food production worldwide, particularly in Mediterranean climate regions where rainfall has been decreasing and temperature increasing. Alfalfa is a perennial forage crop that could play an important role in increasing the resilience and sustainability of rainfed production systems in these environments. In this study, we tested how a prolonged drought period of 5-6 months in a Mediterranean environment of central Chile affects the plant persistence and productivity of an alfalfa diversity panel of 69 landraces, cultivars, and diverse pre-breeding populations (hereafter accessions) from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Spain, Australia, USA, and Chile, with putative drought tolerance. The objectives were i) to evaluate the phenotypic variability in plant survival and productivity among the alfalfa diversity panel, under rainfed and with supplemental irrigation, in a Mediterranean environment; and ii) to study the use of an NDVI sensor, and RGB and thermal cameras for field phenotyping and evaluation of canopy traits, such as leaf area index (LAI) and forage yield (FY). Results showed large phenotypic variability for plant survival after the three drought periods, ranging from 30 % to 76 % under rainfed conditions and from 48 % to 90 % with supplementary irrigation. The FY during winter was significantly different between cultivars, with more than 4 Mg ha-1 per year in some accessions. The average FY for three growing seasons (2018-2020) ranged between 2.26 and 10.80 Mg ha-1 under rainfed and 3.92-11.14 Mg ha-1 per year with supplementary irrigation. Among the most productive accessions under both water regimes were two populations of the Medicago arborea x sativa hybrid (AF3448 and AF3347), cultivars Genesis and Venus, and the landraces Aragon from Spain and Alta Sierra 2 from Chile. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed exponential and positive relationships with the leaf area index (LAI) and FY. RGB images were obtained at 60 cm above the top of the canopy with a digital camera and at 30 m using a drone. The RGB indices "intensity", a* and greener area obtained from images taken at 60 cm above the top of the canopy, were highly correlated (r = 0.76 - 0.98; P < 0.0001) with the NDVI and FY, under rainfed and with supplementary irrigation in 2019. The RGB indices "saturation", a* and u* obtained from a drone at 30 m, were also highly correlated (r > 0.73 - 0.94; P < 0.0001) with the NDVI and FY of accessions growing under both water regimens in 2020. The canopy temperature (CT) obtained from thermal images from a drone was higher under the rainfed regime. The stress degree day (SDD), defined as the difference between canopy temperature (Tc) and air temperature (Ta) was negatively related to FY. Under the rainfed regimen, the population AF3348 and cultivars Genesis and Aragon exhibited the lowest SDD and the highest FY.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We present a near-real-time global gridded daily CO2 emissions dataset (GRACED) throughout 2021. GRACED provides gridded CO2 emissions at a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees spatial resolution and 1-day temporal resolution from cement production and fossil fuel combustion over seven sectors, including industry, power, residential consumption, ground transportation, international aviation, domestic aviation, and international shipping. GRACED is prepared from the near-real-time daily national CO2 emissions estimates (Carbon Monitor), multi-source spatial activity data emissions and satellite NO2 data for time variations of those spatial activity data. GRACED provides the most timely overview of emissions distribution changes, which enables more accurate and timely identification of when and where fossil CO2 emissions have rebounded and decreased. Uncertainty analysis of GRACED gives a grid-level two-sigma uncertainty of value of +/- 19.9% in 2021, indicating the reliability of GRACED was not sacrificed for the sake of higher spatiotemporal resolution that GRACED provides. Continuing to update GRACED in a timely manner could help policymakers monitor energy and climate policies' effectiveness and make adjustments quickly.

TI  - Reducing natural vegetation loss in Amazonia critically depends on the formal recognition of indigenous lands
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon contains the world's largest tract of tropical forest, about 22 % of which is within demarcated indigenous territories. Formal governmental recognition of these traditional territories is often a critical deterrent to deforestation, but the relative conservation performance of Indigenous Lands (ILs) under different legal categories and geographic contexts remains poorly understood. We used 30-m resolution LANDSAT satellite imagery to quantitatively assess the land cover status and annual rates of natural vegetation loss be-tween 1985 and 2020 for 381 indigenous territories amounting to-115 million hectares. Using a comprehensive set of environmental and socio-economic covariates and a mixed-modelling approach, we found that all stages of formal IL recognition consistently inhibit natural vegetation loss throughout the Brazilian Amazon compared to adjacent unprotected areas. Formal physical demarcation and distance from roads were the main proximate drivers of avoided natural vegetation loss inside ILs. Forest loss associated with road access is substantially curbed by ILs, showing the importance of frontier expansion when assessing indigenous reserve performance in counteracting natural vegetation loss. Because loss of natural forest and savannah areas associated with agri-business frontiers and infrastructure projects are likely to intensify, the importance of ecosystem services pro-vided by ILs is expected to increase across the Brazilian Amazon. Cultural profile and human density exerted no impacts on IL effectiveness in precluding natural vegetation loss. Given widespread encroachment of timber extraction and agribusiness, formal recognition of indigenous territories is a critical factor in decelerating pri-mary habitat conversion across the Amazon.

TI  - Does more mean better? Remote-sensing data for monitoring sustainable redevelopment of a historical granary in Mydlniki, Krakow
T2  - HERITAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Post-2015 UN Development Agenda includes culture and links the preservation of cultural heritage (CH) to sustainable development. In principle, sustainable redevelopment of CH should preserve historical qualities and ensure the financial profitability of the asset. Still, being a construction process, it has to be under constant change monitoring. Bearing in mind the quality of data achieved by measurement systems, TLS instruments can be used to capture 3D spatial data for cultural heritage. The authors analyse the usefulness of TLS data as the spatial database for the redevelopment and functional reuse of a historical granary. Following measurements on various stages of the redevelopment of the CH asset, TLS data undergo principally simple and rapid analyses (shape analysis, determination of the pace and scope of redevelopment, detection of conservation effort results, HBIM) to improve decision-making capabilities within the project. Contrary to the universal approach, periodic CH redevelopment scanning involves the entire structure, not merely its most valuable heritage components. As a result, not only doesthe remote-sensing data acquisition for monitoring of sustainable redevelopment of cultural heritage record the state of the revitalised building, but it also demonstrates the potential of periodic measurements as the primary source of insight into the heritage asset and the directions and quality of changes it undergoes.

TI  - Drought characterization and severity analysis using GRACE-TWS and MODIS datasets: a case study from the Awash River Basin (ARB), Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is the utmost highly devastating phenomenon in Ethiopia because of societies that are reliant on rainfall-dependent agriculture; thus, it is crucial to characterize drought at the basin scale using new developments in remote sensing products and recently proposed drought indices. This study aimed to quantify drought in the Awash River Basin (ARB) using drought indices of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI), Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), and Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI). The Mann-Kendall test analysis of annual and seasonal terrestrial water storage (TWS) showed a significant increase from 2002 to 2017 that is beneficial for developmental activities in the ARB. GRACE showed a record high extreme drought that persisted for 15 months was noticed from 2005/01 to 2006/03 with a total water storage deficit of -411.8 mm with a peak shortage of -46.24 mm in 2005/03, representing severe terrestrial water shortage in the ARB. This GRACE-TWS-based quantified extreme water shortage in 2005/30 can be used as a threshold for adaptation. Overall, this study provides a reliable outcome that will be vital for the establishment of climate change adaptation pathways in the future for viable water resources management to minimize the disastrous impacts of drought in the AR.

TI  - Description and quantification of micronucleus and nuclear abnormalities in erythrocytes of the sentinel green turtle<i> (Chelonia</i><i> mydas)</i> with fluorescence microscopy
T2  - MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contamination in marine ecosystems is of the most critical threats to marine turtles. The identification of useful biomarkers to detect and monitor the physiological and clinical effects of pollutants on these populations will allow early detection of alterations (e.g., mutagenic damages) that could risk their viability or favor the devel-opment of diseases, thus threatening the biodiversity of these ecosystems and human population. This study is aimed at describing and quantifying nuclear anomalies in peripheral blood erythrocytes of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from three distinct foraging areas in Mexico (Akumal, Xcalak, and Punta Herrero). We developed a novel morphological index that could be used as a biomarker to identify abnormal nuclei in peripheral blood eryth-rocytes. Here we describe for the first time in C. mydas, with a species-specific staining protocol, distinct nuclear abnormalities such as blebbed, lobed, notched, eight shape nuclei, and binucleated cells. These nuclear abnor-malities were present in > 90 % of the subjects (n = 30). Moreover, 50 % of the organisms presented erythrocytes with micronuclei. The number of nuclear abnormalities did not correlate with size of the green turtles or differ between sites, or health status. We found a higher frequency of green turtles with nuclear abnormalities in the southern region (Punta Herrero and Xcalak) with the highest frequency of micronucleus and buds. The former could be associated to the constant exposure to chemical pollutants of oceanographic origin in the southern coast of Quintana Roo. Furthermore, the increasing anthropogenic pollution in Akumal could also explain the highest variability in the number of nuclear abnormalities presented in resident individuals. We propose that a long-term monitoring programs of green turtle populations in the Mexican Caribbean that include a micronucleus test could be a useful to determine possible mutagenic damage in these animals.

TI  - A novel framework for vegetation change characterization from time series landsat images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding terrestrial ecosystem dynamics requires a comprehensive examination of vegetation changes. Remote sensing technology has been established as an effective approach to reconstructing vegetation change history, investigating change properties, and evaluating the ecological effects. However, current remote sensing techniques are primarily focused on break detection but ignore long-term trend analysis. In this study, we proposed a novel framework based on a change detection algorithm and a trend analysis method that could integrate both short-term disturbance detection and long-term trends to comprehensively assess vegetation change. With this framework, we characterized the vegetation changes in Zhejiang Province from 1990 to 2020 using Landsat and landcover data. Benefiting from combining break detection and long-term trend analysis, the framework showcased its capability of capturing a variety of dynamics and trends of vegetation. The results show that the vegetation was browning in the plains while greening in the mountains, and the overall vegetation was gradually greening during the study period. By comparison, detected vegetation disturbances covered 57.71% of the province's land areas (accounting for 66.92% of the vegetated region) which were mainly distributed around the built-up areas, and most disturbances (94%) occurred in forest and cropland. There were two peak timings in the frequency of vegetation disturbances: around 2003 and around 2014, and the proportions of more than twice disturbances in a single location were low. The results illustrate that this framework is promising for the char-acterization of regional vegetation growth, including long-term trends and short-term features. The proposed framework enlightens a new direction for the continuous monitoring of vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Mineral content estimation for salt lakes on the Tibetan plateau based on the genetic algorithm-based feature selection method using Sentinel-2 imagery: A case study of the Bieruoze Co and Guopu Co lakes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are rich in lithium (Li), boron (B) and other mineral resources, and accurate assessment of the mineral content and spatial distribution of the brine in those salt lakes is important to guide the development and utilization of their mineral resources. There are few studies estimating the mineral content of salt lakes on the TP due to the lack of in situ investigation data. This study introduced an intelligent prediction model combining a feature selection algorithm with a machine learning algorithm using Sentinel-2 satellite data to estimate the Li, B, and TDS contents of Bieruoze Co and Guopu Co lakes on the TP. First, to enrich the spectral information, four mathematical transformations (reciprocal, logarithmic, reciprocal of logarithm, and first-order derivative) were applied to the original bands. Then, feature selection was performed using the genetic algorithm (GA) to select the optimal input variables for the model. Finally, prediction models were constructed by partial least squares regression (PLSR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and random forest (RF). The results showed that: 1) The spectral mathematical transformation provided rich spectral information for the mineral content estimation. 2) The performance of the estimation model constructed by the feature optimization method using GA was better than that of the estimation model constructed based on all spectral bands. Based on GA for feature optimization, the MAPE of GA-RF for estimating Li, B and TDS contents on the testing set was reduced by 77.52%, 28.54% and 36.79%, respectively. 3) Compared with the GA-MLR and GA-PLSR models, GA-RF estimated Li (R (2)=0.99, RMSE=1.15 mg L-1, MAPE=3.00%), B (R (2)=0.97, RMSE=10.65 mg L-1, MAPE=2.73%), and TDS (R (2)=0.93, RMSE=0.60 g L-1, MAPE=1.82%) all obtained the optimal performance. This study showed that the combination of the GA-based feature selection method and the RF model has excellent performance and applicability for monitoring the content of multiple minerals using Sentinel-2 imagery in salt lakes on the TP.

TI  - No Signs of Long-term Greening Trend in Western Mongolian Grasslands
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Trends for increased vegetation greenness based on satellite-derived data have been repeatedly published for the temperate grassland biome (including forest steppes) of eastern Inner Asia since 1982. Although this greening trend has been attenuated or partially reversed by drought in the early twenty-first century, linear increases in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or other parameters of vegetation greenness are nevertheless evident when the period since 1982 is regarded. However, the question arises whether these trends are part of a long-term trend driven by climate change, as simultaneously forests in the region show widespread drought-induced growth reductions and mortality outbreaks. Therefore, we hypothesized that the post-1982 greening trend was neither part of a long-term trend nor unprecedented. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed monthly maximum NDVI data from AVHRR time series and correlated these data with standardized tree-ring data of Larix sibirica from two regions of western Mongolia. We used linear regression to model the NDVI from tree-ring anomalies and to reconstruct the NDVI since 1940. These reconstructions show that the availability of satellite-based NDVI data coincidentally began during a dry period of low vegetation greenness in the early 1980s and was followed by a wet phase in the 1990s, producing the linear greening trend. No positive long-term trend in the reconstructed NDVI was observed from 1940 to 2010. This result rules out a recent climate change-driven greening trend for the grasslands and forest steppes of western Mongolia and calls into question its existence for all of eastern Inner Asia.

TI  - Mapping seagrass habitats of potential suitability using a hybrid machine learning model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide essential ecosystem services globally in the context of climate change. However, seagrass is being degraded at an accelerated rate globally due to ocean warming, ocean acidification, aquaculture, and human activities. The need for more information on seagrasses' spatial distribution and health status is a serious impediment to their conservation and management. Therefore, we propose a new hybrid machine learning model (RF-SWOA) that integrates the sinusoidal chaos map whale optimization algorithm (SWOA) with a random forest (RF) model to accurately model the suitable habitat of potential seagrasses. This study combines in situ sampling data with multivariate remote sensing data to train and validate hybrid machine learning models. It shows that RF-SWOA can predict potential seagrass habitat suitability more accurately and efficiently than RF. It also shows that the two most important factors affecting the potential seagrass habitat suitability on Hainan Island in China are distance to land (38.2%) and depth to sea (25.9%). This paper not only demonstrates the effectiveness of a hybrid machine learning model but also provides a more accurate machine learning model approach for predicting the potential suitability distribution of seagrasses. This research can help identify seagrass suitability distribution areas and thus develop conservation strategies to restore healthy seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Using dense Sentinel-2 time series to explore combined fire and drought impacts in eucalypt forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following one of the driest years on record, millions of hectares of forests in southeast Australia were burned in the 2019-2020 "Black Summer" wildfires. In addition to the areas burned, drought related canopy collapse, dieback and tree mortality was widely observed. In this paper, we present a method to map canopy damage due to drought and fire across a large area. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was used in a monthly time series to highlight areas of forest where the Normalized Burn Ratio index was significantly below a pre-disturbance "stable" period. The stable period was defined as the 3 years prior to 2019 and the disturbance thresholds are based on bioregion specific standard deviations below pre-disturbance means. The novel methods enabled drought impacted forests to be identified, including those which were subsequently burned by wildfire. Across the 20 Mha of forests studied, 9.9 Mha (49%) fell below the disturbance threshold. Of that, 5.8 Mha was disturbed by fire and a further 4.1 Mha by drought outside of the fire extent. Within the fire extent, almost 0.9 Mha was identified as being significantly drought affected prior to being burned. An analysis of spectral recovery following substantial rainfall from February 2020 onward indicates that most of the areas impacted by both drought and fire have similar rates of recovery to those impacted only by fire. There are some areas, however, where the combined effects of the "double disturbance" appears to be hindering recovery. The methods presented here are easily transferrable and demonstrate an approach for monitoring forest disturbance at higher temporal and spatial scales than those typically used.

TI  - A satellite-based monitoring system for quantifying surface water and mesic vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-arid and arid systems cover one third of the earth's land surface, and are becoming increasingly drier, but existing datasets do not capture all of the types of water resources that sustain these systems. In semi-arid environments, small surface water bodies and areas of mesic vegetation (wetlands, wet meadows, riparian zones) function as critical water resources. However, the most commonly-used maps of water resources are derived from the Landsat time series or single date aerial photographs, and are too coarse either spatially or temporally to effectively monitor water resource dynamics. In this study, we produced a Sentinel Fusion (SF) water resources product for a semi-arid mountainous region of the western United States, which includes monthly maps of both a) surface water and b) mesic vegetation at 10 m spatial resolution using freely available Earth observation data on an open access platform. We applied random forest classifiers to optical data from the Sentinel-2 time series, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 time series, and topographic variables. We compared our SF product with three commonly used and publicly available datasets in the western U.S. We found that our surface water class contained fewer omission errors than a leading global surface water product in (94 % producer's accuracy (PA) vs 84 %) and comparable user's accuracy (UA) (91 % vs 97 %) with commission errors occurring largely in mixed water pixels. Our mesic vegetation class had up to 43 % higher PAs compared to the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) estimates and up to 78 % higher UAs over the Sage Grouse Initiative mesic resources maps during the most critical part of the water year. We found that while inclusion of SAR data from the C-band Sentinel-1 sensor consistently improved estimates of water resources in each of the last four months of the 2021 water year when compared to optical-only + topographic variables, only in September did those improvements lie outside of the 95 % confidence interval. With nine times finer spatial resolution and more frequent image collection, our SF maps characterize intra-annual dynamics of smaller water bodies (<30 m wide) and mesic vegetation integral to ecosystem functioning in semi-arid systems compared to leading Landsatderived products. Further, our workflow is easily reproducible using freely available data on an open access platform, and can be adopted to help guide land use decisions related to water resources by farmers, ranchers, and conservationists in semi-arid environments.

TI  - SPRINT: Spectra Preserving Radiance Image Fusion Technique using holistic deep edge spatial attention and Minnaert guided Bayesian probabilistic model
T2  - SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion produces a high resolution multispectral image by merging panchromatic image with the corresponding low resolution multispectral counterpart. The limitation of the existing image fusion techniques is that it lacks in maintaining the spectral characteristics of the multispectral image in the fused output. The motivation of our proposed work is to develop balanced and robust image fusion method, named Spectra Preserving Radiance Image Fusion Technique (SPRINT). The technique developed extracts deep edge map from medoid intensity matched image using Holistic Nested Edge Detection (HNED). Minnaert function is applied on denoised panchromatic radiance image along with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and solar angles' computation to determine the surface topography. SPRINT's core design emphasizes on holistic deep edges for spatial attention and terrain guidance using minnaert parameter at each image pixel in a Spectra Preserving Bayesian Probabilistic Model. The unique data pre-processing engine generates fusion ready representative datasets to trigger SPRINT processing workflow. The Indian Cartosat-1 panchromatic and Resourcesat-2/2A multispectral sensors' datasets along with IKONOS and USGS-NASA's Landsat-8 OLI images covering diverse landscapes are used for image fusion evaluation and assessment. It has been found that SPRINT's fusion performance is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion methods in terms of both visual effects and quantitative metrics. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using SPRINT's fused radiance image tends to have negligible deviation at various classes with respect to reference NDVI. It has been observed that SPRINT derived surface reflectance values have close agreement with original reflectance measurements.

TI  - Wetland water balance assessment: a case study of the Sosa wetland, Maseru, Lesotho
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sosa wetland is a sensitive wetland, situated at the headwaters of the Jordan catchment in Maseru. Due to unregulated land use activities in the past decades (2010-2020), the Sosa wetland nearly dried up resulting in a water shortage. Therefore, this study performed a wetland water balance of the Sosa wetland in Lesotho for the period of 1975-2020 using GIS and remote sensing. Landsat imageries of 1975-2020 were used for land use and land cover while the Penman-Monteith and Thornthwaite methods were used to estimate evapotranspiration. Results show that water/marsh, cultivation, settlements and bare-land increased by 2.04, 4.1, 5.82 and 28.71%, respectively, from 1975 to 2020. Forest and shrubs as well as grasslands decreased by 38.83 and 1.76%, respectively, from 1975 to 2020. Evapotranspiration estimates for the period 1984-2020 were in the range of 900-1,071 mm/year which is substantially greater than the annual mean rainfall of the catchment which ranges from 550 to 850 mm/year. The most sensitive wetlands are found in the middle reach of the catchment and at the headwaters occupying about 16.03% of the catchment, whereas moderately sensitive wetlands occupy 39.75% of the catchment. The water balance closure as a ratio of rainfall received ranged from-3.13 to-3.5.

TI  - Landsystem analysis of a tropical moraine-dammed supraglacial lake, Llaca Lake, Cordillera Blanca, Peru
T2  - BOREAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru are rapidly thinning and retreating as a result of climate warming. The retreat of these glaciers along narrow linear bedrock valleys has increased the number and size of moraine-dammed glacial lakes formed in the valleys. This study aims to identify the geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics of an enlarging moraine-dammed supraglacial lake (Llaca Lake) in the Cordillera Blanca. Field-based sedimentological observations and geomorphological mapping were combined with remotely sensed data and a photogrammetric model derived from aerial surveys by an uncrewed aerial vehicle to identify landform-sediment assemblages. The geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics of Llaca Lake are synthesized into three landsystem zones: Zone 1: distal portions of Llaca Lake and the latero-frontal moraine; Zone 2: the central zone of ice-cored hummocks; and Zone 3: the active glacier margin. These zones are differentiated based on the spatial distribution of landforms, sediments, and active geomorphological processes. This is the first study to describe the landform-sediment assemblages in a tropical moraine-dammed supraglacial lake system and provides a framework for further landsystem element analysis of these growing supraglacial lakes in rapidly deglaciating high-altitude environments.

TI  - Remote sensing for detecting freshly manured fields
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of manure on fields during the rainy season can pollute the environment by leaching nitrates into nearby bodies of water. To reduce and prevent this problem, closed periods are declared to stop the use of manure as a fertilizer during these seasons. However, compliance is difficult to verify due to the impracticality of monitoring all the fields in a region or country through on-site or satellite surveys. To address this problem, a method to automatically monitor freshly manured fields using machine learning and satellite imagery is proposed. This paper evaluates the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite bands as well as 51 of the most common vegetation indices (VI) found in the literature for precision agriculture through experiments based on several feature selection methods. To train the models, a new dataset of freshly manured plots verified by on-site investigations is generated and made publicly available for future research. The proposed method is able to fully detect all freshly manured plots in the test dataset obtaining an F1-Score close to 90% of the tested area.

TI  - Mind the gap in data poor Natura 2000 sites and how to tackle them using Earth Observation and scientific diving surveys
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Charismatic species drives decisions for the conservation of marine areas in the view of the coverage of the Natura 2000 sites in the European Union and other forms of Marine Protected Areas in Europe. However, when used solely, critical seascapes and habitats are systematically ignored and practically it can take decades to fulfill baseline needs on habitats distributions, habitats conservation status and species distributions and biodiversity assessments. Luckily, in the last decade, the use of new technologies in conjunction with scientific diving and budget friendly hydroacoustic tools and applications, has allowed to fill the gap in knowledge in such situations and seascapes. The current work demonstrates the use of Earth Observation and Science Dive to fill the gap of knowledge in a newly established Natura 2000 area in Crete, Greece, East Mediterranean, paving the road for replicable approaches in similar situations.

TI  - Comparison of tropospheric delay correction methods for InSAR analysis using a mesoscale meteorological model: a case study from Japan
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - A major source of error in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), used for mapping ground deformation, is the delay caused by changes in the propagation velocity of radar microwaves in the troposphere. Correcting this tropospheric delay noise using numerical weather models is common because of their global availability. Various correction methods and tools exist; selecting the most appropriate one by considering weather models, delay models, and delay calculation algorithms is essential for specific applications. We compared the performance of two tropospheric delay correction methods applied to Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) data acquired over Japan, where the atmospheric field is complex with significant seasonal variation. We tested: (1) a method of delay integration along the slant radar line-of-sight (LOS) path using the mesoscale model (MSM) provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency and (2) the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) for InSAR, which estimates delay using the high-resolution forecast (HRES)-European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) products along with an iterative decomposition approach. The results showed that the tropospheric delay correction using the slant-delay integration approach with MSM, which has a finer temporal and spatial resolution, performed slightly better than GACOS. We further found that the differences in the refractivity models would have limited significance, suggesting that the difference in performance mainly originates from differences in the numerical weather models being used. This study highlights the importance of using the best-available numerical weather model data for tropospheric delay calculations.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change analysis of land use/land cover in NCT of Delhi, India using geospatial technology
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing anthropological and economic activity has transformed human-environment connections. Using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS), severe issues connected to rapid growth, such as supplemental infrastructure, informal residents, demolition of ecological construction, shortage of natural resources, and environmental contamination, have been studied for a fast-growing metropolis like Delhi. Industrialization accelerates urbanization, resulting in land transformations, which are one of the major uses of natural resources. In a fast-growing city like Delhi, the development has been rapid, and it is important to investigate the factors behind these shifts. For the present study, remote sensing and GIS models are used for land use and land cover (LULC) change detection. The applied model in the study uses the satellite datasets of two different satellites, i.e., Landsat 5 (TM) of 2010 and Landsat 8 (OLI) of 2021, from November with little or no cloud cover, which could block the LULC features. The study compares the temporal LULC map and analyzes the change and increase in urbanization for two periods, 2010 and 2021. In the study, it is revealed that urbanization causes constant shifts in vegetation, built-up area ratio, and land-use patterns. To confirm the same, indices like the normalized difference vegetation index and the normalized difference building index are also studied. Inequitable land use is a major contributor to environmental degradation. The spatial datasets from two time periods used in the study and the database results are helpful in extensive LULC investigations, land use planning, spatial growth, and urbanization patterns in the NCT of Delhi. Further, the change detection model used in the study was supported by the standard accuracy assessment of the Kappa coefficient. Overall accuracy in 2010 was 89.52% with a Kappa statistic of 0.863 and 89.92% with a Kappa statistic of 0.868 in 2021. Such studies using remote sensing and GIS are extremely helpful in understanding and monitoring urban sprawl patterns.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) during the unusually early 2022/23 influenza A(H3N2) epi-demic. Like vaccine, circulating viruses were clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, but with genetic diversity affecting hae-magglutinin positions 135 and 156, and reassortment such that H156 viruses acquired neuraminidase from clade 3C.2a1b.1a. Vaccine provided substantial protec-tion with A(H3N2) VE of 54% (95% CI: 38 to 66) over-all. VE was similar against H156 and vaccine-like S156 viruses, but with potential variation based on diversity at position 135.

TI  - Accuracy of sentinel node mapping in patients with biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes and upfront surgery: preliminary results of the Multimodal Targeted Axillary Surgery (MUTAS) trial
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Some studies suggested that the patients included in the Z0011 trial may represent patients with ultrasound-negative axillary nodes and axillary invasion diagnosed by sentinel node (SN) biopsy. Nevertheless, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend SN mapping if 1 or 2 suspicious lymph nodes are identified on axillary ultrasound (AU). The aim of this preliminary phase of the Multimodal Targeted Axillary Surgery (MUTAS) trial was to establish the accuracy of SN mapping in patients with axillary involvement undergoing upfront surgery.Methods: Between September 2019 and March 2022, we recruited patients with biopsy-proven metastatic axillary nodes and upfront surgery from a single center. We performed SN mapping in these patients before the surgical intervention, which included axillary lymph node dissection. The biopsy-proven metastatic node, SNs and the remaining axillary nodes were excised separately. SN status was considered representative of the status of the remaining axillary nodes. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of the SN, overall and in patients with palpable nodes, in those with non-palpable nodes and an AU leading to diagnosis of axillary involvement, in those with 1 or 2 suspicious nodes on AU, and in patients with a single suspicious node on AU. We evaluated clinical, imaging and pathology features as predictors of the status of the remaining axillary nodes, false-negatives, and false-positives.Results: We included 25 patients in this phase. The false-negative rate of SN mapping was 28% overall, 21.42% for patients with palpable nodes, 36.36% for patients with non-palpable nodes and an AU diagnosis of axillary involvement, 28.75% for those with 1 or 2 suspicious nodes on AU, and 15.38% in patients with a single suspicious node on AU. The negative predictive value was highest in patients with a single suspicious node on AU (75%). The only significant predictive factor was that FN showed a higher Ki67 index score.Conclusions: In this study, SN mapping was not reliable in patients with biopsy-proven metastatic axillary nodes and upfront surgery for any of the subgroups studied. Further research should elucidate the best staging pathways in these patients to avoid premature de-escalation.

TI  - Recognition of spider mite infestations in jujube trees based on spectral-spatial clustering of hyperspectral images from UAVs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spider mite infestations are a serious hazard for jujube trees in China. The use of remote sensing technology to evaluate the health of jujube trees in large-scale intensive agricultural production is an effective means of agricultural control. Hyperspectral remote sensing has a higher spectral resolution and richer spectral information than conventional multispectral remote sensing, which improves the detection of crop pests and diseases. We used hyperspectral remote sensing data from jujube fields infested with spider mite in Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang to evaluate their use in monitoring this important pest. We fused spectral and spatial information from the hyperspectral images and propose a method of recognizing spider mite infestations of jujube trees. Our method is based on the construction of spectral features, the fusion of spatial information and clustering of these spectral-spatial features. We evaluated the effect of different spectral-spatial features and different clustering methods on the recognition of spider mite in jujube trees. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy of the method for the recognition of spider mites was >93% and the overall accuracy of the band clustering-density peak clustering model for the recognition of spider mite reached 96.13%. This method can be applied to the control of jujube spider mites in agricultural production.

TI  - Accumulation and speciation of arsenic in <i>Eisenia fetida</i> in sodium arsenite spiked soils - A dynamic interaction between soil and earthworms
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid that is a significant global pollutant of the environment and a persistent bio-accumulation carcinogen. Earthworms are frequently employed as sentinel organisms to investigate the bioavailability of As in contaminated soils. However, the process of As accumulation in earthworms and the mechanism of transformation of As species in their bodies are not well understood. The accumulation of As and variation of As species in the earthworms (Eisenia fetida) exposed to sodium arsenite (0, 20, and 80 mg kg(-1) As) were investigated in this study. The total As concentration of earthworms in the three treatments at various sample times was dose-dependent on soil As content. After 56 days of exposure, the high concentration treatment had the highest total As content (772 +/- 21 mg kg(-1)) in earthworms, followed by the low concentration treatment (579 +/- 42 mg kg(-1)) and control (31 +/- 1 mg kg(-1)). During 56 days, the proportion of trivalent As in earthworms increased from 70% to more than 90%, while pentavalent As decreased by 11-18%. On day 28, the sum of the four organic As species reached a maximum (<1%). Changes in soil As species and an increase in bioavailable As cause earthworms to accumulate more As. The total As in soil after 56 days of exposure was 9.51 +/- 0.50, 25.6 +/- 0.60, and 82.8 +/- 0.28 mg kg(-1), which was not significantly different from the total As in soil before the experiment. These findings are useful in assessing the risk of earthworm exposure to sodium arsenite in the soil.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - A complete global flood event record would aid researchers to analyze the distribution of global floods and, thus, better formulate and manage disaster prevention and reduction policies. This study used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage and precipitation data combined with high frequency filtering, anomaly detection and flood potential index methods to successfully extract historical flood days globally between 1 April 2002 and 31 August 2016; these results were then further compared and validated with Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) data, Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) discharge data, news reports and social media data. The results showed that GRACE-based flood days could cover 81 % of the flood events in the DFO database, 87 % of flood events extracted by MODIS and supplement many additional flood events not recorded by the DFO. Moreover, the probability of detection greater than or equal to 0.5 reached 62 % among 261 river basins compared to flood events derived from the GRDC discharge data. These detection capabilities and detection results are both good. Finally, we provided flood day products with a 1 degrees spatial resolution covering the range between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N from 1 April 2002 to 31 August 2016; these products can be obtained from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6831384 (Zhang et al., 2022b). Thus, this research contributes a data foundation for the mechanistic analysis and attribution of global flood events.

TI  - Sustainable application of GF-6 WFV satellite data in desert steppe: A village-scale grazing study in China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the vegetation growth and forage-livestock balance of desert grasslands at the village scale. This study was chosen to be conducted in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, where desert grasslands are widely distributed and fragility of the environment. This paper establishes a model for estimating time series changes of above-ground biomass (AGB) in the study area based on remote sensing images from the Gaofen-6 satellite, combined with canopy spectra and AGB data of vegetated desert steppe areas. Next, the ecological carrying capacity and load of the desert steppe area were analyzed based on the number of sheep raised in different enclosures and the grazing methods employed. The status of the forage-livestock balance in the study area was assessed after measuring the crop yield of farmland. Finally, data and case support for grazing management in desert steppe were provided in combination with the research results. The study concluded that Gaofen-6 satellite images could quickly and accurately obtain information on vegetation growth and changes in desert grassland areas at a village scale. The available grazing time in a single year in the study area is inadequate to support current stocking levels. When ecological stability is the primary consideration, natural forage obtained through natural conditions cannot meet the needs of farmers for normal grazing and production activities. The suitable grazing time in the study area is limited in any year. The suitable maximum grazing intensity among all plots ranged from 0.334 to 2.541 sheep/ha. In the case of the balance between grass and livestock, the forage obtained from natural pastures could only satisfy 41.71% of the current stocking levels for sheep. Rotational grazing and subsidies for farmers help desert steppe to recover and achieve a forage-livestock balance.

TI  - Monitoring of Water and Tillage Soil Erosion in Agricultural Basins, a Comparison of Measurements Acquired by Differential Interferometric Analysis of Sentinel TopSAR Images and a Terrestrial LIDAR System
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural production, the main pillar of food security, is highly dependent on soil quality, and threatened by erosion processes that degrade soil quality. This article is part of a research to verify the usefulness of differential interferometric analysis on TopSAR (Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar) images to measure water and tillage erosion in small agricultural basins. For this, images from the Sentinel 1 mission are used, analyzing the deformations on the earth's surface. The purpose of this research is to verify the accuracy of the proposed method by comparing its measures with the ones taken with the gold standard laser terrestrial LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system, as well as to establish a basic step period framework that guarantees an admissible loss of coherence. The results on a pilot plot in El Molar (north of Madrid, Spain) showed that the differences lay within the range of the error associated with the very LIDAR system and showed that coherence losses correspond with the deformations measured. Given the economic and labor advantages of the differential interferometric analysis, this method could be regarded as an excellent alternative to the use of LIDAR in large-scale studies for measuring ground deformation caused by water and tillage erosion.

TI  - Hydrological Modeling of the Kobo-Golina River in the Data-Scarce Upper Danakil Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A proper understanding of hydrological processes is vital for water resource assessment, management, and conservation at a local, national, and global scale. The role of hydrological models is critically important in rarely studied ungauged catchments including of Kobo-Golina, in the Danakil basin of Ethiopia. The main objective of this research is to model the hydrology of the Kobo-Golina catchment using the completely restructured SWAT (SWAT+) model. Validated reanalysis river flow from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for single and multi-variable calibration. It is found that the multi-variable calibration scenario reasonably attained the minimum satisfactory performance limit for both variables (NSE = 0.67, R-2 = 0.68, PBias = -9.68%, and RSR = 0.57 for calibration of GloFAS flow; and NSE = 0.56, R-2 = 0.63, RSR = 0.66, PBias = 3.86 for calibration of MODIS AET). The model simulation showed that evapotranspiration accounts for 47% of the input water while surface runoff, lateral flow, and groundwater recharge account for 30%, 1.53%, and 21.4%, respectively. The simulated mean annual streamflow at the Basin outlet is 10.6 m(3)/s. The monthly low flow occurs in June with a median flow of 1.43 m(3)/s and a coefficient of dispersion of 0.67. High flows occur in August, with a median flow of 16.55 m(3)/s and a coefficient of dispersion of 1.55. The spatial distribution of simulated runoff was depicted as being higher in the floodplains and along the riparian/drainage lines, whereas upland areas showed lower runoff. The maximum monthly recharge occurs in September with a recharge value of 78.2 mm. The findings of the study suggested that both surface water harvesting and groundwater exploitation can be sought in floodplain areas while conserving the uplands.

AB  - Precise knowledge of crop water consumption is essential to better manage agricultural water use, particularly in regions where most countries struggle with increasing water and food insecurity. Approaches such as cloud computing and remote sensing (RS) have facilitated access, process, and visualization of big geospatial data to map and monitor crop water requirements. To find the most reliable Vegetation Index (VI)-based evapotranspiration (ETa) for croplands in drylands, we modeled and mapped ETa using empirical RS methods across the Zayandehrud river basin in Iran for two decades (2000-2019) on the Google Earth Engine platform using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2). Developed ET-VI products in this study comprise three NDVI-based ETa (ET-NDVI*, ET-NDVI*(scaled), and ET-NDVIKc) and an EVI2-based ETa (ET-EVI2). We (a) applied, for the first time, the ET-NDVI* method to croplands as a crop-independent index and then compared its performance with the ET-EVI2 and crop ET, and (b) assessed the ease and feasibility of the transferability of these methods to other regions. Comparing four ET-VI products showed that annual ET-EVI2 and ET-NDVI*(scaled) estimations were close. ET-NDVIKc consistently overestimated ETa. Our findings indicate that ET-EVI2 and ET-NDVIKc were easy to parametrize and adopt to other regions, while ET-NDVI* and ET-NDVI*(scaled) are site-dependent and sensitive to image acquisition time. ET-EVI2 performed robustly in arid and semi-arid regions making it a better tool. Future research should further develop and confirm these findings by characterizing the accuracy of VI-based ETa over croplands in drylands by comparing them with available ETa products and examining their performance using crop-specific comparisons.

TI  - The Influence of Elevation, Land Cover and Vegetation Index on LST Increase in Taiwan from 2000 to 2021
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important factor in ground surface energy balance and in universal climatology studies. Elevation, Land Cover (LC), and vegetation index are three factors that influence ground surface variation, and their influences vary depending on geography. This study aimed to: (i) investigate the seasonal patterns and trends of daytime LST, and (ii) examine the influence of elevation, LC, and vegetation index on daytime LST increase in Taiwan from 2000 to 2021. LST, vegetation, and LC data were downloaded from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) website, and elevation data were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. The natural cubic spline method was applied to investigate annual seasonal patterns and trends in daytime LST. Linear regression modeling was applied to investigate the influence of elevation, LC, and vegetation index on daytime LST increases. The results showed that the average increase in daytime LST per decade in Taiwan was 0.021 degrees C. Elevation, LC, and vegetation had significantly affected the daytime LST increase, with R-2 of 32.5% and 28.1% for the North and South parts of the country, respectively. The daytime LST increase in the North at elevations higher than 1000 m had an increasing trend, while in the South the increasing trend was found at elevations higher than 350 m above sea level. All types of forest and urban areas in the North had a higher daytime LST increase than the average, while in the South, the areas with water, closed shrubland, and urban parts had a higher daytime LST increase than the average.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of the Lake Tana Water Quality Derived from the MODIS-Based Forel-Ule Index: The Roles of Hydrometeorological and Surface Processes
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Tana, the largest inland water body in Ethiopia, has witnessed significant changes due to ongoing urbanization and socioeconomic activities in recent times. In this study, the two-decade recordings of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to derive Forel-Ule index (FUI). The FUI, which ranges from 1 (dark-blue pristine water) to 21 (yellowish-brown polluted water), is important to fully understand the quality and trophic state of the lake in the last two decades. The analysis of FUI over a period of 22 years (2000-2021) indicates that Lake Tana is in a eutrophic state as confirmed by FUI values ranging from 11 to 17. This is in agreement with the trophic state index (TSI) estimated from MERIS diversity-II chlorophyll a (Chl_a) measurements for the overlapping 2003-2011 period. The categorical skill scores show that FUI-based lake water trophic state classification relative to MERIS-based TSI has a high performance. FUI has a positive correlation with TSI, (Chl_a), turbidity, and total suspended matter (TSM) and negative relations with Chl_a and TSM (at the lake shoreline) and colored dissolved organic matter. The annual, interannual and seasonal spatial distribution of FUI over the lake show a marked variation. The hydro-meteorological, land-use-land-cover (LULC) related processes are found to modulate the spatiotemporal variability of water quality within the range of lower and upper extremes of the eutrophic state as revealed from the FUI composite analysis. The FUI composites were obtained for the terciles and extreme percentiles of variables representing hydro-meteorological and LULC processes. High FUI composite (poor water quality) is associated with above-normal and extremely high (85 percentile) lake bottom layer temperature, wind speed, precipitation, surface runoff, and hydrometeorological drought as captured by high negative standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). In contrast, a high FUI composite is observed during below-normal and extremely low (15 percentile) lake skin temperature and evaporation. Conversely good water quality (i.e., low FUI) was observed during times of below-normal and above-normal values of the above two sets of drivers respectively. Moreover, FUI varies in response to seasonal NDVI/EVI variabilities. The relationship between water quality and its drivers is consistent with the expected physical processes under different ranges of the drivers. High wind speed, for instance, displaces algae blooms to the shoreline whereas intense precipitation and increased runoff lead to high sediment loads. Increasing lake skin temperature increases evaporation, thereby decreasing water volume and increasing insoluble nutrients, while the increasing lake bottom layer temperature increases microbial activity, thereby enhancing the phosphorus load. Moreover, during drought events, the low inflow and high temperature allow algal bloom, Chl_a, and suspended particles to increase, whereas high vegetation leads to an increase in the non-point sources of total phosphorus and nitrogen.

TI  - The Impact of Altimetry Corrections of Sentinel-3A Sea Surface Height in the Coastal Zone of the Northwest Atlantic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Corrections to altimeter-measured sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) have a larger proportional effect for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimetry than conventional, pulse-limited altimetry because of lower range noise. Here, we quantified the impact of the current generation of altimeter corrections in the coastal zone of the Northwest Atlantic, a region with significant dynamic activity. In this study, we used the sea level variance analysis to determine the change in variance for the altimeter corrections-range, geophysical, and mean surface-compared to the baseline. We also evaluated the performance of two coastal retrackers, ALES (empirical) and SAMOSA++ (fully analytical), against the SSHA from the Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS), which uses the standard SAR retracker. Tide corrections caused the largest change in sea level variance, followed by wet tropospheric corrections and sea state bias. Most non-standard altimeter corrections failed to reduce the sea level variance and performed markedly worse closer to the coast. Coastal retrackers showed a higher deviation from the standard SSHA closer to the coast, especially when the backscatter coefficient was high and the significant wave height was low. We conclude that further development of coastal corrections is needed. Contrary to our prior expectation, we found that standard altimetry corrections appear to perform as well as alternative more advanced/tailored corrections.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK
M3  - Review
AB  - Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (also known as endometrial can-cer, or more broadly as uterine cancer or carcinoma of the uterine cor-pus) is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract in the United States. It is estimated that 65,950 new uterine cancer cases will have occurred in 2022, with 12,550 deaths resulting from the disease. Endometrial carcinoma includes pure endometrioid cancer and carcino-mas with high-risk endometrial histology (including uterine serous carci-noma, clear cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma [also known as malignant mixed Mu euro llerian tumor], and undifferentiated/dedifferentiated carci-noma). Stromal or mesenchymal sarcomas are uncommon subtypes ac-counting for approximately 3% of all uterine cancers. This selection from the NCCN Guidelines for Uterine Neoplasms focuses on the diagnosis, staging, and management of pure endometrioid carcinoma. The com-plete version of the NCCN Guidelines for Uterine Neoplasms is available online at NCCN.org.J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2023;21(2):181-209doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2023.0006

TI  - Analyzing satellite data time-series for agricultural expansion and its water consumption in arid region: a case study of the Farafra oasis in Egypt's Western Desert
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The harsh climate, prevalent soil properties, and a lack of water in the desert environment make controlling the vegetation cover challenging. The effects of changes in vegetation cover on evapotranspiration in the Farafra region of Egypt were investigated using satellite data time-series analysis. The collected time-series satellite data from 2000 to 2020 of Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) were analyzed by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The most significant element of this article is a long-term comprehensive satellite data analysis using cloud computing to determine soil, vegetation, and local climate interactions. Based on an analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa), agricultural expansion and water consumption have been calculated. Agricultural expansion has increased by 102%, from 3340 ha to 6774 ha, at an average of + 163.5 ha/year over the last 21 years. As a result, agricultural water consumption increased by 587%, from 1.88 to 12.97 Mm(3), or + 0.53 Mm(3)/year. Agricultural density has increased, leading to a 20.3% increase in maximum NDVI. With R-2 = 0.91, the correlation analysis revealed a strong and positive relationship between annual NDVI and water consumption, implying that vegetation cover lowers the surface temperature and increases water consumption. The environment-enhancing effects of agricultural expansion on the local climate were apparent, as the brightness temperature (T-b) indicated a 7.6% decrease in surface temperature, at an average of -0.11 degrees C/year, while the air temperature decreased by 2.8%, at an average of -0.03 degrees C/year.

TI  - Sea Surface Height Estimation from Improved Modified, and Decontaminated Sub-Waveform Retracking Methods over Coastal Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are challenging areas for sensing by satellite altimeters because reflected signals from non-water surfaces and from calm sea surfaces in small bays and ports inside the radar footprint lead to erroneous powers in return waveforms. Accordingly, these contaminated waveforms do not follow the so-called Brown model in conventional retracking algorithms and fail to derive qualified ranges. Consequently, the estimated water level is erroneous as well. Therefore, selecting an optimized retracker for post-processing waveforms is significantly important to achieve a qualified water level estimation. To find the optimized retracker, we employed a methodology to minimize the effect of erroneous powers on retracked range corrections. To this end, two new approaches were presented, one based on a waveform decontamination method and the other based on a waveform modification method. We considered the first meaningful sub-waveforms in the decontaminated waveforms and in the modified waveforms to be processed with a threshold retracker. To assess their performance, we also retracked the decontaminated and modified full-waveforms. The first meaningful sub-waveform and full-waveform in the original waveforms were retracked to compare the performance of the modified and decontaminated waveform retracking with the original waveform retracking. To compare the results of our sub-waveform retracking algorithms with those of external sub-waveform retracking algorithms, the (Adaptive Leading Edge Sub-waveform) ALES database was also used. In our retracking scenarios, we used the Sentinel-3A SRAL Altimeter to estimate the water levels over the study area within 10 km from the coastlines in both the Persian Gulf and the Bay of Biscay from June 2016 to October 2020. The water levels from processing L2 products were estimated as well. We evaluated our retracking scenarios and L2, as well as the ALES processing results, against the tide gauges. Our analysis showed that within 0-10 km from the coast, the first meaningful sub-waveform of the decontaminated waveforms had the best performance. We reached maximum RMS improvements in this scenario of 53% and 86% over the Persian Gulf and the Bay of Biscay, respectively, in comparison with L2 processing. Over these distances from the coast, the first sub-waveform from the original waveforms and the modified waveforms stayed in the second and third order of performance. The ALES database with an RMS ranging from 13 to 51 cm had a worse performance than all of our sub-waveform retracking scenarios.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Remote Sensing and Geo-Statistical Techniques to Quantify Forest Biomass
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately characterizing carbon stock is vital for reporting carbon emissions from forest ecosystems. We studied the estimation of biomass using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data in moist temperate forests in the Galies region of Abbottabad Pakistan. Above-ground biomass (AGB), estimated from 60 field plots, was correlated with vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 image-to-map AGB using regression models. Furthermore, additional explanatory variables were also associated with AGB in the geo-statistical technique, and kriging interpolation was used to predict AGB. The results illustrate that the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) is the best index (R-2 = 0.67) for estimating AGB. In spectral reflectance, Band 1(Coastal Aerosol 443 nm) performs better than other bands. Multiple linear regression models calibrated with ARVI, NNIR and NDVI yielded better results (R-2 = 0.46) with the lowest RMSE (48.53) and MAE (38.42) and were therefore considered better for biomass estimation. On the other hand, in the geo-statistical technique, distance to settlements, ARVI and annual precipitation were significantly correlated with biomass compared to others. In the stepwise regression method, the forward selection resulted in a very significant value (less than 0.000) for ARVI. Therefore, it can be considered best for prediction and used to interpolate AGB through kriging. Compared to the geo-statistical technique, the remote sensing-based models performed relatively well. Regarding potential sites for REDD+ implementation, temporal analysis of Landsat images showed a decrease in forest area from 8896.23 ha in 1988 to 7692.03 ha in 2018. Therefore, this study concludes that the state-of-the-art open-source sensor, the Sentinel-2 data, has significant potential for forest biomass and carbon stock estimation and can be used for robust regional AGB estimation with acceptable accuracy and frequent availability.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP): Employing Landsat Data and Socio-Economic Survey
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation is a global concern, especially in developing countries. The Margalla Hills of Pakistan-Himalayan foothills-also face the threat of deforestation and forest degradation. These Margalla Hills, considering the need for forest protection activities in Pakistan, were declared a reserved national forest and named "the Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP)". This study quantitively evaluates whether deforestation and forest degradation have occurred at MHNP and identifies their possible drivers. Satellite (Landsat) data 1988-2020 was employed for the land use change analysis, whereas a socio-economic survey of the local population and structured interviews with government officials were conducted to identify the drivers of deforestation. Supervised classification was performed for imagery classification and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) was also calculated to measure degradation. Supervised classification showed that the forest cover increased from 65% of the total area in 1988 to 69% in 2020. The VCI results show that the moderate level of degradation has increased from 3.5% of MHNP area in 1988 to 8.8% in 2020. The cumulative measure of degradation from 1988 to 2020 is 1.09% of the total forest (using p < 0.05). Major drivers identified are fuel wood and timber collection. The results reveal a decline in both deforestation and forest degradation. There is a need for further quantitative analysis of the drivers, strict implementation of legislative and control measures, and continuous invigilation of the deforestation trends in MHNP.

TI  - GIS-based earthquake potential analysis in Northwest Himalayan, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the use of integrated remote sensing and the Geographical Information System (GIS) approach for the identification of earthquake potential areas. In the adopted approach Sentinel-2 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) satellite data, earthquake data, and geological data are used. Important factors related to earthquakes were recognized and relative input data layers (digital elevation model, slope, earthquake magnitude, epicentre location, lineaments, faults, distance to active faults and epicentre) were developed. For data integration in GIS, a numerical ranking scheme has been adopted to establish rank values for each factor for the appraisal of earthquake potential index (EPI) map. The final earthquake potential index map divides the study region into different corresponding potential classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The earthquake potential map produced for the region was compared with the previous seismic hazard maps derived from traditional techniques. The use of various parameters and implementation of the suggested method in the study region elucidates its good and detailed estimation of earthquake potential areas compared to traditional techniques.

TI  - Operation of Gate-Controlled Irrigation System Using HEC-RAS 2D for Spring Flood Hazard Reduction
T2  - COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding events have been negatively affecting the Republic of Kazakhstan, with higher occurrence in flat parts of the country during spring snowmelt in snow-fed rivers. The current project aims to assess the flood hazard reduction capacity of Alva irrigation system, which is located in the interfluve area of Yesil and Nura Rivers. The assessment is performed by simulating spring floods using HEC-RAS 2D and controlling the gates of the existing system. A digital elevation model of the study domain was generated by integration of Sentinel-1 radar images with the data obtained from bathymetrical survey and aerial photography. Comparison of the simulated inundation area with a remote sensing image of spring flood in April 2019 indicated that the main reason for differences was due to local snowmelt in the study domain. Exclusion of areas flooded by local snowmelt, which were identified using the updated DEM, from comparison increased the model similarity to 70%. Further simulations of different exceedance probability hydrographs enabled classification of the study area according to maximum flood depth and flood duration. Theoretical changes on the dam crest as well as additional gates were proposed to improve the system capacity by flooding agriculturally important areas, which were not flooded during the simulation of the current system. The developed model could be used by local authorities for further development of flood mitigation measures and assessment of different development plans of the irrigation system.

T2  - CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracted lineaments maps with the geospatial analysis performed by GIS, such as density and orientation, will contribute in comprehending how the lineaments and structural elements in the study area relate to one another. Due to the lack of achievements and accomplishments Al Jabal Al Akhdar in this regard, this study seeks to explain the lineaments' tectonic significance. Throughout this study, the Alos Palsor Satellite was used for automatic extraction. The goal of this study's technique was to establish a unique kind of automatic analysis for lineaments and utilize the results to link tectonic significance and landslides to those lineaments. Two significant observations were recognized about the orientation measured from the analysis of the 28,061 geological lineaments, that were digitally detected. First, the Upper Cretaceous rocks shows trends in NW-SE and NE-SW directions. Second, the other younger Paleogene/Neogene rocks shows a major trend toward the NW-SE. The high density of lineaments is clearly seen in the eastern central part of the study area where the Oligocene Al Bayda and Al Abraq formations are exposed and the lowest densities of lineaments are found in the western and coastline parts of the study area. The density, landslide susceptibility maps and the stratigraphic framework of the area reveals a strong relationship between the lineament intensity and how they are distributed, which reflects several tectonic occurrences. The Oligocene, a period of devastating tectonic history of Al Jabal Al Akhdar, has the greatest influence on the intensity of lineaments in eastern region. However, in the Miocene, a time of relative stability, the intensity of lineaments is greatly reduced western region.

Currently, the most convenient and fastest way to retrieve LST is to use remote sensing images due to their continuous monitoring of the Earth's surface. The work intended to investigate land cover change and temperature response in An-Najaf province. Landsat multispectral imageries acquired in August 1989, 2004, and 2021 were employed to estimate land cover change and LST responses. The findings exhibited an increase in water bodies, built-up areas, plantations, and croplands by 7.78%, 7.27%, 6.98%, 3.24%, and 7.78%, respectively, while bare soil decreased by 25.27% for the period (1989-2021). This indicates a transition from barren lands to different land cover types. The contribution index (CI) was employed to depict how changes in land cover categories altered mean region surface temperatures. The highest LSTs recorded were in bare lands (42.2 degrees C, 44.25 degrees C, and 46.9 degrees C), followed by built-up zones (41.6 degrees C, 43.96 degrees C, and 44.89 degrees C), cropland (30.9 degrees C, 32.96 degrees C, and 34.76 degrees C), plantations (35.4 degrees C, 36.97 degrees C, and 38.92 degrees C), and water bodies (27.3 degrees C, 29.35 degrees C, and 29.68 degrees C) respectively, in 1989, 2004, and 2021. Consequently, these changes resulted in significant variances in LST between different LC types.

TI  - Measuring urban expansion pattern using spatial matrices in Khulna City, Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Khulna, the third-largest metropolitan area in Bangladesh, has become a potential site for the polycentric urbanization for multiple mega-projects. Measurement of urban expansion is essential for regulating haphazard growth and achieving effective management. This study aims to quantify and compare the urban expansion pattern of Khulna City Corporation (KCC) and sur-rounding areas' development hotspots. Landsat remote sensing images of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were used to perform supervised classification using Geographic Information System (GIS). To quantify urban expansion, we compute Annual Urban Expansion Rate, Urban Expansion In-tensity Index, and Urban Expansion Differentiation Index. Although annual urban expansion in the study area was slow during the first two decades, it accelerated to 6.76% during the last decade. 48% of the total built-up areas have grown during 2010-2020 alone. Even though KCC experienced continuous urban growth over a thirty-year period, after 2010, the rate of urban expansion in peripheral areas exceeded that of KCC. Transboundary and intra-regional trans-portation and economic corridor development, establishment of economically potential zones (EPZ), urban to rural migration, availability of rich agriculture hinterland, low land price and several direct transportation links between the core and periphery are the major influencing factors of peri-urbanization.

TI  - The Effects of Exposing <i>Solea senegalensis</i> to Microbeads with and Without Pesticides
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics (MP) are contaminants able to cause adverse effects on organisms. MPs are capable to interact with other environmental contaminants, including pesticides, altering their toxicity. The objective of the study was to research the sublethal effects (enzymatic activity) of pesticides alone and in combination with MPs. Cholinesterase enzymes are used as biomarkers to determine and evaluate the effects produced in organisms after exposure to pollutants. This study showed the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity in the tissue of Solea senegalensis exposed to two environmental pollutants, the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and antibacterial triclosan (TCS) with and without microplastics (MPs). Solea senegalensis was chosen because it is a species in high demand because of its high economic value in southern Europe, as well as the use of this species in ecotoxicology and its increasing use as sentinel species, which justify using it to assess biological effects of pollutants. Toxicity tests were performed in organisms exposed to concentrations of between 5 and 80 mu g/L CPF and 0.1 and 0.4 mg/L TCS for 96 h. In addition, each test incorporated MPs that were added at different concentrations in order to evaluate their role as a possible enhancer of the effects caused by the previous pollutants. In the case of CPF, the head and muscle tissue cholinesterase activity was inhibited from a concentration of 5 mu g/L both without and with MPs, and the AChE enzymatic activity for the treatment with MPs was approximately half the activity for the treatment without MPs in the tissues studied. Besides, TCS inhibited the cholinesterase activity at a concentration of 0.3 mg/L in the muscle of S. senegalensis. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the TCS + MP treatment compared to the controls. These results showed the importance of studies in assessing the anticholinesterase effects of pesticides combined with microplastics due to the abundance of these contaminants in the marine environment and the role of cholinesterase activity (biomarker) in the neurotransmission of key physiological processes.

TI  - Detection and Monitoring of Small-Scale Diamond and Gold Mining Dredges Using Synthetic Aperture Radar on the Kadei (Sangha) River, Central African Republic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Diamond and gold mining has been practiced by artisanal miners in the Central African Republic (CAR) for decades. The recent introduction of riverine dredges indicates a transition from artisanal/manual digging and sorting techniques to small-scale mining methods. This study implements a remote sensing analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to map gold and diamond dredges operating on the Kadei (Sangha) river in the CAR. Riverine vessels are identified in Sentinel-1 SAR data between 2015 and 2019, and their activity levels are mapped over time. The number of active dredges identified on the river increased over the five years studied, with the largest increase occurring between 2016 and 2017. Detailing a method for mapping and monitoring riverine diamond and gold dredge mining is an important step in keeping up with evolving technologies and new areas of mineral exploitation and in helping address concerns over resource governance in remote and conflict-prone terrain. The use of SAR technology, with its weather-independence, broad coverage, and available wavelength combinations, allows for higher temporal resolution and improved vessel detection in the monitoring of small-scale mining (SSM) dredges.

TI  - Predicting Soil Erosion Rate at Transboundary Sub-Watersheds in Ali Al-Gharbi, Southern Iraq, Using RUSLE-Based GIS Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The empirical soil loss model, RUSLE, was used in conjunction with remotely sensed data and geographic information system technology to delineate the soil erosion and watershed priorities in terms of conservation practices at seven boundary sub-watersheds (labeled as SW-00, SW-01, horizontal ellipsis , SW-06) between Iraq and Iran in the district of Ali Al-Gharbi, southern Iraq. The six factors of the RUSLE model, i.e., the rainfall erosivity, the soil erodibility, the slope steepness length, the crop management, and management practice, were calculated or estimated using information from different data sources such as remotely sensed data and previous studies. The results revealed that the annual soil erosion loss ranges from 0 to 1890 (tons h(-1) y(-1)) with an average of 0.66 (tons h(-1) y(-1)). Values of soil erosion were classified into five classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The potential soil loss in the high and very high classes ranges from 14.84 to 1890 (tons h(-1) y(-1)), and these classes occupy only 27 km(2) of the study area, indicating that the soil loss is very low in the area being examined. In terms of the spatial distribution of soil loss, the northern and northeastern parts (mountains and hills) of the sub-watersheds where the slope is steeper are more likely to erode than the plain area in the southern and southeastern portions, indicating that slope, in addition to rainfall erosivity, has a dominant effect on the soil erosion rate. The study of soil erosion in the watersheds under consideration reveals that only the northern portions of the SW-00, SW-02, and SW-04 watersheds require high priority conservation plans; however, these portions are primarily located in mountain regions, making the implementation of conservation plans in these areas impractical. Due to low soil loss, other sub-watersheds, particularly SW-01, SW-03, SW-05, and SW-06, are given low priority.

TI  - The Evolution of the Sentinel Node Biopsy in Melanoma
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - The growing repertoire of approved immune-checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy has revolutionized the adjuvant treatment of melanoma. While the treatment of primary cutaneous melanoma remains wide local excision (WLE), the management of regional lymph nodes continues to evolve in light of practice-changing clinical trials and dramatically improved adjuvant therapy. With large multicenter studies reporting no benefit in overall survival for completion lymph node dissection (CLND) after a positive sentinel node biopsy (SLNB), controversy remains regarding patient selection and clinical decision-making. This review explores the evolution of the SLNB in cutaneous melanoma in the context of a rapidly changing adjuvant treatment landscape, summarizing the key clinical trials which shaped current practice guidelines.

TI  - Fusion of VNIR Optical and C-Band Polarimetric SAR Satellite Data for Accurate Detection of Temporal Changes in Vegetated Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a processing chain jointly employing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, aiming to monitor changes in the status of the vegetation cover by integrating the four 10 m visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands with the three red-edge (RE) bands of Sentinel-2. The latter approximately span the gap between red and NIR bands (700 nm-800 nm), with bandwidths of 15/20 nm and 20 m pixel spacing. The RE bands are sharpened to 10 m, following the hyper-sharpening protocol, which holds, unlike pansharpening, when the sharpening band is not unique. The resulting 10 m fusion product may be integrated with polarimetric features calculated from the Interferometric Wide (IW) Ground Range Detected (GRD) product of Sentinel-1, available at 10 m pixel spacing, before the fused data are analyzed for change detection. A key point of the proposed scheme is that the fusion of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is accomplished at level of change, through modulation of the optical change feature, namely the difference in normalized area over (reflectance) curve (NAOC), calculated from the sharpened RE bands, by the polarimetric SAR change feature, achieved as the temporal ratio of polarimetric features, where the latter is the pixel ratio between the co-polar and the cross-polar channels. Hyper-sharpening of Sentinel-2 RE bands, calculation of NAOC and modulation-based integration of Sentinel-1 polarimetric change features are applied to multitemporal datasets acquired before and after a fire event, over Mount Serra, in Italy. The optical change feature captures variations in the content of chlorophyll. The polarimetric SAR temporal change feature describes depolarization effects and changes in volumetric scattering of canopies. Their fusion shows an increased ability to highlight changes in vegetation status. In a performance comparison achieved by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the proposed change feature-based fusion approach surpasses a traditional area-based approach and the normalized burned ratio (NBR) index, which is widespread in the detection of burnt vegetation.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Rainfed Agriculture Lands of North Darfur State, Sudan, Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfed agriculture in Northern Darfur is influenced by erratic seasonal and decadal rainfall patterns and frequent droughts. Understanding the spatio-temporal variation in rainfed agriculture is crucial for promoting food security, socio-economic stability and protecting the vulnerable ecosystem. This study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of rainfed agriculture in North Darfur State from 1984-2019 using multitemporal Landsat observation data. Using the random forest technique, the multitemporal images were classified into common land use/land cover classes and rainfed agriculture on goz (sandy) and wadi (seasonal river) lands. Overall accuracies were assessed using a confusion matrix. Overall accuracies were assessed using a confusion matrix has ranging between 94.7% and 96.9%, while the kappa statistics were greater than 0.90. The results showed that the high spatial variability in goz land used for rainfed agriculture increased of (889,622.46 ha) over 1994-1999, while it decreased (658,568.61 ha) over 2004-2009 south of the 232.9 mm isohyet. Rainfed cultivation of wadi lands expanded significantly of (580,515.03 ha) over 2014-2019 and decreased (182,701.8 ha) over 1994-1999, especially in the 362.8-477.2 mm isohyets (beyond the climate-adapted 500 mm isohyet agronomic dry limit). These spatial trends need further investigation as they may exacerbate both regional land degradation and disputes among farmers over scarce wadi lands. This study provides essential spatial data which are lacking owing to ongoing conflicts; this can help decision-makers formulate sustainable land use monitoring systems.

T2  - SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The damaging consequences of anthropogenic climate change are well documented. In order to engage the public on the serious question of climate change, there is a need to use different approaches to connect climate change with other concerns. This study is the first to understand how football fans engage with climate change and how a campaign should engage with them. It does this through an analysis of fans' engagement with a campaign to engage fans (Pledgeball). It is situated within the literature, which argues that climate change communication needs to engage with the culture, values and worldviews of the target audience. It argues that football fans could be a significant form of collective behaviour to engage with climate change; and that aligning with the identity and worldview of fans, as well as the broader culture of football, can promote engagement and possible social change.

TI  - Unmanned aerial systems accurately map rangeland condition indicators in a dryland savannah
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry savannahs are highly sensitive to climate change and under intense anthropogenic pressure. Therefore, the methods for assessing their status should be easy and repeatable. Monitoring through satellite data and field measurements are limited in accurately assessing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystems. Fortunately, emerging technologies like Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) allow to transcend these limitations. But their calibration with field data for application in rangelands is still relatively new and less common than for example in precision agriculture. In this study we developed a drone-based workflow for mapping the condition of ran-gelands in dryland savannah. We evaluated how accurately and efficiently the two common indicators (i.e., potential forage biomass and rangeland cover type) of rangeland condition can be estimated from drone imagery across a range of conditions (i.e., highly degraded to healthy rangelands). To develop the drone-based potential forage biomass model we tested the accuracy of four vegetation indices to predict field biomass, with the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) showing the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 194.05). The OSAVI-based model yielded a significant strong relationship (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) between predicted and field observed potential forage biomass across the rangeland system. For land cover, we applied a decision tree classification based on thresholds determined using data mining, with a mean overall accuracy of 95.8%. The drone-based estimates of bare cover, herbaceous cover and woody cover showed strong agreements (R(2 )ranging between 0.86 and 0.97) with the two image-truthing methods (line-point intercept and visual es-timations) tested. We show that the drone-based approach is more efficient, unbiased, and repeatable than the field methods. Based on these results, the drone-based workflow presented here offers a reproducible, accurate and efficient approach for near-real time monitoring of rangeland condition at a landscape level. This may assist with climate-adapted management to prevent further land degradation and associated threats to biodiversity and human livelihoods.

TI  - Axillary Treatment Management in Breast Cancer during COVID-19 Pandemic (Association between ACOSOG Z0011 Criteria and OSNA Test)
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of the SARS-COVID-2 pandemic (COVID-19) had a significant effect on the organisation of healthcare systems. Surgical units saw a significant reduction in the volume of surgical procedures performed, with lengthening waiting lists as a consequence. We assessed the surgical activity in relation to breast cancer that took place at the University Hospital of Cagliari, Italy, from February 2018 to March 2022. Two phases were identified based on the epidemiological circumstances: Phase 1-February 2018 to February 2020; Phase 2-March 2020 to March 2022. The surgery performed in the two phases was then compared. All the patients in our sample underwent a breast surgical procedure involving a lymph node biopsy using OSNA associated with the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria. In the study period overall at our facility, there were 4214 procedures, 417 of which involved breast surgery. In Phase 2, 91 procedures were performed using the OSNA method and ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, enabling the intraoperative staging of axillary nodes. Axillary treatment in breast cancer using this approach resulted in a significant reduction in the number of reoperations for the radicalisation of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - Evaluation of Airborne HySpex and Spaceborne PRISMA Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data for Soil Organic Matter and Carbonates Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and soil spectroscopy applications are valuable techniques for soil property estimation. Soil organic matter (SOM) and calcium carbonate are important factors in soil quality, and although organic matter is well studied, calcium carbonates require more investigation. In this study, we validated the performance of laboratory soil spectroscopy for estimating the aforementioned properties with referenced in situ data. We also examined the performance of imaging spectroscopy sensors, such as the airborne HySpex and the spaceborne PRISMA. For this purpose, we applied four commonly used machine learning algorithms and six preprocessing methods for the evaluation of the best fitting algorithm.. The study took place over crop areas of Amyntaio in Northern Greece, where extensive soil sampling was conducted. This is an area with a very variable mineralogical environment (from lignite mine to mountainous area). The SOM results were very good at the laboratory scale and for both remote sensing sensors with R-2 = 0.79 for HySpex and R-2 = 0.76 for PRISMA. Regarding the calcium carbonate estimations, the remote sensing accuracy was R-2 = 0.82 for HySpex and R-2 = 0.36 for PRISMA. PRISMA was still in the commissioning phase at the time of the study, and therefore, the acquired image did not cover the whole study area. Accuracies for calcium carbonates may be lower due to the smaller sample size used for the modeling procedure. The results show the potential for using quantitative predictions of SOM and the carbonate content based on soil and imaging spectroscopy at the air and spaceborne scales and for future applications using larger datasets.

T2  - TEM JOURNAL-TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - - GIS technology has advanced rapidly in recent decades to become a standard tool for managing and analyzing spatial data to solve spatial problems. Spatial modelling is one of the GIS products that can be used as a reference for future policy development for effective spatial management. This research aims to create land use models for the Tanah Datar area of West Sumatra in 2025 and 2035. The model is created using the Cellular Automata method and remote sensing data. The land use data from 1989 and 2002 became the model's base year, and 2019 served as the basis for testing the model's accuracy. According to the modelling results, there are several trends in land use change. Dryland agriculture expanded significantly, indicating an improvement in the pattern of agricultural land use. This condition suggests that regional development should focus more on potential and good spatial management.

TI  - Modeling Nitrogen Balance for Pre-Assessment of Surface and Groundwater Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><SUP>-</SUP>-N) Contamination from N-Fertilizer Application Loss: a Case of the Bilate Downstream Watershed Cropland
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient, but in excess amounts in the soil can cause significant water quality problems. Since nitrate is very soluble and is not retained by soil, it easily leaches into groundwater and contaminates it. Therefore, modeling nitrate concentration derived from N-fertilizer in the area where the land dominating crop coverage helps to ensure the security of soil and water and also the environmental sustainability actions in the agricultural watershed. Adding N-fertilizer without understanding the concentration of nitrates in the soil and neglecting responsibilities and lacking concern of excess application of nitrogen N fertilizers on agriculture can cause further problems on groundwater resources. In order to evaluate nitrate contamination on surface water and groundwater, estimating partial nitrogen balance (PNB) in crop land is essential. The objective of this study was to model the crop land partial nitrogen balance (PNB) for pre-assessment of nitrate contamination in the downstream of Bilate watershed crop land based on agricultural field N-fertilizer application loss in a scenario within Bilate watershed. The loss of agricultural nitrogen fertilizer in the Bilate watershed is one of the major factors that may contribute to nitrate contamination in the downstream water bodies in Bilate watershed. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) model with (EO-MODIS 250 m-NDVI) and time series cropland from (MODIS-MCD12Q1-IGBP of crop land class) has been utilized. Field crop data using GPS is collected from the upper, middle, and lower parts of watershed confirming the IGBP crop land classification (0.92 kappas) has scored. Additionally, the (MODIS 250 m-NDVI) data observation has been calibrated by the Google Earth Engine using a machine learning approach. Based on the FAO-Agricultural Stress Index System (ASIS), crop growth phonology curves value interval has been indexed, and simulated crop growth index has been validated for 0.25 min and 0.75 max crop growth curves. The results were utilized to replicate the time series heterogeneous crop pattern on crop land NDVI mean zonal statics. For last 20 years, a partial nitrogen balance for observed nitrogen application (Nkg/ha/year(-1)) and crop N uptake (Nkg/ha/year(-1)) is predicted. For the simulated outcome, the model has been verified for its linear correlation value of (R-2 of 0.9986). The idea underlying this research is based on the scientific fact that nitrogen (NO3--N) contamination of surface and subsurface water is unattainable without knowledge of the nitrogen level above the root zone to the particular crop zonal area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Water Quality Indicators in Koka Reservoir, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The science and application of the Earth observation system are receiving growing traction and wider application, and the scope is becoming wider and better owing to the availability of the higher resolution of satellite remote sensing products. A water quality monitoring model was developed using Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing data set to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of water quality indicators at Koka Reservoir. L1C images were processed with an Atmospheric correction processor ACOLITE. The months from June 2021 to May 2022 and the years 2017 to 2022 were used for the temporal analyses. Algorithms were developed by using regression analysis and developing empirical models by correlating satellite reflectance data with in situ Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), turbidity (TU), and Total suspended matter (TSS) measurements. All of the analyzed parameters have determination coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.67, indicating that they can be turned into predictive models. R-2 for the developed algorithms were 0.91, 0.92, and 0.67, indicating that good correlations have been found between field-based and estimated Chl-a, TU, and TSS, respectively. Accordingly, the mean monthly Chl-a, TU, and TSS levels have ranged from (59.69 to 144.25 g/L), (79.67 to 115.39 NTU), and (38.46 to 368.97 mg/L), respectively. The annual mean Chl-a, TU, and TSS vary from (52.86-96.19 mu g/L), (71.04-83 NTU), and (36.58-159.26 mg/L), respectively, showing that the reservoir has been continuously polluted over the last seven years. The spatial study found that the distributions of Chl-a, TU, and TSS were heterogeneous, with Chl-a being greater in the south and southwest, and TU and TSS being higher on the western shore of the reservoir. In conclusion, these results show that there are spatial as well as temporal variations on water quality parameters. The proposed algorithms are capable of detecting optically active water quality indicators and can be applied in similar environmental situations.

TI  - Comparison between random forest and support vector machine algorithms for LULC classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely chosen for classifying satellite images for mapping Earth's surface. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) stand out among these algorithms with their accurate results in the literature. The aim of this study is to analyze the performances of these algorithms on land use and land cover (LULC) classification, especially wetlands which have significant ecological functions. For this purpose, Sentinel-2 satellite image, which is freely provided by European Space Agency (ESA), was used to monitor not only the open surface water body but also around Marmara Lake. The performance evaluation was made with the increasing number of the training dataset. 3 different training datasets having 10, 15, and 20 areas of interest (AOI) per class, respectively were used for the classification of the satellite images acquired in 2015 and 2020. The most accurate results were obtained from the classification with RF algorithm and 20 AOIs. According to obtained results, the change detection analysis of Marmara Lake was investigated for possible reasons. Whereas the water body and wetland have decreased more than 50% between 2015 and 2020, crop sites have increased approximately 50%.

TI  - Assessment of the relationship of the salt-covered area and the groundwater storage/drought indicators in the disappearing Lake Tuz in Turkey (1985-2021)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to reveal the relationship of the expansion of the salt-covered area of Lake Tuz in Turkey with the drought in the region and the change of the groundwater storage. The changes in the salt-covered area in Lake Tuz between 1985 and 2021 (37 years), which have been obtained by August satellite images, are compared with those in groundwater and the 12-month Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) variations in the lake. The results show that the salt-covered area on the lake surface was most strongly correlated with the SPEI spring (-0.78, t test; p < 0.01) during the period of August 1985-2021, implying that the drought conditions in spring determines 62% of the salt-covered area on the lake in August. The groundwater storage (GWS) in June and July and the salt-covered area in August in Lake Tuz also depict a moderate correlation of -0.60 at 1% significance level from 1985 to 2021. The results illustrate that the SPEI and GWS values decreased, while the salt-covered area on the lake surface expanded in the Lake Tuz Basin over the past 37 years. The trends of the salt-covered area, SPEI, and GWS became especially pronounced after 1999, during which the SPEI change and similar changing trends appeared in the GWS and salt-covered area. These patterns of increase in drought severity and decreasing groundwater storage are expected to increasingly compromise the future of Lake Tuz and cause ecological and environmental problems in the near future.

TI  - The Use of Machine Learning and Satellite Imagery to Detect Roman Fortified Sites: The Case Study of Blad Talh (Tunisia Section)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on an ad hoc machine-learning method for locating archaeological sites in arid environments. Pleiades (P1B) were uploaded to the cloud asset of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment because they are not yet available on the platform. The average of the SAR data was combined with the P1B image in the selected study area called Blad Talh at Gafsa, which is located in southern Tunisia. This pre-desert region has long been investigated as an important area of Roman civilization (106 BCE). The results show an accurate probability map with an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 0.93 and 0.91, respectively, when validated with field survey data. The results of this research demonstrate, from the perspective of archaeologists, the capability of satellite data and machine learning to discover buried archaeological sites. This work shows that the area presents more archaeological sites, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. Remote sensing combined with machine learning algorithms provides an effective way to augment archaeological surveys and detect new cultural deposits.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of urbanization and unbalanced urban growth has attracted the attention of many urban planners and decision makers to the issues and consequences of urban population growth. In general, monitoring how urban areas are developed on a large scale is very important in order to plan urban development. However, in most cases, the lack of basic information in this area, especially in developing countries is one of the main obstacles to achieve this. With the development of human civilization and urbanization, the demand for artificial light has increased and this growth will continue. Found. Due to its lack of direct impact on daily life, light pollution has remained largely unknown and has rarely been studied. In this regard, the role of remote sensing techniques and data in identifying changes in the physical development of cities and changes in the amount of light is clearer than other methods. Using VIIRS satellite imagery, other satellite, digital and GIS data can measure and measure the physical growth of cities as well as the spatial and temporal distribution and extent of this type of pollution, and can even manage the risk of this pollution and Reach zoning. High-risk and dangerous areas. In this study, NPP images, travel time layer of Landsat 7 and 8 images have been used, which have been analyzed with the help of remote sensing and GIS techniques. The time frame considered in this study is 2012 to 2020.

TI  - A New Strategy to Fuse Remote Sensing Data and Geochemical Data with Different Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geochemical data can reflect geological features, making it one of the basic types of geodata that have been widely used in mineral exploration, environmental assessment, resource potential analysis and other research. However, final decisions regarding activities are often limited by the spatial accuracy of geochemical data. Geochemical sampling is sometimes difficult to conduct because of harsh natural and geographic conditions (e.g., mountainous areas with high altitude and complex terrain), meaning that only medium/low-precision survey data could be obtained, which may not be adequate for regional geochemical mapping and exploration. Modern techniques such as remote sensing could be used to address this issue. In recent decades, the development of remote sensing technology has provided a huge amount of earth observation data with high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions. The advantage of rapid acquisition of spatial and spectral information of large areas has promoted the broad use of remote sensing data in geoscientific research. Remote sensing data can help to differentiate various ground features by recording the electromagnetic response of the surface to solar radiation. Many problems that occur during the process of fusing remote sensing and geochemical data have been reported, such as the feasibility of existing fusion methods and low fusion accuracies that are less useful in practice. In this paper, a new strategy for integrating geochemical data and remote sensing data (referred to as ASTER data) is proposed; this strategy is achieved through linear regression as well as random forest and support vector regression algorithms. The results show that support vector regression can obtain better results for the available data sets and prove that the strategy currently proposed can effectively support the fusion of high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data (15 m) and low-spatial-resolution geochemical data (2000 m) in wide-range accurate geochemical applications (e.g., lithological identification and geochemical exploration).

TI  - Understanding spatial growth of the old city of Nanjing during 1850-2020 based on historical maps and Landsat data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The conservation and renewal of old cities has become one of the focuses of urban planning worldwide. It is crucial for the sustainable development of old cities to expound the growth process of the shape and texture and internal structure of old cities under different political systems from the perspective of spa-tial configuration. Based on historical maps and Landsat data, using the space syntax theory and GIS plat-form, this paper studies the urban growth process of the old city of Nanjing for about 170 years since the mid-Qing Dynasty. A finding in this study is that the old city of Nanjing is more capable of north-south growth than east-west growth. During the feudal era from 1850 to 1912, the urban center, population and built-up area of the old city of Nanjing were concentrated in the south of the city. After the founding of the Republic of China in 1912. The built-up area and NAIN core of the old city began to move north-ward. During the socialist era after 1949, urban growth sped up dramatically. The old city's NAIN core move northward to Xinjiekou-Gulou. This study proves the possibility of using historical maps and Landsat data to study urban growth and builds a framework for the study of the growth of traditional urban spatial forms in history, providing a theoretical reference for the conservation and revitalization of the old city of Nanjing and a method for the study of the spatial forms of other old cities.

TI  - Estimating the Economic Value of Ichan Kala Using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to estimate the use-value of Ichan Kala, a historical city located in Khiva, Uzbekistan, that is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. It also investigates the visitors' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the economic value of Ichan Kala. The survey was collected from 391 samples, and the factor analysis was done based on the results. After extracting two factors from 11 questions (variables), those factors were used as independent variables to check their impact on WTP. This study involved the contingent valuation method (CVM) to evaluate travelers' WTP for using Ichan Kala. The outcomes of this research are in line with economic theory, which remarks that visitors' willingness-to-pay declines as the suggested bid amount increases. In addition, the identity of cultural worldview (ICW) and tangibility of cultural worldview (TCW) showed a positive and significant effect on the WTP, while travel expenses did not remarkably affect the WTP. The results of this study provide practical implications for the government of the city or region when deciding on the entrance fee for using Ichan Kala. Moreover, this study makes an important contribution to the existent study since it is one of the few endeavors to estimate the WTP of the Central Asian inhabitants regarding the travel destination. Previous studies have estimated the use-value of destinations from Europe, the USA, and East Asia, but those studies mostly observed travelers from parallel countries. This research is therefore distinctive because both the travel site and survey sample was taken from Central Asia, specifically from Uzbekistan. This study reports the mindsets of Central Asian people towards paying the charge of using a travel destination; it may thereby function as a baseline study from which forthcoming studies may compare the behaviors of people living in this region with people living in other regions in terms of the estimation of non-market assets.

TI  - Relevance of UAV and sentinel-2 data fusion for estimating topsoil organic carbon after forest fire
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation at detailed spatial scale of soil status after severe fires may provide useful information on the recovery of burned forest ecosystems. Here, we aimed to assess the potential of combining multispectral imagery at different spectral and spatial resolutions to estimate soil indicators of burn severity. The study was conducted in a burned area located at the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). One month after fire, we measured soil burn severity in the field using an adapted protocol of the Composite Burn Index (CBI). Then, we performed soil sampling to analyze three soil properties potentially indicatives of fire-induced changes: mean weight diameter (MWD), soil moisture content (SMC) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Additionally, we collected post-fire imagery from the Sentinel-2A MSI satellite sensor (10-20 m of spatial resolution), as well as from a Parrot Sequoia camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; 0.50 m of spatial resolution). A Gram-Schmidt (GS) image sharpening technique was used to increase the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 bands and to fuse these data with UAV information. The performance of soil parameters as indicators of soil burn severity was determined trough a machine learning decision tree, and the relationship between soil indicators and reflectance values (UAV, Sentinel-2 and fused UAV-Sentinel-2 images) was analyzed by means of support vector machine (SVM) regression models. All the considered soil parameters decreased their value with burn severity, but soil moisture content, and, to a lesser extent, soil organic carbon discriminated at best among soil burn severity classes (accuracy = 91.18 %; Kappa = 0.82). The performance of reflectance values derived from the fused UAV-Sentinel-2 image to monitor the effects of wildfire on soil characteristics was outstanding, particularly for the case of soil organic carbon content (R2 = 0.52; RPD = 1.47). This study highlights the advantages of combining satellite and UAV images to produce spatially and spectrally enhanced images, which may be relevant for estimating main impacts on soil properties in burned forest areas where emergency actions need to be applied.

TI  - Interactions between Aquatic Plants and Cyanobacterial Blooms in Freshwater Reservoir Ecosystems
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and nutrient pollution are echoed by worldwide increasing trends in the frequency, duration, and toxicity of cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) blooms. Therefore, searching for the best options to mitigate blooms is relevant and timely. Aquatic vascular plants offer a promising solution through biological control. In this study, we use reservoirs regularly affected by intensive blooms (the Kyiv and Kaniv Reservoirs of the Dnipro River, Ukraine) to investigate whether macrophytes may inhibit or reduce the massive development of cyanobacteria. Special attention was paid to plants with floating leaves and free-floating plants since data on their effects on cyanobacteria are controversial. On the basis of field and satellite observations, the spatial distribution of cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophyte patches was assessed. Multispectral images captured by satellites Sentinel-2a (S2A) and Sentinel-2b (S2B) were used. In addition, based on data from field observations, a comparative analysis of phytoplankton and physical and chemical parameters between areas of the reservoirs overgrown and not overgrown by macrophytes was carried out. The obtained results indicate that in macrophyte patches phytoplankton structure differed from that observed in open waters. However, in areas of reservoirs dominated by floating-leaf plants or free-floating plants, a significant decrease in phytoplanktic or cyanobacterial biomass was not observed. This is most likely due to the fact that these macrophytes did not reduce the concentration of biogenic substances to a level that would limit cyanobacterial growth. On the contrary, intensive overgrowth of floating-leaf plants (in particular, Trapa natans) along the river sections of the reservoirs, as well as other factors, contributed to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment. Therefore, in the face of relevant nutrient supply, these ecological groups of macrophytes (floating-leaf plants and free-floating plants) have not shown statistically significant effectiveness in controlling the process of cyanobacterial blooms in reservoir ecosystems.

TI  - Ultrastaging of the Parametrium in Cervical Cancer: A Clinicopathological Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The rate of positive parametrial lymph nodes in a series of apparent early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing bilateral sentinel lymph node mapping was 3.1%. After ultrastaging of parametrial tissue, no occult micrometastasis was detected. Occult parametrial involvement in apparent early-stage cervical cancer might be overlooked with standard pathologic assessment. The primary endpoint of the present study was to assess the rate of positive parametrial lymph nodes and of microscopic continuous or discontinuous parametrial involvement. This is a retrospective, single-center, observational study including patients with FIGO 2018 stage IA1-IIA1 and IIIC1p in whom bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection and ultrastaging of SLN were performed according to institutional protocol, with surgery as primary treatment performed between May 2017 and February 2021, as well as type B2/C1/C2 (Querleu-Morrow) radical hysterectomy and usual histology (squamous cell, adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma). Thirty-one patients were included in the study period. Six (18.7%) patients had metastatic lymph nodes, of whom four had only SLN metastasis (two cases of ITC, one case of micrometastasis and one case of macrometastasis). We found a macroscopic deposit of cancer cells in the parametrial lymph node of one patient (3.1%). There was a positive statistical correlation between the incidence of parametrial lymph node involvement and the metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (p = 0.038). When performed per patient, the sensitivity, negative predictive value and accuracy of parametrial lymph node involvement in predicting pelvic lymph node metastasis were 16.7%, 83.3% and 83.9%, respectively. Ultrastaging of parametrial tissue did not identify any occult continuous or discontinuous parametrial metastasis. In conclusion, the incidence of lymph node parametrial involvement in a retrospective series of early-stage cervical cancer was 3.1% of all included patients. Lymph node involvement of the parametrium was associated with lymph node metastasis. The sensitivity of parametrial lymph node involvement to predict pelvic lymph node metastasis was low. The lack of parametrial involvement revealed by parametrial ultrastaging could be related to the number of patients with tumors with a pathologic diameter < 2 cm (54.8%). Further prospective studies are needed to analyze the role of parametrial ultrastaging in early-stage cervical cancer and to assess whether it can be considered the "sentinel" of the sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Current Status and Future Forecast of Short-lived Climate-Forced Ozone in Tehran, Iran, derived from Ground-Based and Satellite Observations
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the distribution and alterations of ozone concentrations in Tehran, Iran, in 2021 were investigated. The impacts of precursors (i.e., CO, NO2, and NO) on ozone were examined using the data collected over 12 months (i.e., January 2021 to December 2021) from 21 stations of the Air Quality Control Company (AQCC). The results of monthly heat mapping of tropospheric ozone concentrations indicated the lowest value in December and the highest value in July. The lowest and highest seasonal concentrations were in winter and summer, respectively. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between ozone and its precursors. The Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method was then implemented to obtain air pollution zoning maps. Then, ozone concentration modeled by the IDW method was compared with the average monthly change of total column density of ozone derived from Sentinel-5 satellite data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. A good agreement was discovered despite the harsh circumstances that both ground-based and satellite measurements were subjected to. The results obtained from both datasets showed that the west of the city of Tehran had the highest averaged O-3 concentration. In this study, the status of the concentration of ozone precursors and tropospheric ozone in 2022 was also predicted. For this purpose, the Box-Jenkins Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) approach was implemented to predict the monthly air quality parameters. Overall, it was observed that the SARIMA approach was an efficient tool for forecasting air quality. Finally, the results showed that the trends of ozone obtained from terrestrial and satellite observations throughout 2021 were slightly different due to the contribution of the tropospheric ozone precursor concentration and meteorology conditions.

TI  - Soil Moisture Change Detection with Sentinel-1 SAR Image for Slow Onsetting Disasters: An Investigative Study Using Index Based Method
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding physical processes in nature, including the occurrence of slow-onset natural disasters such as droughts and landslides, requires knowledge of the change in soil moisture between two points in time. The study was conducted on a relatively bare soil, and the change in soil moisture was examined with an index called Normalized radar Backscatter soil Moisture Index (NBMI) using Sentinel-1 satellite data. Along with soil moisture measured with a probe on the ground, a study of correlation with satellite imagery was conducted using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. Furthermore, the Dubois model was used to predict soil moisture. Results have shown that NBMI on a logarithmic scale provides a good representation of soil moisture change with R-2 similar to 86%. The MLR model showed a positive correlation of soil moisture with the co-polarized backscatter coefficient, but an opposite correlation with the surface roughness and angle of incidence. The results of the Dubois model showed poor correlation of 44.37% and higher RMSE error of 17.1, demonstrating the need for detailed and accurate measurement of surface roughness as a prerequisite for simulating the model. Of the three approaches, index-based measurement has been shown to be the most rapid for understanding soil moisture change and has the potential to be used for understanding some mechanisms of natural disasters under similar soil conditions.

TI  - Lessons from Shawshank: Outlaws, Lawmen and the Spectacle of Punishment
T2  - HUMANITIES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than a century, cinema has offered a rich source of images and narratives about crime and punishment. Unfortunately, the restricted nature of correctional environments and the social stigma surrounding incarceration leave most viewers reliant on media representations for the majority of their knowledge about correctional spaces. In most media representations of crime and punishment, outlaws and lawmen are reduced to stereotypical archetypes, and incarcerated characters are some of the evilest villains one will ever encounter. Moreover, the prison environment is painted as a playground for bad behavior, as penance for redeemable outlaws, or as an outright paradox that claims to reduce criminality despite appearing to increase it. Our uncritical acceptance of such characterizations goes hand in hand with our cultural addiction to mass incarceration. Limitless stories about uncontainable monsters perpetrating awful crimes inside cushy taxpayer funded facilities endorse a worldview where a permanently expanding and harshening prison system is vital to the safety of a functioning society. In short, our reliance on the spectacle of punishment has left us woefully and willfully misinformed about prison and those who wind up there.

TI  - Analysis of Post-Mining Vegetation Development Using Remote Sensing and Spatial Regression Approach: A Case Study of Former Babina Mine (Western Poland)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation of the post-mining areas is subject to constant and significant changes. Reclamation works, carried out after the cessation of mineral extraction, contribute to the intensive development of new plant species. However, secondary deformations, occurring even many years after the end of exploitation, may cause the degradation of the vegetation cover. It is, therefore, an important issue to identify changes in flora conditions and to determine whether and to what extent past mining has a negative impact on the plant cover state. The objectives of this research have been as follows: (1) analysis of the flora condition in the post-mining area in the 1989-2019 period, (2) identification of sites with significant changes in vegetation state, and (3) modeling of the relationship between the identified changes in vegetation and former mining activities. The research was carried out in the area of the former opencast and underground lignite mine "Friendship of Nations-Babina Shaft," which is located in the present-day Geopark (Western Poland), using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI derived vegetation indices (NDVI, NDII, MTVI2) and GIS-based spatial regression. The results indicate a general improvement in flora condition, especially in the vicinity of post-mining waste heaps and former opencast excavations, with the exception of the northwestern part of the former mining field where the values of all of the analyzed vegetation indices have decreased. Also, four zones of statistically significant changes in the flora condition were identified. Finally, the developed GWR models demonstrate that former mining activities had a significant influence on changes in the plant cover state of the analyzed region.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Using Intradermal Microbubble Sulfur Hexafluoride for Identification of Sentinel Lymph Nodes During Breast Cancer Surgery: A Clinical Trial
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedures have gained popularity in early breast cancer thanks to the reduction of surgical side-effects. The standard SLN mapping procedure uses 99mTc-nanocolloid human serum albumin with/without blue dye; limitations include logistical challenges and adverse reactions. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using sulfur hexafluoride has emerged as a promising technique for SLN mapping. Our study aimed to compare the CEUS technique with the standard isotope method. Materials and Methods: AX-CES, a prospective, monocentric, single-arm phase-3 study was designed (EudraCT: 2020-000393-20). Inclusion criteria were histologically diagnosed early breast cancer eligible for upfront surgery and SLN resection, bodyweight 40-85 kg, and no prior history of ipsilateral surgery or radiotherapy. All patients underwent CEUS prior to surgery and blue dye injection was performed in areas with contrast accumulation. After the experimental procedure, all patients underwent the standard mapping procedure and SLN frozen section assessment was performed. Data on the success rate, systemic reactions, mean procedure time, CEUS appearance, SLN number, and concordance with standard mapping procedure were collected. Results: Among 16 cases, a median of two SLNs were identified during CEUS. In all cases, at least one SLN was identified by CEUS (100%). In six cases, SLNs were classified during CEUS as abnormal, which was confirmed by definitive staining in four cases. After the standard mapping technique, in 15 out of the 16 cases (87.50%), at least one SLN from the standard mapping procedure was marked with blue dye in the CEUS procedure. In our series, sensitivity and specificity of SLN detection by CEUS were 75% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: CEUS is a safe and manageable intraoperative procedure. When compared with standard techniques, US appearance during CEUS may provide additional information when associated with histological assessment.

TI  - Exploring Spatial Distributions of Land Use and Land Cover Change in Fire-Affected Areas of Miombo Woodlands of the Beira Corridor, Central Mozambique
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Miombo woodlands (MW) are increasingly experiencing widespread land use and land cover change (LULCC). This study explores the influence of fire, agriculture, and slope variability on LULCC in the miombo of the Beira Corridor. Land use and land cover data were derived from three Landsat images for 2001, 2008, and 2018. Slope attributes were derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Monthly burned data of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to map fire frequency. The derived data were then used to investigate the relationship between LULCC and fire, agriculture, and slope, based on geographically weighted regression (GWR). In addition, the relationship between LULCC and slope was assessed. Our findings indicate that fire frequency, agriculture, and slope were significantly spatially non-stationary. We found that LULCC was negatively correlated with agriculture in open miombo, but positively correlated in dense miombo. A positive relationship between LULCC and fire was found for dense and open miombo. Changes in agriculture, dense miombo, and open miombo increased towards high slopes. The study improves the understanding of the spatial effect of LULCC drivers. The development and implementation of effective fire management actions is required to promote sustainable forest management and preservation of critical ecosystem services.

TI  - Comparison of Two Water Color Algorithms: Implications for the Remote Sensing of Water Bodies with Moderate to High CDOM or Chlorophyll Levels
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dominant wavelength and hue angle can be used to quantify the color of lake water. Understanding the water color is important because the color relates to the water quality and its related public perceptions. In this paper, we compared the accuracy levels of two methods in calculating dominant wavelength and hue angle values using simulated satellite data calculated from in situ reflectance hyperspectra for 325 lakes and rivers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The methods developed by van der Woerd and Wernand in 2015 and Wang et al. in 2015 were applied to simulated sensor data from the Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and Landsat 8 satellites. Both methods performed comparably when a correction algorithm could be applied, but the correction method did not work well for the Wang method at hue angles < 75 degrees, equivalent to levels of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM, a(440)) > similar to 2 m(-1) or chlorophyll > similar to 10 mg m(-3). The Sentinel-3 spectral bands produced the most accurate results for the van der Woerd and Wernand method, while the Landsat 8 sensor produced the most accurate values for the Wang method. The distinct differences in the shapes of the reflectance hyperspectra were related to the dominant optical water quality constituents in the water bodies, and relationships were found between the dominant wavelength and four water quality parameters, namely the Secchi depth, CDOM, chlorophyll, and Forel-Ule color index.

TI  - Dual-Encoder Transformer for Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Prediction Using Satellite Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The penetration of photovoltaic (PV) energy has gained a significant increase in recent years because of its sustainable and clean characteristics. However, the uncertainty of PV power affected by variable weather poses challenges to an accurate short-term prediction, which is crucial for reliable power system operation. Existing methods focus on coupling satellite images with ground measurements to extract features using deep neural networks. However, a flexible predictive framework capable of handling these two data structures is still not well developed. The spatial and temporal features are merely concatenated and passed to the following layer of a neural network, which is incapable of utilizing the correlation between them. Therefore, we propose a novel dual-encoder transformer (DualET) for short-term PV power prediction. The dual encoders contain wavelet transform and series decomposition blocks to extract informative features from image and sequence data, respectively. Moreover, we propose a cross-domain attention module to learn the correlation between the temporal features and cloud information and modify the attention modules with the spare form and Fourier transform to improve their performance. The experiments on real-world datasets, including PV station data and satellite images, show that our model achieves better results than other models for short-term PV power prediction.

TI  - Can Satellite Remote Sensing Assist in the Characterization of Yeasts Related to Biogeographical Origin?
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogeography is a key concept associated with microbial terroir, which is responsible for the differentiation and uniqueness of wines. One of the factors influencing this microbial terroir is the vegetation, which in turn is influenced by climate, soil, and cultural practices. Remote sensing instruments can provide useful information about vegetation. This study analyses the relationship between NDVI, calculated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite images of different veraison dates, and microbial data obtained in 2015 from 14 commercial (organic and conventional) vineyards belonging to four Designations of Origin (DOs) from Galicia (northwest Spain). Microbial populations in grapes and musts were identified using PCR techniques and confirmed by sequencing. Statistical analyses were made using PCA, CCA, TB-PLS, and correlation analyses. This study confirms that the NDVI is positively correlated with the diversity of yeasts, both in grapes' surface and must samples. Moreover, the results of this study show: (i) Sentinel-2 images, as well as Landsat-8 images, can establish differences in NDVI related to yeast terroir in grapes and musts, as it is the most relevant DO factor, (ii) Sentinel-2 NDVI and yeast biogeography are moderately to strongly correlated, (iii) Sentinel-2 achieved a better delimitation of the DOs than Landsat-8 and can establish more accurate differences in NDVI-yeast terroir correlations, and (iv) a higher NDVI was associated with the yeast biogeographical patterns of the DOs with higher species richness (S) consisting of weakly fermenting yeasts (Hanseniaspora uvarum, Pichia spp., Starmerella bacillaris, and Zygosaccharomyces spp). However, NDVI values did not correlate well with biogeographic patterns of yeasts previously studied at frequency level (proportion or percentage of each species) in each particular DO. This study suggests that satellite imagery has the potential to be a valuable tool for wine quality management and a decision-making instrument for DO regulators and winegrowers.

TI  - Reconstruction Methods in Oceanographic Satellite Data Observation-A Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Oceanographic parameters, such as sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface ice concentration, sea surface height, etc., are listed as Essential Climate Variables. Therefore, there is a crucial need for persistent and accurate measurements on a global scale. While in situ methods tend to be accurate and continuous, these qualities are difficult to scale spatially, leaving a significant portion of Earth's oceans and seas unmonitored. To tackle this, various remote sensing techniques have been developed. One of the more prominent ways to measure the aforementioned parameters is via satellite spacecraft-mounted remote sensors. This way, spatial coverage is considerably increased while retaining significant accuracy and resolution. Unfortunately, due to the nature of electromagnetic signals, the atmosphere itself and its content (such as clouds, rain, etc.) frequently obstruct the signals, preventing the satellite-mounted sensors from measuring, resulting in gaps-missing data-in satellite recordings. One way to deal with these gaps is via various reconstruction methods developed through the past two decades. However, there seems to be a lack of review papers on reconstruction methods for satellite-derived oceanographic variables. To rectify the lack, this paper surveyed more than 130 articles dealing with the issue of data reconstruction. Articles were chosen according to two criteria: (a) the article has to feature satellite-derived oceanographic data (b) gaps in satellite data have to be reconstructed. As an additional result of the survey, a novel categorising system based on the type of input data and the usage of time series in reconstruction efforts is proposed.

TI  - Estimating Afforestation Area Using Landsat Time Series and Photointerpreted Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation processes, natural and anthropogenic, involve the conversion of other land uses to forest, and they represent one of the most important land use transformations, influencing numerous ecosystem services. Although remotely sensed data are commonly used to monitor forest disturbance, only a few reported studies have used these data to monitor afforestation. The objectives of this study were two fold: (1) to develop and illustrate a method that exploits the 1985-2019 Landsat time series for predicting afforestation areas at 30 m resolution at the national scale, and (2) to estimate afforestation areas statistically rigorously within Italian administrative regions and land elevation classes. We used a Landsat best-available-pixel time series (1985-2019) to calculate a set of temporal predictors that, together with the random forests prediction technique, facilitated construction of a map of afforested areas in Italy. Then, the map was used to guide selection of an estimation sample dataset which, after a complex photointerpretation phase, was used to estimate afforestation areas and associated confidence intervals. The classification approach achieved an accuracy of 87%. At the national level, the afforestation area between 1985 and 2019 covered 2.8 +/- 0.2 million ha, corresponding to a potential C-sequestration of 200 million t. The administrative region with the largest afforested area was Sardinia, with 260,670 +/- 58,522 ha, while the smallest area of 28,644 +/- 12,114 ha was in Valle d'Aosta. Considering elevation classes of 200 m, the greatest afforestation area was between 400 and 600 m above sea level, where it was 549,497 +/- 84,979 ha. Our results help to understand the afforestation process in Italy between 1985 and 2019 in relation to geographical location and altitude, and they could be the basis of further studies on the species composition of afforestation areas and land management conditions.

TI  - Andean peatlands at risk? Spatiotemporal patterns of extreme NDVI anomalies, water extraction and drought severity in a large-scale mining area of Atacama, northern Chile
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Andes, multiple human and climatic factors threaten the conservation of bofedales, a type of high altitude peat forming wetland widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical Andes. In northern Chile, climate change and water extraction for industrial activities are among the most significant threats to these relevant socio-hydrological systems hosting indigenous pastoral communities. In this study, we present an integrated anal-ysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies, drought severity and water rights granted to industry to provide insight on the conservation status of bofedales, historical drivers of their transformation, and current threats. Using Landsat satellite imagery from 1986 to 2018, we identify spatio-temporal NDVI changes of 442 bofedales in one of the leading copper producing regions of the world. The NDVI time series analysis over 32 growing seasons was used to detect extreme anomalies, i.e. values outside the 95 % of the reference frequency distribution, indicating periods of extreme changes in the productivity of these high Andes wetlands. To evaluate the relationship between bofedales NDVI extreme periods to drought and continued water extraction activities, we combine a climate-based multi-temporal-scale drought index (SPEI) with the geospatial latitudinal distri-bution of water rights granted for extractive industries in the study area. Over the time period of analysis, the total amount of granted water rights increased 465 % from 1,201 l/s recorded before 1985 to 5,584 l/s in 2018. In the areas where the highest amount of water rights are concentrated, i.e. between 21.3 degrees S and 22.1 degrees S, "green" bofedales (NDVI>=0.23) are practically absent. NDVI of the austral summer (JFM) was highly correlated with the severity of drought occurring during the three months of the growing season peak. While our findings show bofedal productivity is mostly influenced by precipitation and temperature of the wet season (JFM) during the study period, results also raise questions regarding possible bofedal loss occurring over the previous 80 years prior to the satellite record, wherein water extraction activities have significantly increased according to official records.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Green spaces may be protective against COVID-19 incidence. They may provide outdoor, ventilated, settings for physical and social activities and therefore decrease transmission risk. We examined the association between neighborhood greenness and COVID-19-like illness incidence using individual-level data. Methods:The study population includes participants enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application in the United Kingdom and the United States (March-November 2020). All participants were encouraged to report their current health condition and suspected risk factors for COVID-19. We used a validated symptom-based classifier that predicts COVID-19-like illness. We estimated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), for each participant's reported neighborhood of residence for each month, using images from Landsat 8 (30 m(2)). We used time-varying Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age, country, and calendar month at study entry and adjusted for the individual- and neighborhood-level risk factors. Results:We observed 143,340 cases of predicted COVID-19-like illness among 2,794,029 participants. Neighborhood NDVI was associated with a decreased risk of predicted COVID-19-like illness incidence in the fully adjusted model (hazard ratio = 0.965, 95% confidence interval = 0.960, 0.970, per 0.1 NDVI increase). Stratified analyses showed protective associations among U.K. participants but not among U.S. participants. Associations were slightly stronger for White individuals, for individuals living in rural neighborhoods, and for individuals living in high-income neighborhoods compared to individuals living in low-income neighborhoods. Conclusions:Higher levels of greenness may reduce the risk of predicted COVID-19-like illness incidence, but these associations were not observed in all populations.

TI  - The Impacts of Assimilating Fengyun-4A Atmospheric Motion Vectors on Typhoon Forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs), known as cloud track winds, have positive impacts on global numerical weather forecasts (NWP). In this study, AMVs that were retrieved from Fengyun-2G and Fengyun-4A were compared in their data quality and impacts on the typhoon forecasts in order to investigate the differences between the first and second generation of the geostationary meteorological satellites of China. This report conducted data evaluation and assimilation-forecasting experiments on FY-2G and FY-4A atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs), respectively. The results showed that the AMVs data of FY-4A are of better quality than those of FY-2G and assimilating the AMVs of FY-2G and FY-4A have a neutral to slightly positive impacts on typhoon forecasts, which is quite encouraging for their operational use in the future.

TI  - Radiometric Normalization Using a Pseudo-Invariant Polygon Features-Based Algorithm with Contemporaneous Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 OLI Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As sensor parameters and atmospheric conditions create uncertainties for at-sensor radiation detection, radiometric consistency among satellite images is difficult to achieve. Relative radiometric normalization is a method that can improve multi-image consistency with accurate pseudo-invariant features (PIFs), especially over large areas or long time series satellite images. Although there are algorithms that manually or automatically select PIFs, the spatial mismatch of satellite images can affect PIF extraction, particularly with artificial pixels. To alleviate this problem, we proposed to use Landsat-8 OLI as the reference image and Sentinel-2A as the subject image, to apply pseudo-invariant features-based algorithms with polygon features through the single-band and multiple-band regression. Compared to pseudo-invariant point features, hyperspectral library, and histogram matching approaches, the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms with correlation coefficients of 0.9948 and 0.9945, and an RMSE of 0.0097 and 0.0095 with multiple- and single-band regression, respectively. We also found more accurate linear fitting and better shape matching through band scattering and reflectance frequency analysis. The proposed algorithms are a significant improvement in radiometric normalization, within artificial pixels, achieving spectral signature consistency.

TI  - Urban Tree Canopy Mapping Based on Double-Branch Convolutional Neural Network and Multi-Temporal High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of urban forest patterns contributes to well-managed urbanization, but accurate urban tree canopy mapping is still a challenging task because of the complexity of the urban structure. In this paper, a new method that combines double-branch U-NET with multi-temporal satellite images containing phenological information is introduced to accurately map urban tree canopies. Based on the constructed GF-2 image dataset, we developed a double-branch U-NET based on the feature fusion strategy using multi-temporal images to obtain an accuracy improvement with an IOU (intersection over union) of 2.3% and an F1-Score of 1.3% at the pixel level compared to the U-NET using mono-temporal images which performs best in existing studies for urban tree canopy mapping. We also found that the double-branch U-NET based on the feature fusion strategy has better accuracy than the early fusion strategy and decision fusion strategy in processing multi-temporal images for urban tree canopy mapping. We compared the impact of image combinations of different seasons on the urban tree canopy mapping task and found that the combination of summer and autumn images had the highest accuracy in the study area. Our research not only provides a high-precision urban tree canopy mapping method but also provides a direction to improve the accuracy both from the model structure and data potential when using deep learning for urban tree canopy mapping.

TI  - Characteristics and Drivers of Marine Heatwaves in 2021 Summer in East Korea Bay, Japan/East Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are persistent, discrete, extreme high-temperature events in the ocean, which can destructively affect marine ecosystems. Using satellite remote sensing data and reanalysis data from 1982 to 2021, we find that six indices characterizing the MHWs are in a remarkable increasing trend in the Japan/East Sea (JES), which shows that the most severe MHW events take place in the East Korean Bay (EKB) in the summer of 2021. Based on this finding, the present study focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of the MHWs in the EKB and its adjacent areas from June to August 2021. The analysis reveals that the total days and mean intensity of MHWs that occur in the EKB are 1.84 and 1.47 times more than those averaged in the JES, respectively. It is shown that mechanisms for the occurrences of the MHWs in the summer of 2021 are caused by the atmospheric high-pressure system moving to the EKB area. Other reasons also decrease the water cooling: the net positive lateral heat fluxes across open boundaries, and the weak sea surface wind over the EKB area. Other possible reasons which cause the summer MHW events in 2021 need the oceanic numerical models to further investigate the issue.

TI  - Urban Area Characterization and Structure Analysis: A Combined Data-Driven Approach by Remote Sensing Information and Spatial-Temporal Wireless Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of urban area function is crucial for urban development. Urban area function features can help to conduct better urban planning and transportation planning. With development of urbanization, urban area function becomes complex. In order to accurately extract function features, researchers have proposed multisource data mining methods that combine urban remote sensing and other data. Therefore, the research of efficient multisource data analysis tools has become a new hot topic. In this paper, a novel urban data analysis method combining spatiotemporal wireless network data and remote sensing data was proposed. First, a Voronoi-diagram-based method was used to divide the urban remote sensing images into zones. Second, we combined period and trend components of wireless network traffic data to mine urban function structure. Third, for multisource supported urban simulation, we designed a novel spatiotemporal city computing method combining graph attention network (GAT) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to analyze spatiotemporal urban data. The final results prove that our method performs better than other commonly used methods. In addition, we calculated the commuting index of each zone by wireless network data. Combined with the urban simulation conducted in this paper, the dynamic changes of urban area features can be sensed in advance for a better sustainable urban development.

TI  - Slope Scaling Effect and Slope-Conversion-Atlas for Typical Water Erosion Regions in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope has obvious scale-dependent characteristics and it changes with the change in DEM resolution, which brings uncertainty to the evaluation process of regional resource and environment. In this paper, one typical county in each of the six water erosion regions in China was selected as the sample area, respectively. Based on DEM data of ALOS DEM, ASTER GDEM and SRTM DEM with different spatial resolutions, slope characteristics, such as gradient, eigenvalue, frequency and cumulative frequency curves, were calculated by using the third-order inverse distance square weighted difference algorithm, to explore the ability of depicting terrain by these three DEM data. Based on the idea of geo-information map, the "surface-slope conversion atlas" under different resolutions was constructed to achieve the grading correction of slope extraction under low resolution. The results showed that: (1) with the resolution of DEM decreases, the slope information of each area tends to be more generalized and gradually concentrated. The slope frequency curve gradually changed from "tall and thin" to "short and fat", and the peak of the cumulative frequency curve moved to the low-slope area. Six sample areas showed different degrees of slope reduction. (2) In the process of slope grading correction, except for Maoxian, the proportion of low-resolution results converted to medium and low slope grades (0 degrees-25 degrees) is large. (3) The slope spectrum conversion method has a good correction effect on the errors generated by the slope extraction results of DEM90 and DEM30, and the correction rates reached 80% and 90%, respectively. A slope conversion atlas can effectively improve the expression ability of low-resolution DEM data on topography, which can provide a basis for regional resource and environment evaluation, and territorial space optimization.

TI  - Combining Spatiotemporally Global and Local Interpolations Improves Modeling of Annual Land Surface Temperature Cycles
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual temperature cycle (ATC) models are widely used to characterize temporally continuous land surface temperature (LST) dynamics within an annual cycle. However, the existing ATC models ignore the spatiotemporally local correlations among adjacent LST pixels and are inadequate for capturing the complex relationships between LSTs and LST-related descriptors. To address these issues, we propose an improved ATC model (termed the ATC_GL), which combines both the spatiotemporally global and local interpolations. Using the random forest (RF) algorithm, the ATC_GL model quantifies the complex relationships between LSTs and LST-related descriptors such as the surface air temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and digital elevation model. The performances of the ATC_GL and several extensively used LST reconstruction methods were compared under both clear-sky and overcast conditions. In the scenario with randomly missing LSTs, the accuracy of the ATC_GL was 2.3 K and 3.1 K higher than that of the ATCE (the enhanced ATC model) and the ATCO (the original ATC model), respectively. In the scenario with LST gaps of various sizes, the ATC_GL maintained the highest accuracy and was less sensitive to gap size when compared with the ATCH (the hybrid ATC model), Kriging interpolation, RSDAST (Remotely Sensed Daily Land Surface Temperature), and HIT (Hybrid Interpolation Technique). In the scenario of overcast conditions, the accuracy of the ATC_GL was 1.0 K higher than that of other LST reconstruction methods. The ATC_GL enriches the ATC model family and provides enhanced performance for generating spatiotemporally seamless LST products with high accuracy.

TI  - Special Issue Review: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications in Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Remote sensing is used in an increasingly wide range of applications. Models and methodologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) are commonly used to increase the performance of remote sensing technologies. Deep learning (DL) models are the most widely researched AI-based models because of their effectiveness and high performance. Therefore, we organized a Special Issue on remote sensing titled "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications in Remote Sensing." In this paper, we review nine articles included in this Special Issue, most of which report studies based on satellite data and DL, reflecting the most prevalent trends in remote sensing research, as well as how DL architecture and the functioning of DL models can be analyzed and explained is a hot topic in AI research. DL methods can outperform conventional machine learning methods in remote sensing; however, DL remains a black box and understanding the details of the mechanisms through which DL models make decisions is difficult. Therefore, researchers must continue to investigate how explainable DL methods for use in the field of remote sensing can be developed.

TI  - Uncommonly known change characteristics of land use pattern in Guangdong Province-Hong Kong-Macao, China: Space time pattern, terrain gradient effects and policy implication
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies on land use have largely focused on characteristics of quota allocation and spatial distribution based on time series analysis. However, indwelling patterns, combined space-time characteristics and terrain gradient effects are often hidden from the regional territorial spatial planning process. By using spatial econometric techniques, including hot spot analysis, landscape theory, a space-time cube model and a terrain-niche index, this paper aimed to assist regional planning by revealing these hidden characteristics in Guangdong Province, China. The results were as follows: urban construction land had formed an agglomerated region at the center of the study area, surrounded by many smaller satellite cities, which resembled a mainland-island metapopulation pattern. Three hot spot types-oscillating (32.45 % of the region), sporadic (1.85 %) and persistent (6.83 %)-formed the main space-time pattern throughout the study period. The main patterns included persistent hot spots in the Pearl River Delta, approximating a strip pattern of sporadic and oscillating hot spots from the east to west, with persistent cold spots in the north. Dry land cropping showed an increase in area at terrain levels 3-6 while in other terrains the area of dry land cropping decreased over time. These findings indicate that more attention needs to be paid to maintaining or adjusting the shape and equilibrium between the mainland and the island cities in the future. Steeper terrain is normally considered for cropland when conflicts exist for land use, which might decrease cropland quality to some extent. Hence, current territorial and spatial planning should focus on changing spatial disequilibrium and the reduction in cropland quality, which might result from the land policy of "superior occupation and inferior compensation", to slow regional differences and to achieve sustainable development.

TI  - Monitoring Land Degradation through Vegetation Dynamics Mathematical Modeling: Case of Jornada Basin (in the US)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid ecosystems are known to be sensitive to climate change. The Jornada Basin in the USA, as one representative of arid land, has suffered from land degradation in recent decades. In order to disentangle the climate-vegetation feedback, we analyzed the vegetation dynamics under the effects of climate change via a mathematical model based on the reaction-diffusion mechanism. Using this model, we conducted a sensitive analysis of climate factors and concluded that the ecosystem might experience a catastrophic shift with the climatic deterioration. We considered the non-local interaction term to explain the competition among plants. Additionally, the PLR (power law range) metric was used to quantify the extent of the degradation and to compare the results of the vegetation patterns from the remote sensing data and the simulations. From the results, this model could simulate the trends of land degradation in this area. We found that the land degradation could be mainly attributed to climate changes in recent years. This approach suggests that vegetation patterns can provide hints as to whether the ecosystem is approaching desertification. These results can help with mapping vulnerable arid areas around the world through model simulation and satellite images.

TI  - Regional Quantitative Mineral Prospectivity Mapping of W, Sn, and Nb-Ta Based on Integrated Information in Rwanda, Central Africa
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the need to discovers new mineral deposits and occurrences has intensified in recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that we need to map potentials via integrated information on the basis of metallogeny. Occurrences of mineralization such as tungsten (W), tin (Sn), columbium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), gold (Au), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) and monazite (Mnz) have been discovered in Rwanda. The objective of this study was to present a regional quantitative mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) of W, Sn and Nb-Ta mineralization in Rwanda using the random forest (RF) method on the basis of open source data, such as geological maps, Bouguer gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies, Landsat 8 images, ASTER GDEM, Globeland30, and OpenStreetMap. In addition, a newly introduced interpolation-density-delineation (IDD) process was applied to deal with the blank (masked) areas in remotely sensed mineral alteration extraction. Additionally, a k(2)-fold cross-validation method was also proposed to obtain more reasonable test errors. Firstly, the metallogenic regularity of W, Sn and Nb-Ta in Rwanda was summarized with the help of articles online. Secondly, original geological, geophysical, and remote sensing data were utilized to generate secondary data. Specifically, the IDD process was applied subsequent to the directed principal component analysis method (DPCA) to reconstruct the alteration anomaly map, and a relevant dataset was formed by the combination of original and secondary data. Thirdly, specific predictor layers for W, Sn and Nb-Ta were selected from relevant data via spatial correlation with known deposits, respectively, and the predictive models were established. Finally, near 26,000 squares were zoned in Rwanda, and RF was optimized and applied, the k(2)-fold cross-validation method was utilized to assess test errors, metallogenic belts and prospective areas for W, Sn, and Nb-Ta were delineated on the basis of total mineralization potential map and likelihoods map. Results proved that the open source data online were valid for drawing a preliminary mineralization potential map. Furthermore, it was also shown that the IDD method is suitable for the postprocessing of masked alteration anomaly maps. Belt IV-4 in the northwest and belt IV-2, IV-1 in the middle-east of Rwanda, containing a number of prospective areas, possess considerable likelihoods of deposits, and mining in Rwanda is at its dawn, with potential worth expecting.

TI  - A Simplified Coastline Inflection Method for Correcting Geolocation Errors in FengYun-3D Microwave Radiation Imager Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave (PMW) sensors are popularly applied to Earth observations. However, the satellite PMW radiometer data sometimes have non-negligible errors in geolocation. Coastline inflection methods (CIMs) are widely used to improve geolocation errors of PMW images. However, they commonly require accuracy satellite flight parameters, which are difficult to obtain by users. In this study, a simplified coastline inflection method (SCIM) is proposed to correct the geolocation errors without demanding for the satellite flight parameters. SCIM is applied to improve geolocation errors of FengYun-3D (FY-3D) Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) brightness temperature images from 2018 and 2019. It reduces the geolocation errors of MWRI images to 0.15 pixels in the along-track and cross-track direction. This means reductions of 75% and 86% of the geolocation errors, respectively. The mean brightness temperature differences between the ascending and descending MWRI images are reduced by 34%, demonstrating the improved geolocation accuracy of SCIM. The corrected images are also used to estimate Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC). By comparing with SICs retrieved from the un-corrected images, the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the SICs from the corrected images are reduced from 13.7% to 10.2% and 8.9% to 6.9%, respectively. The mean correlation coefficient (R) increases from 0.91 to 0.95. All these results indicate that SCIM can reduce geolocation errors of satellite-based PMW images significantly. As SCIM is very simple and easy to be applied, it could be a useful method for users of PMW images.

TI  - Mapping China?s planted forests using high resolution imagery and massive amounts of crowdsourced samples
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree planting has been suggested as a potentially effective solution for mitigating climate change. China has implemented the world's largest afforestation and reforestation project since the 1970s, but high-resolution maps of China's planted forests remain unavailable. In this study, we explored the use of multi-source remote sensing images and crowdsourced samples to produce the first high-resolution (30-m) map of China's planted forests. We constructed a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-based mapping framework using spectral, temporal, structural, textural and topographic features derived from Landsat and Sentinel-1 time series imagery, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Chinese Forest Canopy Height (CFCH) data. Over 300,000 high-quality crowdsourced samples were collected for training the mapping pipeline. Validation against independent field samples indicated an accuracy of 84.93 % and an F1 score of 0.85. The uncertainty map of each pixel was also constructed and showed that the areas of low and medium uncertainties accounted for 38.27 % and 50.98 % of the total area, respectively, indicating the high estimation reliabilities of the planted forest map. We show that China's planted forests in the year of 2020 had a total area of 769853.01 km2, accounting for 31.30 % of the world's total planted forests. The majority (77.45 %) of China's planted forests were located in the Eastern, Center-South, and Southwestern regions. By further assessing the performance of the image features used to map the planted forests, we found that temporal features are key to identifying the planted forests in East and Center-South of China, where they are mainly timber plantations. However, structural and textural features were more useful for locating the planted forests in North and Northeast of China, where are dominated by planted shelterbelts. Our study demonstrated that combining crowdsourced samples with high-resolution satellite images allows mapping planted forests with unprecedented resolution (30-m) across large areas. Our map could contribute to the sustainable management of China's forests and a more accurate quantification of the carbon balance of China's natural ecosystems.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of 10-m Resolution TVDI Based on Downscaled LST to Monitor Soil Moisture in Tang River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter in hydrological research and drought management. The inversion of soil moisture based on land surface temperature (LST) and NDVI triangular feature spaces has been widely used in various studies. Remote sensing provides regional LST data with coarse spatial resolutions which are insufficient for field scale (tens of meters). In this study, we bridged the data gap by adopting a Data Mining Sharpener algorithm to downscale MODIS thermal data with Vis-NIR imagery from Sentinel-2. To evaluate the downscaling algorithm, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) equipped with a thermal sensor was used to capture the ultra-fine resolution LST at three sites in the Tang River Basin in China. The obtained fine-resolution LST data were then used to calculate the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) for soil moisture monitoring. Results indicated that downscaled LST data from satellites showed spatial patterns similar to UAS-measured LST, although discrepancies still existed. Based on the fine-resolution LST data, a 10-m resolution TVDI map was generated. Significant negative correlations were observed between the TVDI and in-situ soil moisture measurements (Pearson's r of -0.67 and -0.71). Overall, the fine-resolution TVDI derived from the downscaled LST has a high potential for capturing spatial soil moisture variation.

TI  - Ontological Adaptation in Transition to Adulthood A Theoretical Framework for Integrating Phenomenology and Neuroscience in Psychosis Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - In this theoretical review, the neurodevelopmental model of psychotic disorders is considered within the framework of ontological development, referring to the individual-level construction of a sense of reality regarding identity and worldview. Following Erikson's theory of development, the challenge of forging a personal and social identity is a developmental process typical of late adolescence and early adulthood. Accompanying this process is a developmentally normal increase in exploratory and risk-taking behavior, which sometimes includes challenging and defying cultural norms. Although many aspects of ontological adaptation are developmentally appropriate, we argue that psychopathology such as psychosis can be rooted in an abnormal deviation of this process, in which aberrant salience accelerates the typical drive to develop a meaningful sense of identity, leading to delusion formation. By placing psychosis onset within a broader context of normal development, this model offers a humanistic approach for understanding experiences of new onset of psychotic disorders.

TI  - Impact of Surgical Care Bundle on Surgical Site Infection after Non-Reconstructive Breast Cancer Surgery: A Single-Centre Retrospective Comparative Cohort Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Wound infection or so-called surgical-site infection (SSI) is a common occurrence after surgery. For some breast cancer patients, these infections can lead to delays in starting their onward systemic treatments such as chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy after surgery. More importantly, treatment delays in patients can lead to worsened overall survival. SSIs also have considerable negative impacts on financial and staffing resources in healthcare. The World Health Organization has recommended the usage of a surgical care bundle (SCB), which is a group of preventative measures that are effective in reducing SSIs. However, the impact of care bundles on SSIs has not been well documented in the context of breast cancer surgery. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the outcomes of SSI following the implementation of a surgical care bundle protocol for non-reconstructive breast cancer surgery. Background: Surgical-site infections (SSIs) are the commonest cause of healthcare-related infections. Although a surgical care bundle (SCB), defined as a group of preventative measures, is effective in reducing SSIs, it has not been well documented in breast cancer surgery. We aimed to investigate the impact of SCB on SSI. Methods: A single-centre retrospective comparative cohort study between 2016 and 2020 was carried out. An SCB including eight different measures was implemented in October 2018 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden. Patients who underwent non-reconstructive breast cancer surgery were included for analysis. The primary endpoint was SSI within 30 days after surgery. Results: Overall, 10.4% of patients (100/958) developed SSI. After SCB implementation, the overall SSI rate reduced from 11.8% to 8.9% (p = 0.15). The largest SSI rate reduction was seen in the subgroup that underwent breast conservation and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), from 18.8% to 9.8% (p = 0.01). In this multivariable analysis adjusting for patient and treatment factors, the implementation of SCB resulted in a statistically significant reduction in SSI risk (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.99, p = 0.04). Conclusions: The implementation of a SCB could reduce the incidence of SSI in breast cancer surgery.

TI  - Vegetation Fuel Mapping at Regional Scale Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and DEM Derivatives-The Case of the Region of East Macedonia and Thrace, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of Mediterranean ecosystems, even if previously shaped by fire, is threatened by the diverse changes observed in the wildfire regime, in addition to the threat to human security and infrastructure losses. During the two previous years, destructive, extreme wildfire events have taken place in southern Europe, raising once again the demand for effective fire management based on updated and reliable information. Fuel-type mapping is a critical input needed for fire behavior modeling and fire management. This work aims to employ and evaluate multi-source earth observation data for accurate fuel type mapping in a regional context in north-eastern Greece. Three random forest classification models were developed based on Sentinel-2 spectral indices, topographic variables, and Sentinel-1 backscattering information. The explicit contribution of each dataset for fuel type mapping was explored using variable importance measures. The synergistic use of passive and active Sentinel data, along with topographic variables, slightly increased the fuel type classification accuracy (OA = 92.76%) compared to the Sentinel-2 spectral (OA = 81.39%) and spectral-topographic (OA = 91.92%) models. The proposed data fusion approach is, therefore, an alternative that should be considered for fuel type classification in a regional context, especially over diverse and heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperature Gradients Estimation Using Top-of-Atmosphere Observations from the ESA Earth Explorer 10 Harmony Mission: Preliminary Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Harmony satellite mission was recently approved as the next European Space Agency (ESA) Earth Explorer 10. The mission science objectives cover several applications related to solid earth, the cryosphere, upper-ocean dynamics and air-sea interactions. The mission consists of a constellation of two satellites, flying with the Copernicus Sentinel 1 (C or D) spacecraft, each hosting a C-band receive-only radar and a thermal infrared (TIR) payload. From an ocean dynamics/air-sea interaction perspective, the mission will provide the unique opportunity to observe simultaneously the signature of submesoscale upper-ocean processes via synthetic aperture radar and TIR imagery. The TIR imager is based on microbolometer technology and its acquisitions will rely on four channels: three narrow-band channels yielding observations at a?1 km spatial sampling distance (SSD) and a panchromatic (PAN, 8-12 mu m) channel characterized by a ? 300 m SSD. Our study investigates the potential of Harmony in retrieving spatial features related to sea surface temperature (SST) gradients from the high-resolution PAN channel, relying on top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. Compared to a standard SST gradient retrieval, our approach does not require atmospheric correction, thus avoiding uncertainties due to inter-channel co-registration and radiometric consistency, with the possibility of exploiting the higher resolution of the PAN channel. The investigations were carried out simulating the future Harmony TOA radiances (TARs), as well as relying on existing state-ofthe-art level 1 satellite products. Our approach enables the correct description of SST features at the sea surface avoiding the generation of spurious features due to atmospheric correction and/or instrumental issues. In addition, analyses based on existing satellite products suggest that the clear sky TOA observations, in a typical mid-latitude scene, allow the reconstruction of up to 85% of the gradient magnitudes found at the sea-surface level. The methodology is less efficient in tropical areas, suffering from smoothing effects due to the high concentrations of water vapor.

TI  - INTEGRATING LIDAR DATA, 2D HEC-RAS MODELING AND REMOTE SENSING TO DEVELOP FLOOD HAZARD MAPS DOWNSTREAM OF A LARGE RESERVOIR IN THE INNER EASTERN CARPATHIANS
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of 1D, 2D, and 1D/2D modelling techniques to identify flood prone areas is a critical component of any flood hazard management project (e.g., APDF - action plan for dam failure) in the proximity of big dams and reservoirs. In this work, we manage to computed flood hazard models using 2D HEC-RAS module based on Digital Elevation Models (DEM's) derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and pre-and post-processed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based software (e.g., ArcGIS, HEC-RAS). Therefore, to produce urban flood hazard (FH) maps downstream of the Stramtori-Firiza reservoir (S-Fr) in NW Romania, a multi-scenario approach based on LiDAR-derived DEM integration, 2D hydraulic modeling, and remote sensing (RS) data validation is provided. In this context, to assess the flood control capacity (FCC) of the S-Fr hydro-technical system, three flood tests based on S-Fr flow rate with 5% (167 m3/s), 1% (270 m3/s) and 0.1% (447 m3/s) return periods were performed. The flood impact within the urban area of Baia Mare located downstream of S-Fr was achieved for each flood scenarios using four spatial data derived from the RAS Mapper module: flood extent (FE), flood depth (FD), flood velocity (FV) and flood hazard (FH). The results indicate that a large area of Baia Mare city can be affected by a potential flood caused by a dam failure and also contribute to the APDF update of S-Fr dam.

TI  - A Review of the Far-Reaching Usage of Low-Light Nighttime Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - To assess the current and future utility of low-light satellite data, this paper reviewed 1630 papers, presentations, theses, and dissertations using day/night band (DNB) data from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) imager and its precursor, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan system (DMSP-OLS) series from the 1970s through to the year 2021. By the way of a categorical system, we take inventory of the myriad applications of these data to a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from social to natural science, oceans to atmosphere, and biology to civil engineering. Papers from social science fields dominate this spectrum, pointing to the unique aspect of low-light observations in their ability to observe aspects of human civilization at night. We also look at the stratification between applications using natural vs. artificial light, the use of moonlight, and the context of the key earth climate system elements. In light of these findings, a discussion is provided for the future of low-light measurements. Since the start of the VIIRS series, there has been a rapid increase in interest in the use of these data for numerous fields, pointing towards a nascent field centered on the nocturnal earth system science that is enabled by these novel and newly quantifiable measurements. This study is of significant importance in evaluating current uses of low-light data and possible architecture solutions for next-generation satellites.

TI  - Personalized Sentinel Node Mapping in Endometrial Cancer by the Indocyanine Green Implementation as Single Tracer: A Case Control Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective was to analyze the rate of bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in endometrial cancer using indocyanine green (ICG) as a unique tracer compared to Technetium99 + ICG. As secondary objectives, we analyzed the drainage pattern and factors that might affect the oncological outcomes. A case-control ambispective study was carried out on consecutive patients at our center. Data on the SLN biopsy with ICG collected prospectively were compared to retrospective data on the use of a double-tracer technique including Technetium99 + ICG. In total, 194 patients were enrolled and assigned to both groups, in which the group with both tracers (controls) included 107 (54.9%) patients and the ICG-alone group (cases) included 87 (45.1%) patients. The rate of bilateral drainage was significantly higher in the ICG group (98.9% vs. 89.7%; p = 0.013). The median number of nodes retrieved was higher in the control group (three vs. two nodes; p < 0.01). We did not find survival differences associated with the tracer used (p = 0.85). We showed significant differences in terms of disease-free survival regarding the SLN location (p < 0.01), and obturator fossa retrieved nodes showed better prognosis compared to external iliac. The use of ICG as a single tracer for SLN detection in endometrial cancer patients seemed to obtain higher rates of bilateral detection with similar oncological outcomes.

TI  - Extraction of Information on the Flooding Extent of Agricultural Land in Henan Province Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sudden flood disasters cause serious damage to agricultural production. Rapidly extracting information such as the flooding extent of agricultural land and capturing the influence of flooding on crops provides important guidelines for estimating the flood-affected area, promoting post-disaster farmland restoration, and providing an auxiliary decision-making basis for flood prevention and disaster relief departments. Taking the flood event in Henan and Shanxi Provinces as example, based on the characteristics of the variations in radar data and optical data before and after the disaster, we propose an extent information extraction method for the flood inundation area and the flood-affected area of agricultural land. This method consists of change detection, threshold extraction, and superposition analysis, which weakens the negative impact of the radar data speckle noise and cloud contamination of the optical data on the extraction of the agricultural land flooding to a certain extent. The method was developed based on a flood event in Henan Province and validated in Shanxi Province. The results show that the production of this method have a clear boundary and accurate extent, and the overall precisions of the flood inundation area and flood-affected area extraction are 0.87 and 0.92, respectively. The proposed method combines the advantages of both radar and optical remote sensing data in extracting the specific extents of the flood inundation area and the flood-affected area in large spatial scale. Finally, the impact of time window size to the performance of the method is further analyzed. In the application of the proposed method, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides a low-cost, fast, and convenient way to extract flood information from remote sensing data. The proposed scheme provides a scientific data basis for restoring production of agricultural land after a flood disaster, as well as for national post-disaster damage assessment and disaster relief decision making.

TI  - The Spatio-Temporal Variability in the Radiative Forcing of Light-Absorbing Particles in Snow of 2003-2018 over the Northern Hemisphere from MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-absorbing particles (LAPs) deposited on snow can significantly reduce surface albedo and contribute to positive radiative forcing. This study firstly estimated and attributed the spatio-temporal variability in the radiative forcing (RF) of LAPs in snow over the northern hemisphere during the snow-covered period 2003-2018 by employing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, coupled with snow and atmospheric radiative transfer modelling. In general, the RF for the northern hemisphere shows a large spatial variability over the whole snow-covered areas and periods, with the highest value (12.7 W m(-2)) in northeastern China (NEC) and the lowest (1.9 W m(-2)) in Greenland (GRL). The concentration of LAPs in snow is the dominant contributor to spatial variability in RF in spring (similar to 73%) while the joint spatial contributions of snow water equivalent (SWE) and solar irradiance (SI) are the most important (>50%) in winter. The average northern hemisphere RF gradually increases from 2.1 W m(-2) in December to 4.1 W m(-2) in May and the high-value area shifts gradually northwards from mid-altitude to high-latitude over the same period, which is primarily due to the seasonal variability of SI (similar to 58%). More interestingly, our data reveal a significant decrease in RF over high-latitude Eurasia (HEUA) of -0.04 W m(-2) a(-1) and northeastern China (NEC) of -0.14 W m(-2) a(-1) from 2003 to 2018. By employing a sensitivity test, we find the concurrent decline in the concentration of LAPs in snow accounted for the primary responsibility for the decrease in RF over these two areas, which is further confirmed by in situ observations.

TI  - High spatial resolution solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and its relation to rainfall precipitation across Brazilian ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) by remote sensing has opened new perspectives on ecosystem studies and other related aspects such as photosynthesis. In general, fluorescence high-resolution studies were limited to proximal sensors, but new approaches were developed to improve SIF resolution by combining OCO-2 with MODIS orbital observations, improving its resolution from 0.5 degrees to 0.05 on a global scale. Using a high-resolution dataset and rainfall data some SIF characteristics of the satellite were studied based across 06 contrasting ecosystems in Brazil: Amazonia, Caatinga, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Pampa, and Pantanal, from years 2015-2018. SIF spatial variability in each biome presented significant spatial variability structures with high R-2 values (>0.6, Gaussian models) in all studied years. The rainfall maps were positively and similar related to SIF spatial distribution and were able to explain more than 40% of SIF's spatial variability. The Amazon biome presented the higher SIF values (>0.4 W m(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1)) and also the higher annual rainfall precipitation (around 2000 mm), while Caatinga had the lowest SIF values and precipitations (<0.1 W m(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1), precipitation around 500 mm). The linear relationship of SIF to rainfall across biomes was mostly significant (except in Pantanal) and presented contrasting sensitivities as in Caatinga SIF was mostly affected while in the Amazon, SIF was lesser affected by precipitation events. We believe that the features presented here indicate that SIF could be highly affected by rainfall precipitation changes in some Brazilian biomes. Combining rainfall with SIF allowed us to detect the differences and similarities across Brazil's biomes improving our understanding on how these ecosystems could be affected by climate change and severe weather conditions.

TI  - The Effect of Short-Term Upwelling Events on Fish Assemblages at the South-Eastern Coast of the Baltic Sea
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple stressors, such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, biological invasions etc., are affecting fish communities, and thus can have versatile effects on marine ecosystems and socio-economic activities as well. Understanding the changes in the fish community structure is ecologically and economically important, yet a very complex issue, requiring comprehensive analysis of multiple factors. The role of regional oceanographic variability, namely, coastal upwelling, is often neglected when it comes to the analysis of fish assemblages. In this perspective, we were aiming, for the first time in the Baltic Sea, to assess the upwelling influence on fish communities and fish community-based ecological indices used under Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The study covered a long-term period (2000-2019) for upwelling identified by satellite data analysis and fish gillnet surveys, performed in three distinct locations in the coastal waters of the SE Baltic Sea. Overall, our study revealed that temporal dynamics of fish abundance and community composition were associated with the presence of coastal upwelling. The study outcomes suggest that the fish community was more diverse and a higher number of some fish species was observed before upwelling. During upwelling, there was more evident dominance of 1-2 main marine fish species. Through the changes in fish abundance and species composition upwelling was also responsible for the changes in fish community structure-based indices for marine environment status, i.e., in the majority of the cases a decrease in Trophic, Piscivorous Fish, and Diversity indices were observed. Our study demonstrates that upwelling can affect both, the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of coastal fish communities, therefore, it is important to consider this when predicting shifts in the distribution of fish stocks or assessing environmental status indicators, especially under changing climate. We believe that our approach adds novel information to the study of coastal ecosystems of the Baltic Sea and is important for better management of socio-economic activities in the coastal zone.

TI  - Bibliometric and Social Network Analysis on the Use of Satellite Imagery in Agriculture: An Entropy-Based Approach
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery is gaining popularity as a valuable tool to lower the impact on natural resources and increase profits for farmers. The purpose of this study is twofold: to mine the scientific literature to reveal the structure of this research domain, and to investigate to what extent scientific results can reach a wider public audience. To meet these two objectives, a Web of Science and a Twitter dataset were retrieved and analysed, respectively. For the academic literature, different performances of various countries were observed: the USA and China resulted as the leading actors, both in terms of published papers and employed researchers. Among the categorised keywords, "resolution", "Landsat", "yield", "wheat" and "multispectral" are the most used. Then, analysing the semantic network of the words used in the various abstracts, the different facets of the research in satellite remote sensing were detected. The importance of retrieving meteorological parameters through remote sensing and the broad use of vegetation indexes emerged from these analyses. As emerging topics, classification tasks for land use assessment and crop recognition stand out, alongside the use of hyperspectral sensors. Regarding the interaction of academia with the public, the analysis showed that it is practically absent on Twitter: most of the activity therein stems from private companies advertising their business. This shows that there is still a communication gap between academia and actors from other societal sectors.

TI  - Positive effects of projected climate change on post-disturbance forest regrowth rates in northeastern North American boreal forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest anthropogenic and natural stand-replacing disturbances are increasing worldwide due to global change. Many uncertainties regarding the regeneration and growth of these young forests remain within the context of changing climate. In this study, we investigate the effects of climate, tree species composition, and other landscape-scale environmental variables upon boreal forest regrowth following clearcut logging in eastern Canada. Our main objective was to predict the effects of future climate changes upon post-logging forest height regrowth at a subcontinental scale using high spatial resolution remote sensing data. We modeled forest canopy height (estimated from airborne laser scanning [LiDAR] data over 20 m resolution virtual plots) as a function of time elapsed since the last clearcut along with climate (i.e. temperature and moisture), tree species composition, and other environmental variables (e.g. topography and soil hydrology). Once trained and validated with similar to 240 000 plots, the model that was developed in this study was used to predict potential post-logging canopy height regrowth at 20 m resolution across a 240 000 km(2) area following scenarios depicting a range of projected changes in temperature and moisture across the region for 2041-2070. Our results predict an overall beneficial, but limited effect of projected climate changes upon forest regrowth rates in our study area. Stimulatory effects of projected climate change were more pronounced for conifer forests, with growth rates increasing between +5% and +50% over the study area, while mixed and broadleaved forests recorded changes that mostly ranged from -5% to +35%. Predicted increased regrowth rates were mainly associated with increased temperature, while changes in climate moisture had a minor effect. We conclude that such growth gains could partially compensate for the inevitable increase in natural disturbances but should not allow any increase in harvested volumes.

TI  - Assessment of Rural Vulnerability to Sand and Dust Storms in Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-related hazards such as sand and dust storms (SDS) have various impacts on human health, socio-economy, environment, and agroecosystems. Iran has been severely affected by domestic and external SDS during the last two decades. Considering the fragile economy of Iran's rural areas and the strong dependence of livelihood on agroecosystems, SDS cause serious damage to human communities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct a vulnerability assessment for developing SDS risk mitigation plans. In this study, various components of SDS vulnerability were formulated through a geographic information system (GIS)-based integrated assessment approach using composite indicators. By implementing a GIS multiple-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) model using socioeconomic and remote sensing data, a map of rural vulnerability to SDS was produced. Our results show that about 37% of Iran's rural areas have experienced high and very high levels of vulnerability to SDS. Rural areas in the southeast and south of Iran, especially Sistan and Baluchestan and Hormozgan provinces are more vulnerable to SDS. The findings of this study provide a basis for developing SDS disaster risk-reduction plans and enabling the authorities to prioritize SDS mitigation policies at the provincial administrative scale in Iran.

TI  - Half-a-century (1971-2020) of glacier shrinkage and climatic variability in the Bhaga basin, western Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier shrinkage is a globally occurring phenomena. High-resolution change detection based on frequent mapping and monitoring of high-altitude glaciers is necessary to precisely evaluate future water availability and to understand glacier evolution under different climatic scenarios in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayan (HKH) region. This also holds true for the Bhaga basin of the western Himalaya. This study investigates glacier and glacier lake changes in the Bhaga basin, over the last five decades based on satellite imagery including Corona KH4 (1971), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+; 2000), Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS IV; 2013), and Sentinel 2 (2020). Regional temperature and precipitation trends were evaluated from gridded climatic datasets (1900-2020). In the Bhaga basin 306 glaciers (>0.2 km(2)) were mapped with a total area of 360.3 +/- 4.0 km(2), of which 55.7 +/- 0.6 km(2) was covered with debris in 2013. The total glacier covered area decreased by similar to 8.2 +/- 1.5 % (0.16 +/- 0.03 % yr(-1)) during the entire observation period 1971-2020, with noticeable heterogeneity between tributary watersheds. In the past two decades (2000-2020), the deglaciation rate has increased significantly (0.25 % yr(-1)) compared to the previous decades (1971-2000; 0.12 % yr(-1)). Glacier lake area increased by 0.6 +/- 0.1 km(2) (0.012 km(2) yr(-1)) between 1971 and 2020. The NCEP/NCAR climatic data reveals an increase of 0.63 degrees C in temperature and a decrease of 6.39 mm in precipitation for the period 1948-2018. In comparison, APHRODITE data shows an increasing trend in temperature of 1.14 degrees C between 1961 and 2015 and decreasing trend in precipitation of 31 mm between 1951 and 2007. Both NCEP/NCAR and APHRODITE data reveal significant temperature increase and precipitation decrease since the 1990s, which have probably augmented ice loss in the Bhaga basin during the early 21(st) century.

TI  - Application of sentinel-1 SAR-derived vegetation descriptors for soil moisture retrieval and plant height prediction during the wheat growth cycle
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is the crucialparameter impacting the plant growth during its phenological cycle. The Water Cloud Model (WCM) is one of the most widely used semi-empirical models for retrieval of soil moisture of vegetated lands from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The model considers the effect of soil as well as vegetation on the radar backscatter. The study assesses the applicability of Sentinel-1 SAR-derived vegetation descriptors in the WCM for soil moisture retrieval during the wheat growth cycle. Various combinations of vegetation descriptors (V(1)and V-2), viz. VH polarized backscatter coefficient (sigma(0) (VH)), Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and depolarization ratio (chi(v)), were used in the model. The model performed better when different parameters are used as vegetation descriptors (V-1 not equal V-2) in the WCM rather than using the same parameter for both the vegetation descriptors (V-1= V-2). The best results were observed when sigma(0) (VH)was considered as one of the vegetation descriptors (V-1) while either chi(v)or RVI were utilized as the other vegetation descriptor (V-2) giving a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.959 and 0.958 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.499 dB and 0.516 dB respectively. The validation of the model-retrieved soil moisture against the in-situ measured values gave an R value of 0.72 and a RMSE of 0.096m(3)/m(3). The plant height was also predicted by the WCM in which the retrieved soil moisture from SAR data was used as a parameter. The predicted plant height was compared to in-situ measured plant height and an R value of 0.76 and RMSE of 0.214 was obtained as the best result. The study demonstrates the capability of SAR-derived parameters as vegetation descriptors in the WCM for soil moisture retrieval.

TI  - Complete, Theoretical Rovibronic Spectral Characterization of the Carbon Monoxide, Water, and Formaldehyde Cations
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - New high-level ab initio quartic force field (QFF) methods are explored which provide spectroscopic data for the electronically excited states of the carbon monoxide, water, and formaldehyde cations, sentinel species for expanded, recent cometary spectral analysis. QFFs based on equation-of-motion ionization potential (EOM-IP) with a complete basis set extrapolation and core correlation corrections provide assignment for the fundamental vibrational frequencies of the (A) over tilde B-2(1) and (B) over tilde (2)A(1) states of the formaldehyde cation; only three of these frequencies have experimental assignment available. Rotational constants corresponding to these vibrational excitations are also provided for the first time for all electronically excited states of both of these molecules. EOM-IP-CCSDT/CcC computations support tentative re-assignment of the nu(1) and nu(3) frequencies of the (B) over tilde (2)B2 state of the water cation to approximately 2409.3 cm(-1) and 1785.7 cm(-1), respectively, due to significant disagreement between experimental assignment and all levels of theory computed herein, as well as work by previous authors. The EOM-IP-CCSDT/CcC QFF achieves agreement to within 12 cm(-1) for the fundamental vibrational frequencies of the electronic ground state of the water cation compared to experimental values and to the high-level theoretical benchmarks for variationally-accessible states. Less costly EOM-IP based approaches are also explored using approximate triples coupled cluster methods, as well as electronically excited state QFFs based on EOM-CC3 and the previous (T)+EOM approach. The novel data, including vibrationally corrected rotational constants for all states studied herein, provided by these computations should be useful in clarifying comet evolution or other remote sensing applications in addition to fundamental spectroscopy.

TI  - A Method to Improve Land Use Representation for Weather Simulations Based on High-Resolution Data Sets-Application to Corine Land Cover Data in the WRF Model
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) data incorporation, for weather modeling purposes, highlights many problems. The straightforward Single Level Mode (SLM) aggregation is not adapted for high-resolution LC maps, with a high number of classes, because it could generate false classifications. We propose a Multi-Level Mode (MLM) aggregation method that includes a hierarchical structure. This study focuses on the Corine Land Cover (CLC) data set. Differences between MLM and SLM methods are small at the finest horizontal resolution and increase to a value of around 16% at 9-km horizontal resolution. To further integrate CLC data into WRF (Weather Research Forecasting model), we included a dedicated table of physical parameters next to using the classical conversion toward the USGS one. To evaluate the LC impact on the modeled boundary layer, we used WRF at 1 km to simulate a 4-day period with diurnal cycles of valley winds in the heterogeneous western pre-Alps area. We tested three LCs (USGS, MODIS, and CLC), where CLC has two physical parameter tables and two aggregation methods. CLC performs better than other tested LCs. The CLC aggregation methods revealed limited differences between the simulated variables, although the MLM method gives better results. Since these comparisons are restricted to a single location with the same LC type, the differences between various simulations regarding atmospheric parameters probably result from horizontal advection from upwind areas where surface conditions differ. Extended time series with multiple locations and diverse meteorological conditions need to be considered to reinforce the results presented here.

TI  - philosophy of childhood and children's political participation: poli(s)phonic challenges
T2  - CHILDHOOD AND PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - What challenges does the political participation of children pose to the philosophy of childhood? What challenges does the philosophy of childhood pose to children's political participation? To explore these issues, we have created an illustrated narrative text written in the form of a dialogue between two characters-Sentinel and Wanderer-who discuss the waves of children spread over their territory and the possibilities afforded them for participation in politics. The fictional narrative is organized in order to act as a stimulus for communal inquiry in the study group to which we belong, and informs our work with children in the philosophical research community. We establish an articulation between the act of listening to children's voices, the conditions of that listening, and the possible places and spaces for their political participation in the public space that follows. To what extent does creating space and time for listening to children open polyphonic dimensions and enable the construction of new forms of polis: poly(s)phonies? In what ways does the philosophy of childhood challenge itself in the creation of poly(s)phonies, settings in which the participation of children sets the tone? And in what ways does the philosophy of childhood in turn challenge us to create poly(s)phonies of our own?

TI  - Conspiracy Theories and Foreign Policy Narratives: Globalism in Jair Bolsonaro's Foreign Policy
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - An analysis of more than 2,000 speeches and social media posts on foreign policy issues from four members of Jair Bolsonaro's government from January 2019 to December 2020 suggests that a conspiracy theory called "globalism," which explains current events using a series of intrigues and stratagems carried out by fictitious enemies to undermine the national order, has not only taken root in Brazil's foreign policy narrative but consistently been used over time by the cabinet members responsible for that policy. It also indicates that the use of "globalism" is not just a political strategy to persuade voters but a worldview embedded in Bolsonaro's far-right cabinet. Uma analise de mais de 2.000 discursos e posts provenientes de redes sociais sobre questoes da politica externa do Brasil por quatro membros do gabinete do governo de Jair Bolsonaro de janeiro de 2019 a dezembro de 2020 indica que a teoria de conspiracao denominada "globalismo," que explica atualidades em termos de uma serie de intrigas e estrategias implementadas por inimigos ficticios para minar a ordem nacional, nao se arreigou apenas na narrativa exibida na politica exterior brasileira mas tambem se utilizou ha anos pelos mesmos membros do gabinete que sao responsaveis por sua elaboracao. Isso significa que o uso do "globalismo" nao e so uma estrategia politica para convencer eleitores mas e tambem uma visao do mundo que e enraizada no gabinete de Bolsonaro cuja origem reside na extreme direita.

M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing breast cancer survival rates, one of our contemporary challenges is to improve the quality of life of survivors. Lymphedema affects quality of life on physical, psychological, social and economic levels; however, prevention of lymphedema lags behind the progress seen in other areas of survivorship such as breast reconstruction and fertility preservation. Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) is a proactive approach to try to prevent lymphedema. We describe in this article essential aspects of the elaboration of an ILR program. The Calgary experience is reviewed with specific focus on team building, technique, operating room logistics and patient follow-up, all viewed through research and education lenses.

TI  - Analysis of Forest Cover Change and Its Drivers in Biodiversity Hotspot Areas of the Semien Mountains National Park, Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests provide multiple ecosystem services ranging from local livelihoods and socio-economic benefits to global ecological services. Despite these benefits, human activities have put immense strain on forest resources, resulting in forest degradation, impoverishment of the environment, and loss of livelihoods. Hence, monitoring forest cover change and identifying its drivers are essential for developing sustainable forest management strategies that restore forest resources and ecosystem services. This study examined the trends of forest cover changes and its drivers in and around the Semien Mountains National Park, Northwest Ethiopia, from 1984 to 2020. Data from Landsat satellite images of 1984, 1996, 2008, and 2020 were used for forest cover mapping and quantifying the changes using remote sensing techniques. A household survey and key informant interviews were also used to identify the drivers of forest cover change. Results showed an overall decline in forest cover and grasslands while cultivated lands, bare lands and built-up areas have registered gains in the study area. The percentage area under forests declined by about 31% (33,084 ha) over the past 36 years. This loss translates to an annual average forest loss of about 1.02% (919 ha). Conversely, cultivated land, bare land, and built-up areas have experienced an increase of about 159% (33,387 ha), 220% (10,121 ha), and 366% (6356 ha), respectively, over the last 36 years. Analysis of the 36-year change detection matrix revealed that about 62% of the study area experienced a transition, of which 21% and 41% were attributable to net change and swap change, respectively. The observed reduction in forest cover was driven by agricultural expansion, population growth, growing demand for fuelwood, livestock pressure, and forest fires. Such drastic changes in forest cover have a detrimental impact on the community's well-being, biodiversity, climate, and the availability of forest ecosystem services. Thus, the study recommends concerted efforts by stakeholders to develop participatory forest management and public awareness that consider the co-existence of nature conservation and sustainable livelihoods.

TI  - Post Mining Ground Deformations Transition Related to Coal Mines Closure in the Campine Coal Basin, Belgium, Evidenced by Three Decades of MT-InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal ground-movement measurements and mappings have been carried out in the Campine coalfield in Belgian Limburg since the closure of the mines to document post-mining effects. MT-InSAR measurements are compared to groundwater head changes in the overburden and to height data from the closest GNSS stations. Radar interferometry is used to estimate the extension and the velocity of ground movements. In particular, the MT-InSAR technique has been applied to SAR acquisitions of the satellites ERS-1/2 (1991-2005), ENVISAT (2003-2010), COSMO-SkyMed (2011-2014), and Sentinel-1A (2014-2022). The images were processed and used to highlight a switch from subsidence to uplift conditions in the western part of the coal basin, while the eastern part had already been affected by a rebound since the beginning of the ERS-1/2 acquisitions. Following the closure of the last active colliery of Zolder in 1992 and the subsequent cease of mine-water pumping, a recharge of mine-water aquifers occurred in the western part of the basin. This process provoked the change from subsidence to uplift conditions that was recorded during the ENVISAT period. In the center of the coal-mining area, measured uplift velocities reached a maximum of 18 mm/year during the ENVISAT period, while they subsided at -12 mm/year during the ERS-1/2 period. Mean velocities in the western and eastern parts of the coalfield area have decreased since the last MT-InSAR measurements were performed using Sentinel-1A, while the Zolder coal mine continues to rise at a faster-than-average rate of a maximum of 16 mm/year. The eastern part of the coalfield is still uplifting, while its rate has been reduced from 18 mm/year (ERS-1/2) to 9 mm/year (Sentinel-1A) since the beginning of the radar-satellite observations. Time-series data from the two GNSS stations present in the study area were used for a local comparison with the evolution of ground movements observed by MT-InSAR. Two leveling campaigns (2000, 2013) were also used to make comparisons with the MT-InSAR data. The station's measurements and the leveling data were in line with the MT-InSAR data. Overall, major ground movements are obviously limited to an extension of the actual underground-mining works and rapidly diminish outside of them.

T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In terms of sustainable land use management, it is extremely important to reveal the land conditions and the changes that occur on the land in certain periods. In this study, using CORINE data for Duzce province, land use status and transitions between land-use classes over 28 years were investigated. In addition, changes in carbon storage in above-ground biomass were determined for each land-use and land transition using Landsat satellite images for the years 1990 and 2018. 28 years, artificial surfaces increased from 3,852 hectares to 9,058 hectares. While agricultural areas increased by 11.5% to 114,650 hectares, forest and semi-natural areas decreased by 14% to 122,955 hectares. 96.7% of the increase in agricultural areas was land converted from forest areas. While the amount of carbon stored in the forest and semi-natural areas increased by 27.9%, it increased by 30.5% in agricultural areas. With land transitions, 17.8% of the total carbon (14,407 tons) was transferred from one land use to another. In terms of annual land-use change rate between 1990 and 2018, the highest rate of land-use change was in the post-earthquake 2000-2006 period. The information in this study will make important contributions to policymakers in land management and planning.

TI  - Subchronic Exposure to Polystyrene Microplastic Differently Affects Redox Balance in the Anterior and Posterior Intestine of <i>Sparus aurata</i>
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Plastics are among the most widely distributed pollutants in the sea, where they break down into microplastic particles that undergo bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes along the trophic chain. Such particles can cause toxic effects in aquatic organisms, such as cytotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) is one of the most spread species in Mediterranean aquaculture fish. It is a species at the top of the trophic chain and is considered a good sentinel species for toxicological and bioaccumulation studies. This study aimed to investigate the adverse effects of the oral exposure to polystyrene microplastics on intestinal redox balance. We demonstrated that microplastics ingestion increases the intestinal oxidative and nitrosative stress and impairs the antioxidant defense system. This evidence confirms that the gut is a target organ for the toxic effects of ingested microplastics in fish. The observed impairment may damage the organ function, leading to the alteration of fish health status. Microplastics (MPs) are pollutants widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems. MPs are introduced mainly by ingestion acting locally or in organs far from the gastroenteric tract. MPs-induced health consequences for fish species still need to be fully understood. We aimed to investigate the effects of the subchronic oral exposure to polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) (1-20 mu m) in the gilthead seabreams (Sparus aurata) used as the experimental model. We studied the detrimental impact of PS-MPs (25 and 250 mg/kg b.w./day) on the redox balance and antioxidant status in the intestine using histological analysis and molecular techniques. The research goal was to examine the anterior (AI) and posterior intestine (PI) tracts, characterized by morphological and functional differences. PS-MPs caused an increase of reactive oxygen species and nitrosylated proteins in both tracts, as well as augmented malondialdehyde production in the PI. PS-MPs also differently affected gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase). Moreover, an increased up-regulation of protective heat shock proteins (HSPs) (i.e., hsp70 and hsp90) was observed in PI. Our findings demonstrate that PS-MPs are responsible for oxidative/nitrosative stress and alterations of detoxifying defense system responses with differences in AI and PI of gilthead seabreams.

TI  - Long-Term Wetland Monitoring Using the Landsat Archive: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands, which provide multiple functions and ecosystem services, have decreased and been degraded worldwide for several decades due to human activities and climate change. Managers and scientists need tools to characterize and monitor wetland areas, structure, and functions in the long term and at regional and global scales and assess the effects of planning policies on their conservation status. The Landsat earth observation program has collected satellite images since 1972, which makes it the longest global earth observation record with respect to remote sensing. In this review, we describe how Landsat data have been used for long-term (>= 20 years) wetland monitoring. A total of 351 articles were analyzed based on 5 topics and 22 attributes that address long-term wetland monitoring and Landsat data analysis issues. Results showed that (1) the open access Landsat archive successfully highlights changes in wetland areas, structure, and functions worldwide; (2) recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning opens new prospects for analyzing the Landsat archive; (3) most unexplored wetlands can be investigated using the Landsat archive; (4) new cloud-computing tools enable dense Landsat times-series to be processed over large areas. We recommend that future studies focus on changes in wetland functions using AI methods along with cloud computing. This review did not include reports and articles that do not mention the use of Landsat imagery.

TI  - Effect of Dynamic PET Scaling with LAI and Aspect on the Spatial Performance of a Distributed Hydrologic Model
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity in hydrologic simulations is a key difference between lumped and distributed models. Not all distributed models benefit from pedo-transfer functions based on the soil properties and crop-vegetation dynamics. Mostly coarse-scale meteorological forcing is used to estimate only the water balance at the catchment outlet. The mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) is one of the rare models that incorporate remote sensing data, i.e., leaf area index (LAI) and aspect, to improve the actual evapotranspiration (AET) simulations and water balance together. The user can select either LAI or aspect to scale PET. However, herein we introduce a new weight parameter, "alphax", that allows the user to incorporate both LAI and aspect together for potential evapotranspiration (PET) scaling. With the mHM code enhancement, the modeler also has the option of using raw PET with no scaling. In this study, streamflow and AET are simulated using the mHM in The Main Basin (Germany) for the period of 2002-2014. The additional value of PET scaling with LAI and aspect for model performance is investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AET and LAI products. From 69 mHM parameters, 26 parameters are selected for calibration using the Optimization Software Toolkit (OSTRICH). For calibration and evaluation, the KGE metric is used for water balance, and the SPAEF metric is used for evaluating spatial patterns of AET. Our results show that the AET performance of the mHM is highest when using both LAI and aspect indicating that LAI and aspect contain valuable spatial heterogeneity information from topography and canopy (e.g., forests, grasslands, and croplands) that should be preserved during modeling. This is key for agronomic studies like crop yield estimations and irrigation water use. The additional "alphax" parameter makes the model physically more flexible and robust as the model can decide the weights according to the study domain.

TI  - Exploring Geomorphic Features in Lower Sabarmati River Basin as Signatures of Palaeoenvironmental Change, Gujarat: A Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to unravel the role of geomorphic indicators and/or signatures to be used as evidence for palaeoenvironmental changes and other forcing mechanisms from the lower reaches of the Sabarmati river basin, Gujarat, India region. In the present study, geomorphic features have been used as archives to debate the past land-sea interactions using satellite imagery. In the lower reaches of the Sabarmati river, a number of meanders, sinuosity changes, palaeochannels, and scroll plains have been identified. As a result of the rise and fall of the sea during the Holocene period, the changes in hydrodynamic and steady-state conditions of the river can be visualized in terms of changes in landforms. Thus, the intriguing geomorphic landforms in the lower portions of the Sabarmati basin delineate the likely archives and signs of previous environmental change, in particularly similar to the relative sea level change. This approach provides first-hand documentation of the fluvial evolution under the direct impact of the varying forcing mechanisms. This attempt shows the effectiveness of satellite images in unravelling the clues to past changes from the landscape in a fast and insightful manner.

TI  - Impacts of rapid urbanization on spatial dynamics of land use-based carbon emission and surface temperature changes in the Semarang Metropolitan Region, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the relationship between carbon emission patterns and the land surface temperature (LST) changes due to the rapid urbanization in the Semarang Metropolitan Region (SMR), an Indonesian area that has experienced rapid urban growth compared to other urban areas. This research used the stock-difference and gain-loss methods to calculate carbon stocks and emissions. Then, band 6 on Landsat 5 TM (2008) and band 10 on Landsat 8 OLI (2013 and 2018) were used to calculate the LST changes. These results showed that the peri-urban area had a more significant change. The correlation between carbon emissions and an increased SMR temperature correlates to 0.646. This shows that the carbon emissions pattern promotes temperature dynamics in the SMR. Furthermore, this study proved the release of carbon emissions in line with LST dynamics spatially. In this case, this study proved that rapid urbanization in the SMR promotes both carbon emission and LST. Those changes are also affected by vegetation canopy availability and other activities. As a result, the government must prioritize spatial planning in the SMR to mitigate environmental change risk. In addition, the government must develop novel strategies to deal with a wide range of fast and unpredictable potential changes in the urban area and its surroundings.

TI  - Factors associated with partner notification intentions among symptomatic sexually transmitted infection service attendees in South Africa
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In South Africa (SA), a client-initiated partner notification (PN) approach is implemented for the management of sexual partners of patients presenting with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or STI syndromes.Objectives. To explore the demographic, sexual behavioural and clinical characteristics associated with PN intentions among symptomatic STI service attendees at sentinel primary healthcare facilities in three SA provinces.Methods. We analysed cross-sectional data obtained from 1 293 adults enrolled into STI aetiological surveillance during 2019 -2020 in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces. Self-reported sexual practices, PN intentions and clinical data were collected using nurse-administrated questionnaires. We assessed gender-stratified factors associated with the index case's willingness to notify their sexual partners of their STI syndrome diagnosis. Univariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used to determine factors associated with gender-stratified PN intentions.Results. The enrolled participants comprised 887 male (68.6%) and 406 female (31.4%) STI clients. Self-reported PN intentions were higher among women than men (83.5% v. 64.4%; p<0.001). Multivariable analyses revealed that casual sex partnerships during the preceding 3-month period and enrolment at the KwaZulu-Natal site were independent barriers to PN intent among male participants. For females, enrolment at the Gauteng site was independently associated with lower PN intentions, while presenting with genital ulcer syndrome was a motivator towards PN intent. The primary reasons cited for non-disclosure across both genders were casual sexual encounters, followed by geographically distant partnerships and fear of disclosure.Conclusion. We show that demographic and behavioural characteristics, as well as relationship dynamics, may influence the PN intentions of STI service attendees in SA. Alternative PN strategies should be considered, based on the reported barriers, to increase overall STI notification, strengthen partner management and ultimately reduce STI incidence.

TI  - The Effects of Clear-Cutting on Ground Thermal Regimes After a Wildfire Using Hand-Held Thermal Imaging Camera in a Semi-arid Forest Ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of surface temperature after wildfires is important for soil reclamation, germination conditions, and sustainability of the burned site condition. This study was conducted to evaluate the temperature on the forest floor, bare soil, and vegetation after clear-cutting using a handle thermal imaging camera and laser thermometer in Mediterranean Pinus brutia forest, Hatay-Samandagi district, Turkey. Furthermore, the study aimed at determining relations among calculated temperature with some morphometric features; altitude, slope, Compound Topographic Index (CTI), and some spectral indices; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Bare Soil Index (BSI), Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (DNBR) using Sentinel 2A and AlosPalsar Satellite Images in the study area. In total, 80 thermal temperatures were measured. The temperature data obtained with the thermal camera were validated by direct temperature measurement using a laser temperature measuring instrument. The results showed that there was a significant (average RMSE = 1.96) high positive correlation (average R-2 = 0.91) between hand-held thermal camera and laser temperature measurement. The highest correlation was found between CTI and FFT (R-2 = 0.62) and Slope and FFT (R-2 = 0.40). Significant (p < 0.01) positive correlation were found between ground temperature and post_NDVI (R-2 = 0.42), NDMI and FFT (R-2 = 0.37). Significant (p < 0.01) negative correlation were found between FFT and DNBR (R-2 = 0.42), FFT and BSI (R-2 = 0.45). Although the forest floor has the potential to increase the severity of the fire, it was concluded that the forest floor and living vegetation optimize the distribution of soil surface temperature in the burned area.

TI  - Carotid Artery Disease in the Era of Biomarkers: A Pilot Study
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intima-media thickness (IMT) and its irregularities or ulcerations in the common carotid artery (CCA) are useful tools as sentinel biomarkers for the integrity of the cardiovascular system. Total homocysteine and lipoprotein levels are the most commonly used elements in cardiovascular risk stratification. Duplex ultrasound (DUS), associated with serum biomarkers, can be used simply to assess the degree of atherosclerotic disease and cardiovascular risk. This study highlights the role of different kinds of biomarkers, showing their usefulness and potentiality in multi-district atherosclerotic patients, especially for early diagnosis and therapy effectiveness monitoring. A retrospective analysis performed from September 2021 to August 2022, of patients with carotid artery disease, was performed. A total of 341 patients with a mean age of 53.8 years were included in the study. The outcomes showed an increased risk of stroke in patients with significative carotid artery disease, nonresponsive to therapy, monitored through a series of serum biomarkers (homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and oxidized LDL). In this reported experience, the systematic use of DUS in association with the multiple biomarkers approach was effective for the early identification of patients at higher risk of disease progression or inefficient therapy.

TI  - Assessing the Efficacy of Phenological Spectral Differences to Detect Invasive Alien <i>Acacia dealbata</i> Using Sentinel-2 Data in Southern Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants are transforming the landscapes, threatening the most vulnerable elements of local biodiversity across the globe. The monitoring of invasive species is paramount for minimizing the impact on biodiversity. In this study, we aim to discriminate and identify the spatial extent of Acacia dealbata Link from other species using RGB-NIR Sentinel-2 data based on phenological spectral peak differences. Time series were processed using the Earth Engine platform and random forest importance was used to select the most suitable Sentinel-2 derived metrics. Thereafter, a random forest machine learning algorithm was trained to discriminate between A. dealbata and native species. A flowering period was detected in March and metrics based on the spectral difference between blooming and the pre flowering (January) or post flowering (May) months were highly suitable for A. dealbata discrimination. The best-fitted classification model shows an overall accuracy of 94%, including six Sentinel-2 derived metrics. We find that 55% of A. dealbata presences were widely widespread in patches replacing Pinus pinaster Ait. stands. This invasive alien species also creates continuous monospecific stands representing 33% of the presences. This approach demonstrates its value for detecting and mapping A. dealbata based on RGB-NIR bands and phenological peak differences between blooming and pre or post flowering months providing suitable information for an early detection of invasive species to improve sustainable forest management.

TI  - Multicenter Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance among Gram-Negative Bacteria Isolated from Bloodstream Infections in Ghana
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Gram-negative bacteria-causing bloodstream infections (BSIs), such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), is a major public health concern. Nonetheless, AMR surveillance remains scarce in sub-Saharan Africa, where BSI treatment is largely empirical. The aim of the study was to determine the distribution and AMR patterns of BSI-causing NTS, K. pneumoniae, and other Gram-negative bacteria in Ghana. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and December 2021 at eleven sentinel health facilities across Ghana as part of a pilot study on the feasibility and implementation of the human sector AMR surveillance harmonized protocol in sub-Saharan Africa. Gram-negative bacteria recovered from blood specimens of febrile patients were identified using MALDI-TOF and evaluated for antimicrobial resistance using the BD Phoenix M50 analyzer and Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion. The Department of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana served as the reference laboratory. Results: Out of 334 Gram-negative blood isolates, there were 18 (5.4%) NTS, 85 (25.5%) K. pneumoniae, 88 (26.4%) Escherichia coli, 40 (12.0%) Acinetobacter baumannii, 25 (7.5%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 77 (23.1%) other Gram-negative bacteria. As a composite, the isolates displayed high resistance to the antibiotics tested-amoxicillin (89.3%), tetracycline (76.1%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (71.5%), and chloramphenicol (59.7%). Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins [ceftriaxone (73.7%), cefotaxime (77.8%), and ceftazidime (56.3%)] and fluoroquinolones [ciprofloxacin (55.3%)] was also high; 88% of the isolates were multidrug resistant, and the rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was 44.6%. Antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae followed the pattern of all Gram-negative isolates. Antibiotic resistance was lower in NTS blood isolates, ranging between 16.7-38.9% resistance to the tested antibiotics. Resistance rates of 38.9%, 22.2%, and 27.8% were found for cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, respectively, and 27.8% and 23.8% for ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, respectively, which are used in the treatment of invasive NTS. The prevalence of multidrug resistance in NTS isolates was 38.9%. Conclusions: Multicenter AMR surveillance of Gram-negative blood isolates from febrile patients was well-received in Ghana, and the implementation of a harmonized protocol was feasible. High resistance and multidrug resistance to first- or second-choice antibiotics, including penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones, were found, implying that these antibiotics might have limited effectiveness in BSI treatment in the country. Continuation of AMR surveillance in Gram-negative blood isolates is essential for a better understanding of the extent of AMR in these pathogens and to guide clinical practice and policymaking.

TI  - Remote Sensing Applications for Mapping Large Wildfires Based on Machine Learning and Time Series in Northwestern Portugal
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping large wildfires (LW) is essential for environmental applications and enhances the understanding of the dynamics of affected areas. Remote sensing techniques supported by machine learning and time series have been increasingly used in studies addressing this issue and have shown potential for this type of analysis. The main aim of this article is to develop a methodology for mapping LW in northwestern Portugal using a machine learning algorithm and time series from Landsat images. For the burnt area classification, we initially used the Fourier harmonic model to define outliers in the time series that represented pixels of possible burnt areas and, then, we applied the random forest classifier for the LW classification. The results indicate that the harmonic analysis provided estimates with the actual observed values of the NBR index; thus, the pixels classified by random forest were only those that were masked, collaborated in the processing, and reduced possible spectral confusion between targets with similar behaviour. The burnt area maps revealed that similar to 23.5% of the territory was burnt at least once from 2001 to 2020. The temporal variability of the burnt area indicated that, on average, 6.504 hectares were affected by LW within the 20 years. The annual burnt area varied over the years, with the minimum annual area detected in 2014 (679.5 hectares) and the maximum mapped area detected in 2005 (73,025.1 hectares). We concluded that the process of defining the mask with the outliers considerably reduced the universe of pixels to be classified within each image, which leaves the training of the classifier focused on separating the set of pixels into two groups with very similar spectral characteristics, thus contributing so that the separation of groups with similar spectral behaviour was performed automatically and without great sampling effort. The method showed satisfactory accuracy results with little omission for burnt areas.

TI  - GIS-Based Urban Traffic Assessment in a Historical European City under the Influence of Infrastructure Works and COVID-19
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas have developed organically over time, driven by the economic success of cities. However, this development has usually been accompanied by the side effects of urbanization, such as increased traffic and its associated problems: traffic congestion, increased accident rates and pollution. As urban populations grow and expand, the importance of GIS lies in its ability to collect a large amount of geospatial data, including human-generated data. This data is necessary to understand the complexity of the city, set priorities, solve complicated planning problems and perform a variety of spatial analysis, which shows not only the feasibility but also the consistency of the proposed infrastructure with the requirements of a sustainable city. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of integrating real-time traffic data with GIS technology and remote sensing data for analyzing the impact of infrastructure works and COVID-19 on traffic in Oradea, Romania. The case study was focused on the historical center of Oradea and was based on remote sensing data collected before, during, and after traffic restrictions. The study also shows the need for using GIS and crowdsourcing-based applications in traffic analysis and planning.

TI  - Assessment of Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Mangrove in Five Typical Mangrove Reserve Wetlands in Asia, Africa and Oceania
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove wetlands play a key role in global biodiversity conservation, though they have been damaged in recent decades. Therefore, mangrove habitats have been of great concern at the international level since the latter half of the 20th century. We focused on the key issue of the dynamics of mangrove habitats. A comprehensive review of their typicality and status from the global perspective was evaluated before the landscape dynamics of the mangrove habitats at the five sites were interpreted from Landsat satellite images covering 20 years, from 2000 to 2020. Ground-truthing was undertaken after comparing the results with the other published international mangrove datasets. We reached three conclusions: Firstly, within the period from 2000 to 2020, the mangrove area in Dongzhaigang increased by 414 ha, with an increase of 24.6%. In Sembilang NP, Sundarban, Kakadu NP, and RUMAKI, the mangrove area decreased by 1652 ha, 16,091 ha, 83 ha, and 2012 ha, with a decrease of 1.8%, 2.7%, 0.9%, and 3.9%, respectively. Secondly, other types of wetlands play a key role in degradating the mangrove wetlands in all of five protected areas. Thirdly, the rate of mangrove degradation has slowed dramatically based on the five sites over the past two decades, which are generally consistent with the findings of other researchers.

TI  - Reconstruction of Sentinel Images for Suspended Particulate Matter Monitoring in Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing data is a common issue in remote sensing. Data reconstruction through multiple satellite data sources has become one of the most powerful ways to solve this issue. Continuous monitoring of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in arid lakes is vital for water quality solutions. Therefore, this research aimed to develop and evaluate the performance of two image reconstruction strategies, spatio-temporal fusion reflectance image inversion SPM and SPM spatio-temporal fusion, based on the measured SPM concentration data with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. The results show that (1) ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatio-temporal Adaptive Reflection Fusion Model) performed better than FSDAF (Flexible Spatio-temporal Data Fusion) in the fusion image generation, particularly the red band, followed by the blue, green, and NIR (near-infrared) bands. (2) A single-band linear and non-linear regression model was constructed based on Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. Analysis of the accuracy and stability of the model led us to the conclusion that the red band model performs well, is fast to model, and has a wide range of applications (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and fused high-accuracy images). (3) By comparing the two data reconstruction strategies of spatio-temporal fused image inversion SPM and spatio-temporal fused SPM concentration map, we found that the fused SPM concentration map is more effective and more stable when applied to multiple fused images. The findings can provide an important scientific reference value for further expanding the inversion research of other water quality parameters in the future and provide a theoretical basis as well as technical support for the scientific management of Ebinur Lake's ecology and environment.

TI  - Discovery of a New Molecular Bubble-Outflow Structure in the Taurus B18 Cloud
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Star formation can produce bubbles and outflows, as a result of stellar feedback. Outflows and bubbles inject momentum and energy into the surrounding interstellar medium, and so are related to the overall energy balance of the molecular cloud. Molecular bubbles can be resolved by higher-resolution radio telescopes to quantify the effect of star formation on molecular clouds. We report here the identification of a new molecular bubble with an outflow, and a Herbig-Haro object, HH 319, located at the bubble center. Multiwavelength data have been utilized to study its spatial structure, energy injection, and dynamical timescale. This bubble has a kinetic energy of 5.8 x 10(43) erg within the smallest radius of a bubble in Taurus, 0.077 pc. The bubble formed similar to 70,000 yr ago. According to the proper-motion velocities of protostars from Gaia EDR3, the T Tauri binary stars (FY Tau and FZ Tau) at the southwest edge of the bubble may have produced the outflow-bubble structure. This is an unusual new structure found in low- and intermediate-mass star formation regions. Only a bubble in Orion A, driven by V380 Ori, has a similar structure. The bubble-outflow structure provides additional observational evidence for the theory of stellar wind from T Tauri stars. It enhances our understanding of how stellar feedback acts on molecular clouds.

TI  - Drought Monitoring Using Landsat Derived Indices and Google Earth Engine Platform: A Case Study from Al-Lith Watershed, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise assessment of drought and its impact on the natural ecosystem is an arduous task in regions with limited climatic observations due to sparsely distributed in situ stations, especially in the hyper-arid region of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Therefore, this study investigates the application of remote sensing techniques to monitor drought and compare the remote sensing-retrieved drought indices (RSDIs) with the standardized meteorological drought index (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI) during 2001-2020. The computed RSDIs include Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), which are derived using multi-temporal Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellites, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) is used to find the extent of agreement between the SPEI and RSDIs. The comparison showed CC values of 0.74, 0.67, 0.57, and 0.47 observed for VHI/SPEI-12, VHI/SPEI-6, VHI/SPEI-3, and VHI/SPEI-1, respectively. Comparatively low agreement was observed between TCI and SPEI with CC values of 0.60, 0.61, 0.42, and 0.37 observed for TCI/SPEI-12, TCI/SPEI-6, TCI/SPEI-3, and TCI/SPEI-1. A lower correlation with CC values of 0.53, 0.45, 0.33 and 0.24 was observed for VCI/SPEI-12, VCI/SPEI-6, VCI/SPEI-3, and VCI/SPEI-1, respectively. Overall, the results suggest that VHI and SPEI are better correlated drought indices and are suitable for drought monitoring in the data-scarce hyper-arid regions. This research will help to improve our understanding of the relationships between meteorological and remote sensing drought indices.

TI  - Soil Erosion Modelling and Accumulation Using RUSLE and Remote Sensing Techniques: Case Study Wadi Baysh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the sediment retention in Wadi Baysh using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and TerrSet models, accompanied by integrated remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The contribution of this study is mainly associated with the application of TerrSet integrated with high resolution datasets to precisely estimate sediments load, which provide useful information to operate dams and improve the operational efficiency of dams. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data are utilized to delineate the basin and have been used as an input to the TerrSet model. The rainfall erosivity (R factor) was calculated using the Climate Hazards Center Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) in the research area during 2015-2020. The soil erodibility (K factor) and LULC categorization are calculated using the digital soil map of the world (DSMW) and Sentinel-2 datasets, respectively. The R factor calculated for Wadi Baysh ranges between 91.35 and 115.95 MJ mm/ha/h/year, while the estimated K factor ranges from 0.139 to 0.151 t ha h/ha M. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method categorized LULC of the study area into four major classes including barren land (81% of the total area), built-up area (11%), vegetation (8%), and water bodies (1%). Results from the sediment retention module (TerrSet) indicated that each year, 57.91 million tons of soil loss occurred in the basin. The data show that soil loss is greater in the northeast and south, whereas it is typical in the middle of Wadi Baysh. It is concluded from the current analyses that the dam lake of Wadi Baysh, located downstream, will be filled soon in the coming few years if sediment loads are carried to the lake at the same rate. Surface dam operators can obtain a full understanding of sedimentation and take proactive measures to reduce its influence on dam operations by leveraging TerrSet's sophisticated capabilities.

AB  - Objective: Blood groups are associated with duodenal ulcer, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection. In some studies, a relationship was detected between hematologic and solid organ malignancies and blood groups. In this study, we investigated the frequency and phenotypes of blood groups (ABO, Kell, Duffy, Rh) in patients with hematologic malignancies.Materials and Methods: One hundred sixty-one patients with hematologic malignancy (multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myelocytic leukemia) and 41 healthy people were evaluated prospectively. We determined phenotypes and distribution of ABO, Rh, Kell, and Duffy blood groups in all cases. Chi-square test and 1-way variance analysis were used for statistical analysis. P <.05 value was considered statistically significant.Results: In patients with multiple myeloma, the A blood group was statistically significantly more frequent than in the control group (P =.021). Rh negativity was found more frequent in patients with hematologic malignancy than the control group (P =.009). Kpa and Kpb antigen positivity were found statistically significantly less frequent in patients with hematologic malignancy (P =.013, P =.007; respectively). Fy (a-b-) and K-k+ phenotypes were higher in patients with hematologic cancer than in the control group (P =.045).Conclusion: We determined a significant relationship between hematologic malignancies and blood group systems. In our study, due to the low number of cases and few hematological malignancy types, extensive studies with more cases and more hematologic cancer types are needed.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - center dot Context.-Touch preparation (TP) alone is discouraged for intraoperative lymph node (LN) assessment in the neoadjuvant setting (NAS) owing to overall low sensitivity in detecting metastatic breast cancer.Objective.-To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of intraoperative LN assessment via TP and examine potential causes of discrepancies along with the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic parameters in the NAS and non-neoadjuvant setting (NNAS).Design.-A total of 99 LNs from 47 neoadjuvant patients and 108 LNs from 56 non-neoadjuvant patients were identified. Discordant cases were reviewed retrospectively to reveal the discrepancy reasons. Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data were obtained from chart review and the pathology CoPath database.Results.-The sensitivity, specificity, and negative pre-dictive value of TP in NAS and NNAS were 34.2% versus 37.5%, 100% versus 100%, and 70.9% versus 90.2%, respectively. In NAS, discrepancy reasons were interpre-tation challenge due to lobular histotype, poor TP quality secondary to therapy-induced histomorphologic changes, and undersampling due to small tumor deposits (<2 mm); the latter was the major reason in NNAS. More cases with macrometastasis were missed in NAS compared to NNAS (14 of 25 versus 1 of 10). The parameters associated with discrepancy were lobular histotype, histologic grade 2, estrogen receptor positivity, HER2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negativity, multifocality, and pathologic tumor size greater than 10 mm in NAS; and lymphovascular space involvement and pathologic tumor size greater than 20 mm in NNAS.Conclusions.-In NAS, intraoperative TP alone should be used very cautiously owing to a high false-negative rate of macrometastasis, especially for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma and known axillary LN metastasis before neoadjuvant therapy.(Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2023;147:149-158; doi: 10.5858/ arpa.2021-0520-OA)

TI  - Application of Satellite Remote Sensing, UAV-Geological Mapping, and Machine Learning Methods in the Exploration of Podiform Chromite Deposits
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The irregular and sporadic occurrence of chromite pods in podiform chromite deposits (PCD), especially in mountainous terranes with rough topography, necessitates finding innovative methods for reconnaissance and prospecting. This research combines several remote sensing methods to discriminate the highly serpentinized peridotites hosting chromite pods from the other barren ultramafic and mafic cumulates. The case study is the area of the Sabzevar Ophiolite (NE Iran), which hosts several known chromite and other mineral deposits. The integration of satellite images [e.g., Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite sensor, Landsat series, and Sentinel-2] coupled with change detection, band rationing, and target detection algorithms [including the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM)] were used to distinguish potential lithological units hosting chromites. Results have been verified by an initial on-field checking and compared with the high-resolution (GSD similar to 6 cm) orthomosaic images obtained by the processing of photographs taken from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) at a promising area of 35 km(2). The combination of visual interpretation and supervised classification by machine learning methods [Support Vector Machine (SVM)] yielded the production of a geological map, in which the lithological units and structures are outlined, including the crust-mantle transition zone units, mafic cumulates, crosscutting dykes, and mantle sequences. The validation of the results was performed through a second phase, made up of field mapping, sampling, chemical analysis, and microscopic studies, leading to the discovery of new chromite occurrences and mineralized zones. All ultramafic units were classified into four groups based on the degree of serpentinization, represented by the intensity of their average spectral reflectance. Based on their presumed protolith, the highly serpentinized ultramafics and serpentinites were classified into two main categories (dunite or harzburgite). The serpentinite with probable dunitic protolith, discriminated for a peculiar Fe-rich Ni-bearing lateritic crust, is more productive for chromite prospecting. This is particularly true at the contact with mafic dykes, akin to some worldwide chromite deposits. The results of our work highlight the potential of multi-scale satellite and UAV-based remote sensing to find footprints of some chromite mineral deposits.

TI  - Occurrence of rare earth elements (REEs) and trace elements (TEs) in feathers of adult and young Gentoo penguins from King George Island, Antarctica.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Penguins are sentinel species for marine pollution, but their role as potential biovectors of REEs or TEs to ecosystems has been poorly studied. The present study analyzed (ICP-MS) feathers of young and adult Gentoo penguins from Fildes Bay, for 63 elements (including 15 REEs). Most of the REEs were present at very low levels, ranging from 0.002 (Lu) to 0.452 (Sm) mug g-1 d.w., several orders of magnitude lower than TEs. The content of TEs varied widely, with Al, Fe, Zn, Sr, Ba, Ti and Mn as the seven having the highest concentrations in the feathers of both age groups. The results show that P. papua deposits REEs and TEs through the feathers on the penguin rockery, whose potential actual impacts and long-term fate in remote regions need deeper research. This work presents essential baseline data that will be useful for further studies on Antarctic penguins.

TI  - Soil Salinity Assessing and Mapping Using Several Statistical and Distribution Techniques in Arid and Semi-Arid Ecosystems, Egypt
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Oasis lands in Egypt are commonly described as salty soils; therefore, waterlogging and higher soil salinity are major obstacles to sustainable agricultural development. This study aims to map and assess soil salinization at El-Farafra Oasis in the Egypt Western Desert based on salinity indices, Imaging Spectroscopy (IS), and statistical techniques. The regression model was developed to test the relationship between the electrical conductivity (ECe) of 70 surface soil samples and seven salinity indices (SI 1, SI 2, SI 5, SI 6, SI 7, SI 8, and SI 9) to produce soil salinity maps depending on Landsat-8 (OLI) images. The investigations of soil salinization and salinity indices were validated in a studied area based on 30 soil samples; the obtained results represented that all salinity indices have shown satisfactory correlations between ECe values for each soil sample site and salinity indices, except for the SI 5 index that present non-significant correlations with R-2 value of 0.2688. The SI 8 index shows a higher negative significant correlation with ECe and an R-2 value of 0.6356. There is a significant positive correlation at the (p < 0.01) level between SI 9 and ECe (r = 0.514), a non-significant correlation at the (p < 0.05) level between soil ECe and SI 1 index (r = 0.495), and the best-verified salinity index was for SI 7 that has a low estimated RMSE error of 8.58. Finally, the highest standard error (R-2) was represented as ECe (dS m(-1)) with an R-2 of 0.881, and the lowest one was SI 9 with an R-2 of 0.428, according to Tukey's test analysis. Therefore, observing and investigating soil salinity are essential requirements for appropriate natural resource management plans in the future.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Middle Benue Trough is a complex geologic environment consisting of a mix of sedimentary and basement rocks. It is challenged by the problem of water scarcity due to insufficient surface water sources and acute pollution of rivers and streams. Cases of borehole failures are reported during exploration for groundwater and this could be as a result inadequate geological knowledge of the major influences on the availability of groundwater, one of which is lineaments. This study, therefore, integrates the strengths of both aeromagnetic and remote sensing data to appraise the lineaments. The results obtained have important implications for groundwater search in the study area in that they confirm that higher borehole discharge rates are associated with higher density and intersection of lineaments.

TI  - A New Approach to Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Prediction in Karst Mining Areas Based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a common and costly geological hazard, with regular occurrences leading to significant damage and losses. To effectively manage land use and reduce the risk of landslides, it is crucial to conduct susceptibility assessments. To date, many machine-learning methods have been applied to the landslide susceptibility map (LSM). However, as a risk prediction, landslide susceptibility without good interpretability would be a risky approach to apply these methods to real life. This study aimed to assess the LSM in the region of Nayong in Guizhou, China, and conduct a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of landslide susceptibility maps utilizing an explainable artificial intelligence. This study incorporates remote sensing data, field surveys, geographic information system techniques, and interpretable machine-learning techniques to analyze the sensitivity to landslides and to contrast it with other conventional models. As an interpretable machine-learning method, generalized additive models with structured interactions (GAMI-net) could be used to understand how LSM models make decisions. The results showed that the GAMI-net model was valid and had an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is better than the values of 0.85 and 0.81 for the random forest and SVM models, respectively. The coal mining, rock desertification, and rainfall greater than 1300 mm were more susceptible to landslides in the study area. Additionally, the pairwise interaction factors, such as rainfall and mining, lithology and rainfall, and rainfall and elevation, also increased the landslide susceptibility. The results showed that interpretable models could accurately predict landslide susceptibility and reveal the causes of landslide occurrence. The GAMI-net-based model exhibited good predictive capability and significantly increased model interpretability to inform landslide management and decision making, which suggests its great potential for application in LSM.

TI  - Greenland-Ice-Sheet Surface Temperature and Melt Extent from 2000 to 2020 and Implications for Mass Balance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of surface temperature and melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is important for tracking the ice sheet's mass balance as well as global and Arctic climate change. Using a moderate-resolution-imaging-spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived land-surface-temperature (LST) data product with a resolution of 1 km from 2000 to 2020, the temporal and spatial variations of annual and seasonal 'clear-sky' surface temperature were evaluated. We also monitored summer surface melting and studied the relationship between the mass balance of the ice sheet and changes in surface temperature and melting. The results show that the mean annual LST during the study period is -24.86 +/- 5.46 degrees C, with the highest of -22.48 +/- 5.61 degrees C in 2010 and the lowest temperature of -26.49 +/- 5.30 degrees C in 2015. With the change of season, the spatial variation of the ice-sheet surface temperature changes greatly. 2012 and 2019 experienced the warmest summers (-5.92 +/- 4.01 degrees C and -6.51 +/- 3.93 degrees C), with extreme cumulative melting detected on the ice-sheet surface (89.9% and 89.7%, respectively), and 2002 also experienced a greater extent of melting. But short period of melt in 2002 and 2019 (30.6% and 31.4%, respectively), accounted for a larger proportion, with neither the duration nor intensity of the melt reaching that of 2012. There is a strong correlation between the GrIS surface temperature and its mass balance. By fitting the relationship between surface temperature and mass balance, it was found that 93.83% (6.17%) of the ice-sheet response to surface-temperature change was via surface-mass balance (discharge and basal-mass balance).

TI  - The "True Colours" of Golden Loaches (Teleostei: Cobitidae)
T2  - FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Loaches of the genus Sabanejewia are model organisms for many ichthyologic studies focusing on morphological and colour variation. The bright lateral spots-a part of the mimicry of this fish-cause a taxonomic puzzle. Common practice is that morphometric and molecular studies lack habitat assessments of species originating from different environments. In this study, we analysed body shape and colour variation within two species of Sabanejewia in order to reveal whether they are more affected by phylogeny or environmental conditions. The environmental parameters were obtained using satellite mapping tools, body shape using geometric morphometry, and the molecular identification of specimens using an analysis of mitochondrial DNA (sequence of the cytochrome b gene). Generalized linear mixed models were used for the analysis of lateral spot numbers, and principal components analysis to describe the changes in landmark position defined by the permutation tests. Results show a significant impact of the locality elevation and specimen's sex on the change of the body shape. We identified significant differences in the number of lateral spots, which are considered mimicry variation across an elevation gradient. Morphological differences of Sabanejewia spp. vary with ecological factors along the river continuum.

TI  - Impact of an Acquisition Advanced Practice Provider on Home Hospital Patient Volumes and Length of Stay
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - In July 2020, Mayo Clinic introduced a hospital-at-home program, known as Advanced Care at Home (ACH) as an alternate option for clinically stable medical patients requiring hospital-level care. This retrospective cohort study evaluates the impact of the addition of a dedicated ACH patient acquisition Advanced Practice Provider (APP) on average length of stay (ALOS) and the number of patients admitted into the program between in Florida and Wisconsin between 6 July 2020 and 31 January 2022. Patient volumes and ALOS of 755 patients were analyzed between the two sites both before and after a dedicated acquisition APP was added to the Florida site on 1 June 2021. The addition of a dedicated acquisition APP did not affect the length of time a patient was in the emergency department or hospital ward prior to ACH transition (2.91 days [Florida] vs. 2.59 days [Wisconsin], p = 0.22), the transition time between initiation of the ACH consult to patient transfer home (0.85 days [Florida] vs. 1.16 days [Wisconsin], p = 0.28), or the total ALOS (6.63 days [Florida] vs. 6.34 days [Wisconsin], p = 0.47). The average number of patients acquired monthly was significantly increased in Florida (38.3 patients per month) compared with Wisconsin (21.6 patients per month) (p < 0.01). The addition of a dedicated patient acquisition APP resulted in significantly higher patient volumes but did not affect transition time or ALOS. Other hospital-at-home programs may consider the addition of an acquisition APP to maximize patient volumes.

TI  - Assessment of GCOM-C Satellite Imagery in Bloom Detection: A Case Study in the East China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coast of the East China Sea (ECS) is one of the regions most frequently affected by harmful algal blooms in China. Remote sensing monitoring could assist in understanding the mechanism of blooms and their associated environmental changes. Based on imagery from the Second-Generation Global Imager (SGLI) conducted by Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) (Japan), the accuracy of satellite measurements was initially validated using matched pairs of satellite and ground data relating to the ECS. Additionally, using SGLI data from the coast of the ECS, we compared the applicability of three bloom extraction methods: spectral shape, red tide index, and algal bloom ratio. With an RMSE of less than 25%, satellite data at 490 nm, 565 nm, and 670 nm showed good consistency with locally measured remote sensing reflectance data. However, there was unexpected overestimation at 443 nm of SGLI data. By using a linear correction method, the RMSE at 443 nm was decreased from 27% to 17%. Based on the linear corrected SGLI data, the spectral shape at 490 nm was found to provide the most satisfactory results in separating bloom and non-bloom waters among the three bloom detection methods. In addition, the capability in harmful algae distinguished using SGLI data was discussed. Both of the Bloom Index method and the green-red Spectral Slope method were found to be applicable for phytoplankton classification using SGLI data. Overall, the SGLI data provided by GCOM-C are consistent with local data and can be used to identify bloom water bodies in the ECS, thereby providing new satellite data to support monitoring of bloom changes in the ECS.

TI  - Semi-supervised Learning Remote Sensing Image Retrieval MethodBased on Triplet Sampling Graph Convolutional Network br
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel metric learning method based on the triplet sampling graph convolutionalnetwork is proposed to realize semi-supervised Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) for remote sensingimages. The proposed method consists of two parts: Triplet Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) and Graph-based Triplet Sampling (GTS). TGCN is composed of three parallel convolutional neural networks and graphconvolutional networks with shared weights to extract the initial features of the image and learn the graphembedding of the image. By learning simultaneously image features and graph embedding, TGCN can obtainan effective graph structure for semi-supervised image retrieval.Besides, the image similarity informationimplicit in the graph structure is evaluated by the proposed GTS algorithm to select the appropriate Hardtriplet, and the sample set composed of the Hard triplet then can be used to train effectively and quickly themodel. Through the combination of TGCN and GTS, the proposed metric learning method is tested on tworemote sensing data sets. Experimental results show that TGCN-GTS has the following two advantages: TGCNcan learn effective graph embedding features and metric space according to the image and graph structure;GTS evaluates effectively the image similarity information implicit in the image structure and then selects theappropriate Hard triplet, which improves significantly the retrieval performance of semi-supervised remotesensing images

TI  - Local Climate Zones to Identify Surface Urban Heat Islands: A Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Land Surface Temperature (LST) obtained by remote sensing data is an essential indicator for analyzing the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI). A factor contributing to its occurrence is the reflections of the different materials in urban and rural areas, which significantly affect the energy balance near the surface. Therefore, recent studies have increasingly used the Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification system to discriminate those urban areas. Therefore, our study aims to perform a systematic review using the PRISMA method of LCZ classification applied to understand the LST and the SUHI phenomenon. At first, 10,403 related articles were found in the scientific literature which, after passing through filtering stages, resulted in 51 that were further analyzed. Our results showed that these articles were very recent, beginning in 2016, and present an increasing trend. Even though all articles reviewed somehow try to understand the Urban Heat Island phenomenon, in more than half of them, the SUHI calculation method was not mentioned. China was the country with the most studies. Images from Landsat and TERRA/AQUA sensors appeared in 82% of the studies. The method that appears the most to LCZ definitions is from the World Urban Database. Finally, we conclude that LCZ mapping methodologies were accurate enough for SUHI studies considering the current climatic changes. Therefore, this systematic review can help new studies on SUHI identification through LCZ in different world areas using remote sensing data to estimate the LST.

TI  - Using Pre-Fire High Point Cloud Density LiDAR Data to Predict Fire Severity in Central Portugal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wall-to-wall prediction of fuel structural characteristics conducive to high fire severity is essential to provide integrated insights for implementing pre-fire management strategies designed to mitigate the most harmful ecological effects of fire in fire-prone plant communities. Here, we evaluate the potential of high point cloud density LiDAR data from the Portuguese aGiLTerFoRus project to characterize pre-fire surface and canopy fuel structure and predict wildfire severity. The study area corresponds to a pilot LiDAR flight area of around 21,000 ha in central Portugal intersected by a mixed-severity wildfire that occurred one month after the LiDAR survey. Fire severity was assessed through the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index computed from pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2A Level 2A scenes. In addition to continuous data, fire severity was also categorized (low or high) using appropriate dNBR thresholds for the plant communities in the study area. We computed several metrics related to the pre-fire distribution of surface and canopy fuels strata with a point cloud mean density of 10.9 m(-2). The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to evaluate the capacity of the set of pre-fire LiDAR metrics to predict continuous and categorized fire severity. The accuracy of RF regression and classification model for continuous and categorized fire severity data, respectively, was remarkably high (pseudo-R-2 = 0.57 and overall accuracy = 81%) considering that we only focused on variables related to fuel structure and loading. The pre-fire fuel metrics with the highest contribution to RF models were proxies for horizontal fuel continuity (fractional cover metric) and the distribution of fuel loads and canopy openness up to a 10 m height (density metrics), indicating increased fire severity with higher surface fuel load and higher horizontal and vertical fuel continuity. Results evidence that the technical specifications of LiDAR acquisitions framed within the aGiLTerFoRus project enable accurate fire severity predictions through point cloud data with high density.

TI  - Living Theology in a Pluralistic Latin America: An Exploration of Ecclesial Base Communities through the Lens of Social Imaginaries
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The geography, histories, and ethnic composition of the Latin American continent pose a great challenge when attempting to identify and describe the region's constitutive religious traditions and experiences. This task is further complexified by the hybridity, fluidity, and porosity of the region's cultural groups. However, there is an aspect of Latin American religiosity that shares a significant family resemblance across the continent: the small community settings in which religiosity often emerges and consolidates as a worldview, commonly known as Ecclesial base communities. Informed by liberation theology, these communities are a uniquely generative experiment in social, political, and religious life. Scholarly accounts of liberation theology fail to identify key aspects of how Ecclesial base communities generate ways of being, knowing, and making meaning. While many of these accounts depict liberation theology as a socio-political discourse of theological origin, they do not unearth the multidirectional interaction between political practice and theological thought at the heart of these communities. In this paper, I aimed to fill this gap in the literature by reframing liberation theology as a set of social imaginaries, making use of Paul Ricoeur's theories of memory and cultural imagination to provide the philosophical ground to understand the lived theology of Ecclesial base communities. In doing so, I maintain that liberation theology is not only a theoretical discourse that emerges from these communities, but also the inarticulate background of their ways of thinking, communicating, and living, one that provides an existential orientation through which Latin Americans can provide coherence to their collective action and recognize their own capacity to change their reality of oppression.

TI  - Adverse stroke outcomes amongst UK ethnic minorities: a multi-centre registry-based cohort study of acute stroke
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectiveSocioeconomic and health inequalities persist in multicultural western countries. Here, we compared outcomes following an acute stroke amongst ethnic minorities with Caucasian patients.MethodsData were prospectively collected (2014-2016) from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme for 3309 patients who were admitted with an acute stroke in four UK hyperacute stroke units. Associations between variables were examined by chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, prestroke functional limitations and co-morbidities, presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI.ResultsThere were 3046 Caucasian patients, 95 from ethnic minorities (mostly South Asians, Blacks, mixed race and a few in other ethnic groups) and 168 not stated. Compared with Caucasian patients, those from ethnic minorities had a proportionately higher history of diabetes (33.7% vs 15.4%, P < 0.001), but did not differ in other chronic conditions, functional limitations or sex distribution. Their age of stroke onset was younger both in women (76.8 year vs 83.2 year, P < 0.001) and in men (69.5 year vs 75.9 year, P = 0.002). They had greater risk for having a stroke before the median age of 79.5 year: OR = 2.15 (1.36-3.40) or in the first age quartile (< 69 year): OR = 2.91 (1.86-4.54), requiring palliative care within the first 72 h: OR = 3.88 (1.92-7.83), nosocomial pneumonia or urinary tract infection within the first 7 days of admission: OR = 1.86 (1.06-3.28), and in-hospital mortality: OR = 2.50 (1.41-4.44).ConclusionsCompared with Caucasian patients, those from ethnic minorities had earlier onset of an acute stroke by about 5 years and a 2- to fourfold increase in many stroke-related adverse outcomes and death.

TI  - Methods of Assimilation of Sea Surface Temperature Satellite Data and Their Influence on the Reconstruction of Hydrophysical Fields of the Black, Azov, and Marmara Seas Using the Institute of Numerical Mathematics Ocean Model (INMOM)
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The results are analyzed of the simulation of hydrophysical fields of the Black, Azov, and Marmara seas with the Institute of Numerical Mathematics Ocean Model (INMOM) implemented with a spatial resolution of 4 km, with various assimilation technique for sea surface temperature (SST) data from the SEVIRI sensor installed on MSG satellites. The relaxation (so called nudging) and the ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) with various assimilation time frequencies (3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-hour assimilation windows) were used as assimilation methods. It was shown that the assimilation of SST data via the EnOI made it possible to reproduce hydrophysical fields more accurately than via nudging or without assimilation at all. Even with the assimilation of SST data irregularly distributed over space and time, a decrease in the calculation error was observed over the entire sea area, and the structures of the zones of temperature rise or drop were more correctly simulated. The best results were achieved with via the EnOI assimilation with an increasing assimilation frequency over time. When SST data were assimilated using the EnOI, the mean error decreased from 0.16 degrees C (24-hour assimilation window) to 0.08 degrees C (3-hour assimilation window); accordingly, the absolute mean error decreased from 1.03 to 0.33 degrees C, and the standard deviation decreased from 1.33 to 0.42 degrees C. In addition, assimilation using the EnOI 3-hour window improved the reproduction of SST during the period of convection cooling. The assimilation of SST data also led to changes in the structure of the surface sea circulation. In some areas, the direction of currents varied within 5 degrees-10 degrees, and the velocity modulus changed by 3-5%. The assimilation of SST data only slightly reduced errors in the structure of the model vertical temperature profile, which can reach 2 degrees C at depths of 30-40 m. At depths greater than 100 m, deviations did not exceed 0.05 degrees C.

TI  - Regional atmospheric circulation patterns driving consecutive fog events in the United Arab Emirates
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the link between the occurrence of consecutive fog days in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the associated synoptic-scale circulation is investigated. This is particularly pertinent, as such a link may provide an important predictive skill for a phenomenon that has a pronounced impact on road and air traffic but is still poorly simulated by numerical models. A cluster analysis of all consecutive fog days from January 1983 to December 2021 indicated that the positive phase of the East Atlantic/Western Russia teleconnection pattern, Eastern Pacific La Nina events, and the circumglobal wavenumber 5 pattern promote the occurrence of multiple fog days in the UAE. The fog's radiative impacts, as estimated from satellite data, revealed that the fog in the UAE is more optically thick than that observed elsewhere. A trend analysis over the period 1983 to 2021 revealed that consecutive fog events have become more frequent and longer-lasting but less intense (i.e., associated with higher values of visibility). The fog's spatial extent over the UAE at its mature stage has also decreased over time. An analysis of the trends in the surface and top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes indicated that over the period 2000-2021, the fog clouds have likely become less reflective, with a statistically significant decrease in the surface downward shortwave and TOA upward longwave radiation fluxes. Long-term measurements of fog microphysics in the region are needed to better understand the variability in the properties of the fog cloud droplets.

TI  - Heavy Metal(loid) Accumulation in the Ovarian Tissue of Free-Ranging Queens and Bitches Inhabiting Highly Polluted Urban Environments
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Animals are sensitive indicators of environmental pollution and human exposure to environmental contaminants, especially heavy metal(loid)s which have adverse effects at very low concentrations. Cats and dogs meet the demands that define a good sentinel species as they share the human environment and their lifespan is long enough to show the effects of exposure over time. We studied the level of essential and non-essential heavy metal(loid)s in the ovaries of free-ranging queens and bitches of different ages inhabiting highly polluted and non-polluted urban areas of the island of Sardinia, Italy. Our main results revealed an increase in non-essential metals (i.e., cadmium and lead) in the ovarian tissue of animals living in the contaminated sites and an age-related bioaccumulation of these metals. These findings indicated that the accumulation of heavy metal(loid)s in feline and canine ovaries reflected the quality of the inhabited environment and provided new insights for the use of companion animals as sentinels to study female reproductive toxicity of environmental pollution by these chemicals in humans and animals. There is strong scientific evidence that exposure to environmental contaminants, such as heavy metal(loid)s (HMs), can impair female reproductive function. Pets, such as cats and dogs, who share the same habitat as humans, may be particularly useful sentinel models for detecting HMs in the ovary. In the present study, we compared the concentration of essential (Ems; Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn) and non-essential metal(loid)s (NEMs; Al, As, Cd, and Pb) in the ovarian tissues of free-ranging queens and bitches of different ages living in industrialized/highly polluted (south group) and non-polluted (north group) urban areas of the island of Sardinia, Italy. The results showed that both EMs and NEMs were present at detectable concentrations in feline and canine ovaries and their levels varied according to geographical areas and animal age. Among the EMs, Cu was found elevated in older queens and bitches inhabiting the southern area. Cadmium and lead were higher in feline and canine ovaries of older animals from the south compared to those living in the north. In addition, Cd and Pb concentrations increased in individuals of both species living in the south. These findings showed new perspectives for the use of pets as early warning sentinels of environmental pollution by HMs and for the risk of human exposure within a "One Health" approach. Pets may help to study the link between exposure to metals and female reproductive disturbances in mammals.

TI  - Changes in the Spatiotemporal of Net Primary Productivity in the Conventional Lake Chad Basin between 2001 and 2020 Based on CASA Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of vegetation Net Primary Productivity (NPP) has important theoretical and practical significance for ecological environment governance, carbon cycle research, and the rational development and utilization of natural resources. In this study, the spatial characteristics, temporal changes, and driving factors of NPP in the Conventional Lake Chad Basin (CLCB) were based on MODIS data by constructing a Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model and using a combination of Residual trends (RESTREND) and correlation analysis. The results showed that from 2001 to 2020, the NPP of the CLCB decreased annually (1.14 g C/m(2)), mainly because of overgrazing, deforestation, and large-scale irrigation. We conducted a driving factor analysis and found that the main influencing factor of the NPP of the CLCB is high-intensity human activities, including farmland reclamation and animal husbandry. Although the impact of climate change on NPP is not obvious in the short term, climate change may help recover NPP in the long term. The continued reduction in NPP has greatly increased the difficulty of regreening the Sahel; the increase in population density and rapid urbanization have led are major contributing factors to this. Our findings have important implications for the continued implementation of stringent revegetation policies. However, owing to limited data and methods, only the overall change trend of NPP was obtained, and comprehensive follow-up studies are needed.

TI  - "This house believes that: Sentinel node biopsy alone is better than TAD after NACT for cN plus patients"
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has changed the approach to breast surgery. NACT allows de-escalation of surgery by both increasing breast conservation rates (up to 40%), the initial goal of this chemotherapy, and in particular it permits reduces axillary surgery. Furthermore, in relation to the molecular characteristics of the tumor we can have a pathological complete response (pCR) ranging from 20 to 80%.In clinically node positive (cN+) patients who converted to clinically node-negative (cN0) various prospective studies have demonstrated that the false negative rate (FNR) of the sentinel node biopsy (SNB) were higher than the acceptable 10% and strategies to reduce the FNR in cN + patients are being investigated.But all the effort to reduce the FNR does not have clinical prognostic significance. This has already been demonstrated in the literature in different randomized trials with long term follow up.The 10-year follow-up of our study confirmed our preliminary data that the use of standard SNB without the use of clip is acceptable in cN1/2 patients who become cN0 after NAT and will not translate into a worse outcome.In fact, the axillary recurrences were less than 2%. Similar positive data with different follow up were also confirmed by other studies that used SNB alone without TAD. All these studies, with encouraging results on the follow up, confirm that SN surgery alone for selected patients who have an excellent response to NACT is rationale and not oncologically inferior to AD during a short-and long-term follow-up.

TI  - Quantification of the Cooling Effect and Cooling Distance of Urban Green Spaces Based on Their Vegetation Structure and Size as a Basis for Management Tools for Mitigating Urban Climate
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban climate is receiving increased attention mainly due to climate change. There are several ways to mitigate the urban climate, but green spaces have an advantage over other cooling systems because, in addition to their climate function, they provide several other ecosystem services that enhance the sustainability of urban systems. The cooling effect of green spaces varies depending on their species composition, the structure of the vegetation, the size and shape of the green spaces or the specific characteristics of the plants. Therefore, the exact quantification of urban green space's cooling effect is of critical importance in order to be effectively applied in urban planning as a measure of climate change adaptation. In this paper, we quantified the difference in the cooling effect between urban green spaces depending on their vegetation structure (grass versus trees) and their size, and assessed to what distance from the urban green space its cooling effect can be observed. Urban green spaces were identified using Landsat orthophotomosaic and airborne laser scanning. The urban temperature was calculated as the land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat data using a single-channel method. To quantify differences in the magnitude of the cooling effect of green spaces and the distance from the edge of the green space over which the cooling effect occurs, we used a one-way analysis of variance and regression analyses. Our results show that the cooling intensity, as well as the cooling distance, are dependent on the size and structure of the green space. The most significant cooling effect is provided by large green tree spaces, where the cooling intensity (difference of LST compared to an urban area without vegetation) was almost 4.5 degrees C on average (maximum almost 6 degrees C) and the cooling distance was significant up to 90 m (less significantly up to 180 m). Large grass spaces and medium tree spaces have similar effects, with a higher cooling intensity (2.9 degrees C versus 2.5 degrees C on average) however, the cooling effect extends to a greater distance (up to 90 m) for medium tree spaces compared to large grass spaces, where the cooling effect only extends to 30-60 m. Small areas with trees and medium and small grass areas without trees have an average cooling intensity below 2 degrees C.

TI  - Tree Crown Detection and Delineation in a Temperate Deciduous Forest from UAV RGB Imagery Using Deep Learning Approaches: Effects of Spatial Resolution and Species Characteristics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic detection of tree crowns and estimation of crown areas from remotely sensed information offer a quick approach for grasping the dynamics of forest ecosystems and are of great significance for both biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. Among various types of remote sensing data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-acquired RGB imagery has been increasingly used for tree crown detection and crown area estimation; the method has efficient advantages and relies heavily on deep learning models. However, the approach has not been thoroughly investigated in deciduous forests with complex crown structures. In this study, we evaluated two widely used, deep-learning-based tree crown detection and delineation approaches (DeepForest and Detectree2) to assess their potential for detecting tree crowns from UAV-acquired RGB imagery in an alpine, temperate deciduous forest with a complicated species composition. A total of 499 digitized crowns, including four dominant species, with corresponding, accurate inventory data in a 1.5 ha study plot were treated as training and validation datasets. We attempted to identify an effective model to delineate tree crowns and to explore the effects of the spatial resolution on the detection performance, as well as the extracted tree crown areas, with a detailed field inventory. The results show that the two deep-learning-based models, of which Detectree2 (F1 score: 0.57) outperformed DeepForest (F1 score: 0.52), could both be transferred to predict tree crowns successfully. However, the spatial resolution had an obvious effect on the estimation accuracy of tree crown detection, especially when the resolution was greater than 0.1 m. Furthermore, Dectree2 could estimate tree crown areas accurately, highlighting its potential and robustness for tree detection and delineation. In addition, the performance of tree crown detection varied among different species. These results indicate that the evaluated approaches could efficiently delineate individual tree crowns in high-resolution optical images, while demonstrating the applicability of Detectree2, and, thus, have the potential to offer transferable strategies that can be applied to other forest ecosystems.

TI  - A Multi-Sensor Satellite Approach to Characterize the Volcanic Deposits Emitted during Etna's Lava Fountaining: The 2020-2022 Study Case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Between December 2020 and February 2022, the South East Crater of Etna has been the source of numerous eruptions, mostly characterized by the emission of lava fountains, pyroclastic material and short-lasting lava flows. Here we estimate the volume and distribution of the lava deposits by elaborating multi-source satellite imagery. SEVIRI data have been elaborated using CL-HOTSAT to estimate the lava volume emitted during each event and calculate the cumulative volume; Pleiades and WorldView-1 data have been used to derive Digital Surface Models, whose differences provide thickness distributions and hence volumes of the volcanic deposits. We find a good agreement, with the total average lava volume obtained by SEVIRI reaching 73.2 x 10(6) m(3) and the one from optical data amounting to 67.7 x 10(6) m(3). This proves the robustness of both techniques and the accuracy of the volume estimates, which provide important information on the lava flooding history and evolution of the volcano.

TI  - Globally vs. Locally Trained Machine Learning Models for Landslide Detection: A Case Study of a Glacial Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide risk mitigation is limited by data scarcity; however, this could be improved using continuous landslide detection systems. To investigate which image types and machine learning models are most useful for landslide detection in a Norwegian setting, we compared the performance of five different machine learning models, for the Jolster case study (30 July 2019), in Western Norway. These included three globally pre-trained models; (i) the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm, (ii) a combined k-means clustering and random forest classification model, and (iii) a convolutional neural network (CNN), and two locally trained models, including; (iv) classification and regression Trees and (v) a U-net CNN model. Images used included Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, as well as digital elevation model (DEM) and slope. The globally trained models performed poorly in shadowed areas and were all outperformed by the locally trained models. A maximum Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) score of 89% was achieved with a CNN U-net deep learning model, using combined Sentinel-1 and -2 images as input. This is one of the first attempts to apply deep learning to detect landslides with both Sentinel-1 and -2 images. Using Sentinel-1 images only, the locally-trained deep-learning model significantly outperformed the conventional machine learning model. These findings contribute to developing a national continuous monitoring system for landslides.

TI  - The VIIRS Cirrus Reflectance Algorithm
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The VIIRS instrument (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) on board the SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite contains 11 narrow channels (M1-M11) in the 0.4-2.5 mu m solar spectral region. The M9 channel is specifically designed for detecting thin cirrus clouds. It is centered at 1.378 mu m with a width of 15 nm, which is located within a strong atmospheric water vapor band absorption region. In comparison with the corresponding MODIS Channel 26, the VIIRS M9 channel is narrower and more sensitive for cirrus detections. Because the radiances of the M9 channel over cirrus pixels are subjected to absorption by atmospheric water vapor molecules above and within the cirrus clouds, the water vapor absorption effect needs to be properly taken into consideration when using the M9 channel for quantitative removal of cirrus effects in other VIIRS channels in the 0.4-2.5 mu m spectral range. In this article, we describe in detail an empirical technique for the retrieval of cirrus reflectances in the visible and near-IR (VNIR, 0.4-1.0 mu m), where ice particles within cirrus clouds have negligible absorption effects, and in shortwave IR (SWIR, 1.0-2.5 mu m) where ice particles' absorption effects are observed. The descriptions include all elements leading to the development of the operational VIIRS cirrus reflectance algorithm, the journal literature backing up the approach, theoretical descriptions of the algorithm's physics and mathematical background, and sample retrieval results from the VIIRS data. The SNPP VIIRS cirrus reflectance data products from 1 March 2012 to the present are available from a NASA data center.

TI  - ET Partitioning Assessment Using the TSEB Model and sUAS Information across California Central Valley Vineyards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial part of commercial grapevine production in California, and the partitioning of this quantity allows the separate assessment of soil and vine water and energy fluxes. This partitioning has an important role in agriculture since it is related to grapevine stress, yield quality, irrigation efficiency, and growth. Satellite remote sensing-based methods provide an opportunity for ET partitioning at a subfield scale. However, medium-resolution satellite imagery from platforms such as Landsat is often insufficient for precision agricultural management at the plant scale. Small, unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) such as the AggieAir platform from Utah State University enable ET estimation and its partitioning over vineyards via the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model. This study explores the assessment of ET and ET partitioning (i.e., soil water evaporation and plant transpiration), considering three different resistance models using ground-based information and aerial high-resolution imagery from the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). We developed a new method for temperature partitioning that incorporated a quantile technique separation (QTS) and high-resolution sUAS information. This new method, coupled with the TSEB model (called TSEB-2T(Q)), improved sensible heat flux (H) estimation, regarding the bias, with around 61% and 35% compared with the H from the TSEB-PT and TSEB-2T, respectively. Comparisons among ET partitioning estimates from three different methods (Modified Relaxed Eddy Accumulation-MREA; Flux Variance Similarity-FVS; and Conditional Eddy Covariance-CEC) based on EC flux tower data show that the transpiration estimates obtained from the FVS method are statistically different from the estimates from the MREA and the CEC methods, but the transpiration from the MREA and CEC methods are statistically the same. By using the transpiration from the CEC method to compare with the transpiration modeled by different TSEB models, the TSEB-2T(Q) shows better agreement with the transpiration obtained via the CEC method. Additionally, the transpiration estimation from TSEB-2T(Q) coupled with different resistance models resulted in insignificant differences. This comparison is one of the first for evaluating ET partitioning estimation from sUAS imagery based on eddy covariance-based partitioning methods.

TI  - A Drought Dataset Based on a Composite Index for the Sahelian Climate Zone of Niger
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Agricultural drought monitoring in Niger is relevant for the implementation of effective early warning systems and for improving climate change adaptation strategies. However, the scarcity of in situ data hampers an efficient analysis of drought in the country. The present dataset was created for agricultural drought characterization in the Sahelian climate zone of Niger. The dataset comprises the three-month scale and monthly time series of a composite drought index (CDI) and their corresponding drought classes at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2) for the period 2000-2020. The CDI was generated from remote sensing data, namely CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). A weighing technique combining entropy and Euclidian distance was applied in the CDI derivation. From the present dataset, the extraction of the CDI time series can be performed for any location of the study area using its geographic coordinates. Therefore, seasonal drought characteristics, such as onset, end, duration, severity and frequency can be computed from the CDI time series using the theory of runs. The availability of the present dataset is relevant for the socio-economic assessment of drought impacts at small spatial scales, such as district and household level. This dataset is also important for the assessment of drought characteristics in remote areas or areas inaccessible due to civil insecurity in the country as it was entirely generated from remote sensing data. Finally, by including temperature data, the dataset enables drought modelling under global warming.

AB  - Two ancient roads have been revealed with the help of remote sensing data near Tanais, ancient Greek city in Southern Russia. These roads belong to the class of hollow ways which are often found in the vicinities of Greek settlements in the Northern Black Sea region. Very alike hollow ways were discovered in space photographs around the Bronze Age settlements in Upper Mesopotamia. It is assumed that the mechanisms for the formation of such roads both in the Northern Black Sea region and in Upper Mesopotamia are similar. The development of hollow ways is mainly associated with certain environmental conditions and a special economic model.

TI  - Assessment of Oak Groves Conservation Statuses in Natura 2000 Sacs with Single Photon Lidar and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the main objectives of Natura 2000 Network sites management plans is monitoring their conservation status under a reasonable cost and with high temporal frequency. The aim of this study is to assess the ability of single-photon light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology (14 points per m(2)) and Sentinel-2 data to classify the conservation status of oak forests in four special areas of conservation in Navarra Province (Spain) that comprise three habitats. To capture the variability of conservation status within the three habitats, we first performed a random stratified sampling based on conservation status measured in the field, canopy cover, and terrain slope and height. Thereafter, we compared two metric selection approaches, namely Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests, and two machine learning classification methods, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), to classify the conservation statuses using LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data. The best-fit classification model, which included only LiDAR metrics, was obtained using the random forest method, with an overall classification accuracy after validation of 83.01%, 75.51%, and 88.25% for Quercus robur (9160), Quercus pyrenaica (9230), and Quercus faginea (9240) habitats, respectively. The models include three to six LiDAR metrics, with the structural diversity indices (LiDAR height evenness index, LHEI, and LiDAR height diversity index, LHDI) and canopy cover (FCC) being the most relevant ones. The inclusion of the NDVI index from the Sentinel-2 image did not improve the classification accuracy significantly. This approach demonstrates its value for classifying and subsequently mapping conservation statuses in oak groves and other Natura 2000 Network habitat sites at a regional scale, which could serve for more effective monitoring and management of high biodiversity habitats.

TI  - A Physically Interpretable Rice Field Extraction Model for PolSAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and timely rice distribution information is of great value for real-time, quantitative, and localized control of rice production information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has all-weather and all-day observation capability to monitor rice distribution in tropical and subtropical areas. To improve the physical interpretability and spatial interpretability of the deep learning model for SAR rice field extraction, a new SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) value-guided explanation model (SGEM) for polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data was proposed. First, a rice sample set was produced based on field survey and optical data, and the physical characteristics were extracted using decomposition of polarimetric scattering. Then a SHAP-based Physical Feature Interpretable Module (SPFIM) combing the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and SHAP values was designed to analyze the importance of physical characteristics, a credible physical interpretation associated with rice phenology was provided, and the weight of physical interpretation was combined with the weight of original PolSAR data. Moreover, a SHAP-guided spatial interpretation network (SSEN) was constructed to internalize the spatial interpretation values into the network layer to optimize the spatial refinement of the extraction results. Shanwei City, Guangdong Province, China, was chosen as the study area. The experimental results showed that the physical explanation provided by the proposed method had a high correlation with the rice phenology, and spatial self-interpretation for finer extraction results. The overall accuracy of the rice mapping results was 95.73%, and the kappa coefficient reached 0.9143. The proposed method has a high interpretability and practical value compared with other methods.

TI  - Large-Scale Date Palm Tree Segmentation from Multiscale UAV-Based and Aerial Images Using Deep Vision Transformers
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable and efficient large-scale mapping of date palm trees from remotely sensed data is crucial for developing palm tree inventories, continuous monitoring, vulnerability assessments, environmental control, and long-term management. Given the increasing availability of UAV images with limited spectral information, the high intra-class variance of date palm trees, the variations in the spatial resolutions of the data, and the differences in image contexts and backgrounds, accurate mapping of date palm trees from very-high spatial resolution (VHSR) images can be challenging. This study aimed to investigate the reliability and the efficiency of various deep vision transformers in extracting date palm trees from multiscale and multisource VHSR images. Numerous vision transformers, including the Segformer, the Segmenter, the UperNet-Swin transformer, and the dense prediction transformer, with various levels of model complexity, were evaluated. The models were developed and evaluated using a set of comprehensive UAV-based and aerial images. The generalizability and the transferability of the deep vision transformers were evaluated and compared with various convolutional neural network-based (CNN) semantic segmentation models (including DeepLabV3+, PSPNet, FCN-ResNet-50, and DANet). The results of the examined deep vision transformers were generally comparable to several CNN-based models. The investigated deep vision transformers achieved satisfactory results in mapping date palm trees from the UAV images, with an mIoU ranging from 85% to 86.3% and an mF-score ranging from 91.62% to 92.44%. Among the evaluated models, the Segformer generated the highest segmentation results on the UAV-based and the multiscale testing datasets. The Segformer model, followed by the UperNet-Swin transformer, outperformed all of the evaluated CNN-based models in the multiscale testing dataset and in the additional unseen UAV testing dataset. In addition to delivering remarkable results in mapping date palm trees from versatile VHSR images, the Segformer model was among those with a small number of parameters and relatively low computing costs. Collectively, deep vision transformers could be used efficiently in developing and updating inventories of date palms and other tree species.

TI  - Investigating Hydroclimatic Variables Trends on the Natural Lakes of Western Greece Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Expected global climate change is allegedly becoming more intense, and the impacts on water resources are being tracked in various hydroclimatic regimes. The present research investigates a hydrologically important area of Greece, where four natural lakes are concentrated. It aims to quantify any potential long-term trends in lake water area, precipitation, and temperature timeseries. Water area timeseries spanning four decades are estimated by the mNDWI from Landsat satellite imagery and used as an index of each lake's water storage. Precipitation and temperature measurements are obtained from the open access datasets Hydroscope and ERA5-Land, respectively. All of the timeseries were tested seasonally and annually with the Pettitt and Mann-Kendal tests for statistically significant breakpoints and trends detection. No timeseries analysis resulted in a statistically significant (at 0.05 or 0.1 levels) annual or seasonal trend. The hydroclimatic regime over the past forty years in western Greece is found to have been relatively stable. Land use was also assessed to have been relatively unchanging, converging to the overall stability of the local water regime. However, the findings of this research should not be interpreted as a reassurance against climate change, but as a call to further research for the detailed regional and local assessment of climate change and hydroclimatic variability with acknowledged statistical approaches.

TI  - Faith in the Nominalistic Age? The Possible Theological Contribution of Hermeneutics
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper inquires about the defensibility of spiritual faith in this Nominalistic age, i.e., an age when all reality is reduced to scientifically ascertainable matter and all spiritual realities are deemed to be irreal. This Nominalistic worldview was developed in the late Middle Ages and became one of the major presuppositions of Modernity. It has made it ever more difficult to defend the legitimacy of faith and its objects. It also played an important, albeit seldom recognized, role in the emergence of Hermeneutical thought in the 20th Century. In his strong, if also seldom carefully studied, interpretation of Heidegger's philosophy, Gadamer saw in the Nominalism of Modernity one of the main challenges to which Heidegger's thinking wished to respond: the hegemony of the Nominalistic understanding of being would have led to the Nihilism of our technological Age and made the experience of the Divine unthinkable. After recalling the outlines of this interpretation and of the meaning of Nominalism itself, this paper argues that this Nominalism was also one of the main challenges Gadamer wanted to overcome with his Hermeneutics. It discusses how Hermeneutics strives to overcome this Nominalism by calling into question the monopoly of scientific truth (an effort summed up in the title "Truth and Method") and through its renewed understanding of language as the presentation of Being itself, which goes hand in hand with the rediscovery of the Platonic metaphysics of the Beautiful. Hermeneutics thus shows how something like faith is defensible and thus makes an important theological and metaphysical contribution.

Pets cohabiting with smoking owners may be exposed to tobacco by inhalation, absorption, or ingesting residual smoke particles. Cotinine is a product of the endogenous metabolism of nicotine, and it is used as a biomarker of environmental cigarette smoke exposure in humans. In particular, cotinine in biofluids (blood, saliva, and urine) and hair provides information on short- and long-term smoke exposure, respectively. Despite the considerable evidence of the harmful effects of active and passive tobacco smoke, few studies have explored the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and cotinine in dogs. This study aimed to measure cotinine concentration in the serum and hair of dogs that were exposed to the owner's tobacco smoke and to compare it with that of unexposed dogs. Moreover, the influence of exposure intensity (number of cigarettes), age, weight, and sex on cotinine concentration was explored. Cotinine was significantly higher in exposed than unexposed dogs in serum and fur. A sex difference in the concentration of cotinine was also evidenced. These results confirmed the role of cotinine as a sentinel of cigarette smoke exposure in dogs with a different sex sensibility. The adverse health effects of both active and passive tobacco smoke have been well-known in humans for a long time. It is presumable that even pets, which intimately share the owner's lifestyle, may be exposed to the same risks. This study aimed to detect and quantify cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) in the serum and hair of dogs using a specific commercial ELISA immunoassay kit. A total of 32 dogs, 16 exposed and 16 unexposed to the owner's smoke, were enrolled. The cotinine concentration was higher in the exposed than the unexposed group in both matrices (p < 0.001), with greater values in serum than in hair (p < 0.001). Exposed bitches had higher hair cotinine than male dogs (p < 0.001). Conversely, serum and fur cotinine concentrations were lower in female than male dogs of the unexposed group (p < 0.01). The exposure intensity, age, and weight of the dogs did not affect cotinine concentrations. A cut-off value of 2.78 ng/mL and 1.13 ng/mL cotinine concentration in serum and fur, respectively, was estimated to distinguish between the exposed and unexposed dogs. Cotinine was confirmed as a valuable marker of passive smoking also in dogs. Although owners do not perceive secondhand smoke as a risk for their dogs, greater awareness should be advisable, especially in pregnant animals.

TI  - Comparison of Data of OMI Long-Term Measurements of NO<sub>2</sub> Contents in the Stratosphere and Troposphere with the Results of Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of measuring the NO2 content in vertical columns of the stratosphere and troposphere using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the EOS Aura satellite in 2004-2020 are compared with the results of ground-based measurements at stations of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), first and foremost, with the results of measurements at the Zvenigorod Scientific Station (ZSS) of the Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences. The comparison between the satellite data and the ZSS data is performed using the two products of satellite measurements: the NO2 contents in stratospheric and tropospheric columns. When comparing the OMI data with ground-based measurements at other stations, satellite values of the NO2 content in the stratospheric column are compared to values of the total content (TC) of NO2 obtained from ground-based measurements. The correspondence between the results of satellite and ground-based measurements is characterized by the magnitude of difference between them, the linear correlation coefficients, and regression coefficients. The difference has a noticeable seasonal variation. The correlation and regression coefficients depend significantly on the season. Characteristic patterns of correlation coefficient changes with latitude, as well as specific features of correlation between satellite and ground-based data in the polar and middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere in spring, have been revealed. For some stations, the dependence of quantitative characteristics of the correspondence between the results of satellite and ground-based measurements on cloudiness has been found. Under cloudless conditions at the ZSS, a weakening of the correlation between the satellite and ground-based values of the stratospheric NO2 content and an increase in the correlation between the values of the tropospheric NO2 content is observed. The dependence of the correspondence characteristics between the data of satellite and ground-based measurements on the level of pollution of the lower troposphere by nitrogen oxides is revealed. The correlation between the values of the tropospheric NO2 content in the vicinity of ZSS under strong pollution increases, while the correlation between the values of the stratospheric NO2 content decreases. Based on the results of the comparison of satellite and ground-based data, estimates of the upper threshold values of the tropospheric NO2 content at different stations are found. The lowest values are obtained for polar stations, and the highest value are obtained for the ZSS, which is most susceptible to anthropogenic pollution due to its proximity to the Moscow megapolis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution Pattern and Driving Factors Analysis of GPP in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region by Long-Term MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is an important parameter that represents the productivity of vegetation and responses to various ecological environments. Using the Mann-Kendall methods, Pearson correlation, and the Geodetector, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variation and driving factors of GPP from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that (1) in terms of spatial distribution, GPP showed a trend of "low-high-low" regions, with low values for grassland and arable land and a high value for forest land. The growth trend is fast in forest areas, while the growth trend is not obvious in cultivated areas. The regions with significant growth accounted for 68.73% of the whole region. (2) The whole region shows a growth rate of 2.07 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), showing obvious seasonality, with a slow growth trend in spring and autumn and a fast growth trend in summer. (3) The driving factors of GPP spatial differentiation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region were land surface temperature, land use type, and nighttime light data, while precipitation and downward surface shortwave radiation show no strong explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of GPP, which means that these two factors have less driving force on the spatial differentiation of GPP. The interaction of LUCC with the other factors presents two-factor enhancement, while the LST interaction with the other three factors presents non-linear enhancement. This study could provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution and Main Influencing Factors of Grasshopper Potential Habitats in Two Steppe Types of Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasshoppers can greatly interfere with agriculture and husbandry, and they will breed and grow rapidly in suitable habitats. Therefore, it is necessary to extract the distribution of the grasshopper potential habitat (GPH), analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics of the GPH, and detect the different effects of key environmental factors in the meadow and typical steppe. To achieve the goal, this study took the two steppe types of Xilingol (the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China) as the research object and coupled them with the MaxEnt and multisource remote sensing data to establish a model. First, the environmental factors, including meteorological, vegetation, topographic, and soil factors, that affect the developmental stages of grasshoppers were obtained. Secondly, the GPH associated with meadow and typical steppes from 2018 to 2022 were extracted based on the MaxEnt model. Then, the spatial-temporal characteristics of the GPHs were analyzed. Finally, the effects of the habitat factors in two steppe types were explored. The results demonstrated that the most suitable and moderately suitable areas were distributed mainly in the southern part of the meadow steppe and the eastern and southern parts of the typical steppe. Additionally, most areas in the town of Gaorihan, Honggeergaole, Jirengaole, as well as the border of Wulanhalage and Haoretugaole became more suitable for grasshoppers from 2018 to 2022. This paper also found that the soil temperature in the egg stage, the vegetation type, the soil type, and the precipitation amount in the nymph stage were significant factors both in the meadow and typical steppes. The slope and precipitation in the egg stage played more important roles in the typical steppe, whereas the aspect had a greater contribution to the meadow steppe. These findings can provide a methodical guide for grasshopper control and management and for further ensuring the security of agriculture and husbandry.

TI  - Detection and Attribution of Alpine Inland Lake Changes by Using Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine inland lake dynamics have been good indicators of changes in terrestrial hydrological cycles under global climate change. However, the relationship between alpine inland lake and climatic factors remained largely uncertain. This study examines the spatial-temporal change of the fluctuation of the lake by using dense time series Landsat TM/ETM/OLI images to delineate water boundary information based on the Random Forest algorithm and using ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) dataset to monitor changes in variations of water level. Variations of Qinghai Lake (QHL) were analyzed from 1987 to 2020 and the mechanism of these changes was discussed with meteorological data. The results indicated that the QHL fluctuated strongly showing a pattern of shrinkage-expansion over the last three decades. The lake storage significantly decreased by -2.58 x 10(8) m(3)center dot yr(-1) (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.01) from 1989 to 2004 and sharply increased (6.92 x 10(8) m(3)center dot yr(-1), R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.01) after 2004. The relationship between the lake and climate over the last 30 years implies that the decreasing evaporation and increasing precipitation were the major factors affecting the fluctuation of lake storage. Meanwhile, the temporal heterogeneity of the driving mechanism of climate change led to the phased characteristics of lake storage change. In detail, obvious warming led to the shrinkage of the QHL before 2004 through increasing evaporation, while humidifying and accelerating wind stilling dominated the expansion of the QHL after 2004 by increasing precipitation and decreasing evaporation. This paper indicated that the frameworks of multi-source remote sensing and accurate detection of water bodies were required to protect the high-altitude lakes from further climate changes based on the findings of this paper of the QHL recently. The framework presented herein can provide accurate detection and monitoring of water bodies in different locations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and provide a necessary basis for future political activities and decisions in terms of sustainable water resource management.

TI  - Late Holocene morphodynamic evolution of Thamirabarani delta and Thoothukudi tombolo in South India: insights from integrated analysis of early cartographic documents and satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The age of discovery and exploration (fifteenth-sixteenth century CE) in Europe and later colonisation of newly explored territories by Portuguese, Spanish, Danish, French, Dutch, and British led to extensive mapping/charting of coastal regions around the globe for navigation, as well as for political and military purposes. These sea charts and coastal maps contain rich geomorphological details and offer unique geographical inputs for studying past geomorphic processes. By meticulously combining data from early sea charts, maps, historical textual records, and satellite images, the current study intends to illustrate their relevance in comprehending the long-term (from the past few centuries to a few thousand years) geomorphological processes. The study area includes the coast of the Thamirabarani delta and the Thoothukudi coast in southeast Tamil Nadu, which is known for its historically important ports, viz. Korkai and Kayal or Palayakayal. These places, were functional ports in the past, are now located a few kilometres inland. This study provides the following multifaceted outcomes: 1) offered a novel understanding of the morphodynamic evolution of the Thamirabarani delta and Thoothukudi tombolo; 2) revealed the value of early maps not only in tracing the geomorphic dynamics and dating the observed changes but also in developing a better understanding of the interpretation keys of remote sensing data; 3) provided an understanding of anthropogenic impressions on the landscape (street pattern or agricultural field pattern) driven by geomorphic changes; the identification of these patterns help validating the content of early maps. Integrated study of early cartographic documents (widely available in various archives and libraries around the world) has a high potential to advance the understanding of the morphodynamic evolution of various coastal landforms at a global scale.

TI  - Typological, etymological and cognitive aspects of comparing phraseological units of military topics in Russian and Chinese
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phraseology is part of the cultural heritage, reflecting the peculiarities of the worldview and the value system of a particular people. In this regard, phraseological units of military topics can give an idea of the perception of war and the army within the framework of individual cultures and languages. Since war is an integral part of life in most countries of the world, the peculiarities of the attitude towards it embodied in the language make it possible to understand its significance for the bearers of a particular culture. The aim of the study is to compare the phraseology of the military theme of the Russian and Chinese languages in the typological, etymological and cognitive aspects. This is the first time such a study is being conducted. The research material was Russian (284 units) and Chinese (3773 and 290 units) phraseological units extracted from various Russian-language and Chinese lexicographic publications (11 titles). In the course of the study, methods of continuous sampling, directional selection and simple probabilistic sampling, methods of linguistic observation and description, systematization and classification, comparative analysis, interpretation of data and their statistical processing, synthesis, abstraction and generalization were used. The types of phraseological units of military topics in the Russian and Chinese languages were established; the sources and time of origin of phraseology of military topics were described; the main mechanism for the formation of phraseological meanings of military idioms was identified; semantic groups of metaphorized images of phraseological units of military topics in the two languages were identified; the differences and similarities of the named semantic groups were indicated. The study concludes that the Chinese military phraseology is more anthropocentric and anthropomorphic in comparison with the Russian military phraseological system. In general, the results of the study allow characterizing the military phraseology of the Chinese language as having emerged in an earlier period and having a greater number of units. This is explained both by the longer period of existence of the Chinese civilization and the typological features of the system of Chinese hieroglyphic writing, which has preserved written monuments containing phraseological units for thousands of years, and by the importance of war and the military sphere in Chinese culture.

TI  - Groin Surveillance by Serial Ultrasonography Rather Than Sentinel Node Biopsy or Inguinofemoral Lymphadenectomy for Patients with Vulvar Cancer: A Pilot Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Vulvar cancer is a rare disease, but its treatment often causes significant issues with body image. One such issue is chronic lower limb lymphedema, which commonly occurs following the resection of groin lymph nodes. The status of these nodes is the most important prognostic factor for patients with vulvar cancer, and all patients but those with small, superficially invasive cancers currently require some form of groin dissection. If patients recur in an undissected groin, there is a 90% mortality rate. We have hypothesized that it may be possible to avoid groin dissection in selected patients by performing serial ultrasonography of the groin for at least 12 months. In this pilot study on 32 patients, we were able to identify three patients (9.4%) with positive nodes upon ultrasound. After groin dissection and radiation therapy, one patient (3.1%) died while 90.7% of groins were preserved intact. A pilot study was conducted to determine whether 3-monthly groin ultrasonography could eliminate groin dissection after a negative bilateral groin ultrasound in three groups of patients: (i) Those with a unifocal stage 1B squamous cell carcinoma of up to 20 mm in diameter. (ii) Those with an ipsilateral squamous cell carcinoma of any size which extended to within 1 cm either side of the midline. These patients underwent ipsilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy and ultrasonic surveillance of the contralateral groin. (iii) Patients with multifocal invasive lesions with the largest individual focus 20 mm or less in diameter. Three additional patients were added because they either refused groin dissection or were considered unfit for surgery. All ultrasonically positive nodes were confirmed histologically. Thirty-two patients were entered, and no patients were lost to follow-up. Forty-three groins were followed. With a median follow-up of 37 months, three positive nodes (9.4%) were detected. One patient died of her recurrence (3.1%), and 39 groins (90.7%) were preserved. The overall sensitivity of ultrasonic surveillance was 100% (95% CI: 44-100%), with a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 83-99%) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 88-100%). This pilot justifies a larger study on serial ultrasonography in lieu of groin dissection in selected patients with vulvar cancer.

TI  - Simulation of Urban Areas Exposed to Hazardous Flash Flooding Scenarios in Hail City
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the United Nations (UN), an additional 1.35 billion people will live in cities by 2030. Well-planned measures are essential for reducing the risk of flash floods. Flash floods typically inflict more damage in densely populated areas. The province of Hail encompasses 120,000 square kilometers, or approximately 6% of the total land area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Due to its innate physiographic and geologic character, Hail city is susceptible to a wide variety of geo-environmental risks such as sand drifts, flash floods, and rock falls. The aim of this work is to evaluate the rate of urban sprawl in the Hail region using remote sensing data and to identify urban areas that would be affected by simulated worst-case flash floods. From 1984 to 2022, the global urbanization rate increased from 467 to 713% in the Hail region. This is a very high rate of expansion, which means that the number of urban areas exposed to the highest level of flood risk is rising every year. With Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA), a wide range of hydrologic scenarios can be simulated. The data sources for the soil type, infiltration, and initial moisture were utilized to create the coverage and index maps. To generate virtual floods, we ran the GSSHA model within the Watershed Modeling System (WMS) program to create the hazard map for flash flooding. This model provides a suitable method based on open access data and remote data that can help planners in developing countries to create the risk analysis for flash flooding.

TI  - Modelling of Acid Mine Drainage in Open Pit Lakes Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series: A Case Study from Lusatia, Germany
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong acid mine drainage (AMD) processes in the flooded, formerly open pits in the Lusatia area present an enormous environmental challenge for the rehabilitation of the post-mining landscape. Extensive and costly monitoring is required for optimal AMD management and remediation planning and control. Because of the large size of the area and the dimension of the problem, the regular sampling can only provide limited point data, which needs to be extrapolated to the entire area. Consequently, the search for effective approaches for extrapolating the point data to the area of all water bodies is essential for rehabilitation success monitoring and for understanding the dependencies between AMD and environmental factors such as land use, weather conditions, geology, and hydrogeology. The main aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the quantitative mapping of acid mine drainage (AMD) constituents, such as dissolved iron, pH value, and sulfate in large water bodies, for an area of approximately 7220 km(2) (the area of the pit lakes is about 185 km(2)). Correlations between different chemical water parameters were also investigated. An extensive water monitoring dataset was used to train artificial neural networks for the identification of dependencies between the multispectral remote sensing data and the water quality ground measurements. Respective relationships have been identified, especially for dissolved iron and pH. These trained ANNs have been used to produce water quality maps with high spatial (10 x 10 m) and temporal (any cloud-free period) resolution, which show the wide variability of water quality in the different parts of the mining region. Concrete sources of AMD can be identified using the water quality maps of single lakes, and the success of sanitation measures such as liming was visualized. The approach opens many doors for the optimization of both the monitoring program and sanitation technology.

TI  - Estimation of dissolved organic carbon from inland waters at a large scale using satellite data and machine learning methods.
T2  - Water research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) in inland waters plays an essential role in the global carbon cycle and has significant public health effects. Machine learning (ML) together with remote sensing has emerged as a powerful and promising combination to quantify water quality parameters from space. However, inland water sample data for DOC is limited. Hence, little is known about the potential to quantify DOC content in inland waters, especially over large-scale areas. This study presents the first attempt to estimate DOC in inland waters over a large-scale area using satellite data and ML methods with the newly published open-source dataset AquaSat. Four ML approaches, namely Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and a Multilayer Backpropagation Neural Network (MBPNN) were trained using more than 16 thousand samples across the continental United States matched with satellite data from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 missions. Satellite data from the Landsat missions were further extended with environmental data from the ERA5-Land product and used as input to train the ML algorithms. Our results show that including environmental data as inputs considerably improved the prediction of DOC for all ML algorithms, with GPR showing the most promising performance results with moderate estimation errors (RMSE: 4.08 mg/L). Permutation feature importance analysis showed that the wavelength range in the visible Green band (from Landsat) and the monthly average air temperature (from ERA5-Land) were the most important variables for the ML approaches. The results demonstrate the predictive strength of GPR and its useful feature to derive per pixel standard deviations for detailed analysis. Our results further highlight the important role of considering environmental processes to explain DOC variations over large scales. The application and performance of the GPR in mapping spatiotemporal variations of DOC in an entire water body were discussed by taking Lake Okeechobee (the 8th largest freshwater lake in the U.S.) as an illustrative example. While performance evaluation showed that DOC concentrations can be retrieved with adequate accuracy, algorithm development was challenged by the heterogenous nature of large-scale open source in situ data, issues related to atmospheric correction, and the low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental predictors. This research demonstrates how open source, large-scale datasets like AquaSat in combination with ML and satellite remote sensing can make research toward large-scale estimation of inland water DOC more realistic while highlighting its remaining limitations and challenges.

TI  - Retrieval of Leaf Chlorophyll Contents (LCCs) in Litchi Based on Fractional Order Derivatives and VCPA-GA-ML Algorithms
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a significant foundation in assessing litchi photosynthetic activity and possible nutrient status. Hyperspectral remote sensing data have been widely used in agricultural quantitative monitoring research for the non-destructive assessment of LCC. Variable selection approaches are crucial for analyzing high-dimensional datasets due to the high danger of overfitting, time-intensiveness, or substantial computational requirements. In this study, the performance of five machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) was investigated based on the hyperspectral fractional order derivative (FOD) reflection of 298 leaves together with the variable combination population analysis (VCPA)-genetic algorithm (GA) hybrid strategy in estimating the LCC of Litchi. The results showed that the correlation coefficient (r) between the 0.8-order derivative spectrum and LCC had the highest correlation coefficients (r = 0.9179, p < 0.01). The VCPA-GA hybrid strategy fully utilizes VCPA and GA while compensating for their limitations based on a large number of variables. Moreover, the model was developed using the selected 14 sensitive bands from 0.8-order hyperspectral reflectance data with the lowest root mean square error in prediction (RMSEP = 5.04 mu gmiddotcm(-2)). Compared with the five MLRAs, validation results confirmed that the ridge regression (RR) algorithm derived from the 0.2 order was the most effective for estimating the LCC with the coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.88), mean absolute error (MAE = 3.40 mu gmiddotcm(-2)), root mean square error (RMSE = 4.23 mu gmiddotcm-(2)), and ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance (RPIQ = 3.59). This study indicates that a hybrid variable selection strategy (VCPA-GA) and MLRAs are very effective in retrieving the LCC through hyperspectral reflectance at the leaf scale. The proposed methods could further provide some scientific basis for the hyperspectral remote sensing band setting of different platforms, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite.

TI  - Mapping of diatom indices by remote sensing to evaluate the Um El-Naaj Marshes' water quality
T2  - International Journal of Aquatic Biology-IJAB
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the water quality of the Um El-Naaj Marshes using the community of diatoms bioindicator and mapping them by remote sensing data. From November 2018 to April 2019, epiphytic diatoms were collected from host aquatic plants of Zannichllia palustnia from six sites in the Um El-Naaj Marshes. According to the results, the Diatom Index (DI) ranged from 3.5 in autumn 2018 to 2.4 in summer 2019, i.e in sites 3 and 2, respectively. The index of trophic diatoms (TDI) for the majority of study sites showed the mesotrophic state ranged from 47.5 to 62.5 in all seasons. Except for site 2, which had the lowest value (35) in the summer of 2019, and station 3 which had a greater value than 60 in the Autumn of 2018 and spring of 2019, other sites had oligo-mesotrophic states. The general diatomic index (GDI) values showed the lowest value (9.6) at site 2 in the summer of 2019 and the greatest value (14.4) at site 3 in the spring of 2019. In addition, in the current study, maps were produced using remote sensing methods to visualize the values close to the studied sites to show the quality state of the whole marsh.

TI  - Generalized Spectral Super-resolution for Multispectral Satellite Imagings
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral super-resolution, a very important computational imaging technology to obtain high spatial-resolution hyperspectral images at a tow cost, has received more and more attention. However, the existing works about spectral super-resolution are all based on the assumption that there is only spectral degradation between the observed multispectral data and the real spectra. For multispectral satellites, different imaging modes also include spatial degradation. For this type of data, the existing spectral super-resolution usually uses only a part of the multispectral data to reconstruct hyperspectral data, which will lead to the waste of multispectral data. This paper extends the traditional spectral super resolution to the generalized spectral super resolution by summarizing the imaging modes of different multispectral satellites. There are FusSR, which makes full use of the additional nmitispectral hands with a lower spatial resolution to further optimize the spectral reconstruction, and PansSR, which uses the panchromatic channel with a higher spatial resolution to simultaneously improve the spatial resolution of the reconstructed hyperspectral data. The above two extended spectral super resolution technologies have made the best of all multispectral data. Besides, after modeling the imaging degradation, the generalized spectral super resolution is expressed as an optimal problem containing two data fidelity terms and one image prior term. To ensure the algorithm's physical interpretability, the deep unrolling strategy is adopted to build a generalized spectral super-resolution network that combines data-driven and model-driven manner. In addition, the idea of spectral grouping is also employed to generate the initial results. The spectral grouping includes three steps. Firstly, the difference information between bands is calculated. Then the coverage relationship of spectral response function between hyperspectral images and multispectral images is counted. Lastly, bands with high correlation are uniformly reconstructed, so as to eliminate mutual interference between bands with a large radiation gap. To discuss the feasibility of combining model driven and data driven algorithms in the generalized spectral super resolution problem, this paper proposed multiple multispectral satellite data sets, named Sen2OHS and GF2Hyper respectively. The former includes four high-resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral hands, four low-resolution Sentinel-2 multispectral bands, and 32 high resolution Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral bands; the latter includes four low resolution nmitispectral bands, one high-resolution panchromatic hand and 63 high-resolution hyperspectral hands. CC, mPSNR, mSSIM and SAM are used to evaluate the reconstruction quality. Comparing the results of traditional sSR and FusSR, we can find that the quantitative result of FusSR is higher than sSR. It can be inferred that introducing additional spectral information can effectively improve the spectral reconstruction results, even if they are low spatial resolution. Comparing the data before and after PansSR, we can see that not only the spectral channel number of the input data has increased, but also its spatial resolution has been improved. Above resulets show that using higher resolution panchannatic data can effectively help spectral super resolution improve spatial resolution.Whether in FusSR or PansSR, their experimental results in this paper effectively prove that a broader concept of spectral super-resolution should he proposed for remote sensing satellite data to effectively reduce data waste.

TI  - Evaluation of Habitat Suitability for Asian Elephants in Sipsongpanna under Climate Change by Coupling Multi-Source Remote Sensing Products with MaxEnt Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus Linnaeus) is a globally endangered species, an internationally protected species, and a first-class protected animal in China. However, future climate change and human activities exacerbate the instability of its habitat range, leading to a possible reduction in the range. By using multi-source remote sensing data and products, as well as climate change models, including ASTER GDEM v3, Landsat8 OLI image and ClimateAP, we examined the effects of ecological factors related to climate and natural and anthropogenic influences on the distribution of Asian elephants in Sipsongpanna. Multiyear elephant field tracking data were used with a MaxEnt species distribution model and the climate model. First, the distribution of Asian elephants in potentially suitable areas in Sipsongpanna was simulated under current climatic conditions without considering human activities. The predicted distribution was verified by existing Asian elephant migration trajectories. Subsequently, the distribution of potentially suitable areas for Asian elephants in Sipsongpanna was simulated under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) in three periods (2025, 2055, and 2085). The changes in potentially suitable areas for Asian elephants in Sipsongpanna were analyzed under multiple climate change scenarios for the current (2017) and different future periods by considering the effects of human activities. The results show the following: (1) under anthropogenic interference (AI), the optimal MaxEnt model has a high prediction accuracy with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.913. The feature combination (FC) includes linear, quadratic, and threshold features, and the regularization multiplier (RM) is 2.1. (2) Jackknife analyses of the non-anthropogenic interference (NAI) and anthropogenic interference (AI) scenarios indicate that topography (altitude (Alt)), temperature (mean warmest month temperature (MWMT)), and precipitation (mean annual precipitation (MAP)) are the top three factors influencing the distribution of Asian elephants. (3) The total area suitable for Asian elephants under current climate conditions and AI accounts for 46.35% of the total area. Areas of high suitability (occurrence probability >0.5) are located in Jinghong City in central Sipsongpanna and Mengla County in southeastern Sipsongpanna. Among them, the minimum habitat range and ecological corridors are mainly located in Mengman Town, Mohan Town, Mengla Town, Mengban Township, Dadugang Township, and Mengwang Township. (4) The change in potentially suitable areas for Asian elephants between current and future conditions is small under AI and large under undisturbed conditions.

TI  - Deep Learning in Forest Tree Species Classification Using Sentinel-2 on Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of Qingyuan County
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest tree species information plays an important role in ecology and forest management, and deep learning has been used widely for remote sensing image classification in recent years. However, forest tree species classification using remote sensing images is still a difficult task. Since there is no benchmark dataset for forest tree species, a forest tree species dataset (FTSD) was built in this paper to fill the gap based on the Sentinel-2 images. The FTSD contained nine kinds of forest tree species in Qingyuan County with 8,815 images, each with a resolution of 64 x 64 pixels. The images were produced by combining forest management inventory data and Sentinel-2 images, which were acquired with less than 20% clouds from 1 April to 31 October, including the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Then, the images were preprocessed and downloaded from Google Earth Engine (GEE). Four different band combinations were compared in the paper. Moreover, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were also calculated using the GEE. Deep learning algorithms including DenseNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and ShuffleNet were trained and validated in the FTSD. RGB images with red, green, and blue (PC1, PC2, and NDVI) obtained the highest validation accuracy in four band combinations. ResNet obtained the highest validation accuracy in all algorithms after 500 epochs were trained in the FTSD, which reached 84.91%. As a famous and widely used remote sensing classification satellite imagery dataset, NWPU RESISC-45 was also trained and validated in the paper. ResNet achieved a high validation accuracy of 87.90% after training 100 epochs in NWPU RESISC-45. The paper shows in forest tree species classification based on remote sensing images and deep learning that (1) PCA and NDVI can be combined to improve the accuracy of classification; (2) ResNet is more suitable than other deep learning algorithms including DenseNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet in remote sensing classification; and (3) being too shallow or deep in ResNet does not perform better in the FTSD, that is, 50 layers are better than 34 and 101 layers.

TI  - Fresh Yield Estimation of Spring Tea via Spectral Differences in UAV Hyperspectral Images from Unpicked and Picked Canopies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, spring tea yield is mainly estimated through a manual sampling survey. Obtaining yield information is time consuming and laborious for the whole spring tea industry, especially at the regional scale. Remote sensing yield estimation is a popular method used in large-scale grain crop fields, and few studies on the estimation of spring tea yield from remote sensing data have been reported. This is a similar spectrum of fresh tea yield components to that of the tea tree canopy. In this study, two types of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral images from the unpicked and picked Anji white tea tree canopies are collected, and research on the estimation of the spring tea fresh yield is performed using the differences identified in the single and combined chlorophyll spectral indices (CSIs) or leaf area spectral indices (LASIs) while also considering the changes in the green coverage of the tea tree canopy by way of a linear or piecewise linear function. The results are as follows: (1) in the linear model with a single index variable (LMSV), the accuracy of spring tea fresh yield models based on the selected CSIs was better than that based on the selected LASIs as a whole, in which the model based on the curvature index (CUR) was the best with regard to the accuracy metrics; (2) compared to the LMSVs, the accuracy performance of the piecewise linear model with the same index variables (PLMSVs) was obviously improved, with an encouraging root mean square error (RMSE) and validation determination coefficient (VR2); and (3) in the piecewise model with the combined index variables (PLMCVs), its evaluation metrics are also improved, in which the best performance of them was the CUR&CUR model with a RMSE (124.602 g) and VR2 (0.625). It showed that the use of PLMSVs or PLMCVs for fresh tea yield estimation could reduce the vegetation index saturation of the tea tree canopy. These results show that the spectral difference discovered through hyperspectral remote sensing can provide the potential capability of estimating the fresh yield of spring tea on a large scale.

TI  - Rapid Assessment of 2022 Floods around the UNESCO Site of Mohenjo-Daro in Pakistan by Using Sentinel and Planet Labs Missions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This communication study aims to provide evidence on how Sentinel sensors and Copernicus Programme's contributing missions can support heritage endangered by natural hazards. The recent catastrophic floods of 2022 in Pakistan, mainly in the Indus Valley, threatened one of the most iconic sites within the country; thus, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Mohenjo-Daro was selected here as a case study. Even if the main area of the site was not directly affected by the floods but rather by the heavy rains, its landscape suffered profound damage. This study aims to report a combined remote-sensing methodology for a rapid assessment of the flooded areas around the site. By using Sentinel-1 radar data in combination with mid-resolution Sentinel-2 data and Planet Lab images, it was possible to accurately map the affected areas near the site. This approach can be used to better understand the extent of the affected areas and build a better recovery strategy. A near-real-time satellite-based investigation and observations combining various sensors and resolutions (Sentinel 1 and 2 images, as well as Planet Lab images) can provide valuable insights for local heritage managers.

TI  - Neutrophil CEACAM1 determines susceptibility to NETosis by regulating the S1PR2/S1PR3 axis in liver
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Neutrophils, the largest innate immune cell population in humans, are the primary proinflammatory sentinel in the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mechanism in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1, CC1, or CD66a) is essential in neutrophil activation and serves as a checkpoint regulator of innate immune-driven IRI cascade in OLT. Although CC1 alternative splicing generates two functionally distinct short and long cytoplasmic isoforms, their role in neutrophil activation remains unknown. Here, we undertook molecular and functional studies to interrogate the significance of neutrophil CC1 signaling in mouse and human OLT recipients. In the experimental arm, we employed a mouse OLT model to document that ablation of recipient-derived neutrophil CC1-long (CC1-L) isotype aggravated hepatic IRI by promoting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Notably, by regulating the S1P-S1PR2/S1PR3 axis, neutrophil CC1-L determined susceptibility to NET formation via autophagy signaling. In the clinical arm, liver grafts from 55 transplant patients selectively enriched for neutrophil CC1-L showed relative resistance to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) stress/ tissue damage, improved hepatocellular function, and clinical outcomes. In conclusion, despite neutrophils being considered a principal villain in peritransplant tissue injury, their CC1-L isoform may serve as a regulator of IR stress resistance/NETosis in human and mouse OLT recipients.

TI  - Tsunami Risk Change Analysis for Qidong County of China Based on Land Use Classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tsunamis can cause high numbers of casualties, as well as direct and indirect economic losses to coastal regions. The huge destructiveness of tsunamis requires us to study tsunami risk and its temporal change. We adopt the tsunami scenarios of the Ryukyu Trench as an example to analyze the temporal change in tsunami risk. According to the tsunami numerical model results, the tsunami inundation in the worst tsunami scenario covered an area of 82.83 km(2). Satellite data including Landsat 8 images from July 2013 and Landsat 9 images from March 2022 were used with the random forest (RF) method to analyze land use and tsunami vulnerability in 2013 and 2022. The tsunami risk and its temporal change were analyzed by integrating tsunami hazard and tsunami vulnerability. The tsunami risk change analysis results show that the area of tsunami risk level 1 increased by 4.57 km(2), and the area of tsunami risk level 4 decreased by 7.31 km(2). By analyzing changes in land use and land cover (LULC) and tsunami risk, we concluded that the expansion of constructed land and the increase in coastal population were responsible for the increase in tsunami risk. The results of tsunami risk change analysis will help us understand the current tsunami risk and predict possible future risk change. In addition, it is necessary to prepare tsunami prevention measures in advance and produce tsunami emergency response plans for Qidong County and other regions under potential tsunami threat.

TI  - Dynamics of the eco-environmental quality in response to land use changes in rapidly urbanizing areas: A case study of Wuhan, China from 2000 to 2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic land use changes that occur in rapidly urbanized areas are important inducement to changes in the eco-environmental quality. Investigating urban land use changes and their eco-environmental quality responses can provide theoretical support and a decision-making basis for sustainable and high-quality development in rapidly urbanizing areas. Taking Wuhan, China, as the study area, this paper extracts land use information using Landsat satellite remote sensing images and a support vector machine classification. Based on this, a remote sensing-based ecological index evaluation model including humidity, greenness, dryness and heat is constructed to explore the changes in land use and their eco-environmental quality responses from 2000 to 2018. The results show that (1) the structure, extent and spatial layout of land use in Wuhan from 2000 to 2018 have undergone tremendous changes under rapid urbanization, and the change of construction land is the greatest among all land use types; (2) the overall quality of eco-environment in Wuhan continues to improve as the scale of the improved eco-environment areas is greater than that of the deteriorated areas. The direction and magnitude of the impact of each indicator on the eco-environmental quality are different; (3) the improvement or deterioration of eco-environmental quality is closely related to the changes of different land use types within the study area. The eco-environmental quality shows significant spatial heterogeneity, especially between the main urban areas and the suburban areas. This paper argues that reasonably adjusting the land use structure can serve to maintain or even improve the quality of the regional eco-environment. Finally, this study puts forward suggestions for the coordinated development of land use and the eco-environment in rapidly urbanizing areas.

TI  - Mapping Diverse Paddy Rice Cropping Patterns in South China Using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice cropping patterns (PRCPs) play important roles in both agroecosystem modeling and food security. Although paddy rice maps have been generated over several regions using satellite observations, few studies have focused on mapping diverse smallholder PRCPs, which include crop rotation and are dominant cropping structures in South China. Here, an approach called the feature selection and hierarchical classification (FSHC) method was proposed to effectively identify paddy rice and its rotation types. Considering the cloudy and rainy weather in South China, a harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) surface reflectance product was employed to increase high-quality observations. The FSHC method consists of three processes: cropping intensity mapping, feature selection, and decision tree (DT) model development. The FSHC performance was carefully evaluated using crop field samples obtained in 2018 and 2019. Results suggested that the derived cropping intensity map based on the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtered normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series was reliable, with an overall accuracy greater than 93%. Additionally, the optimal spectral (i.e., normalized difference water index (NDWI) and land surface water index (LSWI)) and temporal (start-of-season (SOS) date) features for distinguishing different PRCPs were successfully identified, and these features are highly related to the critical growth stage of paddy rice. The developed DT model with three hierarchical levels based on optimal features performed satisfactorily, and the identification accuracy of each PRCP can be achieved approximately 85%. Furthermore, the FSHC method exhibited similar performances when mapping PRCPs in adjacent years. These results demonstrate that the proposed FSHC approach with HLS data can accurately extract diverse PRCPs over fragmented croplands; thus, this approach represents a promising opportunity for generating refined crop type maps.

TI  - Updating Active Deformation Inventory Maps in Mining Areas by Integrating InSAR and LiDAR Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope failures, subsidence, earthworks, consolidation of waste dumps, and erosion are typical active deformation processes that pose a significant hazard in current and abandoned mining areas, given their considerable potential to produce damage and affect the population at large. This work proves the potential of exploiting space-borne InSAR and airborne LiDAR techniques, combined with data inferred through a simple slope stability geotechnical model, to obtain and update inventory maps of active deformations in mining areas. The proposed approach is illustrated by analyzing the region of Sierra de Cartagena-La Union (Murcia), a mountainous mining area in southeast Spain. Firstly, we processed Sentinel-1 InSAR imagery acquired both in ascending and descending orbits covering the period from October 2016 to November 2021. The obtained ascending and descending deformation velocities were then separately post-processed to semi-automatically generate two active deformation areas (ADA) maps by using ADATool. Subsequently, the PS-InSAR LOS displacements of the ascending and descending tracks were decomposed into vertical and east-west components. Complementarily, open-access, and non-customized LiDAR point clouds were used to analyze surface changes and movements. Furthermore, a slope stability safety factor (SF) map was obtained over the study area adopting a simple infinite slope stability model. Finally, the InSAR-derived maps, the LiDAR-derived map, and the SF map were integrated to update a previously published landslides' inventory map and to perform a preliminary classification of the different active deformation areas with the support of optical images and a geological map. Complementarily, a level of activity index is defined to state the reliability of the detected ADA. A total of 28, 19, 5, and 12 ADAs were identified through ascending, descending, horizontal, and vertical InSAR datasets, respectively, and 58 ADAs from the LiDAR change detection map. The subsequent preliminary classification of the ADA enabled the identification of eight areas of consolidation of waste dumps, 11 zones in which earthworks were performed, three areas affected by erosion processes, 17 landslides, two mining subsidence zone, seven areas affected by compound processes, and 23 possible false positive ADAs. The results highlight the effectiveness of these two remote sensing techniques (i.e., InSAR and LiDAR) in conjunction with simple geotechnical models and with the support of orthophotos and geological information to update inventory maps of active deformation areas in mining zones.

TI  - Large-scale burn severity mapping in multispectral imagery using deep semantic segmentation models
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays Earth observation satellites provide forest fire authorities and resource managers with spatial and comprehensive information for fire stabilization and recovery. Burn severity mapping is typically performed by classifying bi-temporal indices (e.g., dNBR, and RdNBR) using thresholds derived from parametric models incorporating field-based measurements. Analysts are currently expending considerable manual effort using prior knowledge and visual inspection to determine burn severity thresholds. In this study, we aim to employ highly automated approaches to provide spatially explicit damage level estimates. We first reorganize a large-scale Landsat-based bi-temporal burn severity assessment dataset (Landsat-BSA) by visual data cleaning based on annotated MTBS data (approximately 1000 major fire events in the United States). Then we apply state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) based methods to map burn severity based on the Landsat-BSA dataset. Experimental results emphasize that multi-class semantic segmentation algorithms can approximate the threshold-based techniques used extensively for burn severity classification. UNet-like models outperform other region-based CNN and Transformer-based models and achieve accurate pixel-wise classification results. Combined with the online hard example mining algorithm to reduce class imbalance issue, Attention UNet achieves the highest mIoU (0.78) and the highest Kappa coefficient close to 0.90. The bi-temporal inputs with ancillary spectral indices work much better than the uni-temporal multispectral inputs. The restructured dataset will be publicly available and create opportunities for further advances in remote sensing and wildfire communities.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change Detection and NDVI Estimation in Pakistan's Southern Punjab Province
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes are among the most significant human-caused global variations affecting the natural environment and ecosystems. Pakistan's LULC patterns have undergone huge changes since the 1900s, with no clear mitigation plan. This paper aims to determine LULC and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes as well as their causes in Pakistan's Southern Punjab province over four different periods (2000, 2007, 2014, and 2021). Landsat-based images of 30 m x 30 m spatial resolution were used to detect LULC changes, while NDVI dynamics were calculated using Modis Product MOD13Q1 (Tiles: h24 v5, h24 v6) at a resolution of 250 m. The iterative self-organizing (ISO) cluster method (object meta-clustering using the minimal distance center approach) was used to quantify the LULC changes in this research because of its straightforward approach that requires minimal human intervention. The accuracy assessment and the Kappa coefficient were calculated to assess the efficacy of results derived from LULC changes. Our findings revealed considerable changes in settlements, forests, and barren land in Southern Punjab. Compared to 2000, while forest cover had reduced by 31.03%, settlement had increased by 14.52% in 2021. Similarly, forest land had rapidly been converted into barren land. For example, barren land had increased by 12.87% in 2021 compared to 2000. The analysis showed that forests were reduced by 31.03%, while settlements and barren land increased by 14.52% and 12.87%, respectively, over the twenty year period in Southern Punjab. The forest area had decreased to 4.36% by 2021. It shows that 31.03% of forest land had been converted to urban land, barren ground, and farmland. Land that was formerly utilized for vegetation had been converted into urban land due to the expansion of infrastructure and the commercial sector in Southern Punjab. Consequently, proper monitoring of LULC changes is required. Furthermore, relevant agencies, governments, and policymakers must focus on land management development. Finally, the current study provides an overall scenario of how LULC trends are evolving over the study region, which aids in land use planning and management.

TI  - The terror management and sorrow management of death consciousness
T2  - ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep in our consciousness, we all know that we will die someday. The management of mortality and death-related emotions influence our behavior profoundly. Terror Management Theory ( TMT) and Death Reflection (DR) theory postulate different directions to manage mortality salience (MS; i.e., reminding people of their mortality). While TMT proposes a series of external defenses to restrain the fear of mortality, DR focuses on inner growth when contemplating our mortality. On the other hand, the role of emotion in managing mortality is a major challenge: Firstly, does MS lead to changes in emotion? Secondly, if MS does influence emotion, what are the main emotions that can be induced? Thirdly, what role do emotions play when mortality becomes salient? Based on the reflective function of sadness, the present study proposed the "sorrow management assumption", and hypothesized that MS would induce fear and sadness; death reflection would evoke more sadness, while pure mortality salience would evoke more fear. Next, we expected that fear and sadness would lead to two different modes of response to MS, i.e., "fear management" and " sorrow management". Finally, we proposed that fear and sadness would mediate the relationship between MS and external defenses, and MS and internal growth, respectively.The current study conducted three experiments to compare the "sorrow management" and "terror management" of MS. In Experiment 1, 82 participants were recruited to explore the emotional changes during and after MS by using a variety of emotion measurement methods (i.e., micro-expression, self-report emotion, physiological skin conductance response, and heart rate). In Experiment 2, 152 participants were recruited. Two death consciousness manipulations (mortality salience paradigm, death reflection paradigm) were used to explore the different after-effects of two death management patterns (i.e., "sorrow management" and "terror management") on external defense and internal growth. Additionally, the mediating role of emotion (fear, sadness) was also explored. In Experiment 3, 182 participants were recruited to explore the different effects of terror and sorrow management. Sad and fearful background music was used to arouse respective emotions when conducting mortality salience manipulations.The results of Experiment 1 showed that reminding people of their mortality led to increased sadness and fear, and the death reflection paradigm (vs. mortality salience paradigm) aroused significantly more sadness. The results of Experiment 2 did not find significant differences between the two different manipulations on the external defense (i.e., worldview defense, external life goal structure) and internal growth ( i.e., internal life goal structure), but found that fear mediated the effect of MS on external defense (i. e., external life goal structure). The results of Experiment 3 did not observe a significant MS effect on the external defense (i.e., self-esteem striving, external life goal structure), but found that MS prompted the participants to attach more importance to internal growth (i. e., internal life goal structure) in sad (not fear) background music; emotion ( i.e., sadness, fear) did not function as a mediator in the relationship between MS and internal life goal structure; background music (i.e., sadness, fear) functioned as a moderator in the relationship between MS and internal life goal structure.In conclusion, these results indicated that MS did elicit sadness and fear, especially sadness, and death reflection elicited more sadness than pure mortality salience; fear played a mediating role between MS and external defense (i.e., external life goal structure); MS promoted internal growth (i.e., internal life goal structure) under sadness ( not fear) background music. The current study expands the understanding of the role of emotions when reminding people's mortality, particularly for sadness, thus it is an important innovation and addition to TMT. The present study also provides empirical evidence for "sorrow management" of mortality, which provides enlightenment for psychological rescue in epidemics and other social disasters.

TI  - Long-Term Variability of Vegetation Cover and Its Driving Factors and Effects over the Zuli River Basin in Northwest China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation information is a critical factor in regional environment management under climate change. In this study, a typical arid and semi-arid watershed on the Loess Plateau, the Zu Li River Basin (ZRB), was selected to study the long-term changes in vegetation cover and its drivers and impacts. Unlike existing normalized vegetation index (NDVI) products, which have coarse spatial resolution and short time horizons, this study used the 30 m Landsat dataset analyzed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate high-resolution and long-term NDVI data, which are the most ideal for monitoring vegetation dynamics using long-time-series data products. The results showed that the annual mean maximum NDVI (normalized vegetation index) in the ZRB increased during 1987-2021, with a significant (p < 0.05) increasing trend in most areas. Upstream vegetation cover increased more than midstream and downstream, but the increase was smaller. Precipitation in the ZRB area was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the NDVI series, except for the upstream pass area, where human activities played an important role. NDVI was significantly (p < 0.05) negatively correlated with runoff coefficient and sand content, indicating that vegetation cover was an important reason for the decrease in runoff coefficient and sand content.

TI  - Variability of Glacier Velocity and the Influencing Factors in the Muztag-Kongur Mountains, Eastern Pamir Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier velocity is the key to understanding the nature of glaciers. Its variation plays an important role in glacier dynamics, mass balance, and climate change. The Muztag-Kongur Mountains are an important glacier region in the Eastern Pamir Plateau. Under the background of global warming, the glacier velocity variation has been widely considered, but details of the inter-annual and intra-annual changes have not been clear. In this study, we explored the inter-annual and intra-annual variations in the glacier velocity from 1990 to 2021, and the influencing factors, based on Landsat images, Inter-Mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE), and Karakoram Highway (KKH) data product analysis. The results showed the following: (1) the glacier velocity has increased since 1990, and significant growth occurred in 1995-1996. (2) A transverse profile of two typical glaciers was used to analyze the monthly variation in glacier velocity during the year. The peaks of monthly velocity occurred in May and August. (3) Since 1990, the inter-annual precipitation has increased, and the temperature increase slowed down from 2000 to 2013. The trend of inter-annual glacier velocity variation was consistent with that of the precipitation. The glacier velocity peaked in 1996/1997 due to increased precipitation in 1995. The glacier velocity over the year was consistent with the monthly precipitation trends, which indicates that precipitation has a significant influence on the change in glacier velocity. (4) In addition to temperature and precipitation, the glacier velocity variation was moderately correlated with the glacier size (length and area) and weakly correlated with the slope. The spatial distribution of glaciers shows that the spatial heterogeneity of glaciers in the Muztag-Kongur Mountains is affected by the westerly circulation. The long-term glacier velocity variation research of the Muztag-Kongur Mountains will contribute to a better understanding of glacier dynamics within the context of climatic warming, and the different influencing factors were analyzed to further explain the glacier velocity variation.

TI  - Shallow sea topography detection using fully Polarimetric Gaofen-3 SAR data based on swell patterns
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to single-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, fully polarimetric SAR data can provide more detailed information of the sea surface, which is important for applications such as shallow sea topography detection. The Gaofen-3 satellite provides abundant polarimetric SAR data for ocean research. In this paper, a shallow sea topography detection method was proposed based on fully polarimetric Gaofen-3 SAR data. This method considers swell patterns and only requires SAR data and little prior knowledge of the water depth to detect shallow sea topography. Wave tracking was performed based on preprocessed fully polarimetric SAR data, and the water depth was then calculated considering the wave parameters and the linear dispersion relationships. In this paper, four study areas were selected for experiments, and the experimental results indicated that the polarimetric scattering parameter alpha had higher detection accuracy than quad-polarization images. The mean relative errors were 14.52%, 10.30%, 12.56%, and 12.90%, respectively, in the four study areas. In addition, this paper also analyzed the detection ability of this model for different topographies, and the experiments revealed that the topography could be well recognized when the topography gradient is small, the topography gradient direction is close to the wave propagation direction, and the isobath line is regular.

T2  - Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Axillary arch is the most common type of axillary muscle fiber variation, with about 10.8% incidence in the Chinese population. Its natural forms are varied and fluid, with different starting points and terminations, and clinicians frequently lack recognition. Under commonly applicated sentinel lymph node biopsy, the axillary arch has been endowed with more clinical significance. The fabric of axillary arch will not only block lymphatic drainage in axilla and unclear anatomical level of axillary dissection, but also compress the axillary neurovascular bundle, causing upper limb venous thrombosis, lymphedema and nerve entrapment. The intumescent axillary arch may also show abnormal axillary bulge. In addition to finding axillary arch during cadaveric study and operation, several of imaging methods availably diagnose axillary arch preoperative, which can create new way for detection of axillary arch and extension of the surgical plan of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Although embryology and comparative anatomy have been used to explain the origin of the axillary arch, most of the ideas are still hypotheses and need further study.
AB  - 腋弓是常见的腋窝肌纤维变异，在中国人群中的发生率约为10.8%。它的形态多样且不固定，有不同起止点，临床医师尚缺乏对它的充分认知。随着前哨淋巴结活检逐渐获得广泛开展，腋弓的临床意义日益凸显。腋弓的存在不仅会遮挡腋窝区域淋巴结，导致腋窝淋巴结清扫解剖层次不清；还会压迫腋窝神经血管束，引起上肢静脉血栓、淋巴水肿及神经卡压等相关症状；体积明显的腋弓还会表现为腋窝异常凸起。除在尸体解剖或手术过程中发现腋弓外，目前已有多种影像学方法可对腋弓进行评估，为前哨淋巴结活检方案的制定提供参考。研究人员虽尝试用胚胎学、比较解剖学来解释腋弓的起源，但多数观点仍为假说，腋弓的起源尚需进一步研究。.

TI  - UAV aerial image target detection based on BLUR-YOLO
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology, target detection based on UAV images has increasingly become a hot spot for research. Aiming at the problems of many small target instances, complex backgrounds and difficult feature extraction in UAV images, we propose a UAV aerial image target detection algorithm called BLUR-YOLO. First, the h-swish activation function is used in the backbone network and the neck network to increase the expressiveness of the model. Second, an attention mechanism (CoordAttention) is added to the bottleneck layer of the backbone network, thereby increasing the weight of valid information and suppressing background noise interference. Finally, by removing redundant nodes of the path aggregation network (PANet), adding additional connections, and using BlurPool instead of the downsampling method, a feature pyramid network (Blur-PANet) is proposed to effectively fuse multilayer features. Experimental results on the VisDrone public dataset show that the proposed drone image object detection model (BLUR-YOLO) is 1.2% better than the YOLOv4 algorithm, which proves the effectiveness of the method.

TI  - Identifying Corn Lodging in the Mature Period Using Chinese GF-1 PMS Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient, fast, and accurate crop lodging monitoring is urgent for farmers, agronomists, insurance loss adjusters, and policymakers. This study aims to explore the potential of Chinese GF-1 PMS high-spatial-resolution images for corn lodging monitoring and to find a robust and efficient way to identify corn lodging accurately and efficiently. Three groups of image features and five machine-learning approaches are used for classifying non-lodged, moderately lodged, and severely lodged areas. Our results reveal that (1) the combination of spectral bands, optimized vegetation indexes, and texture features classify corn lodging with an overall accuracy of 93.81% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91. (2) The random forest is an efficient, robust, and easy classifier to identify corn lodging with the F1-score of 0.95, 0.92, and 0.95 for non-lodged, moderately lodged, and severely lodged areas, respectively. (3) The GF-1 PMS image has great potential for identifying corn lodging on a regional scale.

TI  - A New Approach for Assessing Groundwater Recharge by Combining GRACE and Baseflow With Case Studies in Karst Areas of Southwest China
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach combining groundwater storage change (GWSC) derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and baseflow was proposed to estimate groundwater recharge at large spatial scales but a short (monthly) time scale. This method was applied in two typical karst basins of southwest China, the Wujiang River basin (WRB, & SIM;87,900 km(2), & SIM;70% karstification) and Xijiang River Basin (XRB, & SIM;360,000 km(2), & SIM;44% karstification). The 2006-2012 monthly baseflow was first separated from in situ streamflow through multivariate regression analysis. Groundwater recharge was estimated using separated baseflow and GWSC estimated from GRACE data and observation-based groundwater-level data. The comparison between GRACE- and observation-based recharge in the larger XRB shows better consistency, while that in the smaller WRB shows larger discrepancies. Considering the associated uncertainty (60-93 mm/yr), the 2006-2012 mean recharge in two basins, ranging 199-225 mm/yr (17%-19% of precipitation) is comparable to bulletin-reported estimates (& SIM;145 mm/yr). Both the degree of karstification and aquifer water table depth influence recharge and discharge processes in karst areas of southwest China. The more karstic WRB exhibits more rapid infiltration (due to more developed permeable epikarst zone) and higher discharge capability (due to more developed underground drainage systems), particularly during dry periods (2009, 2011, and winter). Baseflow exhibits a shorter time lag to recharge and GWSC in the XRB than WRB owing to more quick flow, lower storage with more rapid infiltration, and shorter mean groundwater residence time. Observation-based monthly recharge reflects different rainfall-infiltration-runoff processes under different rainfall intensities, particularly in the WRB.

TI  - Mystery metatext in the poem "Field Hospital" by Arseny Tarkovsky
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article interprets the mystery codes in the poem "Field Hospital" by Arseny Tarkovsky. The research is based on the principles of mythopoetic and structural-semantic analysis of the text, and provides a systematic approach to the work, taking into account the specifics of its plot-genre paradigmatics and figurative-symbolic language. The inner world of the poem is organized by the logic of the mystery topos with its key coordinates: frontier ontology; the evolving character of time and the reflection of its dynamics in the "dialectic of the soul"; existential self-reflection and detachment of the hero's consciousness. The motivic complex of the border, repeatedly manifested in the text and culminating in the symbolism of the limb, becomes a meta-image, in the semantic field of which all the named parameters of the mystery continuum intersect. The model of reality recreated in Tarkovsky's poem goes beyond mythological monism, but it clearly correlates with the mystery organization of the chronotope: the mystic is aware of the multidimensionality of the universe and the existence of boundaries between different spheres of reality - primarily profane-everyday and sacred - as well as the possibility of moving across these boundaries, which, ultimately, is one of the results of mystery initiations. The plot-forming meaning in "Field Hospital" is acquired by allusive references to the mystery texts of culture: the ancient Egyptian, Christian, alchemical mysteries are dialogically integrated in the act of birth - transfiguration - resurrection experienced by Tarkovsky's hero. The central place in this paradigm is given to the mystery of Osiris and Isis, the symbolic codes of which are reflected in a number of iconic motifs, images, and details. The key among them are the motif of dismemberment and the semantic complex of the victim associated with it; the symbolism of death - resurrection; the archetypal dyad of a newborn - infant; a tree-natural code associated with the lyrical hero; the allusively designated image of Isis, personifying the female harmonizing principle of the universe. If the motif of dismemberment contains a specific reference to the theme of Osiris, then the other elements in this series also relate to the mystery of Christ and, accordingly, to the texts of culture associated with it, including the mysteries of the alchemists. The study leads to the conclusion that Tarkovsky's "Field Hospital" is read as a metatext, where in a situation of semantic dialogue different culturological modes of mystery coexist, and the mystery consciousness itself enters into a relationship of mutual reflection with the mythological and tragic worldview. The logic of the myth is intertwined in the development of the lyrical plot with the logic of tragedy, which in turn is overcome through a detached view of the tragic situations experienced and the mystery-conscious acceptance of fate and life in all their manifestations.

TI  - Mapping <i>Lantana camara</i> and <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> in Protected Areas of Pakistan: A Geo-Spatial Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered as one of the major causes of loss of native biodiversity around the world. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to identify and map native and invasive species using accurate spectral information. The current study was aimed to evaluate PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel (10 m) datasets for mapping the distribution of native and invasive species in two protected areas in Pakistan, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The multispectral data were analysed with the following four ML algorithms (classifiers)-random forest (RF), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)-to classify two invasive species, Lantana camara L. (common lantana) and Leucaena leucocephala L. The (Ipil-ipil) Dzetsaka plugin of QGIS was used to map these species using all ML algorithms. RF, GMM, and SVM algorithms were more accurate at detecting both invasive species when using PlanetScope imagery rather than Sentinel. Random forest produced the highest accuracy of 64% using PlanetScope data. Lantana camara was the most dominating plant species with 23% cover, represented in all thematic maps. Leucaena leucocpehala was represented by 7% cover and was mainly distributed in the southern end of the Jindi Reserve Forest (Jhelum). It was not possible to discriminate native species Dodonea viscosa Jacq. (Snatha) using the SVM classifier for Sentinel data. Overall, the accuracy of PlanetScope was slightly better than Sentinel in term of species discrimination. These spectral findings provide a reliable estimation of the current distribution status of invasive species and would be helpful for land managers to prioritize invaded areas for their effective management.

TI  - Integrating UAV-Derived Information and WorldView-3 Imagery for Mapping Wetland Plants in the Old Woman Creek Estuary, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of wetland plants using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite synergies has received increasing attention in recent years. In this study, UAV-derived training and validation data and WorldView-3 satellite imagery are integrated in the classification of five dominant wetland plants in the Old Woman Creek (OWC) estuary, USA. Several classifiers are explored: (1) pixel-based methods: maximum likelihood (ML), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN), and (2) object-based methods: Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The study evaluates the performance of the classifiers for different image feature combinations such as single bands, vegetation indices, principal components (PCs), and texture information. The results showed that all classifiers reached high overall accuracy (>85%). Pixel-based SVM and object-based NB exhibited the best performance with overall accuracies of 93.76% and 93.30%, respectively. Insignificantly lower overall accuracy was achieved with ML (92.29), followed by NN (90.95) and object-oriented SVM (90.61). The k-NN method showed the lowest (but still high) accuracy of 86.74%. All classifiers except for the pixel-based SVM required additional input features. The pixel-based SVM achieved low errors of commission and omission, and unlike the other classifiers, exhibited low variability and low sensitivity to additional image features. Our study shows the efficacy of combining very high spatial resolution UAV-derived information and the super spectral observation capabilities of WorldView-3 in machine learning for mapping wetland vegetation.

TI  - Efficacy of pre-operative axillary ultrasonography in excluding nodal disease: Can it replace sentinel lymph node biopsy in early stage breast cancer?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine false negative rate, negative predictive value and the factors predicting false negativity of pre-treatment axillary ultrasound.Method: The retrospective study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised data from January 2019 to December 2020 of patients with normal lymph nodes on ultrasound, tumour stages T1, T2 or T3 having invasive cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Ultrasound findings were compared with the biopsy results, dividing the sample into false negative group A and true negative group B. Clinical, radiological, histopathological parameters and therapeutic strategies were compared between the two groups. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.Results: Of the 781 patients with mean age 49.39 +/- 11.51 years, 154(19.7%) were in group A and 627(80.2%) were in group B, with negative predictive value of 80.2%. Initial tumour size, histopathology, tumour grade, receptors, timing of chemotherapy, and type of surgery has significant difference between the groups (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed larger, high-grade, progesterone receptor negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive tumours were significantly associated with lower false negative rate on axillary ultrasound (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Axillary ultrasound was found to be effective in ruling out axillary nodal disease, especially in patients with high-burden axillary disease, aggressive tumour biology, larger tumour size and higher timour grade.

TI  - A Ship-Wake Joint Detection Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection is widely used in areas such as maritime security, maritime traffic, fisheries management, illegal fishing, and border control, and ship detection is important for rapid response and damage minimization as ship accident rates increase due to recent increases in international maritime traffic. Currently, according to a number of global and national regulations, ships must be equipped with automatic identification system (AIS), which provide information such as the location and speed of the ship periodically at regular intervals. However, most small vessels (less than 300 tons) are not obligated to install the transponder and may not be transmitted intentionally or accidentally. There is even a case of misuse of the ship's location information. Therefore, in this study, ship detection was performed using high-resolution optical satellite images that can periodically remotely detect a wide range and detect small ships. However, optical images can cause false-alarm due to noise on the surface of the sea, such as waves, or factors indicating ship-like brightness, such as clouds and wakes. So, it is important to remove these factors to improve the accuracy of ship detection. In this study, false alarm was reduced, and the accuracy of ship detection was improved by removing wake. As a ship detection method, ship detection was performed using machine learning-based random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques that have been widely used in object detection fields recently, and ship detection results by the model were compared and analyzed. In addition, in this study, the results of RF and CNN were combined to improve the phenomenon of ship disconnection and the phenomenon of small detection. The ship detection results of this study are significant in that they improved the limitations of each model while maintaining accuracy. In addition, if satellite images with improved spatial resolution are utilized in the future, it is expected that ship and wake simultaneous detection with higher accuracy will be performed.

TI  - Updating and Evaluating Anthropogenic Emissions for NOAA's Global Ensemble Forecast Systems for Aerosols (GEFS-Aerosols): Application of an SO<sub>2</sub> Bias-Scaling Method
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We updated the anthropogenic emissions inventory in NOAA's operational Global Ensemble Forecast for Aerosols (GEFS-Aerosols) to improve the model's prediction of aerosol optical depth (AOD). We used a methodology to quickly update the pivotal global anthropogenic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions using a speciated AOD bias-scaling method. The AOD bias-scaling method is based on the latest model predictions compared to NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2). The model bias was subsequently applied to the CEDS 2019 SO2 emissions for adjustment. The monthly mean GEFS-Aerosols AOD predictions were evaluated against a suite of satellite observations (e.g., MISR, VIIRS, and MODIS), ground-based AERONET observations, and the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP) ensemble results. The results show that transitioning from CEDS 2014 to CEDS 2019 emissions data led to a significant improvement in the operational GEFS-Aerosols model performance, and applying the bias-scaled SO2 emissions could further improve global AOD distributions. The biases of the simulated AODs against the observed AODs varied with observation type and seasons by a factor of 3 similar to 13 and 2 similar to 10, respectively. The global AOD distributions showed that the differences in the simulations against ICAP, MISR, VIIRS, and MODIS were the largest in March-May (MAM) and the smallest in December-February (DJF). When evaluating against the ground-truth AERONET data, the bias-scaling methods improved the global seasonal correlation (r), Index of Agreement (IOA), and mean biases, except for the MAM season, when the negative regional biases were exacerbated compared to the positive regional biases. The effect of bias-scaling had the most beneficial impact on model performance in the regions dominated by anthropogenic emissions, such as East Asia. However, it showed less improvement in other areas impacted by the greater relative transport of natural emissions sources, such as India. The accuracies of the reference observation or assimilation data for the adjusted inputs and the model physics for outputs, and the selection of regions with less seasonal emissions of natural aerosols determine the success of the bias-scaling methods. A companion study on emission scaling of anthropogenic absorbing aerosols needs further improved aerosol prediction.

TI  - Improved cloudy-sky snow albedo estimates using passive microwave and VIIRS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo (LSA) is an essential component of the surface radiation budget, and has been retrieved extensively as a basic remote sensing product; however, daily LSA products suffer from extensive data gaps primarily caused by cloud cover. Accordingly, several gap-filling methods were developed (e.g., spatiotemporal interpolation and data fusion with albedo climatology), although the traditional methods are limited by cloud scale and surface heterogeneity. Further, as the largest varying surface landscape feature, seasonal snow cover substantially influences LSA and represents a major uncertainty factor of gap recovery because previous studies failed to employ actual surface signals to capture such ephemeral but intense albedo changes under cloud cover. To address this issue, a three-step framework was proposed for estimating 1 km cloudy-sky LSA using passive microwave (PMW) data, albedo climatology, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) clear-sky albedo: (1) All-sky snow albedo was estimated from PMW brightness temperatures using a statistical model, (2) Continuous albedo dynamics were generated by combining the all-sky snow albedo with snow-free climatological albedo, and (3) The 1 km cloudy-sky LSA was predicted after filtering 1 km VIIRS clear-sky LSA by the albedo dynamic series. PMW-derived snow albedo was assessed over the Contiguous US (CONUS), and the final 1 km cloudy-sky LSA was validated across 10 sites from SURFRAD and Core AmeriFlux in 2013. Based on the comparison with high-quality MODIS pixels, the estimated snow albedo yielded an overall RMSE of 0.064 over CONUS, with a bias of 0.010 (R-2 = 0.845). The recovered 1 km cloudy-sky LSA produced RMSEs of 0.074 (0.137) for all (snow) samples, a significant improvement over the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) gap-free albedo products especially on snow cases (p-value = 0.027). Corresponding RMSE in calculating surface net radiation was also decreased by 38.91 W.m(-2); and anomalous snow samples were corrected as well. The temporal analysis and all-sky LSA mapping suggest that the recovered LSA has satisfactory spatiotemporal continuity, and successfully captured details of spatiotemporal variability, especially for ephemeral snow events. This study provides an innovative solution to recover gaps in LSA data, and considerably improves the LSA accuracy under cloud cover, which can inform snow melting modeling, hazard forecasting, and irrigation management.

TI  - Assessing Carbon Reduction Potential of Rooftop PV in China through Remote Sensing Data-Driven Simulations
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing rooftop photovoltaic (PV) has become an important initiative for achieving carbon neutrality in China, but the carbon reduction potential assessment has not properly considered the spatial and temporal variability of PV generation and the curtailment in electricity dispatch. In this study, we propose a technical framework to fill the gap in assessing carbon reduction potential through remote sensing data-driven simulations. The spatio-temporal variations in rooftop PV generations were simulated on an hourly basis, and a dispatch analysis was then performed in combination with hourly load profiles to quantify the PV curtailment in different scenarios. Our results showed that the total rooftop PV potential in China reached 6.5 PWh yr(-1), mainly concentrated in the eastern region where PV generation showed high variability. The carbon reduction from 100% flexible grids with 12 h of storage capacity is close to the theoretical maximum, while without storage, the potential may be halved. To maximize the carbon reduction potential, rooftop PV development should consider grid characteristics and regional differences. This study has important implications for the development of rooftop PV and the design of carbon-neutral pathways based on it.

TI  - Programmatic Retention in Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) Programs: Estimated Rates and Cofactors Using Different Nonretention Measures
T2  - JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs serve women continuing and initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy, and follow-up schedules align to delivery rather than ART initiation, making conventional HIV retention measures (assessed from ART initiation) challenging to apply. We evaluated 3 measures of peripartum nonretention in Kenyan women living with HIV from pregnancy to 2 years postpartum.Methods:This longitudinal analysis used programmatic data from the Mobile WAChX trial (NCT02400671). Outcomes included loss to follow-up (LTFU) (no visit for >= 6 months), incomplete visit coverage (<80% of 3-month intervals with a visit), and late visits (>2 weeks after scheduled date). Predictors of nonretention were determined using Cox proportional hazards, log-binomial, and generalized estimating equation models.Results:Among 813 women enrolled at a median of 24 weeks gestation, incidence of LTFU was 13.6/100 person-years; cumulative incidence of LTFU by 6, 12, and 24 months postpartum was 16.7%, 20.9%, and 22.5%, respectively. Overall, 35.5% of women had incomplete visit coverage. Among 794 women with 12,437 scheduled visits, a median of 11.1% of visits per woman were late (interquartile range 4.3%-23.5%). Younger age, unsuppressed viral load, unemployment, ART initiation in pregnancy, and nondisclosure were associated with nonretention by all measures. Partner involvement was associated with better visit coverage and timely attendance. Women who became LTFU had higher frequency of previous late visits (16.7% vs. 7.7%, P < 0.0001).Conclusions:Late visit attendance may be a sentinel indicator of LTFU. Identified cofactors of prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmatic retention may differ depending on retention measure assessed, highlighting the need for standardized measures.

TI  - The pattern of abandoned cropland and its productivity potential in China: A four-years continuous study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased requirement of food production with the rising population challenges limited cultivation land in China. The abandoned cropland has high potential in grain production to ensure China's food security. However, the spatial distributions of abandoned cropland in China are understudied and therefore it is difficult to estimate its potential grain production. Our study proposed a new definition of abandoned cropland considering unique multiple cropping systems in China, and estimate the abandoned cropland distribution and grain productivity potential by using Landsat8 and GF-1 images under deep learning technology. The area of abandoned cropland in three main grain-producing regions was approximately 1.53 million hectares during 2014-2017. The estimated images agreed with the field survey and the national agricultural statistical data with the accuracy larger than 87 %. The spatial distribution of abandoned cropland in China was scattered and a high abandonment rate observed in the Middle-lower Yangtze River Plain. Moreover, the uncultivated cropland accounted for approximately 50 % of the total area of abandoned cropland. The maximum production potential of abandoned cropland could reach 8.5 million tons, including 2.7, 2.5 and 3.3 million tons of maize, wheat and rice, respectively. The exploitation of abandoned cropland is also beneficial for additional soybean production in China. National-scale estimation of abandoned cropland in China is crucial for land use policy making and cropland protection, as well the implementation of national food security strategy.

TI  - Towards Edge-Precise Cloud and Shadow Detection on the GaoFen-1 Dataset: A Visual, Comprehensive Investigation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images are usually contaminated by opaque cloud and shadow regions when acquired, and therefore cloud and shadow detection arises as one of the essential prerequisites for restoration and prediction of the objects of interest underneath, which are required by further processing and analysis. Cutting-edge, learning-based segmentation techniques, given a well-labeled, sufficient sample set, are significantly developed for such a detection issue and can already achieve region-accurate or even pixel-precise performance. However, it may possibly be problematic to attempt to apply the sophisticated segmentation techniques to label-free datasets in a straightforward way, more specifically, to the remote sensing data generated by the Chinese domestic satellite GaoFen-1. We wish to partially address such a segmentation problem from a practical perspective rather than in a conceptual way. This can be performed by considering a hypothesis that a segmentor, which is sufficiently trained on the well-labeled samples of common bands drawn from a source dataset, can be directly applicable to the custom, band-consistent test cases from a target set. Such a band-consistent hypothesis allows us to present a straightforward solution to the GaoFen-1 segmentation problem by treating the well-labeled Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager dataset as the source and by selecting the fourth, the third, and the second bands, also known as the false-color bands, to construct the band-consistent samples and cases. Furthermore, we attempt to achieve edge-refined segmentation performance on the GaoFen-1 dataset by adopting our prior Refined UNet and v4. We finally verify the effectiveness of the band-consistent hypothesis and the edge-refined approaches by performing a relatively comprehensive investigation, including visual comparisons, ablation experiments regarding bilateral manipulations, explorations of critical hyperparameters within our implementation of the conditional random field, and time consumption in practice. The experiments and corresponding results show that the hypothesis of selecting the false-color bands is effective for cloud and shadow segmentation on the GaoFen-1 data, and that edge-refined segmentation performance of our Refined UNet and v4 can be also achieved.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATION USING SENTINEL-2 BAND FUNCTIONS IN MULA RESERVOIR, RAHURI, INDIA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand how the physical, chemical, biological, and environmental components interact, it is important to know what the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is. To assess the suspended sediment concentrations in oceans, lakes, rivers, and coastal waterways remotely sensed spectral radiant energy collected by satellite sensors can offer a different, synoptic, quick, and affordable technique. Therefore, various sentinel-2 satellite band functions after observing spectral signature of suspended sediments in Mula dam reservoir were calibrated against observed SSC at various locations in Mula dam reservoir located at Rahuri, Maharashtra during October 2021 and February 2022. Observed SSC ranged between 15.62 and 137.65 mg/L during this period. Widely used linear, power, quadratic, exponential and logarithmic functions of various band combinations/ratios were calibrated using 80% data set. Best performing power function of (Red + Green) / 2 (R-2=0.8), Red + NIR (R-2=0.79), polynomial function of Red / Blue (R-2=0.71) and logarithmic function of Red Edge 1/ Blue (R-2=0.62) were further validated to estimate SSC. Estimated SSC and observed SSC of validation dataset were compared using visual interpretation and further subjected to linear regression t-test and student t-test. Statistical error and efficiency models (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)) were applied after validation to find out most suitable band combination for estimation SSC in Mula dam reservoir. Power function of (Red + Green / 2) with R-2=0.73, RMSE = 16.185, NSE=0.728 and MAPE = 26.70 % of validation is selected for spatio-temporal mapping of SSC in Mula dam reservoir. The results demonstrate that the applicability of calibration/validation technique developed for the empirical modelling of suspended sediment in Mula dam reservoir using high resolution sensor. Temporal variation of SSC over the period of six months shows the increased SSC towards the portion where river enters the reservoir than in the central portion of reservoir. Moreover, average SSC in Mula dam reservoir immediately after rainy season (October month) was found more than that in summer months. This highlights the applicability of SSC mapping using empirical band function.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pakistan has an annual deforestation rate of 4.6% which is the second highest in Asia. It has been described by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that the deforestation rate increased from 1.8-2.2% within two decades (1980-2000 and 2000-2010). KPK (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Pakistan's northwestern province, holds 31% of the country's total forest resources, the majority of which are natural forests. The Malam Jabba region, known for its agro-forestry practices, has undergone significant changes in its agricultural, forestry, and urban development. Agricultural and built-up land increased by 77.6% in the last four decades, and significant changes in land cover especially loss in forest, woodland, and agricultural land were observed due to flood disasters since 1980. For assessing and interpreting land-cover dynamics, particularly for changes in natural resources such as evergreen forest cover, remote sensing images are valuable assets. This study proposes a framework to assess the changes in vegetation cover in the Malam Jabba region during the past four decades with Landsat time series data. The random forest classifier (RF) was used to analyze the forest, woodland, and other land cover changes over the past four decades. Landsat MMS, TM, ETM+, and OLI satellite images were used as inputs for the random forest (RF) classifier. The vegetation cover change for each period was calculated from the pixels using vegetation indices such as NDVI, SAVI, and VCI. The results show that Malam Jabba's total forest land area in 1980 was about 236 km(2) and shrank to 152 km(2) by 2020. The overall loss rate of evergreen forests was 35.3 percent. The mean forest cover loss rate occurred at 2.1 km(2)/year from 1980 to 2020. The area of woodland forest decreased by 87 km(2) (25.43 percent) between 1980 and 2020. Other landcover increased by 121% and covered a total area of 178 km(2). The overall accuracy was about 94% and the value of the kappa coefficient was 0.92 for the change in forest and woodland cover. In conclusion, this study can be beneficial to researchers and decision makers who are enthusiastic about using remote sensing for monitoring and planning the development of LULC at the regional and global scales.

TI  - Combining Remote Sensing Approaches for Detecting Marks of Archaeological and Demolished Constructions in Cahokia's Grand Plaza, Southwestern Illinois
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are increasingly being used in digital archaeology for the potential non-invasive detection of archaeological remains. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the capability of standalone (LiDAR and aerial photogrammetry) and integration/fusion remote sensing approaches in improving the prospecting and interpretation of archaeological remains in Cahokia's Grand Plaza. Cahokia Mounds is an ancient area; it was the largest settlement of the Mississippian culture located in southwestern Illinois, USA. There are a limited number of studies combining LiDAR and aerial photogrammetry to extract archaeological features. This article, therefore, combines LiDAR with photogrammetric data to create new datasets and investigate whether the new data can enhance the detection of archaeological/ demolished structures in comparison to the standalone approaches. The investigations are implemented based on the hillshade, gradient, and sky view factor visual analysis techniques, which have various merits in revealing topographic features. The outcomes of this research illustrate that combining data derived from different sources can not only confirm the detection of remains but can also reveal more remains than standalone approaches. This study demonstrates that the use of combination remote sensing approaches provides archaeologists with another powerful tool for site analysis.

TI  - Interactive Web Mapping Applications for 2D and 3D Geo-Visualization of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry SAR Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface motion is a complex, dynamic phenomenon that draws significant scientific attention. This study focuses on the development of a cartographic toolset for the visualization of space-borne Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) surface motion measurements. The entire archive of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery over the broader Thessaloniki (Greece) area has been exploited to derive the PSI measurements utilizing the Surface motioN mAPPING (SNAPPING) service on the Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP). A collection of web map applications, interactive visualization tools, and an animated map were developed based on state-of-the-art approaches. This geo-visualization toolset consists of the following: (i) Three web map applications exploring PSI velocity rates, PSI time series, and a comparison of PSI with geodetic leveling data; (ii) Two interactive map tools focusing on 3D visualization of PSI time series and estimating velocity rates for predefined temporal frames; and (iii) An animated map of PSI time series. The utilization of the aforementioned visualization toolset provided useful conclusions about the variety of land displacement that occurs in different subareas of Northern Greece from different causes. More specifically, certain subareas with significant subsidence rates range from -2 mm/year up to -18 mm/year from 2015 to 2020. The magnitude of displacement and the underlying causes (subsidence, faults, landslides, human processes, etc.) varies across different subareas. On the other hand, a subarea of uplift trend exists in the north of the city of Thessaloniki with displacements up to 5 mm/year for the period between 2015-2020, despite being constrained by the fact that the geo-visualization platform is able to display SNAPPING PSI measurements from any location around the world, making it a useful tool for global exploration. The platform's contents are available through a user-friendly graphical interface and are mostly addressed to domain experts as well as end-users. Opposed to similar approaches where static 2D maps and velocity rates web applications are presented through this platform, users can monitor and study the dynamic behavior of surface motion to a spatiotemporal extent more thoroughly.

TI  - How do natural and human factors influence ecosystem services changing? A case study in two most developed regions of China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that influence changes in ecosystem services (ESs) is critical to the sustainable management of ecosystems. However, existing studies ignore the different importance of influencing factors of ESs in different periods and do not consider the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of influence factors. In this study, we first quantified six ESs for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) in 2000 and 2020 based on remote sensing data, including water yield, grain production, climate regulation, air purification, biodiversity, and recreation. Then, eight factors influencing ESs were selected from natural and human perspectives, and random forest was used to determine the importance level of factors influencing ESs. Finally, the GTWR model was used to explore the spatial and temporal differentiation of factors influencing ESs. The results showed that the spatial variation of the six ESs in the YRD and PRD was irregular from 2000 to 2020. In 2000, natural factors (forest, topography, climate) dominated the regional ESs, while in 2020 human factors (population, economy, human activities) gradually replaced the dominance of natural factors on ESs. The spatial and temporal het-erogeneity of multiple influence factors on ESs in the YRD and PRD is significant, and we interpret the ecological implications in detail and propose a series of policy recommendations. The results of this study could provide an important reference for scientific guidance to enhance ecological sustainability in developed regions.

TI  - Quantifying the Effects of Different Containment Policies on Urban NO<sub>2</sub> Decline: Evidence from Remote Sensing and Ground-Station Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities exposed their vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unprecedented policies restricted human activities but left a unique opportunity to quantify anthropogenic effects on urban air pollution. This study aimed to explore the underlying urban development issues behind these restrictions and support a sustainable transition. The data from ground stations and Sentinel-5P satellite were used to assess the temporal and spatial anomalies of NO2. Beijing China was selected for a case study because this mega city maintained a "dynamic zero-COVID" policy with adjusted restrictions, which allowed for better tracking of the effects. The time-series decomposition and prediction regression model were employed to estimate the normal NO2 levels in 2020. The deviation between the observations and predictions was identified and attributed to the policy interventions, and spatial stratified heterogeneity statistics were used to quantify the effects of different policies. Workplace closures (54.8%), restricted public transport usage (52.3%), and school closures (46.4%) were the top three restrictions that had the most significant impacts on NO2 anomalies. These restrictions were directly linked to mismatched employment and housing, educational inequality, and long-term road congestion issues. Promoting the transformation of urban spatial structures can effectively alleviate air pollution.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for estimating cotton crop coefficient, height, and Leaf Area Index
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In cotton, an optimal balance between vegetative and reproductive growth will lead to high yields and water-use efficiency. Remote sensing estimations of vegetation variables such as crop coefficient (Kc), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop height during plant development can improve irrigation management. Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery can be a useful data source since they provide synoptic cover at fixed time intervals. Furthermore, they can better capture the spatial variability in the field compared to point mea-surements. Since clouds limit optical observations at times, the combination with SAR can provide information during cloudy periods. This study utilized optical imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 and SAR imagery acquired by Sentinel-1 over cotton fields in Israel. The Sentinel-2-based vegetation indices that are best suited for cotton monitoring were identified, and the most robust Sentinel-2 models for Kc, LAI, and height estimation achieved R2 = 0.879, RMSE= 0.0645 (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index, MTCI); R2 = 0.9535, RMSE= 0.8 (MTCI); and R2 = 0.8883, RMSE= 10 cm (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI), respectively. Additionally, a model based on the output of the SNAP Biophysical Processor LAI estimation algorithm was superior to the empirical LAI models of the best-performing vegetation indices (R2 =0.9717, RMSE=0.6). The most robust Sentinel-1 models were ob-tained by applying an innovative local incidence angle normalization method with R2 = 0.7913, RMSE= 0.0925; R2 = 0.6699, RMSE= 2.3; R2 = 0.6586, RMSE= 18 cm for the Kc, LAI, and height estimation, respectively. This work paves the way for future studies to design decision support systems for better irrigation management in cotton, even at the sub-plot level, by monitoring the heterogeneous development of the crop from space and adapting the irrigation accordingly to reach the target development at different growth stages during the season.

TI  - Effects of Mesoscale Mixing on Phytopigment Determinations in the Photic Zone from Multispectral Ocean Color Data (The Case of the Tasman Sea)
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The inconstancy of the composition of phytopigments during intensive mesoscale mixing of the photic zone of the Tasman Sea was investigated from MODIS images of its surface. For this, each pixel of the image is assigned a WRM (wavelength of reflectance minimum) index equal to the sum of the wavelengths of the minima in the reflectance spectrum of the water surface within the boundaries of a pixel on the ground. The WRM is acceptable as an indicator of the inconstancy of the composition of phytopigments in the water column, since the spectra of light absorption by phytopigments in an aqueous medium change following the species affiliation of phytoplankton, even though light attenuation by water as a solvent and its admixtures of a different nature are inferior to light absorption by phytopigments in spectral selectivity. A comparative analysis of the WRM index distributions and characteristics of Tasman Sea water showed that the increased mesoscale variability of open ocean waters is accompanied by an increase in phytopigment content to a level where pigment minima appear in the spectra of backscattered solar radiation at 400-550 nm, distinguishable by multispectral ocean color scanners. This effect is not considered by common algorithms for chlorophyll determination using data from multispectral ocean color scanners (band-ratio algorithms) and is probably one of the reasons for the known tendency of such algorithms to overestimate chlorophyll concentration with respect to its actual content even in water areas free of the influence of external sources of optically significant admixtures in the water column.

TI  - Assessment of the NO<sub>2</sub> Spatio-Temporal Variability over Thessaloniki, Greece, Using MAX-DOAS Measurements and Comparison with S5P/TROPOMI Observations
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we investigate the spatio-temporal variability of tropospheric NO2 Vertical Column Densities (VCDs) and surface concentrations that were retrieved using Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements over Thessaloniki, Greece, for the period June 2020 to November 2022. The MAX-DOAS system captures the NO2 seasonal variability very well, reporting low concentrations during summer and higher concentrations in the winter, as well as the diurnal cycle with higher NO2 amounts in the morning followed by a reduction towards noon. The "weekend effect" is evident, with approximately 30% lower NO2 concentrations on the weekends compared to the working days. An excellent agreement is found with in situ data from a nearby air quality monitoring station with Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging between R = 0.90 and R = 0.99. The spatial variability is assessed by comparing the NO2 concentrations at four azimuth viewing directions of the MAX-DOAS system. Despite the large variability due to short- and long-term temporal variations, higher NO2 concentrations of up to 25% (statistically significant at the 95% confidence level) are reported for the azimuth that crosses the entire city center and an urban area compared to those pointing towards the sea. The MAX-DOAS tropospheric NO2 columns are then compared to those measured by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5P satellite. Despite the generally good correlation (R = 0.72 and R = 0.89 for the daily and monthly data, respectively), a clear underestimation of TROPOMI is found (approximately 55% in winter, 21% in spring and 40% during autumn and summer), mainly due to the much larger satellite footprint that provides a smoother perception of the NO2 concentration, while the MAX-DOAS measurements are more affected by local emissions.

T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the development of open access medium-high resolution remote sensing data like multispectral remote sensing images, crop classification becomes a hot research topic to be realized on large scale using machine learning (ML) models. At the same time, chlorophyll content is a critical index used for defining crop growth conditions, photosynthetic ability, and physiological position. It has an adaptive characteristic which finds useful to monitor crop growth conditions and understand the procedure of material and energy exchange among crops and the environment. Recently, several research works have been carried out to estimate chlorophyll content on multispectral remote sensing images. The recent advances in deep learning models enable us to effectively classify different crop types and estimate chlorophyll content on multispectral remote sensing images. In this view, this paper presents a new remora optimization with deep learning driven crop classification and chlorophyll content estimation (RODLD-C4E) model using multispectral remote sensing images. The proposed RODLD-C4E model intends to properly identify the crop type and chlorophyll content. For accomplishing this, the proposed RODLD-C4E model initially derives a RO algorithm with NASNetLargemodel for feature extraction process. The utilization of RO algorithm enables to effectually adjust the hyperparameters of the NasNetLarge model. Besides, cascaded gated recurrent unit (CGRU) model is employed for crop type classification. Finally, deep belief network (DBN) model is applied to estimate the chlorophyll content exist in the crop. To demonstrate the better performance of RODLD-C4E model, a wide-ranging experimental analysis wasimplemented on benchmark dataset. The comparative analysis pointed out the better outcomes of the RODLD-C4E model under several aspects.

TI  - A linear approach for wheat yield prediction by using different spectral vegetation indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield prediction before harvest is one of the important issues in terms of managing agricultural policies and making the right decisions for the future. Using remote sensing techniques in yield estimation studies is one of the important steps for many countries to reach their 21st-century agricultural targets. The aim of this study is to develop a wheat yield model using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. In this study, the development stages of winter wheat were examined with the help of satellite images obtained between the years 2015-2018 of a selected region in Sanliurfa, Turkey, and it was aimed to predict the yields for other years by establishing a yield estimation model. The yield estimation model was established with the help of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Modified Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) obtained from remote sensing satellite images. Linear regression analysis was established between calculated NDVI, SAVI, GNDVI, MSAVI indices, and actual yield values on the pre-flowering, flowering stage, and post flowering stage. As a result of the study, the highest correlation coefficient was found in the flowering stage between the vegetation indices values and the actual yield values. The values of NDVI, SAVI, GNDVI, and MSAVI and correlation coefficients are obtained in the flowering stage were 0.82, 0.80, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively. With the established model, yield values in 2019 were tried to be estimated for three different fields. The highest correlations were seen in the flowering stage for MSAVI and GNDVI, pre-flowering stage for NDVI and post-flowering stage for SAVI. This clearly shows that the satellite images can be used in yield estimation studies with a remarkable correlation between vegetation indices and actual yield values.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of agrometeorological services conducted by various institutions around the world is to support decisions in the field of planning individual farmer works and agrotechnical treatments so as to fully enable the use of the prevailing weather and climatic conditions. However, the not always sufficient spatial distribution of ground measuring stations limits the possibility of the precise determination of meteorological conditions and the state of vegetation in a specific location. The solution may be the simultaneous use of both ground and satellite data, which can improve and enhance the final agrometeorological products. This paper presents examples of the use of meteorological products combining classical ground measurement and data from meteorological radars and satellites, applied in an agrometeorological service provided by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management in Poland. Selected examples cover Wielkopolskie Province, which is a primarily agricultural region. An analysis of the course of the soil moisture index and HTC as well as differences in the PEI spatial distribution from ground and satellite data for the extremely dry growing season of 2018 are presented. The authors tried to demonstrate that combining data available from different sources may be a necessary condition for modern agriculture in the conditions of climate change.

TI  - Assessing the Heterogeneity and Conservation Status of the Natura 2000 Priority Forest Habitat Type <i>Tilio-Acerion</i> (9180*) Based on Field Mapping
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Priority habitat types (HTs) within the Natura 2000 network are of the highest importance for conservation in Europe. However, they often occur in smaller areas and their conservation status is not well understood. One such HT is that of the Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines (9180*). The Natura 2000 study site, Boc-Haloze-Donacka gora, in the Sub-Pannonian region of eastern Slovenia is characterized by a matrix of European beech forests and includes rather small, fragmented areas covered by Tilio-Acerion forests. The goal of this research was to examine the heterogeneity and conservation status of the selected HT through field mapping, which was performed in the summer of 2020. As the conservation of HT calls for a more detailed approach, we distinguished between the following four pre-defined habitat subtypes: (i) Acer pseudoplatanus-Ulmus glabra stands growing mostly in concave terrain, (ii) Fraxinus excelsior stands growing on slopes, (iii) Tilia sp. stands with thermophilous broadleaves occurring on ridges and slopes, (iv) Acer pseudoplatanus stands occurring on more acidic soils with an admixture of Castanea sativa. Field mapping information was complemented with the assessment of habitat subtype characteristics using remote sensing data. The results showed that habitat subtypes differed significantly in terms of area, tree species composition, forest stand characteristics, relief features and the various threats they experienced (e.g., fragmentation, tree mortality, ungulate browsing pressure). The differences between subtypes were also evident for LiDAR-derived environmental factors related to topography (i.e., terrain steepness and Topographic Position Index). This study provides a baseline for setting more realistic objectives for the conservation management of priority forest HTs. Due to the specificities of each individual habitat subtype, conservation activities should be targeted to the Natura 2000 habitat subtype level.

TI  - Land Surface Model Calibration Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides a unique opportunity for calibrating land surface models due to their direct measurements of various hydrological variables as well as extensive spatial and temporal coverage. This study aims to apply terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) mission as well as soil moisture products from advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth observing system (AMSR-E) to calibrate a land surface model using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. For this purpose, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) is used to improve the model's parameters. The calibration is carried out for the period of two years 2003 and 2010 (calibration period) in Australia, and the impact is further monitored over 2011 (forecasting period). A new combined objective function based on the observations' uncertainty is developed to efficiently improve the model parameters for a consistent and reliable forecasting skill. According to the evaluation of the results against independent measurements, it is found that the calibrated model parameters lead to better model simulations both in the calibration and forecasting period.

TI  - Early Identification of Crop Type for Smallholder Farming Systems Using Deep Learning on Time-Series Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted the food supply chain across the globe and adversely affected food security. Early estimation of staple crops can assist relevant government agencies to take timely actions for ensuring food security. Reliable crop type maps can play an essential role in monitoring crops, estimating yields, and maintaining smooth food supplies. However, these maps are not available for developing countries until crops have matured and are about to be harvested. The use of remote sensing for accurate crop-type mapping in the first few weeks of sowing remains challenging. Smallholder farming systems and diverse crop types further complicate the challenge. For this study, a ground-based survey is carried out to map fields by recording the coordinates and planted crops in respective fields. The time-series images of the mapped fields are acquired from the Sentinel-2 satellite. A deep learning-based long short-term memory network is used for the accurate mapping of crops at an early growth stage. Results show that staple crops, including rice, wheat, and sugarcane, are classified with 93.77% accuracy as early as the first four weeks of sowing. The proposed method can be applied on a large scale to effectively map crop types for smallholder farms at an early stage, allowing the authorities to plan a seamless availability of food.

TI  - Comparison of Cloud Properties between SGLI Aboard GCOM-C Satellite and MODIS Aboard Terra Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a comprehensive comparison of Level 2.0 cloud properties between a Second-generation Global Imager (SGLI) aboard the GCOM-C satellite and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite, to better understand the qualities of cloud properties obtained from SGLI/GCOM-C launched on 23 December 2017. The cloud pixels identified as water phase by both satellite sensors are highly consistent to each other by more than 90%, although the consistency is only similar to 60% for ice phase cloud pixels. A comparison of cloud properties-cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud particle effective radius (CER)-between these two satellite sensors reveals that water and ice cloud properties can have different degrees of agreement depending on underlying surface. The relative difference (RD) values of 22% (18%) and 37% (24%) for water cloud COT (CER) comparison over ocean and land surfaces and respective values of 35% (42%) and 35% (62%) for comparisons of ice cloud properties, and also other comparison metrics, suggest better agreements for water cloud properties than for ice cloud properties, and for ocean surface than for land surface. Though cloud properties differences between MODIS and SGLI can arise from inherent features of cloud retrieval algorithms, such as differences in ancillary data, surface reflectance, cloud droplet size distribution function, model for ice particle habit, etc., this study further identifies the important roles of cloud thickness and Sun and satellite positions for differences in cloud properties between SGLI and MODIS: the differences in cloud properties are found to increase for thinner clouds, higher solar zenith angle, and higher differences in viewing zenith and azimuth angles between these satellite sensors, and such differences are more distinct for water cloud properties than for ice cloud properties.

TI  - Assessment of Aquifer Recharge Potential Using Remote Sensing, GIS and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Combined with Hydrochemical and Isotope Data (Tamassari Basin, Burkina Faso)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Tamassari basin, the agricultural population is highly dependent on groundwater resources for its socioeconomic development. However, the decrease in rainfall in the region since the late 1960s and the demographic pressure on the land are significantly affecting groundwater recharge. In order to exploit this groundwater sustainably, it is necessary to identify potential recharge areas for a better capitalisation of this resource. The objective of this study is to map the recharge potential of the existing aquifers making use of remote sensing and GIS techniques and to make a validation based on chloride and tritium contents in the borehole water. The processing carried out on the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images combined with a digital elevation model (ALOS PALSAR), highlight the lithological, linear and topographical characteristics of the study area. In addition, various supervised classification algorithms were used to produce the most accurate land use map. Field campaigns were conducted to validate the thematic maps resulting from the geospatial data processing and to collect water samples for hydrochemical (chloride) and isotopic analysis (tritium). The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to derive recharge factors weights. The resulting recharge map shows a perfect agreement between the recharge classes derived from spatial modelling and the tritium isotope analyses. This was not the case with the chloride contents, which showed a dispersion over all the recharge areas.

TI  - Feasibility of Ultrasound-Guided Localization for Clipped Metastatic Axillary Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients: A Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We present our initial experience of ultrasound (US)-guided localization of clipped metastatic axillary lymph nodes (LNs) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We evaluated US visibility and the successful excision rate of clipped LN after NAC in 29 consecutive patients with breast cancer. US-guided localization of clipped nodes was performed in 22 patients on the day of surgery, while seven patients underwent surgery without localization. The clips were identified in all patients with residual metastatic LNs and 6 of 12 (50%) patients without residual metastatic LNs on US. Six patients without visible clips underwent US-guided localization at the presumed previous clip insertion site. The successful excision rate of 22 LNs with localization was 100% (even though 3 of them were non-sentinel LNs) and 57% (4/7) without localization. Regardless of the presence of visible residual metastatic LNs on US after NAC, successful excision of the LN with US localization is feasible.

TI  - High Spatiotemporal Flood Monitoring Associated with Rapid Lake Shrinkage Using Planet Smallsat and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal flood monitoring is critical for flood control, mitigation, and management purposes in areas where tectonic and geological events significantly exacerbate flood disasters. For example, the rapid lake shrinkage resulting from the transformations of enclosed seas into lakes by the rapid land movement in the collision zone dramatically increases the flood risks in Indonesia, which requires frequent and detailed monitoring and assessment. This study primarily quantified the detailed flood disasters associated with the rapid lake shrinkage in Gorontalo Regency in Gorontalo Province, Indonesia using high spatiotemporal monitoring with a combination of PlanetScope smallsat constellations, Sentinel-1, and surface water datasets. Based on the findings that indicated its volume, distribution, pace, and pattern, the flood event that occurred in Gorontalo in November 2022 was demonstrated within a short interval of 2-12 days. The results also indicate both direct and indirect floodwater overflow from different water resources. Combining these results with the surface water occurrences from 1984 to 2021, our findings reveal the historical major flood-prone areas associated with the rapid lake shrinkage. These findings are expected to aid in the timely high spatiotemporal monitoring of rapid environmental change-induced flood disasters, even in tropical regions with high cloud coverage. Furthermore, these are also expected to be integrated into the flood hazard mitigation and management strategies associated with local-specific tectonic and geological systems.

TI  - Did Depression, Schizophrenia, and Alcohol Use Increase During the COVID-19 Pandemic Even in Low-Risk Regions? An Analysis of the 2017-2020 National Health Insurance Data in Tottori Prefecture
T2  - YONAGO ACTA MEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic increased the number of medi-cal consultations for depression, schizophrenia, and alcohol dependence in low-risk regions.Methods National Health Insurance enrolments from March 2017 to March 2021 in Tottori Prefecture, Japan, where there were minimal COVID-19 cases in 2020, were included in this study. The all-cause mortality and proportion of National Health Insurance members with depression, schizophrenia, and alcohol dependence in the financial years (FY) 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 were calculated. The proportion in FY 2020 was compared with the average proportion from FY2017 to FY2019 and the proportion in FY2019.Results The all-cause mortality for men aged 80-99 years and women aged 70-89 years decreased in FY2020. The proportion of men aged 20-29 years with depression increased to 4.1% in FY2020 compared with 3.0% in FY2019, while the proportion of women aged 20-29 years with depression was 4.4% in FY2017, 4.8% in FY2018, 4.8% in FY2019, and 5.5% in FY2020, con-firming an increasing trend from before the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of men aged 30-39 years and 60-69 years with schizophrenia increased and that of women aged 40-49 years, 60-69 years, and 90-99 years with schizophrenia also increased, even before the pandemic. The proportion of people with alcohol use disorder has not changed significantly since FY2017.Conclusion The pandemic has led to an increased proportion of men aged 20-29 years with depression, even in low-risk regions.

TI  - Mountain Tree Species Mapping Using Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, and Airborne HySpex Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Europe's mountain forests, which are naturally valuable areas due to their high biodiversity and well-preserved natural characteristics, are experiencing major alterations, so an important component of monitoring is obtaining up-to-date information concerning species composition, extent, and location. An important aspect of mapping tree stands is the selection of remote sensing data that vary in temporal, spectral, and spatial resolution, as well as in open and commercial access. For the Tatra Mountains area, which is a unique alpine ecosystem in central Europe, we classified 13 woody species by iterative machine learning methods using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms of more than 1000 polygons collected in the field. For this task, we used free Sentinel-2 multitemporal satellite data (10 m pixel size, 12 spectral bands, and 21 acquisition dates), commercial PlanetScope data (3 m pixel size, 8 spectral bands, and 3 acquisitions dates), and airborne HySpex hyperspectral data (2 m pixel size, 430 spectral bands, and a single acquisition) with fusion of the data of topographic derivatives based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The iterative classification method achieved the highest F1-score with HySpex (0.95 RF; 0.92 SVM) imagery, but the multitemporal Sentinel-2 data cube, which consisted of 21 scenes, offered comparable results (0.93 RF; 0.89 SVM). The three images of the high-resolution PlanetScope produced slightly less accurate results (0.89 RF; 0.87 SVM).

TI  - Genetically isolated population of the coastal species with high dispersal potential: the case of the sentinel crab Macrophthalmus japonicus (Brachyura: Macrophthalmidae) in Japan
T2  - PLANKTON & BENTHOS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Genetic homogeneity among populations of marine organisms with high dispersal potential is maintained by high gene flow whereas genetic differentiation is often formed under the presence of dispersal barriers. One of the possible dispersal barriers for intertidal species in Japan is the Sea of Japan because several tidal-flat species are absent in the region due to the small tidal range. In this study, we aimed to validate this possibility by examining the popula-tion genetic structure of the intertidal crab Macrophthalmus japonicus, which possesses a long planktonic larval period indicating high dispersal potential but is absent on the Sea of Japan side in Honshu Island. In total, 83 haplotypes of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I were recovered from 154 specimens collected from 10 Japanese sampling sites and three GenBank sequences from China and Korea. All populations showed high genetic diversity except for the northernmost population at Asadokoro site in Mutsu Bay. The (DST values among populations were low, even between populations with great distances such as the Pacific side of northeastern Honshu and Kyushu Islands (ca. 1500 km). On the other hand, the (DST values between Asadokoro site and the other Japan sites were high. The isolation of the northernmost population despite the high dispersal potential of M. japonicus is probably because of the absence of neighboring populations that can supply larvae to the northernmost population and the invasion of larvae from the Pacific side is blocked by ocean currents.

TI  - Evaluating Threatened Bird Occurrence in the Tropics by Using L-Band SAR Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia indicates an urgent need for long-term monitoring, which is lacking. Much attention is being directed toward bird diversity monitoring using remote sensing, based on relation to forest structure. However, few studies have utilized space-borne active microwave remote sensing, which has considerable advantages in terms of repetitive observations over tropical areas. Here, we evaluate threatened bird occurrence from L-band satellite data explaining forest structure in Sumatra, Indonesia. First, we identified L-band parameters with strong correlations with the forest layer structure, defined as forest floor, understory, and canopy layers. Then, we analyzed the correlation between threatened bird occurrence and L-band parameters identified as explaining forest structure. The results reveal that several parameters can represent the layers of forest floor, understory, and canopy. Subsequent statistical analysis elucidated that forest-dependent and threatened bird species exhibit significant positive correlations with the selected L-band parameters explaining forest floor and understory. Our results highlight the potential of applying microwave satellite remote sensing to evaluate bird diversity through forest structure estimation, although a more comprehensive study is needed to strengthen our findings.

TI  - Using Satellite Imagery and Aerial Orthophotos for the Multi-Decade Monitoring of Subalpine Norway Spruce Stands Changes in Gorce National Park, Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last 50 years, forest disturbances, caused mainly by insect outbreaks and windstorms, had a significant impact on the subalpine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) stands across Europe. The high intensity of these factors often led to complete dieback of existing forest stands, as in Gorce National Park (Southern Poland). The aim of this study was to monitor land cover changes in subalpine Norway spruce stands and their dynamics in Gorce NP in the years 1977-2020 (43 years), with the use of archival remote sensing data. The study area was divided into two subareas: A-the Kudlon and B-the Jaworzyna range. Changes were tracked in six defined land cover classes, based on available aerial orthophotos and Landsat (NASA) imagery, with the help of the authors' photointerpretation key. The results showed that almost 50% of old-growth Norway spruce stands died in the analyzed time period (50.9% in subarea A; 48.8% in subarea B). However, young forests appeared in almost 17% of the study area (20.7% and 14.2% in subarea A and B, respectively). The dynamics of land cover changes were different for the analyzed subareas; in subarea A Norway spruce dieback processes weakened at the end of the analyzed time period, whereas in subarea B they maintained high intensity. The process of old-growth Norway spruce stands dieback is still occurring in Gorce NP, but it does not result in the disappearance of the whole subalpine spruce forest ecosystem but is rather a generational change, due to emerging young forests.

TI  - Machine Learning Approach for Detection of Water Overgrowth in Azov Sea with Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Azov Sea estuaries play an important role in the reproduction of semi-anadromous fish species. Spawning efficiency is closely connected with overgrowing of those species spawning grounds; thus, the objective of the water vegetation research has vital fisheries importance. Thus, the main goal of the research was to develop a machine learning algorithm for the detection of water overgrowth with Phragmites australis based on Sentinel-2 data. The research was conducted based on field botanical and vegetation investigations in 2020-2021 in Soleniy and Chumyanniy firths. Collected field and remote sensing data were processed with the semi-automatic classification plugin for QGIS. For the classification of Azov Sea estuaries, a random forest algorithm was used. The obtained results showed that in 2020 the areas occupied by reeds reached 0.37 km(2), while in 2021, they increased to 0.51 km(2). There was a high level of Phragmites australis growth in the Soleniy and Chumyanniy firths. The rapid growth of Phragmites australis in the period of 2020-2021, where the area covered by the reed doubled, is primarily attributed to eutrophication. This is due to the nutrient enrichment from agricultural lands located in the northern part of the research area near Novonekrasovskiy village. Additionally, changes in water flows and hydrological conditions can also contribute to the favorable growth of the reed. This can result in a high growth rate of Phragmites australis, which can reach up to 2 m per year and can propagate both through vegetative and sexual means, leading to the formation of large and dense clusters.

TI  - Fire Danger Assessment Using Moderate-Spatial Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the most common disturbances in natural ecosystems. The analysis of various sources of information (official and unofficial) about the fires in Ukraine (2019-2020) showed a lack of timely and reliable information. Satellite observation is of crucial importance to provide accurate, reliable, and timely information. This paper aims to modify the index of fire danger of a forest's FWI by increasing its precision, based on the use of higher spatial resolution satellite data. A modification of the FWI method involves the utilization of the soil moisture deficit, in addition to the six subindices of the FWI system. In order to calculate the subindices values, weather data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service were used. Soil moisture deficit is calculated using Sentinel-1 radar satellite data on the water saturation degree of the soil surface layer and geospatial parameters from the 3D Soil Hydraulic Database of Europe. The application of the proposed methodology using the specified satellite, weather, and geospatial data makes it possible to assess fire danger on a continental scale with a spatial resolution of 250 m, 1 km, and a daily temporal resolution. Validation of the proposed method for modifying the FWI system demonstrates an improvement in the precision and relevance of fire danger prediction.

TI  - Multifactorial Evaluation of Spatial Suitability and Economic Viability of Light Green Bridges Using Remote Sensing Data and Spatial Urban Planning Criteria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-faceted stresses of social, environmental, and economic nature are increasingly challenging the existence and sustainability of our societies. Cities in particular are disproportionately threatened by global issues such as climate change, urbanization, population growth, air pollution, etc. In addition, urban space is often too limited to effectively develop sustainable, nature-based solutions while accommodating growing populations. This research aims to provide new methodologies by proposing lightweight green bridges in inner-city areas as an effective land value capture mechanism. Geometry analysis was performed using geospatial and remote sensing data to provide geometrically feasible locations of green bridges. A multi-criteria decision analysis was applied to identify suitable locations for green bridges investigating Central European urban centers with a focus on German cities as representative examples. A cost-benefit analysis was performed to assess the economic feasibility using a case study. The results of the geometry analysis identified 3249 locations that were geometrically feasible to implement a green bridge in German cities. The sample locations from the geometry analysis were proved to be validated for their implementation potential. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used to select 287 sites that fall under the highest suitable class based on several criteria. The cost-benefit analysis of the case study showed that the market value of the property alone can easily outweigh the capital and maintenance costs of a green bridge, while the indirect (monetary) benefits of the green space continue to increase the overall value of the green bridge property including its neighborhood over time. Hence, we strongly recommend light green bridges as financially sustainable and nature-based solutions in cities worldwide.

TI  - Global Observations of Riverbank Erosion and Accretion From Landsat Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverbank migration has historically been seen as a risk to infrastructure that can be combated through channelization, bank stabilization, and sediment trapping. The physical processes involved with riverbank erosion and deposition are well defined, yet the solutions to equations that describe these processes are computationally and data intensive over large domains. While current understanding of large-scale river channel mobility largely comes from reach- and watershed-scale observations, we need global observations of riverbank erosion and accretion to broaden our understanding of sediment processes within and across river basins. In this work, we create the first global data set of riverbank erosion for > 370,000 km of large rivers using up to 20 years of water classifications from Landsat imagery. We estimate uncertainty by propagating water classification errors through our methods. Globally, we find riverbank erosion for rivers wider than 150 m to have an approximately log-normal distribution with a median value of 1.52 m/yr. Comparing our data set to 25 similar estimates of riverbank migration, we found a normalized mean absolute error of 42% and a bias of 5.8%. We show that river width is the best first-order predictor of riverbank erosion, in agreement with existing literature. We also show that the relationship between width and bank erosion is substantially different among a sample of global river basins and suggest that this is due to second-order influences of geology, hydrology, and human influence. These data will help improve models of sediment transport, support models of bank erosion, and improve our understanding of human modification of rivers.

AB  - Purpose: Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy-guided lymph node dissection compared to extended pelvic lymph node dissection in patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study at 3 tertiary centers in France between February 2012 and May 2019. Eligible patients had clinically localized intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. After intraprostatic injection of (99m)Tc-nanocolloid, the locations of the sentinel lymph nodes were defined by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Surgical excision of the sentinel lymph nodes was performed using intraoperative gamma probe guidance. After resection of the sentinel lymph nodes, extended pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in all patients. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy method using extended pelvic lymph node dissection as the reference standard. This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02732392).Results: A total of 162 men cN0M0 (CT scan and bone scan) were enrolled: 106 (65.4%) and 56 (34.6%) patients had intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, respectively. The median number of nodes retrieved was 14 (mean 16, IQR 10-21) per patient. At final pathological analysis, 22 patients (13.6%) were pN+. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy method in detecting patients with at least 1 lymph node metastasis were 95.4% (95% CI, 75.1-99.7), 100% (95% CI, 96.6-100), 99.2% (95% CI, 95.5-99.9), and 100% (95% CI, 80.7-100), respectively.Conclusions: Our multicenter prospective study supports that sentinel lymph node biopsy is a very effective and sensitive method for pelvic lymph node staging in patients with intermediate- or high-risk localized prostate cancer.

TI  - Monitoring Corn Nitrogen Concentration from Radar (C-SAR), Optical, and Sensor Satellite Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Corn (Zea mays L.) nitrogen (N) management requires monitoring plant N concentration (Nc) with remote sensing tools to improve N use, increasing both profitability and sustainability. This work aims to predict the corn Nc during the growing cycle from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 (C-SAR) sensor data fusion. Eleven experiments using five fertilizer N rates (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg N ha(-1)) were conducted in the Pampas region of Argentina. Plant samples were collected at four stages of vegetative and reproductive periods. Vegetation indices were calculated with new combinations of spectral bands, C-SAR backscatters, and sensor data fusion derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Predictive models of Nc with the best fit (R-2 = 0.91) were calibrated with spectral band combinations and sensor data fusion in six experiments. During validation of the models in five experiments, sensor data fusion predicted corn Nc with lower error (MAPE: 14%, RMSE: 0.31 %Nc) than spectral band combination (MAPE: 20%, RMSE: 0.44 %Nc). The red-edge (704, 740, 740 nm), short-wave infrared (1375 nm) bands, and VV backscatter were all necessary to monitor corn Nc. Thus, satellite remote sensing via sensor data fusion is a critical data source for predicting changes in plant N status.

TI  - Long-Term Changes of Positive Anomalies of Erythema-Effective UV Irradiance Associated with Low Ozone Events in Germany 1983-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess whether there is an increasing need for adaptation to the associated human health risks, the long-term occurrence (1983-2019) of low-ozone events (LOEs) with associated near-surface anomalies of erythema-effective UV irradiance was examined using an impact-related approach. Based on satellite data, means of four locations in Germany (Sylt, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich) were compared for three subperiods (T1: 1983-1989, T2: 1990-1997, T3: 1998-2019). The period of peak global ozone depletion in the 1990s (T2) is characterized by a larger frequency of LOEs than the preceding (T1) and the subsequent (T3) subperiods. During the most recent subperiod (T3), the mean number of LOEs is 1.1 +/- 0.5 events/year, with a variability of 0 to 4.2 +/- 0.8 events/year, and shows a statistically significant decrease in the annual number of -4.8%/year. The annual totals of the LOE-associated anomalies of the erythema-effective UV radiation dose show no trend during T3. With regard to LOE-associated UV index anomalies, spring is the season most affected by LOEs, with more than half of all cumulative UV peak loads, while the absolute maximum values of the LOE-associated UV index anomaly of about 1.8 UV index occur near the summer solstice. Within the most recent subperiod (T3), summer contributes an increasing share of the peak loads. Overall, the study confirms that LOEs pose health risks due to intermittent, pronounced positive anomalies in erythema-effective UV irradiance and therefore require special attention and adaptation measures. Long-term changes can be identified, but to date there has been no evidence of an increasing health risk in Germany.

TI  - Mapping Cropland Extent in Pakistan Using Machine Learning Algorithms on Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Framework
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An actual cropland extent product with a high spatial resolution with a precision of up to 60 m is believed to be particularly significant in tackling numerous water security concerns and world food challenges. To advance the development of niche, advanced cropland goods such as crop variety techniques, crop intensities, crop water production, and crop irrigation, it is necessary to examine how cropland products typically span narrow or expansive farmlands. Some of the existing challenges are processing by constructing precision-high resolution cropland-wide items of training and testing data on diverse geographical locations and safe frontiers, computing capacity, and managing vast volumes of geographical data. This analysis includes eight separate Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instruments data from 2018 to 2019 (Short-wave Infrared Imagery (SWIR 2), SWIR 1, Cirrus, the near infrared, red, green, blue, and aerosols) have been used. Pixel-based classification algorithms have been employed, and their precision is measured and scrutinized in this study. The computations and analyses have been conducted on the cloud-based Google Earth Engine computing network. Training and testing data were obtained from the Google Earth Engine map console at a high spatial 10 m resolution for this analysis. The basis of research information for testing the computer algorithms consists of 855 training samples, culminating in a manufacturing field of 200 individual validation samples measuring product accuracy. The Pakistan cropland extent map produced in this study using four state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes & CART shows an overall validation accuracy of 82%, 89% manufacturer accuracy, and 77% customer accuracy. Among these four machine learning algorithms, the CART algorithm overperformed the other three, with an impressive classification accuracy of 93%. Pakistan's average cropland areas were calculated to be 370,200 m(2), and the cropland's scale of goods indicated that sub-national croplands could be measured. The research offers a conceptual change in the development of cropland maps utilizing a remote sensing multi-date.

TI  - Detection of <i>Sargassum</i> from Sentinel Satellite Sensors Using Deep Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2011, the proliferation of brown macro-algae of the genus Sargassum has considerably increased in the North Tropical Atlantic Sea, all the way from the Gulf of Guinea to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The large amount of Sargassum aggregations in that area cause major beaching events, which have a significant impact on the local economy and the environment and are starting to present a real threat to public health. In such a context, it is crucial to collect spatial and temporal data of Sargassum aggregations to understand their dynamics and predict stranding. Lately, indexes based on satellite imagery such as the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) or the Alternative Floating Algae Index (AFAI), have been developed and used to detect these Sargassum aggregations. However, their accuracy is questionable as they tend to detect various non-Sargassum features. To overcome false positive detection biases encountered by the index-thresholding methods, we developed two new deep learning models specific for Sargassum detection based on an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN). One was tuned to spectral bands from the multispectral instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 satellites and the other to the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 satellites. This specific new approach outperformed previous generalist deep learning models, such as ErisNet, UNet, and SegNet, in the detection of Sargassum from satellite images with the same training, with an F1-score of 0.88 using MSI images, and 0.76 using OLCI images. Indeed, the proposed CNN considered neighbor pixels, unlike ErisNet, and had fewer reduction levels than UNet and SegNet, allowing filiform objects such as Sargassum aggregations to be detected. Using both spectral and spatial features, it also yielded a better detection performance compared to algal index-based techniques. The CNN method proposed here recognizes new small aggregations that were previously undetected, provides more complete structures, and has a lower false-positive detection rate.

TI  - Monitoring Building Activity by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many countries globally, information for new buildings is either scarce or incomplete. In an effort to bridge this information gap an approach based on public domain synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data is introduced. The method is based on the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique in order to detect newly constructed buildings and estimate their heights in a selected case study area in Athens, Greece. The overall objective is to derive timely spatial information for building activity. A key concept of the approach is the residual height, i.e., the difference in height of each point compared to a reference point that is suitably selected. The data used are acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite. Both ascending and descending orbits and dual polarizations (VV/VH) are used. The results show that as much as 70% of new buildings can be detected at a vertical accuracy approximately of 2.5 m, which is sufficient to determine the number of stories per building. Overall, the proposed method can provide an efficient insight regarding building activity and provide a significant information layer for urban studies in a rapidly changing world.

TI  - Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach for the Primary Prevention of Lymphedema: A 4-Year Follow-Up
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article

CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reconstructive-Microsurgery
CL  - Fort Lauderdale, FL
AB  - Background:Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains the leading cause of lymphedema nationally, and there is still no cure for the disease. The lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach (LYMPHA) is a promising option for lymphedema prophylaxis in patients undergoing ALND, but long-term outcomes of the LYMPHA are not well established. Methods:The authors conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing ALND at their center from November of 2012 to November of 2016 and assembled two cohorts, those who received the LYMPHA and those who did not (non-LYMPHA). Patient data were collected to evaluate lymphedema risk and long-term lymphedema incidence of each group. Results:Forty-five women were included in both our LYMPHA and non-LYMPHA cohorts. Mean body mass index (27.7 kg/m(2) versus 29.9 kg/m(2); P = 0.15) and radiation therapy rates (60.0% versus 68.9%; P = 0.51) did not differ between groups. Non-LYMPHA patients underwent complete mastectomy more frequently than LYMPHA patients (97.8% versus 77.8%; P = 0.007), but had a similar number of nodes removed during ALND (14.4 versus 15.8; P = 0.32). Median follow-up time was greater than 4 years for both LYMPHA and non-LYMPHA groups (57.0 months versus 63.0 months; P = 0.07). Overall, lymphedema incidence was 31.1% in the LYMPHA group and 33.3% in the non-LYMPHA group (P > 0.99). No significant differences in lymphedema incidences were observed between the LYMPHA and non-LYMPHA groups for patients with obesity, patients who received radiation therapy, or patients with obesity who also received radiation therapy (P > 0.05 for all subgroups). Conclusions:The LYMPHA may not prevent lymphedema long-term in patients who undergo ALND. More long-term studies are needed to determine the true potential of the procedure.

TI  - Water Quality Parameter COD Retrieved From Remote Sensing Based on Convolutional Neural Network Model
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a commonly used water quality indicator in water pollution monitoring. Traditional collection methods are time-consuming and labor-consuming, but the inversion of COD concentration by remote sensing method can quickly obtain the spatial distribution of COD concentration in the whole water area, which is of great significance for water pollution control and water environment protection.Using multi-spectral remote sensing data inversion of COD concentration is low precision. Because at present, a lot of the inversion models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient index selection experience method, modeling band for multi-spectral remote sensing data, its wide spectral bands, and band combination of quantity is limited, hard to find effective variables as modeling.In order to solve this problem, this study in Zhengzhou city, lake as an example, based on the Planet multi-spectral high-resolution remote sensing image and the remote sensing image preprocessing and hyperspectral data for analysis of water samples, using convolution neural network method to inversion of days lake COD concentration. At the same time, choose the single variable regression model, a multivariate regression model accuracy comparison test. The main conclusions are as follows:(1) Compared with the inversion method using Pearson correlation coefficient as the measurement standard to select different band combinations, convolutional neural network inversion has higher spatial inversion accuracy, with the determination coefficient of 0.89 and RMSE of 2.22 mg center dot L-1. This is because a convolutional neural network not only makes full use of the spectral characteristics of its remote sensing images. Moreover, the spatial information of the domain around the target pixel can be extracted. The abstract features of the deep layer of the image, as well as the"internal law" between the water quality parameter concentration and remote sensing data, can be learned, which can avoid the instability caused by the traditional modeling method to a certain extent. (2) Select the optimal convolutional neural network model to make the thematic map of the spatial distribution of COD concentration in Tiande Lake water quality. Tiande Lake has typical spectral characteristics of inland water, and its spatial distribution of COD concentration is generally characterized by high in the west, low in the east, low in the southeast inlet and high in the northeast outlet.The average value of concentration in the Tiande Lake region retrieved by the convolutional neural network is 23.96 mg center dot L-1, the standard deviation is 7.11 mg center dot L-1, and the coefficient of variation is 0.29, which is closer to the statistical value of actual sampling points.The results of COD retrieval based on a convolutional neural network model and multi-spectral image show that the convolutional neural network has good application potential in remote sensing COD retrieval of water quality parameters.

TI  - An Object-Oriented Method for Extracting Single-Object Aquaculture Ponds from 10 m Resolution Sentinel-2 Images on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture plays a key role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while it is difficult to accurately extract single-object aquaculture ponds (SOAPs) from medium-resolution remote sensing images (Mr-RSIs). Due to the limited spatial resolutions of Mr-RSIs, most studies have aimed to obtain aquaculture areas rather than SOAPs. This study proposed an object-oriented method for extracting SOAPs. We developed an iterative algorithm combining grayscale morphology and edge detection to segment water bodies and proposed a segmentation degree detection approach to select and edit potential SOAPs. Then a classification decision tree combining aquaculture knowledge about morphological, spectral, and spatial characteristics of SOAPs was constructed for object filter. We selected a 707.26 km(2) study region in Sri Lanka and realized our method on Google Earth Engine (GEE). A 25.11 km(2) plot was chosen for verification, where 433 SOAPs were manually labeled from 0.5 m high-resolution RSIs. The results showed that our method could extract SOAPs with high accuracy. The relative error of total areas between extracted result and the labeled dataset was 1.13%. The MIoU of the proposed method was 0.6965, representing an improvement of between 0.1925 and 0.3268 over the comparative segmentation algorithms provided by GEE. The proposed method provides an available solution for extracting SOAPs over a large region and shows high spatiotemporal transferability and potential for identifying other objects.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Settlements along the coastlines of oceans and lakes, which are among the world's most densely populated areas, are in immediate danger due to stressors brought on by climate change and dangers posed by human activities. This study investigates the water changes of Chao Lake during the last 30 years by using Landsat 5, 7 and 8 time-series images and water indices, including Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Normalized Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The gathered data demonstrates that each estimated indicator's value has increased with time. Thus, over the course of the 30-year research period, the NDWI, NDTI, GNDVI and SST annual average values show increases of 112.10%, 242.42%, 112.82% and 119.42%, respectively. The NDWI index underwent these fluctuations, evidenced with the biggest amount (681.8%) in the winter and the lowest amount (28.13%) in the fall. The most NDTI changes (480%) and the least (only 50%) occurred in summer and fall, respectively. The largest increases in GNDVI (180%) and SST values (537.86%) were observed in winter; the smallest changes in GNDVI (43.48%) and GNDVI (68.76%) in fall. The outcomes also demonstrated a strong link between all four estimated factors. In the majority of the analyzed months, the correlation between the 2 measures, GNDVI and NDTI, was considerably greater and near to 1. The findings of this study may be utilized by managers, decision-makers and local planners for the purpose of environmental planning and reducing water pollution in Chao Lake (and other water regions), as well as reducing the risk of environmental hazards due to water pollution.

TI  - Land Cover Classification by Gaofen Satellite Images Based on CART Algorithm in Yuli County, Xinjiang, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote-sensing images can be used in human activity analysis and criminal activity monitoring, especially in sparsely populated zones. In this paper, we explore the applicability of China's Gaofen satellite images in the land cover classification of Xinjiang, China. First of all, the features of spectral reflectance and a normalized radar cross section (NRCS) for different types of land covers were analyzed. Moreover, the seasonal variation of the NRCS in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images for the study area, Dunkuotan Village of Yuli County, China, was demonstrated by the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform accordingly. Finally, the CART (classification and regression trees) algorithm of a DT (decision tree) was applied to investigate the classification of land cover in the western area of China when both optical and SAR images were employed. An overall classification accuracy of 83.15% with a kappa coefficient of 0.803 was observed by using GF-2/GF-3 images (2017-2021) in the study area. The DT-based classification procedure proposed in this investigation proved that Gaofen series remote-sensing images can be engaged to effectively promote the routine workflow of the administrative department.

TI  - Nesting Elterman Model and Spatiotemporal Linear Mixed-Effects Model to Predict the Daily Aerosol Optical Depth over the Southern Central Hebei Plain, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD), an important indicator of atmospheric aerosol load, characterizes the impacts of aerosol on radiation balance and atmospheric turbidity. The nesting Elterman model and a spatiotemporal linear mixed-effects (ST-LME) model, which is referred to as the ST-Elterman retrieval model (ST-ERM), was employed to improve the temporal resolution of AOD prediction. This model produces daily AOD in the Southern Central Hebei Plain (SCHP) region, China. Results show that the ST-ERM can effectively capture the variability of correlations between daily AOD and meteorological variables. After being validated against the daily Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD, the correlation coefficient between daily retrieved AOD from ST-ERM and MAIAC observations in 2017 reached 0.823. The validated Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-f) of daily MAIAC AOD and ST-ERM-retrieved AOD is greater than or equal to 0.50 at 72 of the 95 stations in 2017. The relative error (E-r) is less than 14% at all the stations except for Shijiazhuang (17.5%), Fengfeng (17.8%), and Raoyang (30.1%) stations. The ST-ERM significantly outperforms the conventional meteorology-AOD prediction approaches, such as the revised Elterman retrieval model (R-ERM). Thus, the ST-ERM shows great potential for daily AOD estimation in study regions with missingness of data.

TI  - Multi-Year Crop Type Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Deep Semantic Segmentation Algorithm in the Hetao Irrigation District in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately obtaining the multi-year spatial distribution information of crops combined with the corresponding agricultural production data is of great significance to the optimal management of agricultural production in the future. However, there are still some problems, such as low generality of crop type mapping models and susceptibility to cloud pollution in large-area crop mapping. Here, the models were constructed by using multi-phase images at the key periods to improve model generality. Multi-phase images in key periods masked each other to obtain large-area cloud-free images, which were combined with the general models to map large areas. The key periods were determined by calculating the global separation index (GSI) of the main crops (wheat, maize, sunflower, and squash) in different growth stages in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in China. The multi-phase images in the key period were used to make the data set and were then combined with a variety of deep learning algorithms (U-Net, U-Net++, Deeplabv3+, and SegFormer) to construct general models. The selection of the key periods, the acquisition of regional cloud-free images, and the construction of the general crop mapping models were all based on 2021 data. Relevant models and methods were respectively applied to crop mapping of the HID from 2017 to 2020 to study the generality of mapping methods. The results show that the images obtained by combining multi-phase images in the key period effectively avoided the influence of clouds and aerosols in large areas. Compared with the other three algorithms, U-Net had better mapping results. The F1-score, mean intersection-over-union, and overall accuracy were 78.13%, 75.39% and 96.28%, respectively. The crop mapping model was applied to images in 2020, and its average overall accuracy was more than 88.28%. When we applied the model to map crops (county food crops, cash crops, and cultivated land area) from 2017 to 2019, the regression analysis between the mapping areas obtained by the model and the ground measurements was made. The R2 was 0.856, and the RMSE was 17,221 ha, which reached the application accuracy, indicating that the mapping method has certain universality for mapping in different years.

TI  - Mature dendritic cells enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDCs): A novel population in the tumour microenvironment and immunotherapy target
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundDendritic cells (DCs) mediate divergent immune effects by activating T cells or negatively regulating the immune response to promote immune tolerance. They perform specific functions determined by their tissue distribution and maturation state. Traditionally, immature and semimature DCs were described to have immunosuppressive effects, leading to immune tolerance. Nonetheless, recent research has demonstrated that mature DCs can also suppress the immune response under certain circumstances. Main bodyMature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDCs) have emerged as a regulatory module across species and tumour types. Indeed, the distinct roles of mregDCs in tumour immunotherapy have sparked the interest of researchers in the field of single-cell omics. In particular, these regulatory cells were found to be associated with a positive response to immunotherapy and a favourable prognosis. ConclusionHere, we provide a general overview of the latest and most notable advances and recent findings regarding the basic features and complex roles of mregDCs in nonmalignant diseases and the tumour microenvironment. We also emphasise the important clinical implications of mregDCs in tumours.

TI  - Global analysis of benthic complexity in shallow coral reefs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional shallow benthic complexity (also known as benthic rugosity) reflects the physical conditions of shallow coral reefs environments and can be used to estimate fish biomass and coral cover on reefs. Spatially explicit data on benthic complexity could offer critical information for coral reef conservation and management. However, benthic complexity has not yet been mapped at a global scale. We mapped global shallow water benthic complexity to 20 m depth at a spatial resolution of 10 m using 22 000 Sentinel-2 satellite images and a globally applicable underwater algorithm. We quantified geographic variation of benthic complexity in shallow coral reef areas from individual reef to ocean basin scales. We found that shallow benthic complexity is unevenly distributed worldwide, with high benthic complexity regions found in areas known to have high levels of benthic biodiversity such as the Coral Triangle, Coral Sea, and Great Barrier Reef. Yet nearly 60% of detected coral reef regions (size = 61 156 km(2)) are not listed as protected under current marine protected plans. These unprotected regions include substantial reef areas of high benthic complexity that may harbor high levels of biodiversity. Our global coral reef benthic complexity map supports plans to improve marine protected areas, reef conservation, and management.

TI  - Analysis of China's Coastline Changes during 1990-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the boundary between the sea and the land, information on the location and type of coastline constantly changes with environmental changes in coastal zones. Monitoring of coastline changes in long time series becomes important for the monitoring and assessment of the coastal zone environment. In this study, Landsat series images from five time periods (1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2020) were selected for monitoring and analyzing the changes in coastline length, sea-land pattern, the index of coastline diversity, and fractal dimension characteristics. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) The lengths of the entire coastline and the artificial coastline of mainland China increased from 30,041.22 km and 10,022.49 km in 1990 to 32,977.34 km and 17,660.84 km in 2020, with annual change rates of 97.87 km/year and 254.61 km/year, respectively. From 1990 to 2020, the rate of natural coastline decreased from 66.68% to 42.29%, and the artificial coastline increased from 33.32% to 57.71%. (2) The length of natural coastline decreased from 20,018.73 km to 15,316.5 km; among the types of natural coastline, the length of sandy coastline and bedrock coastline decreased the most, at 2062.95 km and 1815.8 km, respectively. (3) The coastal zone of mainland China had a significant increase in land area, with a net increase of about 10,902.55 km(2). (4) The index of coastline diversity continued to decrease, and the coastline structure tended to be simple. The fractal dimension of the mainland coastline was consistent with the trend of the length of the coastline, which basically shows an increasing trend. Therefore, the length of the mainland coastline and artificial coastline displayed an upward trend between 1990 and 2020, which also led to simpler coastline diversity and more complex coastline shapes. Since the first year of the SDGs (2015), the growth rate of the artificial coastline has decreased by 158.32 km/year compared with that between 2010 and 2015. In recent years, China has enacted a number of laws, regulations, and action plans to protect its coastline, and it has proposed that by 2020, the proportion of natural coastline will be no less than 35%. The rapid development of China's coastal areas drives the construction of coastal zone cities but also creates a variety of challenges for the ecological environment of the coastal zone, and the management and sustainable use of the mainland coastline resources should be further strengthened.

TI  - Reduction in Uncertainty in Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Images: A Case Study of <i>Pinus densata</i> Forests in Shangri-La City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainty from the under-estimation and over-estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is an urgent problem in optical remote sensing estimation. In order to more accurately estimate the AGB of Pinus densata forests in Shangri-La City, we mainly discuss three non-parametric models-the artificial neural network (ANN), random forests (RFs), and the quantile regression neural network (QRNN) based on 146 sample plots and Sentinel-2 images in Shangri-La City, China. Moreover, we selected the corresponding optical quartile models with the lowest mean error at each AGB segment to combine as the best QRNN (QRNNb). The results showed that: (1) for the whole biomass segment, the QRNNb has the best fitting performance compared with the ANN and RFs, the ANN has the lowest R-2 (0.602) and the highest RMSE (48.180 Mg/ha), and the difference between the QRNNb and RFs is not apparent. (2) For the different biomass segments, the QRNNb has a better performance. Especially when AGB is lower than 40 Mg/ha, the QRNNb has the highest R-2 of 0.961 and the lowest RMSE of 1.733 (Mg/ha). Meanwhile, when AGB is larger than 160 Mg/ha, the QRNNb has the highest R-2 of 0.867 and the lowest RMSE of 18.203 Mg/ha. This indicates that the QRNNb is more robust and can improve the over-estimation and under-estimation in AGB estimation. This means that the QRNNb combined with the optimal quantile model of each biomass segment provides a method with more potential for reducing the uncertainties in AGB estimation using optical remote sensing images.

TI  - Stability Analysis of Unmixing-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Model: A Case of Land Surface Temperature Product Downscaling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unmixing-based spatiotemporal fusion model is one of the effective ways to solve limitations in temporal and spatial resolution tradeoffs in a single satellite sensor. By using fusion data from different satellite platforms, high resolution in both temporal and spatial domains can be produced. However, due to the ill-posed characteristic of the unmixing function, the model performance may vary due to the different model setups. The key factors affecting the model stability most and how to set up the unmixing strategy for data downscaling remain unknown. In this study, we use the multisource land surface temperature as the case and focus on the three major factors to analyze the stability of the unmixing-based fusion model: (1) the definition of the homogeneous change regions (HCRs), (2) the unmixing levels, and (3) the number of HCRs. The spatiotemporal data fusion model U-STFM was used as the baseline model. The results show: (1) The clustering-based algorithm is more suitable for detecting HCRs for unmixing. Compared with the multi-resolution segmentation algorithm and k-means algorithm, the ISODATA clustering algorithm can more accurately describe LST's temporal and spatial changes on HCRs. (2) For the U-STFM model, applying the unmixing processing at the change ratio level can significantly reduce the additive and multiplicative noise of the prediction. (3) There is a tradeoff effect between the number of HCRs and the solvability of the linear unmixing function. The larger the number of HCRs (less than the available MODIS pixels), the more stable the model is. (4) For the fusion of the daily 30 m scale LST product, compared with STARFM and ESTARFM, the modified U-STFM (iso_USTFM) achieved higher prediction accuracy and a lower error (R (2): 0.87 and RMSE:1.09 k). With the findings of this study, daily fine-scale LST products can be predicted based on the unmixing-based spatial-temporal model with lower uncertainty and stable prediction.

TI  - DMU-Net: A Dual-Stream Multi-Scale U-Net Network Using Multi-Dimensional Spatial Information for Urban Building Extraction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatically extracting urban buildings from remote sensing images has essential application value, such as urban planning and management. Gaofen-7 (GF-7) provides multi-perspective and multispectral satellite images, which can obtain three-dimensional spatial information. Previous studies on building extraction often ignored information outside the red-green-blue (RGB) bands. To utilize the multi-dimensional spatial information of GF-7, we propose a dual-stream multi-scale network (DMU-Net) for urban building extraction. DMU-Net is based on U-Net, and the encoder is designed as the dual-stream CNN structure, which inputs RGB images, near-infrared (NIR), and normalized digital surface model (nDSM) fusion images, respectively. In addition, the improved FPN (IFPN) structure is integrated into the decoder. It enables DMU-Net to fuse different band features and multi-scale features of images effectively. This new method is tested with the study area within the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing, and the conclusions are as follows: (1) Our network achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.16% and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 84.49% for the GF-7 self-annotated building dataset, outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. (2) Three-dimensional information significantly improved the accuracy of building extraction. Compared with RGB and RGB + NIR, the IoU increased by 7.61% and 3.19% after using nDSM data, respectively. (3) DMU-Net is superior to SMU-Net, DU-Net, and IEU-Net. The IoU is improved by 0.74%, 0.55%, and 1.65%, respectively, indicating the superiority of the dual-stream CNN structure and the IFPN structure.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Bathymetry with Sediment Classification Using ICESat-2 and Multispectral Imagery: Case Studies in the South China Sea and Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving coastal and shallow-water bathymetry is essential for understanding the marine environment and for coastal management. Bathymetric data in shallow sea areas can currently be obtained using SDB (satellite-derived bathymetry) with multispectral satellites based on depth inversion models. In situ bathymetric data are crucial for validating empirical models but are currently limited in remote and unapproachable areas. In this paper, instead of using the measured water depth data, ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2) ATL03 bathymetric points at different acquisition dates and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2/GeoEye-1 were used to train and evaluate water depth inversion empirical models in two study regions: Shanhu Island in the South China Sea, and Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia. However, different sediment types also influenced the SDB results. Therefore, three types of sediments (sand, reef, and coral/algae) were analyzed for Heron Island, and four types of sediments (sand, reef, rubble and coral/algae) were analyzed for Shanhu Island. The results show that accuracy generally improved when sediment classification information was considered in both study areas. For Heron Island, the sand sediments showed the best performance in both models compared to the other sediments, with mean R-2 and RMSE values of 0.90 and 1.52 m, respectively, representing a 5.6% improvement of the latter metric. For Shanhu Island, the rubble sediments showed the best accuracy in both models, and the average R-2 and RMSE values were 0.97 and 0.65 m, respectively, indicating an RMSE improvement of 15.5%. Finally, bathymetric maps were generated in two regions based on the sediment classification results.

TI  - High-Spatial-Resolution Methane Emissions Calculation Using TROPOMI Data by a Divergence Method
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) is the second-largest greenhouse gas emitted by human activity and natural sources after carbon dioxide (CO2). Its relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere (about 12 years) means that we can mitigate the human impacts of climate change in a relatively short period of time by reducing CH4 emissions. The creation of CH4 emissions management policies can be based on the distribution maps of surface CH4 concentration that are in large-scale and at high-resolution. The estimate of CH4 emissions with broad coverage are provided by currently extensively used satellite data supplemented with data from model simulations. However, it is at low spatial resolution. In this paper, through the combination of atmospheric CH4 observations from the TROPOMI sensor and wind data from the ECMWF global reanalysis, a straightforward divergence method is proposed to estimate the surface CH4 emissions in China from March 2019 to September 2022 at a resolution of 7 km x 7 km. This method was compared with the average annual CH4 emissions of Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv7.0), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 2.53 kg/km(2)/h and within error envelop (EE) is 72.93%, which represents the proportion of reliable values under certain uncertain conditions. We estimated that the average annual CH4 emissions in China from 2019 to 2022 is 81 Tg, with the lowest emissions in 2021 (75 Tg) due to the impact of COVID-19. In 2021, the largest anthropogenic emissions in China are from agriculture, energy activities and livestock, accounting for 28% (20.8 Tg), 25% (18.9 Tg) and 19% (13.9 Tg) of total emissions, respectively, while wetlands, as the largest natural source, produce 14% (10.5 Tg) of CH4 emissions.

TI  - A Retrospective Analysis of National-Scale Agricultural Development in Saudi Arabia from 1990 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification has resulted in the depletion of groundwater resources in many regions of the world. A prime example is Saudi Arabia, which witnessed dramatic agricultural expansion since the 1970s. To explore the influence of policy interventions aimed to better manage water resources, accurate information on the changes in the number and acreage of center-pivot fields is required. To quantify these metrics, we apply a hybrid machine learning framework, consisting of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Spectral Clustering, to the annual maximum Normalized Differential Vegetation Index maps obtained from Landsat imagery collected between 1990 to 2021. When evaluated against more than 28,000 manually delineated fields, the approach demonstrated producer's accuracies ranging from 83.7% to 94.8% and user's accuracies ranging from 90.2% to 97.9%. The coefficient of determination (R2) between framework-delineated and manually delineated fields was higher than 0.97. Nationally, we found that most fields pre-dated 1990 (covering 8841 km2 in that year) and were primarily located within the central regions covering Hail, Qassim, Riyadh, and Wadi ad-Dawasir. A small decreasing trend in field acreage was observed for the period 1990-2010. However, by 2015, the acreage had increased to approximately 33,000 fields covering 9310 km(2). While a maximum extent was achieved in 2016, recent decreases have seen levels return to pre-1990 levels. The gradual decrease between 1990 to 2010 was related to policy initiatives designed to phase-out wheat, while increases between 2010 to 2015 were linked to fodder crop expansion. There is evidence of an agricultural uptick starting in 2021, which is likely in response to global influences such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the conflict in Ukraine. Overall, this work offers the first detailed assessment of long-term agricultural development in Saudi Arabia, and provides important insights related to production metrics such as crop types, crop water consumption, and crop phenology and the overarching impacts of agricultural policy interventions.

TI  - Mapping the Shifting Focus in Remote Sensing Literature: Technology, Methodology, and Applications
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper characterizes the body of knowledge on remote sensing from 1999 to 2021 by employing bibliometric techniques based on the Science Citation Index databases and the Social Science Citation Index of the Web of Science, abbreviated to "SCI" and "SSCI", respectively. A total of 28,438 articles were analyzed from various aspects of the publication characteristics, such as countries, institutes, subjects, journals, and keywords. Dynamic changes in published remote sensing research were examined by segregating the 19-year period into 4 stages. Co-occurrences of keywords from three aspects were evaluated, including technology, methodology, and applications. Results show that "hyperspectral remote sensing", "classification", "monitoring" and "MODIS" in the category of technology have emerged more frequently in recent years, and there are strong co-occurrences of "remote sensing" and "GIS" in the remote sensing technology category. In addition, there was a marked shift from traditional analytical methods (i.e., geostatistics and neural networks) to a variety of emerging methods, such as support vector machines, random forests, and feature extraction. Moreover, research hotspots are identified for remote sensing applications, which have expanded significantly with improvements in technology and methodology. In particular, "water quality", "climate change", and "urbanization" have become popular themes in recent years. Finally, future directions of remote sensing are identified, which would be beneficial for researchers and policy makers.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Changes in Vegetation Cover in the Three North Protection Forest Project Area Supported by GEE Cloud Platform
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The alterations in vegetation cover in the Three North Protection Forest Project area influence its ecological and environmental management. It helps to study soil erosion, environmental change, and ecosystem protection to provide basic data support. Based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, this paper selects MODIS 3Q1 data from 2000-2020 and uses the image element dichotomous model to estimate the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of the Three North Protection Forest Project area, evaluates the stability and temporal and spatial variation of FVC, investigates the coupling relationship between the FVC and temperature and rainfall through evaluation indexes such as the slope of inter-annual variation and partial correlation coefficient, and then analyzes the influence of land use changes on the FVC. The results show that the fractional vegetation cover of the Three North Protection Forest Project area as a whole has increased significantly over the past 20 years, the medium and high vegetation coverage areas have reached 36.4%, the high vegetation FVC has increased from 20.66% in 2000 to 21.59% in 2020, and the vegetation activity is increasing. The vegetation cover is significantly affected by the topographic effect, with the vegetation cover improving relatively well at slopes between 5-13 degrees and elevations ranging from 2000-2500 m. The overall positive correlation between vegetation and temperature and vegetation and precipitation in the study area was 54.08% and 70.04%, respectively, and precipitation was the key factor influencing vegetation growth in the research region. Human activities have a stronger effect on vegetation construction than destruction, and this study contributes to the evaluation of the benefits of the Three North Protection Forest Project and the understanding of human influence on environmental change.

TI  - Mapping Potential Water Resource Areas Using GIS-Based Frequency Ratio and Evidential Belief Function
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a critical freshwater resource that is necessary for sustaining life. Thus, targeting prospective groundwater zones is crucial for the extraction, use, and management of water resources. In this study, we combined the remote sensing, GIS-based frequency ratio (FR), and evidential belief function (EBF) techniques into a model to delineate and quantify prospective groundwater zones. To accomplish this, we processed Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2, and rainfall data to reveal the geomorphic, hydrologic, and structural elements and climatic conditions of the study area, which is downstream of the Yellow River basin, China. We processed, quantified, and combined twelve factors (the elevation, slope, aspect, drainage density, lineament density, distance to rivers, NDVI, TWI, SPI, TRI, land use/cover, and rainfall intensity) that control the groundwater infiltration and occurrence using the GIS-based FR and EBF models to produce groundwater potential zones (GWPZs). We used the natural breaks classifier to categorize the groundwater likelihood at each location as very low, low, moderate, high, or very high. The FR model exhibited a better performance than the EBF model, as evidenced by the area under the curve (AUC) assessment of the groundwater potential predictions (FR AUCs of 0.707 and 0.734, and EBF AUCs of 0.665 and 0.690). Combining the FR and EBF models into the FR-EBF model increased the accuracy (AUC = 0.716 and 0.747), and it increased the areas of very high and moderate potentiality to 1.97% of the entire area, instead of the 0.39 and 0.78% of the FR and EBF models, respectively. The integration of remote sensing and GIS-data-driven techniques is crucial for the mapping of groundwater prospective zones.

TI  - A SqueeSAR Spatially Adaptive Filtering Algorithm Based on Hadoop Distributed Cluster Environment
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques analyze a study area using a set of SAR image data composed of time series, reaching millimeter surface subsidence accuracy. To effectively acquire the subsidence information in low-coherence areas without obvious features in non-urban areas, an MT-InSAR technique, called SqueeSAR, is proposed to improve the density of the subsidence points in the study area by fusing the distributed scatterers (DS). However, SqueeSAR filters the DS points individually during spatial adaptive filtering, which requires significant computer memory, which leads to low processing efficiency, and faces great challenges in large-area InSAR processing. We propose a spatially adaptive filtering parallelization strategy based on the Spark distributed computing engine in a Hadoop distributed cluster environment, which splits the different DS pixel point data into different computing nodes for parallel processing and effectively improves the filtering algorithm's performance. To evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, we conducted a performance evaluation and accuracy verification in and around the main city of Kunming with the original Sentinel-1A SLC data provided by ESA. Additionally, parallel calculation was performed in a YARN cluster comprising three computing nodes, which improved the performance of the filtering algorithm by a factor of 2.15, without affecting the filtering accuracy.

TI  - Research on the Interactive Relationship of Spatial Expansion between Estuarine and Coastal Port Cities
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In both developed and developing countries, port-city relationships have always attracted much attention. However, in the port-city interface, views differ as to whether the port drives the city or vice versa. The combination of remote sensing data and geospatial big data (point of interest) has provided a favorable solution. Taking the typical estuarine and coastal port cities in China's coastal zone as an example, this study examines the following contents based on the port-city interface: the formation age of urban built-up areas and port areas on both sides of the port-city boundary; interaction between port and urban built-up areas; and the distribution of urban functional areas outside the port. Results show that the degree of spatial integration in estuarine port cities is higher than that of coastal port cities and that in the past 30 years, the expansion of ports has led to the expansion of cities. This expansion is port- and sea-oriented, and the expansion direction of the port city is consistent. On the port-city interface, the estuarine and coastal port cities form different urban regional structure modes. Aside from enriching literature on the port-city relationship, this study provides a reference for the spatial planning and transformation of ports and cities in the future.

TI  - Weighted Sparseness-Based Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anomaly detection of hyperspectral remote sensing data has recently become more attractive in hyperspectral image processing. The low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition-based anomaly detection algorithm (LRaSMD) exhibits poor detection performance in complex scenes with multiple background edges and noise. Therefore, this study proposes a weighted sparse hyperspectral anomaly detection method. First, using the idea of matrix decomposition in mathematics, the original hyperspectral data matrix is reconstructed into three sub-matrices with low rank, small sparsity and representing noise, respectively. Second, to suppress the noise interference in the complex background, we employed the low-rank, background image as a reference, built a local spectral and spatial dictionary through the sliding window strategy, reconstructed the HSI pixels of the original data, and extracted the sparse coefficient. We proposed the sparse coefficient divergence evaluation index (SCDI) as a weighting factor to weight the sparse anomaly map to obtain a significant anomaly map to suppress the background edge, noise, and other residues caused by decomposition, and enhance the abnormal target. Finally, abnormal pixels are segmented based on the adaptive threshold. The experimental results demonstrate that, on a real-scene hyperspectral dataset with a complicated background, the proposed method outperforms the existing representative algorithms in terms of detection performance.

TI  - Intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics for preoperatively predicting the axillary non- sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer on the basis of contrast- enhanced mammography: a multicenter study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To develop and test a contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM)- based radiomics model using intratumoral and peritumoral regions to predict non -sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis in breast cancer before surgery.Methods: This multicenter study included 365 breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis. Intratumoral regions of interest (ROIs) were manually delineated, and peritumoral ROIs (5 and 10 mm) were automatically obtained. Five models, including intratu-moral model, peritumoral (5 and 10 mm) models, and intratumoral+peritumoral (5 and 10 mm) models, were constructed by support vector machine classifier on the basis of optimal features selected by variance threshold, SelectKbest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms. The predictive performance of radi-omics models was evaluated by receiver operating char-acteristic curves. An external testing set was used to test the model. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) model was used to compare the predictive performance with radiomics model.Results: The intratumoral ROI and intratumoral+peritu-moral 10 -mm ROI -based radiomics model achieved the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6871-0.8266) in the internal testing set. In the external testing set, the AUC of radiomics model was 0.7567 (95% CI: 0.6717- 0.8678), higher than that of MSKCC model (AUC = 0.6681, 95% CI: 0.5148-0.8213) (p = 0.361).Conclusions: The intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics based on CEM had an acceptable predictive perfor-mance in predicting NSLN metastasis in breast cancer, which could be seen as a supplementary predicting tool to help clinicians make appropriate surgical plans.Advances in knowledge: The intratumoral and peri-tumoral CEM- based radiomics model could noninva-sively predict NSLN metastasis in breast cancer patients before surgery.

TI  - In-Flight Calibration of Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectra Measured by the Zhurong Mars Rover
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zhurong rover of the China's first Mars Exploration Mission successfully landed on the northern plain of Mars and measured near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra with the Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe). There was only orbital NIR hyperspectral data before the success of the Zhurong and Perseverance rovers in 2021. The in situ spectral measurements by the rover face different problems when compared with orbital measurements in data analysis, and thus need a new process pipeline. We analyzed the factors affecting the quality of the NIR spectra acquired by the Zhurong rover, including temperature variation of the detector, non-homogeneous properties of the calibration panels, the atmosphere transmission and Martian dust buildup on the calibration panels. We then identified that the Martian dust buildup on the calibration panels is the main factor affecting the spectra, causing significant discrepancies between the reflectance calibrated with the white and gray panels, respectively, and the systematically higher reflectance values of the Martian soils measured by the Zhurong rover than those by other missions. We proposed a spectral unmixing strategy to restore the radiance of clean calibration panels on the rover and then derived the reflectance spectra with an uncertainty of similar to 14%. The method has been tested by simulation experiments in laboratory. The data quality of the in situ NIR spectra of the Zhurong rover is significantly improved after the calibrations based on our pipeline, which is critical for mineral identification on small scales and calibrations of the orbital remote sensing data.

TI  - Cross-Slope Transport by a Mesoscale Anticyclone in the Northern South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-slope eddies play an important role in the exchange of water, salt, heat, nutrients, chlorophyll, phytoplankton and other biogeochemical elements between basin and shelf in the South China Sea. The cross-slope transport process by a mesoscale anticyclonic eddy is studied by ROMS model and satellite data. The 1000 m isobath was considered as a proxy for the slope. The anticyclone shows different features at different places on the slope: (a) the volume transport at the northeast of the slope was off-slope, while at the southwest was on-slope; (b) both on and off-slope transports were greatly enhanced during the cross-slope process, and gradually weakened after crossing the slope. The total cross-slope water transport was 5.97 Sv, which was higher than the along-slope component with -0.58 Sv. The Eulerian results also showed that enhanced cross-slope transport was related to the distance between the eddy and slope, the eddy radius, and the eccentricity of the eddy. The offline passive tracer experiment showed that particles were floating up during and after the crossing process, mainly due to the strong Ekman pumping.

TI  - Monitoring Roadbed Stability in Permafrost Area of Qinghai-Tibet Railway by MT-InSAR Technology
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost areas pose a threat to the safe operation of linear projects such as the Qinghai-Tibet railway due to the repeated alternating effects of frost heaving and thawing settlement of frozen soil in permafrost area. Time series InSAR technology can effectively obtain ground deformation information with an accuracy of up to millimeters. Therefore, it is of great significance to use time series InSAR technology to monitor the deformation of the permafrost section of the Qinghai-Tibet railway. This study uses multi-time InSAR (MT-InSAR) technology to monitor the deformation of the whole section of the Qinghai-Tibet railway, detect the uneven settlement of the railway roadbed in space, and detect the seasonal changes in the roadbed in the time domain. At the same time, the local deformation sections over the years are compared and discussed. The time series deformation monitoring results of the permafrost section Sentinel-1 data in 2020 show that the length of the railway roadbed from Tanggula station to Za'gya Zangbo station (TZ) section is approximately 620 m, the deformation of the east and west sides is uneven, and the average annual deformation difference is 60.68 mm/a. The impact of frozen soil in WangKun station to Budongquan station (WB) section on railway roadbed shows the distribution characteristics of high in the middle and low at both ends, and the maximum annual average settlement can reach -158.46 mm/a. This study shows that the deformation of permafrost varies with different ground layers. The impact of human activities on frozen soil deformation is less than that of topography and hydrothermal conditions. At the same time, the study determined that compared with other sections, the roadbed deformation of TZ and WB sections is more obvious.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) transmits a variety of arboviruses (arthropod -borne viruses) and acts as one of the most dangerous mosquito species in the world. Mosquito surveillance is the main means of evaluating vector density, vector-borne disease risk, and the efficacy of vector-control operations. The larval density of Ae. albopictus can be reflected by means of Breteau index and Route index, and egg density can be moni-tored by ovitrap and mosq-ovitrap, whereas mosquito surveillance methods mainly include human landing catch, human-baited double net trap, BG-Sentinel trap, autocidal gravid ovitrap, gravid Aedes trap, and mosquito magnet. This article describes different methods of Ae. albopictus surveillance and offers suggestions to improve surveillance.

TI  - IRS-Aided Uplink Transmission Scheme in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - paper proposes an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided uplink transmission scheme to expand the wireless coverage and improve spectral efficiency for an integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN). Here, multiple earth stations communi-cate with the satellite via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology, while multiple direct users and blockage users access the cellular network through space division multiple access and IRS-aided NOMA technology, respectively. In particular, we first aim at maximizing the ergodic sum rate of the ISTN subject to the quality-of-service requirements and transmit power budgets of all users, yielding a constrained optimization problem. Then, based on the assumption that only the statistical channel state information (CSI) is available, we propose a two-layer alternating algorithm to solve the non-convex original problem. The algorithm combines successive convex approximation with S-procedure ap-proach to calculate the phase shifts of IRS and transmit powers of all users in the first layer, and uses Charnes-Cooper method with semi-definite programming to calculate beamforming vectors at the BS in the second layer. Furthermore, with the help of the zero-forcing beamforming principle, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve the problem that can reduce the computational load effectively. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can obtain a higher ergodic sum rate than the benchmarks.

TI  - Time Ring Data: Definition and Application in Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Urban Expansion and Forest Loss
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can provide spatio-temporal continuous Earth observation data and is becoming the main data source for spatial and temporal analysis. Remote sensing data have been widely used in applications such as meteorological monitoring, forest investigation, environmental health, urban planning, and water conservancy. While long-time-series remote sensing data are used for spatio-temporal analysis, this analysis is usually limited because of the large data volumes and complex models used. This study intends to develop an innovative and simple approach to reveal the spatio-temporal characteristics of geographic features from the perspective of remote sensing data themselves. We defined an efficient remote sensing data structure, namely time ring (TR) data, to depict the spatio-temporal dynamics of two common geographic features. One is spatially expansive features. Taking nighttime light (NTL) as an example, we generated a NTL TR map to exhibit urban expansion with spatial and temporal information. The speed and acceleration maps of NTL TR data indicated extraordinary expansion in the last 10 years, especially in coastal cities and provincial capitals. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province, Shandong Province, and Jiangsu Province exhibited fast acceleration of urbanization. The other is spatially contractive features. We took forest loss in the Amazon basin as an example and produced a forest cover TR map. The speed and acceleration were mapped in two 10-year periods (2000-2010 and 2010-2020) in order to observe the changes in Amazon forest cover. Then, combining cropland TR data, we determined the consistency of the spatio-temporal variations and used a linear regression model to detect the association between the acceleration of cropland and forest. The forest TR map showed that, spatially, there was an apparent phenomenon of forest loss occurring in the southern and eastern Amazon basin. Temporally, the speed of forest loss was more drastic between 2000 and 2010 than that in 2010-2020. In addition, the acceleration of forest loss showed a dispersed distribution, except for in Bolivia, which demonstrated a concentrated regional acceleration. The R-squared value of the linear regression between forest and cropland acceleration reached 0.75, indicating that forest loss was closely linked to the expansion of cropland. The TR data defined in this study not only optimized the use of remote sensing data, but also facilitated their application in spatio-temporal integrative analysis. More importantly, multi-field TR data could be jointly applied to explore the driving force at spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Defense System of the Manila Clam <i>Ruditapes philippinarum</i> under High-Temperature and Hydrogen Sulfide Conditions
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary During evolution, marine bivalves developed physiological and behavioral strategies to cope with stress. However, the role of behavioral strategies is unclear when the physiological strategies of bivalves contradict behavioral survival and environmental stress. This study presents the effects of high-temperature and hydrogen sulfide conditions on the survival and defensive strategies of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. The results show that both physiological and behavioral strategies play an important role under stress conditions, but the defense system and response strategy of the Manila clam to cope with H2S changed with the temperature. This study aims to achieve an understanding of the relationship between the physiological response, behavioral characteristics, and survival of the Manila clam under stressful conditions, and to provide useful information for the culture of the Manila clam. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) acts as an environmental toxin. Despite its toxicity, little is known about the defense strategies of marine bivalves against it. Thus, the tolerance, behavioral characteristics, and physiological response strategies against H2S treatment in the sentinel organism Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum were examined. We monitored the survival and behavioral status of Manila clams exposed to different combinations of temperature and H2S. The physiological response strategies were examined by measuring the enzymatic activity of cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), fumarate reductase (FRD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase enzymes (CAT). Moreover, adverse effects of H2S on the tissue and cell structure of Manila clams were also examined under a transmission electron microscope. Manila clams responded to H2S stress through behavioral and chemical defenses. With exposure to H2S alone, Manila clams primarily enhanced aerobic respiratory metabolic pathways in the beginning stages by opening the shell and increasing the CCO activity to obtain more oxygen; with increasing exposure time, when aerobic respiration was inhibited, the shell was closed, and FRD, CAT, and SOD were activated. At this point, Manila clams responded to H2S stress through the anaerobic metabolism and antioxidant defense systems. However, high temperatures (>= 28 degrees C) altered the defense strategy of Manila clams. With co-exposure to high temperatures and high H2S concentrations (>= 20 mu mol/L), the Manila clams immediately closed their shells and changed from aerobic respiration to anaerobic metabolism while immediately activating antioxidant defense systems. Nevertheless, this defense strategy was short lived. In addition to this, apparent damage to tissue and cell structures, including mitochondrial ridge dissolution and many vacuoles, was observed in Manila clams exposed to high temperatures and high H2S concentrations. Thus, prolonged exposure to high temperature and H2S damages the tissue structure of Manila clams, affecting their behavioral capacity and future survival. In summary, profiling Manila clams' physiological response strategies to H2S exposure provided ecological behavioral support for our current understanding of H2S detrimental toxicity on marine bivalves.

TI  - Discovering the Ancient Tomb under the Forest Using Machine Learning with Timing-Series Features of Sentinel Images: Taking Baling Mountain in Jingzhou as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultural traces under forests are one of the main problems affecting the identification of archaeological sites in densely forested areas, so it is full of challenges to discover ancient tombs buried under dense vegetation. The covered ancient tombs can be identified by studying the time-series features of the vegetation covering the ancient tombs on the multi-time series remote sensing images because the ancient tombs buried deep underground have long-term underground space structures, which affect the intrinsic properties of the surface soil so that the growth status of the covering vegetation is different from that of the vegetation in the area without ancient tombs. We first use the highly detailed DSM data to select the ancient tombs that cannot be visually distinguished on the optical images. Then, we explored and constructed the temporal features of the ancient tombs under the forest and the non-ancient tombs in the images, such as the radar timing-series features of Sentinel 1 and the multi-spectral and vegetation index timing-series features of Sentinel 2. Finally, based on these features and machine learning, we designed an automatic identification algorithm for ancient tombs under the forest. The method has been validated in Baling Mountain in Jingzhou, China. It is very feasible to automatically identify ancient tombs covered by surface vegetation by using the timing-series features of remote sensing images. Additionally, the identification of large ancient tombs or concentrated ancient tombs is more accurate, and the accuracy is improved after adding radar features. The paper concludes with a discussion of the current limitations and future directions of the method.

TI  - Dynamic Habitat Indices and Climatic Characteristics Explain Species Richness Patterns on the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change affects biodiversity patterns, especially in arid and semi-arid regions such as the Mongolian plateau, one of the most ecologically fragile regions in the world. Three dynamic habitat indices (DHIs) were related to the productivity hypothesis and calculated based on FAPAR, including cumulative productivity (DHIcum indicates the availability of resources such as food supply and habitat in a year, representing available energy), minimum productivity (DHImin indicates the limitations of food and habitat resources in a year, representing environmental stress), and seasonal productivity (DHIsea denotes the change in productivity in a year, representing environmental stability). In this paper, we investigated the distribution pattern of species richness on the Mongolian Plateau based on the productivity hypothesis. We constructed models of the richness of three species (mammals, birds, and amphibians) using DHIs and climate variables to explain patterns of species richness on the Mongolian Plateau. The results revealed that, on the Mongolian plateau, there is a relatively high correlation between DHIs and species richness, especially with DHIcum (R = 0.59 for mammals, R = 0.73 for birds, and R = 0.58 for amphibians). There was a significant non-linear relationship between DHIs and species richness, as the model predictive power was significantly enhanced with GAM and RF. The inclusion of climate variables significantly improved the explanatory power of various models for the mammal, bird, and amphibian species richness on the Mongolian Plateau, with the best results for RF (0.89, 0.94, and 0.91, respectively). The influence of climate variables on species richness patterns in the importance ranking was higher than that of DHIs. Climate also has an influence on species richness. Vegetation productivity and climatic factors are good determinants of species richness on the Mongolian Plateau and should be carefully considered in future studies.

TI  - CRA-40/Atmosphere-The First-Generation Chinese Atmospheric Reanalysis (1979-2018): System Description and Performance Evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric reanalysis reproduces the past atmospheric conditions through assimilation of historical meteorological observations with fixed version of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model and data assimilation (DA) system. It is widely used in weather, climate, and even business-related research and applications. This paper reports the development of CMA's first-generation global atmospheric reanalysis (RA) covering 1979-2018 (CRA-40; CRA refers to CMA-RA). CRA-40 is produced by using the Global Spectral Model (GSM)/Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) at a 6-h time interval and a T(L)574 spectral (34-km) resolution with the model top at 0.27 hPa. A large number of reprocessed satellite data and widely collected conventional observations were assimilated during the reanalyzing process, including the reprocessed atmospheric motion vector (AMV) products from FY-2C/D/E/G satellites, dense conventional observations (at about 120 radiosonde and 2400 synoptic stations) over China, as well as MWHS-2 and GNSS-RO observations from FY-3C. The reanalysis fitting to observations is improved over time, especially for surface pressure with root-mean-square error reduced from 1.05 hPa in 1979 to 0.8 hPa, and for upper air temperature from 1.65 K in 1979 to 1.35 K, in 2018. The patterns of global analysis increments for temperature, specific humidity, and zonal wind are consistent with the changes in the observing system. Near surface temperature from the model's 6-h forecast reflects the global warming trend reasonably. The CRA-40 precipitation pattern matches well with those of GPCP and other reanalyses. CRA-40 also successfully captures the QBO and its vertical and temporal development, hemispherical atmospheric circulation change, and moisture transport by the East Asian summer monsoon. CRA is now operationally running in near real time as a climate data assimilation system in CMA.

TI  - Prediction of Vegetation Change by Discrete Wavelet Decomposition Based on Remote Sensing Time Series Images
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of remote sensing technology has accumulated a large number of remote sensing image time series data for human monitoring of surface vegetation change, which provides a basis for vegetation change prediction. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of vegetation change, this paper uses discrete wavelet to decompose remote sensing image sequences at multiple scales, to explore the difference of influence of different temporal scale change characteristics on vegetation spatio-temporal change prediction, and find the best decomposition scale for vegetation change prediction. In this paper, the research object is the MODIS 13Q1 EVI image data of Hunan Province from 2001 to 2021. The discrete wavelet is adopted to obtain multi-scale vegetation trend components and detailed component sequences, and then complete the LSTM modeling prediction and comparison. The following are the experimental findings: the predictive ability of the discrete wavelet decomposition sequence group is better than that of the original EVI time series to varying degrees. The order of prediction accuracy is: monthly scale > seasonal scale > annual scale > original EVI time series. Thus, it is of reference significance to the research of application scenarios of change prediction of other regionalized variables with multi-scale characteristics.

TI  - Investigating the Stability of the Hill of the Acropolis of Athens, Greece, Using Fuzzy Logic and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate the stability of the Acropolis Hill, Greece, by developing a Rock Instability Model (RIM) based on fuzzy logic and remote sensing techniques. RIM aimed to identify locations on the rock formations of the Acropolis Hill that will potentially have instability issues due to the action of geomorphological factors, weathering and erosive processes. Six factors including lithology, slope angle, density of discontinuities, density of faults, density of surface runoff elements, and the orientation of the stratigraphy of the geological formations in relation to the orientation of the slope were considered as the most appropriate for implementing the proposed novel approach, with each variable classified and weighted by a fuzzy simple additive weighting method. Lithology and slope angle were considered the most significant variables that contributed to the overall stability of the Acropolis Hill. The outcomes of the RIM model were verified by remote sensing data and field observation, showing an agreement and high accuracy. From the satellite data analysis, it was concluded that for the entire Acropolis Hill, minor displacement rates were recorded, probably because of the extensive mitigation measures and consolidation works established in the recent past. Overall, the study highlighted the ability of the proposed methodology to be used as an alternative investigation tool in rock instability-related assessments valuable to land use planning and development, helping reduce the anticipated losses in highly susceptible zones.

TI  - Using 'sentinel' plants to improve early detection of invasive plant pathogens
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Infectious diseases of plants present an ongoing and increasing threat to international biosecurity, with wide-ranging implications. An important challenge in plant disease management is achieving early detection of invading pathogens, which requires effective surveillance through the implementation of appropriate monitoring programmes. However, when monitoring relies on visual inspection as a means of detection, surveillance is often hindered by a long incubation period (delay from infection to symptom onset) during which plants may be infectious but not displaying visible symptoms. 'Sentinel' plants-alternative susceptible host species that display visible symptoms of infection more rapidly-could be introduced to at-risk populations and included in monitoring programmes to act as early warning beacons for infection. However, while sentinel hosts exhibit faster disease progression and so allow pathogens to be detected earlier, this often comes at a cost: faster disease progression typically promotes earlier onward transmission. Here, we construct a computational model of pathogen transmission to explore this trade-off and investigate how including sentinel plants in monitoring programmes could facilitate earlier detection of invasive plant pathogens. Using Xylella fastidiosa infection in Olea europaea (European olive) as a current high profile case study, for which Catharanthus roseus (Madagascan periwinkle) is a candidate sentinel host, we apply a Bayesian optimisation algorithm to determine the optimal number of sentinel hosts to introduce for a given sampling effort, as well as the optimal division of limited surveillance resources between crop and sentinel plants. Our results demonstrate that including sentinel plants in monitoring programmes can reduce the expected prevalence of infection upon outbreak detection substantially, increasing the feasibility of local outbreak containment.Author summaryPlant diseases affect the environment and the economy negatively, with implications for biodiversity and food security. Fast detection of invading pathogens is essential to prevent widespread transmission. This is challenging, however, because many plant diseases have a long presymptomatic period (delay from initial infection to symptom onset) in globally important hosts. During this presymptomatic period, infection may spread undetected to other plants. While the presymptomatic period can be long, plant diseases often affect multiple host species, with different epidemiological characteristics. This provides an opportunity for planting sentinel plants, which are alternative host species that display visible symptoms of infection quickly, as early warning beacons for infection. In this research article, we use mathematical modelling to explore the potential for sentinel plants to aid plant disease monitoring programmes. We show that, for a high-profile plant pathogen (Xylella fastidiosa, which is currently devastating olive groves in southern Europe), the use of sentinel plants allows new outbreaks to be identified quickly, reducing the prevalence of infection when outbreaks are detected. Model simulations also indicate that our results apply more generally. Sentinel plants have the potential to assist fast detection of a wide range of invading plant pathogens.

TI  - Extracting a Connected River Network from DEM by Incorporating Surface River Occurrence Data and Sentinel-2 Imagery in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of river network from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a significant content in the application of a distributed hydrological model. However, the study of river network extraction based on DEM has some limitations, such as location offset, inaccurate parallel channel and short circuit of meandering channels. In this study, we proposed a new enhancement method for NASADEM V001 in the Danjiangkou Reservoir area. We used Surface Water Occurrence (SWO) and Sentinel-2 data to describe vertical limit differences between morphological units to complement actual flow path information from NASADEM data by a stream burning method. The differences between the extracted river network and the actual river network were evaluated in three different geographical regions. Compared with the actual river centerline, the location error of the river network extraction was significantly reduced. The average offset distances between river network extraction and the actual river network were 68.38, 36.99, and 21.59 m in the three test areas. Compared with NASADEM V001, the average offset distances in the three test areas were reduced by 7.26, 40.29, and 42.35%, respectively. To better estimate accuracy, we also calculated and compared the accuracy of the river network based on MERIT Hrdro and HydroSHEDS. The experimental results demonstrated that the method can effectively improve the accuracy of river network extraction and meet the needs of hydrological simulation.

TI  - Aerosol Characterization of Northern China and Yangtze River Delta Based on Multi-Satellite Data: Spatiotemporal Variations and Policy Implications
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Horizontal and vertical distributions of aerosol properties in the Taklimakan Desert (TD), North central region of China (NCR),North China Plain(NCP), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) were investigated by statistical analysis using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) L3 data from 2007 to 2020, to identify the similarities and differences in atmospheric aerosols in different regions, and evaluate the impact of pollution control policies developed in China in 2013 on aerosol properties in the study area. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) distribution had substantial seasonal and spatial distribution characteristics. AOD had high annual averages in TD (0.38), NCP (0.49), and YRD (0.52). However, these rates showed a decline post-implementation of the long-term pollution control policies; AOD values declined by 5%, 13.8%, 15.5%, and 23.7% in TD, NCR, NCP, and YRD respectively when comparing 2014-2018 to 2007-2013, and by 7.8%, 11.5%, 16%, and 10.4% when comparing 2019-2020 to 2014-2018. The aerosol extinction coefficient showed a clear regional pattern and a tendency to decrease gradually as height increased. Dust and polluted dust were responsible for the changes in AOD and extinction coefficients between TD and NCR and NCP and YRD, respectively. In TD, with change of longitude, dust aerosol first increased and then decreased gradually, peaking in the middle. Similarly in NCP, polluted dust aerosol first increased and then decreased, with a maximum value in the middle. The elevated smoke aerosols of NCP and YRD were significantly higher than those observed in TD and NCR. The high aerosol extinction coefficient values (>0.1 km(-1)) were mainly distributed below 4 km, and the relatively weak aerosol extinction coefficients (>0.001 km(-1)) were mainly distributed between 5-8 km, indicating that the high-altitude long-range transport of TD and NCR dust aerosols affects NCP and YRD.

TI  - Prediction of Future Land Use/Land Cover Changes Using a Coupled CA-ANN Model in the Upper Omo-Gibe River Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change evaluation and prediction using spatiotemporal data are crucial for environmental monitoring and better planning and management of land use. The main objective of this study is to evaluate land use/land cover changes for the time period of 1991-2022 and predict future changes using the CA-ANN model in the Upper Omo-Gibe River basin. Landsat-5 TM for 1991, 1997, and 2004, Landsat-7 ETM+ for 2010, and Landsat-8 (OLI) for 2016 and 2022 were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer Data Center. A random forest machine learning algorithm was employed for LULC classification. The LULC classification result was evaluated using an accuracy assessment technique to assure the correctness of the classification method employing the kappa coefficient. Kappa coefficient values of the classification indicate that there was strong agreement between the classified and reference data. Using the MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS and the CA-ANN model, future LULC changes were predicted. Artificial neural network (ANN) and cellular automata (CA) machine learning methods were made available for LULC change modeling and prediction via the QGIS MOLUSCE plugin. Transition potential modeling was computed, and future LULC changes were predicted using the CA-ANN model. An overall accuracy of 86.53% and an overall kappa value of 0.82 were obtained by comparing the actual data of 2022 with the simulated LULC data from the same year. The study findings revealed that between 2022 and 2037, agricultural land (63.09%) and shrubland (5.74%) showed significant increases, and forest (-48.10%) and grassland (-0.31%) decreased. From 2037 to 2052, the built-up area (2.99%) showed a significant increase, and forest and agricultural land (-2.55%) showed a significant decrease. From 2052 to 2067, the projected LULC simulation result showed that agricultural land (3.15%) and built-up area (0.32%) increased, and forest (-1.59%) and shrubland (-0.56%) showed significant decreases. According to the study's findings, the main drivers of LULC changes are the expansion of built-up areas and agricultural land, which calls for a thorough investigation using additional data and models to give planners and policymakers clear information on LULC changes and their environmental effects.

TI  - Greenhouse Gases Monitoring Instrument on GaoFen-5 Satellite-II: Optical Design and Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenhouse gases Monitoring Instrument on GaoFen-5 satellite-II (GMI-II) uses spatial heterodyne spectroscopy (SHS) for quantitative monitoring of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG). Unlike the traditional SHS, the interferometer component of the GMI-II was designed with zero optical path difference offset, effectively improving spectral resolution while maintaining the same detector specifications. The secondary imaging system with non-isometric scaling of spatial and spectral dimensions was designed to decrease the integration time of a frame image or improve the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under the same integration time. This paper introduces the design, manufacture, adjustment methods, and test results of the main performance indexes of the GMI-II that indicate that the spectral resolution of the O-2 A-band detection channel is better than 0.6 cm(-1) and other channels are better than 0.27 cm(-1). Under the typical radiance of other carbon monitors' on-orbit statistics, the spectral SNR of the GMI-II is more than 300. These test results demonstrate that the GMI-II can be well adapted to quantitative remote sensing monitoring of atmospheric GHG.

TI  - A new technique for quantifying algal bloom, floating/emergent and submerged vegetation in eutrophic shallow lakes using Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing problem of eutrophication, lacustrine ecosystem can undergo complex changes, often resulting in a shift from a clear macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid phytoplankton-dominated state. How-ever, it's not clear how lake transitions occur at regional and global scales. This is due to a lack of long-term monitoring and an effective algorithm that can distinguish floating/emergent aquatic vegetation (FEAV), sub-merged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and algal bloom (AB). This paper presents a novel three-step classification algorithm based on Landsat imagery, (ie., vegetation and bloom indices (VBI) algorithm): (1) to distinguish between aquatic vegetation (AV) and non-aquatic vegetation (non-AV) extents by an aquatic vegetation index (AVI) derived from tasseled cap transformation; (2) to identify FEAV and SAV within AV extent by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and (3) to extract AB from non-AV extent with floating algae index (FAI). The performance of the VBI algorithm was validated using 1307 field samples collected across 22 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLY) in China, with a pooled overall accuracy of 84.49%. Finally, the VBI algorithm was applied to Landsat data from 1985 to 2021 to quantify the temporal changes of FEAV, SAV and AB in large lakes (i.e., > 50 km2) along the MLY. Within these lakes, AV showed a significant decrease over the past 37 years, mainly due to the decrease of SAV; while AB occurred with higher frequency and in more lakes. The transition from a macrophyte-dominated state to a phytoplankton-dominated aquatic systems is still ongoing in the MLY area. This study shows outstanding innovation in the construction of a new classification index (i.e., AVI), and the method of calculating the adaptive threshold, which makes VBI algorithm have great potential in mapping long-term changes and capturing transformation between lake communities on a global scale.

TI  - Crop type mapping in the central part of the North China Plain using Sentinel-2 time series and machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The North China Plain (NCP), a major agricultural area in China, plays an important role in China's grain production. Timely and accurate crop information for NCP is very important to China's food security and sus-tainable development. Due to high variability of the temporal profiles of vegetation indices, classification models using temporally aggregated remote sensing data often exhibit suboptimal performance for multi-crop classifi-cation in the NCP with complex cropping patterns. Therefore, optimal feature sets and classification models should be developed for efficient and accurate crop mapping in this region. In this study, we used all available Sentinel-2 imagery in 2020 to map major crops including winter wheat/corn, cotton, peanut, and millet in a typical winter wheat production city in the central part of the NCP. NDVI time series, textural, and phenological features from Sentinel-2 time series and topographic features of the study area were derived as input features (394 features in total). Two feature selection methods, random forest and unsupervised feature selection based on multi-subspace randomization and collaboration (SRCFS), were used to select 20 informative features from the 394 features. Then, four groups of features were evaluated with three machine learning classifiers, i.e., random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results showed that the most useful features for crop type classification for the region were phenological and textural features during February to March and April to May. When using the full feature set, RF provided the best results compared with SVM and ANN. However, both RF and SVM classifier with 20 RF-selected features generated the optimal results. The crops were identified with an overall accuracy of 93% and a kappa coefficient of 0.9 in the final 10-meter resolution crop map. The feature selection and machine learning classification methods can be applied to high -resolution crop mapping using time series of Sentinel-2 data in agricultural regions with mixed cropping patterns in an efficient manner.

TI  - A Spatial and Temporal Evaluation of Broad-Scale Yield Predictions Created from Yield Mapping Technology and Landsat Satellite Imagery in the Australian Mediterranean Dryland Cropping Region
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemplation of potential strategies to adapt to a changing and variable climate in agricultural cropping areas depends on the availability of geo-information that is at a sufficient resolution, scale and temporal length to inform these decisions. We evaluated the efficacy of creating high-resolution, broad-scale indicators of yield from simple models that combine yield mapping data, a precision agriculture tool, with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 5 and 7 ETM+ imagery. These models were then generalised to test its potential operationalisation across a large agricultural region (>1/2 million hectares) and the state of South Australia (>8 million hectares). Annual models were the best predictors of yield across both areas. Moderate discrimination accuracy in the regional analysis meant that models could be extrapolated with reasonable spatial precision, whereas the accuracy across the state-wide analysis was poor. Generalisation of these models to further operationalise the methodology by removing the need for crop type discrimination and the continual access to annual yield data showed some benefit. The application of this approach with past and contemporary datasets can create a long-term archive that fills an information void, providing a powerful evidence base to inform current management decisions and future on-farm land use in cropping regions elsewhere.

TI  - Flood Runoff Simulation under Changing Environment, Based on Multiple Satellite Data in the Jinghe River Basin of the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the hydrological surface condition changes, climate change and their combined impacts on flood runoff are critical for comprehending the hydrology under environmental changes and for solving future flood management challenges. This study was designed to examine the relative contributions of the hydrological surface condition changes and climate change in the flood runoff of a 45,421-km(2) watershed in the Loess Plateau region. Statistical analytical methods, including Kendall's trend test, the Theisen median trend analysis, and cumulative anomaly method, were used to detect trends in the relationship between the climatic variables, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use/cover change (LUCC) data, and observed flood runoff. A grid-cell distributed rainfall-runoff model was used to detect the quantitative hydrologic responses to the climatic variability and land-use change. We found that climatic variables were not statistically significantly different (p > 0.05) over the study period. From 1985 to 2013, the cropland area continued to decrease, while the forest land, pastures, and residential areas increased in the Jinghe River Basin. Affected by LUCC and climate change, the peak discharges and flood volumes decreased by 8-22% and 5-67%, respectively. This study can provide a reference for future land-use planning and flood runoff control policy formulation and for revision in the study area.

TI  - Land Subsidence Assessment of an Archipelago Based on the InSAR Time Series Analysis Method
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of resources on islands leads to their extremely rapid development, and this can result in frequent geological disasters involving island subsidence. These disasters not only destroy the ecological environment and landscape of islands but also pose massive threats to the safety of residents' lives and property and can even affect the country's maritime rights and interests. To meet the demands of island stability and safety monitoring, in this study, we propose a large-area, full-coverage deformation monitoring method using InSAR technology to assess island subsidence based on a comprehensive analysis of conventional monitoring techniques. The working principle and unique advantages of InSAR data are introduced, and the SBAS InSAR key interpretation processing flow are described in detail. The GPU-assisted InSAR processing method is used to improve the processing efficiency. The monitoring results showed that the southern island group of the Miaodao Archipelago was relatively stable overall, with an annual average deformation rate of 3 mm. Only a few areas experienced large-magnitude surface deformation, and the maximum annual deformation magnitude was 45 mm. The time series deformation results of the characteristic points of the five inhabited islands in the southern island group showed that the subsidence trends of the two selected points on Beichangshan Island (P1 and P2) were slowly declining. The P3 point on Nanchangshan Island experienced a large deformation, while the P4 point experienced a relatively small deformation. The selected points (P5, P6 and P7) on Miaodao Island, Xiaoheishan Island and Daheishan Island were stable during the monitoring period. InSAR data can be used to accurately identify the millimetre-scale microdeformations experienced by island groups, thus demonstrating the high-precision deformation monitoring capability of these data. In addition, the accuracy of these data can meet the needs of island and archipelago subsidence monitoring, and the proposed method is an effective means to monitor the spatial deformation of island targets. This study is conducive to further enriching and improving island stability and safety monitoring technology systems in China and to providing data and technical support for identifying and mastering potential island risks, protecting and utilizing islands and preventing and reducing disasters.

TI  - Estimating Fractional Snow Cover in the Pan-Arctic Region Using Added Vegetation Extraction Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an essential indicator of global climate change. The composition of the underlying surface in the Pan-Arctic region is complex; forest and other areas with high vegetation coverage have a significant influence on the retrieval accuracy of fractional snow cover (FSC). Therefore, to explore the impact of vegetation on the extraction of the FSC algorithm, this study developed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based Bivariate Linear Regression Model (BV-BLRM) to calculate the FSC. Then, the overall accuracy of the model and its changes under different classification conditions were evaluated and the relationship between the accuracy improvement and different underlying surfaces and elevations was analyzed. The results show that the BV-BLRM model is more accurate than MODIS's traditional univariate linear algorithm for FSC (MOD-FSC) in each underlying surface. Overall, regarding the accuracy of the BV-BLRM model, the RMSE is 0.2, MAE is 0.15, and accuracy is 28.6% higher than the MOD-FSC model. The newly developed BV-BLRM model has the most significant improvement in the accuracy of FSC retrieval when the underlying surface has high vegetation coverage. Under different classification accuracies, the accuracy of BV-BLRM model was higher than that of MOD-FSC model, with an average of 30.5%. The improvement of FSC extraction accuracy by the model is smaller when the underlying surface is perpetual snow zone, with an average of 12.2%. This study is applicable to the scale mapping of FSC in large areas and is helpful to improve the FSC accuracy in areas with high vegetation coverage.

TI  - Dictionary Learning for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With deep learning-based methods growing (even with scarce data in some fields), few-shot remote sensing scene classification (FSRSSC) has received a lot of attention. One mainstream approach uses base data to train a feature extractor (FE) in the pre-training phase and employs novel data to design the classifier and complete the classification task in the meta-test phase. Due to the scarcity of remote sensing data, obtaining a suitable feature extractor for remote sensing data and designing a robust classifier have become two major challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning (DL) algorithm for few-shot remote sensing scene classification to address these two difficulties. First, we use natural image datasets with sufficient data to obtain a pre-trained feature extractor. We fine-tune the parameters with the remote sensing dataset to make the feature extractor suitable for remote sensing data. Second, we design the kernel space classifier to map the features to a high-dimensional space and embed the label information into the dictionary learning to improve the discrimination of features for classification. Extensive experiments on four popular remote sensing scene classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed dictionary learning method.

TI  - Natural marine cloud brightening in the Southern Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of cloud droplets per unit volume (Nd) is a fundamentally important property of marine boundary layer (MBL) liquid clouds that, at constant liquid water path, exerts considerable controls on albedo. Past work has shown that regional N(d )has a direct correlation to marine primary productivity (PP) because of the role of seasonally varying, biogenically derived precursor gases in modulating secondary aerosol properties. These linkages are thought to be observable over the high-latitude oceans, where strong seasonal variability in aerosol and meteorology covary in mostly pristine environments. Here, we examine N-d variability derived from 5 years of MODIS Level 2-derived cloud properties in a broad region of the summer eastern Southern Ocean and adjacent marginal seas. We demonstrate latitudinal, longitudinal and temporal gradients in N-d that are strongly correlated with the passage of air masses over high-PP waters that are mostly concentrated along the Antarctic Shelf poleward of 60 degrees S. We find that the albedo of MBL clouds in the latitudes south of 60 degrees S is significantly higher than similar liquid water path (LWP) clouds north of this latitude.

TI  - Cyclic Trends of Wildfires over Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the patterns of the occurrences of fire incidents over sub-Saharan Africa are studied on the basis of satellite data. Patterns for the whole sub-Saharan Africa are contrasted with those for northern sub-Saharan Africa and southern-hemisphere Africa. This paper attempts to unravel linear trends and overriding oscillations using regression and spectral techniques. It compares fire patterns for aggregated vegetation with those for specific types, which are savannahs, grasslands, shrublands, croplands, and forests, to identify key trend drivers. The underlying cyclic trends are interpreted in light of climate change and model projections. Considering sub-Saharan Africa, northern sub-Saharan Africa, and southern-hemisphere Africa, we found declining linear trends of wildfires with overriding cyclic patterns that have a period of similar to 5 years, seemingly largely driven by savannahs, grasslands, and croplands.

TI  - Is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Necessary in Patients who Undergo Prophylactic Mastectomy?
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) during prophylactic mastectomy (PM). We conducted a retrospective review of 146 patients who underwent PM without SLNB. Pathology findings revealed no incidence of occult invasive breast cancer - suggesting limited utility of routine SLNB. We also assessed preoperative imaging, underscoring breast MRIs as a non-invasive tool to detect occult malignancy. Background: Over the last decade, rates of risk-reducing prophylactic mastectomy (PM) have risen dramatically. A topic of debate regarding the procedure is whether to use sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at the time of PM and what factors might predict for such need. In order to assess the rate of identifying presence of occult invasive breast cancer in the PM specimen, we performed a retrospective review of the pathology findings from a single-surgeon case-series of PM. Methods: Patients undergoing PM between January 2013 and June 2019 at Orlando Health Cancer Institute were identified for a retrospective chart review. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data from the surgical procedure were collected and analyzed for the incidence of occult invasive breast cancer in the PM specimen. Results: A total of 146 consecutive patients with PM were identified; 120 (82.2%) underwent contralateral PM (CPM) and 26 (17.8%) underwent bilateral PM (BPM). Final pathology of the 172 PM specimens identified 4 (3.3%) with lobular carcinoma in situ, 3 (2.5%) with atypical ductal hyperplasia, and 2 (1.7%) with atypical lobular hyperplasia and 2 (1.7%) with intraductal papilloma. No invasive malignancy was detected in any of the 172 PM specimens. Conclusions: The absence of occult invasive carcinoma in 172 consecutive PM specimens suggests a limited clinical utility in routinely performing SLNB in this setting. This study also suggests that use of preoperative breast MRI imaging could offer a potential non-invasive tool to detect occult malignancy and select patients who can safely undergo omission of SLNB at the time of PM.

TI  - Groundwater Potential Mapping Using Remote Sensing and Random Forest Machine Learning Model: A Case Study from Lower Part of Wadi Yalamlam, Western Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater storage is influenced by many geo-environmental factors. Most of these factors are prepared in the form of categorical data. The present study utilized raster satellite data instead of categorical data and a Random Forest machine learning model to identify groundwater potential zones at the downstream parts of Wadi Yalamlam, western Saudi Arabia. Eighteen groundwater-influenced variables are prepared in continuous raster format from ASTER GDEM, TRMM, and SPOT-5 satellite data. The Random Forest (RF) model is trained using (70%) of the target variable and validated using the rest (30%). The accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-score are all generated to evaluate the model performance. SPOT band 3, band 4, and the rainfall variables are the most important for groundwater potential mapping contributing 11%, 7%, and 8% during the prediction stage. The GDEM elevation variable contributed 6% and the slope variable scored 1%. The main conclusions of the study are: (1) The RF machine learning algorithm successfully identified three groundwater potential zones with an accuracy of 96%. (2) The high, moderate, and low potential groundwater zones covered 11.5%, 59.9%, and 28.6% of the study area respectively. (3) Majority of high and moderate zones lie within the pumping rate range between 10 and 20 m(3)/day. (4) The approach developed in this study can be applied to any other wadis having the same conditions to help authorities and decision-makers in planning and development projects.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Urban Sprawl in a Coastal City Using GIS-Based Markov Chain and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, globally coastal areas have urbanized rapidly due to various socioeconomic and demographic driving forces. However, urban expansion in towns and cities of the developing world has been characterized by entangled structures and trends exacerbating numerous negative consequences such as pollution, ecological degradation, loss of agricultural land and green areas, and deprived settlements. Substantially, spatial simulation of urban growth and their consequences on coastal areas particularly in Egypt is still very rare. Geospatial modelling coastal urban growth is crucial and has enormous potential for coastal land use transformation and urban sustainability. The key aim of this study was to analyze spatiotemporal changes (2010-2020) and simulate future dynamics (2030 to 2050) of land use/land cover (LULC) in Alexandria Governorate, Egypt. Artificial Neural Network-Multiple Layer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) and Markov Chain techniques were employed within the GIS platform to assess processes of land transitions and predict urban growth trends, patterns and dimensions. The forecasting process was based on three maps of LULC derived from classified Landsat images of 2000, 2010 and 2020. In addition, topographical, demographic, accessibility, proximity factors were generated and developed in the form of raster spatial parameters of urbanization driving forces. The findings revealed that the observed expansion of the built-up area during one decade (2010-2020) was 12,477.51 ha, with a decline in agricultural area (7440.39 ha) and bare land (4904.91 ha). The projected change was forecasted to be 71,544 ha by 2030 and 81,983 ha in 2040 with a total of 35,998 ha increase in the built-up area and residential expansion by 2050. Despite this expected pattern of rapid changes, urban growth will be shaped by the key drivers of proximity to coastline and agricultural land transformation. The analysis indicates that the vertical urban growth will be most likely dominant along the coastal zone due to the lack of vacant lands, whereas the horizontal urban expansion will primarily take place towards the east-northeastern and south-southeastern directions of the city. The present work provides a holistic framework for establishing initial coastal land use plans not only for planners and urban administrators in Alexandria but also for policymakers and coastal municipalities in developing nations.

TI  - Data Integration for Investigating Drivers of Water Quality Variability in the Banja Reservoir Watershed
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - It is increasingly important to know the water quality of a reservoir, given the prospect of an environment poor in water reserves, which are based on intense and short-lived precipitation events. In this work, vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI) and bio-physical parameters of the vegetation (LAI, FC), meteorological variables, and hydrological data are considered as possible drivers of the spatial and temporal variability of water quality (WQ) of the Banja reservoir (Albania). Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images are analyzed to derive WQ parameters and vegetation properties, while the HYPE model provides hydrological variables. Timeseries of the considered variables are examined using graphical and statistical methods and correlations among the variables are computed for a five-year period (2016-2022). The added-value of integrating earth observation derived data is demonstrated in the analysis of specific time periods or precipitation events. Significant positive correlations are found between water turbidity and hydrological parameters such as river discharge or runoff (0.55 and 0.40, respectively), while negative correlations are found between water turbidity and vegetation descriptors (-0.48 to -0.56). The possibility of having easy-to-use tools (e.g., web portal) for the analysis of multi-source data in an interactive way, facilitates the planning of hydroelectric plants management operations.

TI  - Corn Land Extraction Based on Integrating Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Images
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Corn is an important food crop worldwide, and its yield is directly related to Chinese food security. Accurate remote sensing extraction of corn can realize the rational application of land resources, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of modern agriculture. In the field of large-scale crop remote sensing classification, single-period optical remote sensing images often cannot achieve high-precision classification. To improve classification accuracy, multiple time series image combinations have gradually been adopted. However, due to the influence of cloudy and rainy weather, it is often difficult to obtain complete time series optical images. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are imaged by microwaves, which have strong penetrating power and are not affected by clouds. A critical way to solve this problem is to use SAR images to compensate for the lack of optical images and obtain a complete time series image in the corn-growing season. However, SAR images have limited wavelengths and cannot provide important wavelengths, such as visible light bands and near-infrared information. To solve this problem, this study took Zhaodong City, a vital corn-planting base in China, as the research area; took GF-6/GF-3 and Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 as remote sensing data sources; designed12 classification scenarios; analyzed the best classification period and the best time series combination of corn classification; studied the influence of SAR images on the classification results of time series images; and compared the classification differences between GF-6/GF-3 and Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2. The results show that the classification accuracy of time series combinations is much higher than that of single-period images. The polarization characteristics of SAR images can improve the classification accuracy with time series images. The classification accuracy of GF series images from China is obviously higher than that of Sentinel series images. The research performed in this paper can provide a reference for agricultural classification by using remote sensing data.

TI  - Study on the Boundary Layer of the Haze at Xianyang Airport Based on Multi-Source Detection Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To reveal the high-resolution atmospheric and statistical characteristics of haze events within the boundary layer (BL) in different months, this study conducted a combined detection experiment using a wind-profiling radar, a microwave radiometer, and an ambient particulate monitor on 1230 haze events occurring at Xianyang Airport from 2016 to 2021. First, the boundary layer heights (BLHs) of the haze events were calculated using the atmospheric refractive index structure constant, wind direction and speed, and these were verified against reanalysis data from ERA-Interim. Spatial-temporal evolution and statistical characteristics of temperature, and relative humidity and horizontal wind during haze events, were then analyzed. Finally, the relationships between the BLH and AQI (air quality index) and PM(2.5 )during the haze events were analyzed. The results indicate that the average BLHs during haze events at Xianyang Airport were generally lower than 1000 m. Moreover, the average BLHs in December and January were distributed in the range of 200-600 m, and lower than that in June and July, in a range of 500-1100 m. Furthermore, the maximum value of the average BLH appears at 13:00-15:00. When the temperature was low in the morning, the stratification difference was small and the sensible heat flux between ground and air was still weak, leading to a low BLH value. Meanwhile, when the air quality was poor, the relative humidity was relatively large, and the corresponding AQI and PM(2.5 )were very large. Subsequently, when the temperature gradually increased with time, the heat flux and the average BLH also gradually increased. Moreover, the relative humidity within the BL decreased, and the corresponding AQI and PM2.5  also gradually decreased, with the corresponding air quality improving accordingly. The results obtained herein provide a key reference for the preparedness of haze events.

TI  - VIIRS Edition 1 Cloud Properties for CERES, Part 1: Algorithm Adjustments and Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud properties are essential for the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Project, enabling accurate interpretation of measured broadband radiances, providing a means to understand global cloud-radiation interactions, and constituting an important climate record. Producing consistent cloud retrievals across multiple platforms is critical for generating a multidecadal cloud and radiation record. Techniques used by CERES for retrievals from measurements by the MODerate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua platforms are adapted for the application to radiances from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership to continue the CERES record beyond the MODIS era. The algorithm adjustments account for spectral and channel differences, use revised reflectance models, and set new thresholds for detecting thin cirrus clouds at night. Cloud amounts from VIIRS are less than their MODIS counterparts by 0.016 during the day and 0.026 at night, but trend consistently over the 2012-2020 period. The VIIRS mean liquid water cloud fraction differs by similar to 0.01 from the MODIS amount. The average cloud heights from VIIRS differ from the MODIS heights by less than 0.2 km, except the VIIRS daytime ice cloud heights, which are 0.4 km higher. The mean VIIRS nonpolar optical depths are 17% (1%) larger (smaller) than those from MODIS for liquid (ice) clouds. The VIIRS cloud hydrometeor sizes are generally smaller than their MODIS counterparts. Discrepancies between the MODIS and VIIRS properties stem from spectral and spatial resolution differences, new tests at night, calibration inconsistencies, and new reflectance models. Many of those differences will be addressed in future editions.

TI  - Monitoring Spatiotemporal Vegetation Response to Drought Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental factors such as drought significantly influence vegetation growth, coverage, and ecosystem functions. Hence, monitoring the spatiotemporal vegetation responses to drought in a high temporal and adequate spatial resolution is essential, mainly at the local scale. This study was conducted to investigate the aspatial and spatial relationships between vegetation growth status and drought in the southeastern South Dakota, USA. For this purpose, Landsat 8 OLI images from the months of April through September for the years 2016-2021, with cloud cover of less than 10%, were acquired. After that, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction were performed on all of the images. Some spectral indices were calculated using the Band Math toolbox in ENVI 5.3 (Environment for Visualizing Images v. 5.3). In the present study, the extracted spectral indices from Landsat 8 OLI images were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI). The results showed that the NDVI values for the month of July in different years were at maximum value at mostly pixels. Based on the statistical criteria, the best regression models for explaining the relationship between NDVI and NMDISoil were polynomial order 2 for 2016 to 2019 and linear for 2021. The developed regression models accounted for 96.7, 95.7, 96.2, 88.4, and 32.2% of vegetation changes for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021, respectively. However, there was no defined trend between NDVI and NMDISoil observed in 2020. In addition, pixel-by-pixel analyses showed that drought significantly impacted vegetation coverage, and 69.6% of the pixels were negatively correlated with the NDVI. It was concluded that the Landsat satellite images have potential information for studying the relationships between vegetation growth status and drought, which is the primary step in site-specific management.

TI  - Population fluctuation of the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera:Tephritidae) in the Tarom Sofla region, Iran
T2  - Journal of Entomological Society of Iran
M3  - Article
AB  - Olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), is one of the most important and main pests that attack olives all around the world, especially in Mediterranean countries. This research was done to study some biological characteristics of the pest in two years. This pest has three to five generations in the Tarom sofla area of Qazvin province. Results showed that fly overwinters as adult mainly but rarely as pupa beneath the plant debris and surface soil layer of the olive orchards. The olive fruit fly Attacks the fruits as the weather warms up and after a period of reproductive diapause, in late spring and early summer, at the same time as the olive core hardens (Pit hardening). Climatic changes and olive tree phenology and access to olive fruit were constant and fully correlated with olive fruit fly activity. Based on these results, the first generation, because of the favorable conditions and the product of in the first year, happened generally in July, the second generation has continued between August and September, the third generation between September and October, the fourth generation in October and November, and the fifth generation or the wintering generation in November and December. But in the second year, due to the low yield and weather conditions, the first generation was generally observed in August, the second generation in September, the third generation between September and October, and the fourth generation (wintering generation) in October and November, and another fruit was not observed in December. Due to the long oviposition period, the olive fy has overlapping generations. The density of the olive fly population in the third and fourth generation is more than the first and second generation. In the early generations, the sex ratio is in favor of males, but in the last generation, it changes to 1:1.

TI  - Quantitative Estimation of Rainfall from Remote Sensing Data Using Machine Learning Regression Models
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To estimate rainfall from remote sensing data, three machine learning-based regression models, K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (K-NNR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR), were implemented using MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) satellite data. Daytime and nighttime data from a rain gauge are used for model training and validation. To optimize the results, the outputs of the three models are combined using the weighted average. The combination of the three models (hereafter called Com-RSK) markedly improved the predictions. Indeed, the MAE, MBE, RMSE and correlation coefficient went from 23.6 mm, 10.0 mm, 40.6 mm and 89% for the SVR to 20.7 mm, 5.5 mm, 37.4 mm, and 94% when the models were combined, respectively. The Com-RSK is also compared to a few methods using the classification in the estimation, such as the ECST Enhanced Convective Stratiform Technique (ECST), the MMultic technique, and the Convective/Stratiform Rain Area Delineation Technique (CS-RADT). The Com-RSK show superior performance compared to ECST, MMultic and CS-RADT methods.The Com-RSK is also compared to the two products of satellite estimates, namely CMORPH and CHIRPS. The results indicate that Com-RSK performs better than CMORPH and CHIRPS according to MBE, RMSE and CC (coefficient correlation). A comparison with three types of satellite precipitation estimation products, such as global product, regional product, and near real-time product, is performed. Overall, the methodology developed here shows almost the same results as regional product methods and exhibits better results than near real-time and global product methods.

TI  - Integration of geospatial technologies with RUSLE model for analysis of soil erosion in response to land use/land cover dynamics: a case of Jere watershed, Western Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of land use/land cover (LU/LC) change on soil resources is getting the attention of scholars around the world. This study is attempted to analyze the impacts of LU/LC changes on soil erosion over the study period 1991 to 2019 at Jere watershed in Ethiopia. Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, and Landsat OLI/TIRS images of 1991, 2003, and 2019 were acquired and processed using supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm. Beside Landsat images, rainfall, digital soil map, and a digital elevation model were utilized in the present study. The LU/LC types and their trend were examined based on the three periods. The average soil loss rate for the Jere watershed was 35 t/ha/yr in 1991, 46.5 t/ha/yr in 2003, and 61.8 t/ha/yr in 2019. The results show that about 1727.7 ha (22.7%), 2324.1 ha (30.5%), and 2917.3 ha (38.3%) were classified under very severe erosion classes in the year 1991, 2003, and 2019, respectively. The steep slope areas with crop land experienced a considerable soil loss, with increasing mean soil loss from 55.7 t/ha/yr in 1991 to 62.4 t/ha/yr in 2003 and 76.5 t/ha/yr in 2019. To mitigate the current soil loss, the government and other actors will contribute on soil and water conservation strategies. Moreover, community awareness creation on the negative effect of LU/LC change on soil loss and agricultural productivity may be provided.

TI  - Expansion of <i>Eucalyptus</i> Plantation on Fertile Cultivated Lands in the North-Western Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Converting fertile, cultivated land into Eucalyptus plantations has become a common practice in Ethiopia. Integrating geospatial techniques with socio-economic data analysis can be a useful method to evaluate the expansion of Eucalyptus and its underlying factors. The objective of this study is to detect the spatio-temporal patterns and main factors contributing to Eucalyptus expansion in the Mecha district of Ethiopia. To quantify the spatial extents of Eucalyptus plantations, the study employed Landsat images from 1991 to 2021 with supervised image classification in ERDAS Imagine 2015. In addition, 120 households were chosen using random sampling technique to incorporate socioeconomic factors related to Eucalyptus expansion. The result shows that, Eucalyptus plantations expanded significantly across the study area during the last three decades. Eucalyptus plantation covered 908.87 ha, 3719.05 ha, and 26261.9 ha in 1991, 2006, and 2021, respectively. The increment was mostly at the expense of fertile cultivated land use. The main reasons for its expansion are linked with farmer's expectations of a better source of income, apprehension about the detrimental effects on nearby cropland, and its affordable production cost. In conclusion, the study area faces challenges from the uncontrolled expansion of Eucalyptus plantations on productive lands. Therefore, careful management and intervention strategies should be established to manage its rapid expansion.

TI  - Clinical Decision Support for Axillary Lymph Node Staging in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients Based on 18F-FDG PET/MRI and Machine Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to its high prognostic value, the involvement of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients also plays an important role in therapy planning. Therefore, an imaging modality that can determine nodal status with high accuracy in patients with primary breast cancer is desirable. Our purpose was to investigate whether, in newly diag-nosed breast cancer patients, machine-learning prediction models based on simple assessable imaging features on MRI or PET/MRI are able to determine nodal status with performance comparable to that of experienced radiologists; whether such models can be adjusted to achieve low rates of false-negatives such that invasive procedures might potentially be omitted; and whether a clinical framework for decision support based on simple imaging features can be derived from these models. Methods: Between August 2017 and September 2020, 303 participants from 3 centers prospectively underwent dedi-cated whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI. Imaging datasets were evalu-ated for axillary lymph node metastases based on morphologic and metabolic features. Predictive models were developed for MRI and PET/MRI separately using random forest classifiers on data from 2 centers and were tested on data from the third center. Results: The diagnostic accuracy for MRI features was 87.5% both for radiologists and for the machine-learning algorithm. For PET/MRI, the diagnostic accuracy was 89.3% for the radiologists and 91.2% for the machine -learning algorithm, with no significant differences in diagnostic perfor-mance between radiologists and the machine-learning algorithm for MRI (P = 0.671) or PET/MRI (P = 0.683). The most important lymph node feature was tracer uptake, followed by lymph node size. With an adjusted threshold, a sensitivity of 96.2% was achieved by the ran-dom forest classifier, whereas specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 68.2%, 78.1%, 93.8%, and 83.3%, respectively. A decision tree based on 3 simple imaging features could be established for MRI and PET/MRI. Conclusion: Applying a high-sensitivity threshold to the random forest results might potentially avoid invasive procedures such as sentinel lymph node biopsy in 68.2% of the patients.

TI  - Urbanization Trends Analysis Using Hybrid Modeling of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process-Cellular Automata-Markov Chain and Investigating Its Impact on Land Surface Temperature over Gharbia City, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quick population increase and the desire for urbanization are the main drivers for accelerating urban expansion on agricultural lands in Egypt. This issue is obvious in governorates with no desert backyards. This study aims to (1) explore the trend of Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) through the period of 1991-2018; (2) upgrade the reliability of predicting LULCC by integrating the Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov chain and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP); and (3) perform analysis of urbanization risk on LST trends over the Gharbia governorate for the decision makers to implement effective strategies for sustainable land use. Multi-temporal Landsat images were used to monitor LULCC dynamics from 1991 to 2018 and then simulate LULCC in 2033 and 2048. Two comparable models were adopted for the simulation of spatiotemporal dynamics of land use in the study area: CA-Markov chain and FAHP-CA-Markov chain hybrid models. The second model upgrades the potential of the CA-Markov chain for prediction by its integration with FAHP, which can determine the locations of high potential to be urbanized. The outcomes stated a significant LULCC in Gharbia during the study period-specifically, urban sprawl on agricultural land, and this trend is predicted to carry on. The agricultural sector represented 91.2% in 1991 and reduced to 83.7% in 2018. The built-up area is almost doubled by 2048 with respect to 2018. The regression analysis revealed the LST increase due to urbanization, causing an urban heat island phenomenon. Criteria-based analysis reveals the district's vulnerability to rapid urbanization, which is efficient for data-gap zones. The simulation results make sense since the FAHP-CA-Markov simulated the LULCC in a thoughtful way, considering the driving forces of LULCC, while the CA-Markov chain results were relatively random. Therefore, the FAHP-CA-Markov chain is the pioneer to be relied upon for future projection. The findings of this work provide a better understanding of LULCC trends over the years supporting decision makers toward sustainable land use. Thus, further urbanization should be planned to avert the loss of agricultural land and uninterrupted increasing temperatures.

TI  - Comparison of Radiosonde Measurements of Meteorological Variables with Drone, Satellite Products, and WRF Simulations in the Tropical Andes: The Case of Quito, Ecuador
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiosondes are the most widely used method for studies of vertical atmospheric behavior, but the high costs associated, and the logistic limitations have forced researchers to look for alternative methods for atmospheric profiling, such as lidar and satellite measurements, or modeling. However, the assessment of the accuracy of alternative methods is recommended, especially in complex terrain, such as the tropical Andes. In this research, the atmospheric profiling of satellite data from AIRS and MODIS products, simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting model, WRF, and drone measurements are evaluated for a campaign of 10 radio soundings, between August 2021 and January 2022. Additionally, the capability to capture the planetary boundary layer height, hPBL, is studied. The measurements were conducted at Izobamba station near Quito, Ecuador. Temperature, T, Dew Point Temperature, TD, Mixing Ratio, Q, and Potential Temperature, PT, were evaluated from 0 to 300 m above ground level (magl.) for satellite, WRF, and drone data, and from 0 km to 15 km for satellite and WRF data. Additionally, the capability to capture the planetary boundary layer height, HPBL, was assessed. The results show that drone profiles best represented the magnitude of the analyzed variables showing mean RMSE of 0.79 for T, but the noise of the measurements caused a low correlation with radio sounding profiles, which was partially corrected with a quadratic fit on the profile. The WRF results achieved a positive representation in terms of correlation, but error metrics show that there are remarkable differences in magnitude in the first 300 magl., up to the tropopause height, which surpasses satellite representations for all variables. The MODIS profiles do not generally perform well due to their low vertical resolution and limitations with cloud coverage. However, AIRS data, despite its low resolution, show a better representation of vertical profiles than MODIS, for T and TD, surpassing WRF simulations in some dates. For the HPBL, the WRF results show that physical and atmospheric conditions limit its determination, and the methods and conditioning factors should be further analyzed.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling and Gap-Filling of SMAP Soil Moisture to High Resolution Using MODIS Surface Variables and Machine Learning Approaches over ShanDian River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution soil moisture (SM) information is essential for regional to global hydrological and agricultural applications. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) offers daily global composites of SM at coarse-resolution 9 and 36 km, with data gaps limiting its local application to depict SM distribution in detail. To overcome the aforementioned problem, a downscaling and gap-filling novel approach was adopted, using random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to downscale SMAP SM data, using land-surface variables from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and Terra satellites from the years 2018 to 2019. Firstly, four combinations (RF+Aqua, RF+Terra, ANN+Aqua, and ANN+Terra) were developed. Each combination downscaled SMAP SM at a high resolution (1 km). These combinations were evaluated by using error matrices and in situ SM at different scales in the ShanDian River (SDR) Basin. The combination RF+Terra showed a better performance, with a low averaged unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.034 m3/m3 and high averaged correlation (R) of 0.54 against the small-, medium-, and large-scale in situ SM. Secondly, the impact of various land covers was examined by using downscaled SMAP and in situ SM. Vegetation attenuation makes woodland more error-prone and less correlated than grassland and farmland. Finally, the RF+Terra and ANN+Terra combinations were selected for their higher accuracy in gap filling of downscaled SMAP SM. The gap-filled downscaled SMAP SM results were compared spatially with China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) SM and in situ SM. The RF+Terra combination outcomes were more humid than ANN+Terra combination results in the SDR basin. Overall, the RF+Terra combination gap-filled data showed high R (0.40) and less ubRMSE (0.064 m(3)/m(3)) against in situ SM, which was close to CLDAS SM. This study showed that the proposed RF- and ANN-based downscaling methods have a potential to improve the spatial resolution and gap-filling of SMAP SM at a high resolution (1 km).

AB  - Forest fires are caused naturally by lightning, high atmospheric temperatures, and dryness. Forest fires have ramifications for both climatic conditions and anthropogenic ecosystems. According to various research studies, there has been a noticeable increase in the frequency of forest fires in India. Between 1 January and 31 March 2022, the country had 136,604 fire points. They activated an alerting system that indicates the location of a forest fire detected using MODIS sensor data from NASA Aqua and Terra satellite images. However, the satellite passes the country only twice and sends the information to the state forest departments. The early detection of forest fires is crucial, as once they reach a certain level, it is hard to control them. Compared with the satellite monitoring and detection of fire incidents, video-based fire detection on the ground identifies the fire at a faster rate. Hence, an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a GPS and a high-resolution camera can acquire quality images referencing the fire location. Further, deep learning frameworks can be applied to efficiently classify forest fires. In this paper, a cheaper UAV with extended MobileNet deep learning capability is proposed to classify forest fires (97.26%) and share the detection of forest fires and the GPS location with the state forest departments for timely action.

TI  - Monitoring invasive pines using remote sensing: a case study from Sri Lanka
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Production plantation forestry has many economic benefits but can also have negative environmental impacts such as the spreading of invasive pines to native forest habitats. Monitoring forest for the presence of invasive pines helps with the management of this issue. However, detection of vegetation change over a large time period is difficult due to changes in image quality and sensor types, and by the spectral similarity of evergreen species and frequent cloud cover in the study area. The costs of high-resolution images are also prohibitive for routine monitoring in resource-constrained countries. This research investigated the use of remote sensing to identify the spread of Pinus caribaea over a 21-year period (2000 to 2021) in Belihuloya, Sri Lanka, using Landsat images. It applied a range of techniques to produce cloud free images, extract vegetation features, and improve vegetation classification accuracy, followed by the use of Geographical Information System to spatially analyze the spread of invasive pines. The results showed most invading pines were found within 100 m of the pine plantations' borders where broadleaved forests and grasslands are vulnerable to invasion. However, the extent of invasive pine had an overall decline of 4 ha over the 21 years. The study confirmed that remote sensing combined with spatial analysis are effective tools for monitoring invasive pines in countries with limited resources. This study also provides information to conservationists and forest managers to conduct strategic planning for sustainable forest management and conservation in Sri Lanka.

TI  - GOCE Downward Continuation to the Earth's Surface and Improvements to Local Geoid Modeling by FFT and LSC
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main applications of the gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite data is their combination with local gravity anomalies for geoid and gravity field modeling purposes. The aim of the present paper was the determination of an improved geoid model for the wider Hellenic area, using original GOCE SGG data filtered to retain only useful signals inside the measurement bandwidth (MBW) of the satellite. The filtered SGGs, originally at the satellite altitude, were projected to a mean orbit (MO) and then downward continued to the Earth's surface (ES) in order to be combined with local gravity anomalies. For the projection to an MO, grids of disturbing gravity gradients from a global geopotential model (GGM) were used, computed per 1 km from the maximum satellite altitude to that of the MO. The downward continuation process was then undertaken using an iterative Monte Carlo (MC) simulated annealing method with GGM gravity anomalies on the ES used as ground truth data. The final geoid model over the wider Hellenic area was estimated, employing the remove-compute-restore method and both Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Least Squares Collocation (LSC). Gravity-only, GOCE-only and combined models using local gravity and GOCE data were determined and evaluation of the results was carried out against available GNSS/levelling data in the study area. From the results achieved, it was concluded that even when FFT is used, so that a combined grid of local gravity and GOCE data is used, improvements to the differences regarding GNSS/levelling data by 14.53% to 27.78% can be achieved. The geoid determination with LSC was focused on three different areas over Greece, with different characteristics in the topography and gravity variability. From these results, improvements from 14.73%, for the well-surveyed local data of Thessaly, to 32.88%, over the mountainous area of Pindos, and 57.10% for the island of Crete for 57.10% were found.

TI  - Tropical Forest Top Height by GEDI: From Sparse Coverage to Continuous Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating consistent large-scale tropical forest height using remote sensing is essential for understanding forest-related carbon cycles. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) instrument employed on the International Space Station has collected unique vegetation structure data since April 2019. Our study shows the potential value of using remote-sensing (RS) data (i.e., optical Sentinel-2, radar Sentinel-1, and radar PALSAR-2) to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height model (CHM) measurements. We show that selected RS features can estimate vegetation heights with high precision by analyzing RS data, spaceborne GEDI LiDAR, and airborne LiDAR at four tropical forest sites in South America and Africa. We found that the GEDI relative height (RH) metric is the best at 98% (RH98), filtered by full-power shots with a sensitivity greater than 98%. We found that the optical Sentinel-2 indices are dominant with respect to radar from 77 possible features. We proposed the nine essential optical Sentinel-2 and the radar cross-polarization HV PALSAR-2 features in CHM estimation. Using only ten optimal indices for the regression problems can avoid unimportant features and reduce the computational effort. The predicted CHM was compared to the available airborne LiDAR data, resulting in an error of around 5 m. Finally, we tested cross-validation error values between South America and Africa, including around 40% from validation data in training to obtain a similar performance. We recommend that GEDI data be extracted from all continents to maintain consistent performance on a global scale. Combining GEDI and RS data is a promising method to advance our capability in mapping CHM values.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI Data for Flood Mapping and Damage Assessment in Mozambique
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most frequent natural disasters worldwide. Although the vulnerability varies from region to region, all countries are susceptible to flooding. Mozambique was hit by several cyclones in the last few decades, and in 2019, after cyclones Idai and Kenneth, the country became the first one in southern Africa to be hit by two cyclones in the same raining season. Aiming to provide the local authorities with tools to yield better responses before and after any disaster event, and to mitigate the impact and support in decision making for sustainable development, it is fundamental to continue investigating reliable methods for disaster management. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method for flood mapping in near real-time utilizing multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired in the Beira municipality and Macomia district. The procedure exploits the processing capability of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We map flooded areas by finding the differences of images acquired before and after the flooding and then use Otsu's thresholding method to automatically extract the flooded area from the difference image. To validate and compute the accuracy of the proposed technique, we compare our results with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Copernicus EMS) data available in the study areas. Furthermore, we investigated the use of a Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) to produce a land cover (LC) map of the study area and estimate the percentage of flooded areas in each LC class. The results show that the combination of Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI data is reliable for near real-time flood mapping and damage assessment. We automatically mapped flooded areas with an overall accuracy of about 87-88% and kappa of 0.73-0.75 by directly comparing our prediction and Copernicus EMS maps. The LC classification is validated by randomly collecting over 600 points for each LC, and the overall accuracy is 90-95% with a kappa of 0.80-0.94.

TI  - Land Cover Changes of the Qilian Mountain National Park in Northwest China Based on Phenological Features and Sample Migration from 1990 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variation analysis of land cover classification is important for studying the distribution and transformation of regional land cover changes. The Qilian Mountain National Park (QMNP), an important ecological barrier in northwestern China, has lacked land cover products for long time series. The Landsat images available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) make it possible to analyze the land cover changes over the past three decades. The purpose of this study was to generate a long time series of datasets of land cover classification based on the method of sample migration in the QMNP in Northwest China. The Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images and field sample data were combined with multiple image features and the random forest algorithm to complete the land cover classification of the QMNP from 1990 to 2020. The results indicate that (1) the method of Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance can reduce image feature redundancy and show that elevation and phenological features have good differentiability among land cover types that were easy to mix with feature classes; (2) the spatial distribution of land cover every 10 years between 1990 and 2020 was consistent in the QMNP, and there were obvious differences in land cover from the east to the west part of the QMNP, with a large area of vegetation distribution in Sunan county in the central part and Tianzhu county in the east part of the QMNP; (3) over the past 30 years, forests and grasslands decreased by 62.2 km(2) and 794.7 km(2), respectively, while shrubs increased by 442.9 km(2) in the QMNP. The conversion of bare land to grassland and the interconversion between different vegetation types were the main patterns of land cover changes, and the land cover changes were mainly concentrated in pastoral areas, meaning that human activity was the main factor of land cover changes; and (4) when the samples of 2020 were migrated to 2010, 2000, and 1990, the overall classification accuracies were 89.7%, 88.0%, 86.0%, and 83.9%, respectively. The results show that the vegetation conservation process in the QMNP was closely related to human activities.

TI  - Single Remote Sensing Image Dehazing Using Robust Light-Dark Prior
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze, generated by floaters (semitransparent clouds, fog, snow, etc.) in the atmosphere, can significantly degrade the utilization of remote sensing images (RSIs). However, the existing techniques for single image dehazing rarely consider that the haze is superimposed by floaters and shadow, and they often aggravate the degree of the haze shadow and dark region. In this paper, a single RSI dehazing method based on robust light-dark prior (RLDP) is proposed, which utilizes the proposed hybrid model and is robust to outlier pixels. In the proposed RLDP method, the haze is first removed by a robust dark channel prior (RDCP). Then, the shadow is removed with a robust light channel prior (RLCP). Further, a cube root mean enhancement (CRME)-based stable state search criterion is proposed for solving the difficult problem of patch size setting. The experiment results on benchmark and Landsat 8 RSIs demonstrate that the RLDP method could effectively remove haze.

TI  - In Pursuit of Local Solutions for Climate Resilience: Sensing Microspatial Inequities in Heat and Air Pollution within Urban Neighborhoods in Boston, MA
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental hazards vary locally and even street to street resulting in microspatial inequities, necessitating climate resilience solutions that respond to specific hyperlocal conditions. This study uses remote sensing data to estimate two environmental hazards that are particularly relevant to community health: land surface temperature (LST; from LandSat) and air pollution (AP; from motor vehicle volume via cell phone records). These data are analyzed in conjunction with land use records in Boston, MA to test (1) the extent to which each hazard concentrates on specific streets within neighborhoods, (2) the infrastructural elements that drive variation in the hazards, and (3) how strongly hazards overlap in space. Though these data rely on proxies, they provide preliminary evidence. Substantial variations in LST and AP existed between streets in the same neighborhood (40% and 70-80% of variance, respectively). The former were driven by canopy, impervious surfaces, and albedo. The latter were associated with main streets and zoning with tall buildings. The correlation between LST and AP was moderate across census tracts (r = 0.4) but modest across streets within census tracts (r = 0.16). The combination of results confirms not only the presence of microspatial inequities for both hazards but also their limited coincidence, indicating that some streets suffer from both hazards, some from neither, and others from only one. There is a need for more precise, temporally-dynamic data tracking environmental hazards (e.g., from environmental sensor networks) and strategies for translating them into community-based solutions.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Emulation of Radiative Transfer Models for Top-of-Atmosphere BRDF Modelling Using Sentinel-3 OLCI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) defines the anisotropy of surface reflectance and plays a fundamental role in many remote sensing applications. This study proposes a new machine learning-based model for characterizing the BRDF. The model integrates the capability of Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) to generate simulated remote sensing data with the power of deep neural networks to emulate, learn and approximate the complex pattern of physical RTMs for BRDF modeling. To implement this idea, we used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) trained with a dataset simulated using two widely used RTMs: PROSAIL and 6S. The proposed 1D-CNN consists of convolutional, max poling, and dropout layers that collaborate to establish a more efficient relationship between the input and output variables from the coupled PROSAIL and 6S yielding a robust, fast, and accurate BRDF model. We evaluated the proposed approach performance using a collection of an independent testing dataset. The results indicated that the proposed framework for BRDF modeling performed well at four simulated Sentinel-3 OLCI bands, including Oa04 (blue), Oa06 (green), Oa08 (red), and Oa17 (NIR), with a mean correlation coefficient of around 0.97, and RMSE around 0.003 and an average relative percentage error of under 4%. Furthermore, to assess the performance of the developed network in the real domain, a collection of multi-temporals OLCI real data was used. The results indicated that the proposed framework has a good performance in the real domain with a coefficient correlation (R-2), 0.88, 0.76, 0.7527, and 0.7560 respectively for the blue, green, red, and NIR bands.

TI  - High-Resolution Lidar-Derived DEM for Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Using AHP and Fuzzy Logic in Serdang, Malaysia
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide impact is potentially hazardous to an urban environment. Landslides occur at certain slope levels over time and require practical slope analysis to assess the nature of the slope where a landslide is likely to occur. Thus, acquiring very high-resolution remote sensing data plays a significant role in determining the slope surface. For this study, 12 landslide conditioning parameters with 10 x 10 cell sizes that have never been previously collectively applied were created. These factors were created directly from the LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) DEM (digital elevation model)using their layer toolboxes, which include slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, and hill shade. Stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), and terrain roughness index (TRI) were created from spatial layers such as slope, flow direction, and flow accumulation. Shapefiles of distances to roads, lakes, trees, and build-up were digitized as land use/cover from the LiDAR image and produced using the Euclidean distance method in ArcGIS. The parameters were selected based on expert knowledge, previous landslide literature, and the study area characteristics. Moreover, multicriteria decision-making analysis, which includes the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy logic approaches not previously utilized with a LiDAR DEM, was used in this study to predict the possibility of a landslide. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used for the validation of results. The area under the curve (AUC) values obtained from the ROC method for the AHP and fuzzy were 0.859 and 0.802, respectively. The final susceptibility results will be helpful to urban developers in Malaysia and for sustainable landslide hazard mitigation.

TI  - Building Trust in Earth Science Findings through Data Traceability and Results Explainability
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - To trust findings in computational science, scientists need workflows that trace the data provenance and support results explainability. As workflows become more complex, tracing data provenance and explaining results become harder to achieve. In this paper, we propose a computational environment that automatically creates a workflow execution's record trail and invisibly attaches it to the workflow's output, enabling data traceability and results explainability. Our solution transforms existing container technology, includes tools for automatically annotating provenance metadata, and allows effective movement of data and metadata across the workflow execution. We demonstrate the capabilities of our environment with the study of SOMOSPIE, an earth science workflow. Through a suite of machine learning modeling techniques, this workflow predicts soil moisture values from the 27 km resolution satellite data down to higher resolutions necessary for policy making and precision agriculture. By running the workflow in our environment, we can identify the causes of different accuracy measurements for predicted soil moisture values in different resolutions of the input data and link different results to different machine learning methods used during the soil moisture downscaling, all without requiring scientists to know aspects of workflow design and implementation.

TI  - Recognition of whole-landscape changes due to extreme rain events in a hyperarid desert
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrequent extreme rain events in extraordinarily dry environments can dramatically shape the landscape. Here, a change-detection method is demonstrated that uses Landsat 8 OLI scenes to document land surface modification across thousands of square kilometers due to two extreme rain events which impacted the Atacama Desert. Images for 4 dates, in 3 date-pairs, are analyzed using a Change Vector Analysis (CVA) technique which delivers a measure of the intensity of change (Intensity-CVA). In 2015, an extreme rain event affected the southern Atacama and one in 2019 affected the northern Atacama. In this work, we show with the 2015 event the efficacy of CVA to identify areas of mass transference by favorable comparison to published Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) permanent coherence loss for areas located in nearly flat ter-rains. The efficacy of Intensity-CVA was also demonstrated for the 2019 rain event, where it iden-tified mass transference and mineral transformations. To clarify the physical processes behind the Intensity-CVA response, for specific areas with known types of surface materials we conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on quadratic difference of Surface Reflection (SR) values of Landsat 8 OLI scenes for multiple dates and also analyzed Intensity-CVA trends. These two analy-ses reveal that, among locations with strong Intensity-CVA change, remotely identified changes are dominated by soil moisture variations associated with active alluvial deposits, playa lakes and evaporitic units verified by PCA even 60 Km away from the focus of the rain. Secondarily we de-tected salt crystals growth several months after the rain. This approach, validated in the Atacama, successfully identified the consequences of extreme rain events at the scale of the entire land-scape. This result opens the possibility to use a long-lived sensor, such as Landsat, to examine ge-omorphological surface changes through time in arid environments in a context of climate change.

TI  - MINDED-FBA: An Automatic Remote Sensing Tool for the Estimation of Flooded and Burned Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the MINDED-FBA, a remote-sensing-based tool for the determination of both flooded and burned areas. The tool, freely distributed as a QGIS plugin, consists of an adaptation and development of the previously published Multi Index Image Differencing methods (MINDED and MINDED-BA). The MINDED-FBA allows the integration and combination of a wider diversity of satellite sensor datasets, now including the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), in addition to optical multispectral data. The performance of the tool is evaluated for six case studies located in Portugal, Australia, Pakistan, Italy, and the USA. The case studies were chosen for representing a wide range of conditions, such as type of hazardous event (i.e., flooding or fire), scale of application (i.e., local or regional), site specificities (e.g., climatic conditions, morphology), and available satellite data (optical multispectral and SAR). The results are compared in respect to reference delineation datasets (mostly from the Copernicus EMS). The application of the MINDED-FBA tool with SAR data is particularly effective to delineate flooding, while optical multispectral data resulted in the best performances for burned areas. Nonetheless, the combination of both types of remote sensing data (data fusion approach) also provides high correlations with the available reference datasets. The MINDED-FBA tool could represent a new near-real-time solution, capable of supporting emergency response measures.

TI  - Sentinel Surveillance System Implementation and Evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Data, Washington, USA, 2020-2021
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Genomic data provides useful information for public health practice, particularly when combined with epide-miologic data. However, sampling bias is a concern be-cause inferences from nonrandom data can be mislead-ing. In March 2021, the Washington State Department of Health, USA, partnered with submitting and sequencing laboratories to establish sentinel surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. We analyzed available genomic and epidemiologic data during presentinel and sentinel periods to assess representativeness and timeliness of availability. Genomic data during the presentinel period was largely unrepresentative of all COVID-19 cases. Data available during the sentinel period improved rep-resentativeness for age, death from COVID-19, outbreak association, long-term care facility-affiliated status, and geographic coverage; timeliness of data availability and captured viral diversity also improved. Hospitalized cas-es were underrepresented, indicating a need to increase inpatient sampling. Our analysis emphasizes the need to understand and quantify sampling bias in phyloge-netic studies and continue evaluation and improvement of public health surveillance systems.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater occurrence in a typical schist belt region in Osun State, Southwestern Nigeria using VES, aeromagnetic dataset, remotely sensed data, and MCDA approaches
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents modelling of groundwater potential in a typical schist belt region in Osun State, Southwestern Nigeria using electrical resistivity, aeromagnetic, remotely sensed data, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Lineaments extracted from filtered and enhanced Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery and aeromagnetic data were superimposed to generate lineament intersection, which was subjected to line density in the ArcGIS 10.5 environment to produce lineament intersection density. Eighty (80) vertical electrical soundings (VES) using Schlumberger configuration were acquired within the study location. The geoelectric parameters from the VES interpretation were used to determine the second-order parameters. Integration of electrical resistivity, aeromagnetic dataset, and remotely sensed data was subjected to multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to model the groundwater potential of the investigated area. Four distinct groundwater potential zones, very low, low, moderate and high zones, were identified. Boreholes and static water level data across the study area were used to validate the accuracy of the groundwater potential map. The prediction accuracy obtained showed that the techniques used in this study are capable of producing reliable and accurate results.

TI  - Experimental and numerical analyses of airflow around two cylinders angled to the direction of wind
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES-TECHNICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The analyses aim to determine aerodynamic force coefficients in the case of airflow around two smooth or rough cylinders positioned at different angles to the direction of wind velocity. Such systems, for instance, may be part of a tubular water slide. The results were compared with the values of the interference coefficient of the cylinders arranged in a row included in Eurocode EN 1991 part 4. The aerodynamic forces of the cylinder systems were determined on the basis of experimental tests conducted in a wind tunnel. To verify the above results, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations were prepared. An important observation is that for the angle of yaw beta = 0 degrees, the negative component of the lift force (lateral) fy is shown, while for the other cases, the situation is opposite and the lateral force points outside the gap (upward). The second is that the results of aerodynamic drag for rough cylinders arranged in a row and calculated according to EN 1991 part 4 may be underestimated. The flow around the pair of smooth cylinders is quite different from that of the rough ones, because during the experiment the first falls into the critical flow regime, while the second has supercritical characteristics.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel Images to Evaluate Physicochemical Parameters Concentrations in Water Bodies-Application in a Wetlands System in Northern Colombia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This research demonstrated the feasibility of applying Sentinel-2 images to generate empirical models and estimate physicochemical parameters concentration, particularly nutrients in the wetland system called Bajo Sinu wetlands complex, Colombia. Spearman correlations were determined between water quality parameters, which were monitored at 17 points in the wetland on 5 February 2021, with Sentinel-2 images reflectance values from the same monitoring date; the correlations allowed the identification of statistically significant bands in the multiple linear regression algorithm implementation to determine empirical water quality models. The results show significant correlations between the optically active parameters, TSS-Turbidity, which in turn correlated with the optically inactive parameters Turbidity-NO3 and TSS-DO, as well as non-optically active parameters among themselves, TDS-NO3 and TDS-TP; the empirical models presented higher than 74.5% fit (R-2), particularly DO (R-2 = 0.948), NO3 (R-2 = 0.858) and TP (R-2 = 0.779) were the models with the highest fits (R-2). These models allowed us to properly estimate the spatial distribution of nutrient-forming compounds in the wetlands complex. The determinant role played by turbidity in this type of water body is highlighted; it acts as a connecting constituent that makes the estimation of water quality parameters without spectral response through remote sensing feasible. Sentinel-2 images and multiple linear regression algorithms have been shown to be effective in estimating the concentration of water quality parameters without spectral response, such as NO3 and TP in shallow tropical wetlands, due to the processes of transformation, interaction and dependence between the different environmental variables in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Perspectives of human-water co-evolution of blue-green water resources in subtropical areas
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue-green water resources and their transformation play a vital role in crop production and ecosystem services regulation, and their distribution and utilization are affected by human activity, such as policy-driven green water resources development projects. However, it is unclear how policy-driven green water resources development projects, such as the Grain for Green Project (GGP) in China, affect eco-environmental quality and socio-economic development, that is, human-water co-evolution. Therefore, considering the GGP in a subtropical ungauged basin in southern China as an example, based on remote sensing hydrological station (RSHS) technology and multisource remote sensing data, this study analyzed the impact of the GGP on human-water co-evolution from the perspective of blue-green water resources. The results show that: (1) From 2001 to 2020 the GGP transformed more blue water resources into green water resources, resulting in an increase in green water resources of 282.29% compared to that of blue water resources. (2) Due to the initial success of the GGP in 2005, there was a distinct positive correlation between the green water coefficient (GWC) and basin development index (BDI) from 2005 to 2020 (R-2 = 0.70, p < 0.05), indicating that the GGP did not cause conflict between the sustainability of socio-economic development and the health of the ecological environment. (3) In the GGP scenario, in which the cultivated land area maintained 50% of the current decreasing rate, the overall efficiency index maintain a continuously increasing trend at an average rate of 0.001 year(-1) from 2021 to 2050, which not only improved the eco-environmental quality but also met cultivated land demand. This research reveals the role of GGP in promoting the transformation from blue to green water resources, and proves the feasibility of the simultaneous promotion of GGP and socio-economic development, providing significant insights for the promotion of policy-driven green water resources development projects and long-term blue-green water resources planning and management in other countries or regions.

TI  - Airborne hyperspectral and Sentinel imagery to quantify winter wheat traits through ensemble modeling approaches
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early prediction of crop production by remote sensing (RS) may help to plan the harvest and ensure food security. This study aims to improve the quantification of yield, grain protein concentration (GPC), and nitrogen (N) output in winter wheat with RS imagery. Ground-truth wheat traits were measured at flowering and harvest in a field experiment combining four N and two water levels in central Spain over 2 years. Hyperspectral and thermal airborne images coincident with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were acquired at flowering. A parametric linear model using all hyperspectral normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI) and two non-parametric models (artificial neural network and random forest) were used to assess their estimation ability combining NDSIs and other RS indicators. The feasibility of using freely available multispectral satellite was tested by applying the same methodology but using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands. Yield estimation obtained the highest R-2 value, showing that the visible and short-wave infrared region (VSWIR) had similar accuracy to the hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 imagery (R-2 approximate to 0.84). The SWIR bands were important in the GPC estimation with both sensors, whereas N output was better estimated using red-edge-based NDSIs, obtaining satisfactory results with the hyperspectral sensor (R-2 = 0.74) and with the Sentinel-2 (R-2 = 0.62). When including the Sentinel-2 SWIR index, the NDSI (B11, B3) improved the estimation of N output (R-2 = 0.71). Ensemble models based on Sentinel were found to be as reliable as those based on hyperspectral imagery, and including SWIR information improved the quantification of N-related traits.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Merging Gridded Satellite and Earth-Observed Precipitation Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Gridded satellite precipitation datasets are useful in hydrological applications as they cover large regions with high density. However, they are not accurate in the sense that they do not agree with ground-based measurements. An established means for improving their accuracy is to correct them by adopting machine learning algorithms. This correction takes the form of a regression problem, in which the ground-based measurements have the role of the dependent variable and the satellite data are the predictor variables, together with topography factors (e.g., elevation). Most studies of this kind involve a limited number of machine learning algorithms and are conducted for a small region and for a limited time period. Thus, the results obtained through them are of local importance and do not provide more general guidance and best practices. To provide results that are generalizable and to contribute to the delivery of best practices, we here compare eight state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in correcting satellite precipitation data for the entire contiguous United States and for a 15-year period. We use monthly data from the PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks) gridded dataset, together with monthly earth-observed precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network monthly database, version 2 (GHCNm). The results suggest that extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forests are the most accurate in terms of the squared error scoring function. The remaining algorithms can be ordered as follows, from the best to the worst: Bayesian regularized feed-forward neural networks, multivariate adaptive polynomial splines (poly-MARS), gradient boosting machines (gbm), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), feed-forward neural networks and linear regression.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Virtual Optical Image Generation and Its Application to Early Crop Mapping
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the potential of cloud-free virtual optical imagery generated using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images and conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) for early crop mapping, which requires cloud-free optical imagery at the optimal date for classification. A two-stage CGAN approach, including representation and generation stages, is presented to generate virtual Sentinel-2 spectral bands using all available information from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images. The dual-polarization-based radar vegetation index and all available multi-spectral bands of Sentinel-2 imagery are particularly considered for feature extraction in the representation stage. A crop classification experiment using Sentinel-1 and -2 images in Illinois, USA, demonstrated that the use of all available scattering and spectral features achieved the best prediction performance for all spectral bands, including visible, near-infrared, red-edge, and shortwave infrared bands, compared with the cases that only used dual-polarization backscattering coefficients and partial input spectral bands. Early crop mapping with an image time series, including the virtual Sentinel-2 image, yielded satisfactory classification accuracy comparable to the case of using an actual time-series image set, regardless of the different combinations of spectral bands. Therefore, the generation of virtual optical images using the proposed model can be effectively applied to early crop mapping when the availability of cloud-free optical images is limited.

TI  - Rubber expansion and age-class mapping in the state of Tripura (India) 1990-2021 using multi-year and multi-sensor data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the spread of rubber monoculture in the state of Tripura during past three decades (1990-2021) in the northeast region of India which is known for its rich biodiversity, shifting cultivation, and extensive forest dynamics. Earth observation (EO) data of seven time periods from Landsat missions (1990, 1995, 2000, 2004, and 2009) and Sentinel-2 (2016 and 2021) were the main source for mapping and were supplemented with MODIS-EVI temporal spectral profiles, GEDI-derived vegetation heights (2019), and Google Earth high-resolution historical images for additional cues to support discrimination, mapping, and accuracy assessment. The methodology for rubber used its unique phenology from spectral-temporal profile and multi-year comparison of patches and their dynamics for age-class mapping. The results indicate that in the state of Tripura (geographic area 1.08 Mha), the area under rubber increased from 0.3% in 1990 to 8.9% of the geographic area in 2021. The overall classification accuracy for the maps created for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2009, 2016, and 2021 was 84.2%, 83.9%, 84.8%, 88.0%, 86.0%, 86.7%, and 89.5%, respectively. New areas under rubber originated from various land cover classes including open forests, shifting cultivation lands, and scrub. Recent expansion has resulted in 84.3% of rubber plantations under the 10-year age class. Implications of this transformation of the natural landscape, biodiversity and biomass, and carbon pool assessment are discussed.

TI  - Vicarious CAL/VAL Approach for Orbital Hyperspectral Sensors Using Multiple Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperspectral (HSR) sensors Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) were recently launched. These state-of-the-art sensors have joined the already operational HSR sensors DESIS (DLR), PRISMA (Italian Space Agency), and HISUI (developed by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry METI and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA). The launching of more HSR sensors is being planned for the near future (e.g., SBG of NASA, and CHIME of the European Space Agency), and the challenge of monitoring and maintaining their calibration accuracy is becoming more relevant. We proposed two test sites: Amiaz Plain (AP) and Makhtesh Ramon (MR) for spectral, radiometric, and geometric calibration/validation (CAL/VAL). The sites are situated in the arid environment of southern Israel and are in the same overpass coverage. Both test sites have already demonstrated favorable results in assessing an HSR sensor's performance and were chosen to participate in the EMIT and EnMAP validation stage. We first evaluated the feasibility of using AP and MR as CAL/VAL test sites with extensive datasets and sensors, such as the multispectral sensor Landsat (Landsat5 TM and Landsat8 OLI), the airborne HSR sensor AisaFENIX 1K, and the spaceborne HSR sensors DESIS and PRISMA. Field measurements were taken over time. The suggested methodology integrates reflectance and radiometric CAL/VAL test sites into one operational protocol. The method can highlight degradation in the spectral domain early on, help maintain quantitative applications, adjust the sensor's radiometric calibration during its mission lifetime, and minimize uncertainties of calibration parameters. A PRISMA sensor case study demonstrates the complete operational protocol, i.e., performance evaluation, quality assessment, and cross-calibration between HSR sensors. These CAL/VAL sites are ready to serve as operational sites for other HSR sensors.

TI  - Satellite imagery dataset of manure application on pasture fields.
T2  - Data in brief
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Applying manure to pasture fields is a very common method of fertilization. However, rainfall can cause the manure to leach into water bodies near the field, contaminating the water and damaging the environment and the animals living in it, ultimately affecting human life. This paper presents a dataset consisting of images of 30 plots after manure application, verified by on-site investigations. This involved visiting 38 different plots, of which 8 were discarded because they were not suitable, either because of their small size, the lack of a specific manure application date, or the images being too cloudy in that period. The imagery is collected through Google Earth Engine using the satellite Sentinel-2, which offers 13 hyperspectral bands in the range of ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths including the visible spectrum. From these 13 bands, the most common hyperspectral indices in the literature for precision agriculture are calculated and added into the images as channels. 51 hyperspectral indices are calculated, summing up to a total of 64 channels per image when adding the raw bands from Sentinel-2. No normalization has been performed on any of the channels. The data can be used for further research of automatic classification of manure application to control its use and prevent contamination.

TI  - Application of a Novel Multiscale Global Graph Convolutional Neural Network to Improve the Accuracy of Forest Type Classification Using Aerial Photographs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate classification of forest types is critical for sustainable forest management. In this study, a novel multiscale global graph convolutional neural network (MSG-GCN) was compared with random forest (RF), U-Net, and U-Net++ models in terms of the classification of natural mixed forest (NMX), natural broadleaved forest (NBL), and conifer plantation (CP) using very high-resolution aerial photographs from the University of Tokyo Chiba Forest in central Japan. Our MSG-GCN architecture is novel in the following respects: The convolutional kernel scale of the encoder is unlike those of other models; local attention replaces the conventional U-Net++ skip connection; a multiscale graph convolutional neural block is embedded into the end layer of the encoder module; and various decoding layers are spliced to preserve high- and low-level feature information and to improve the decision capacity for boundary cells. The MSG-GCN achieved higher classification accuracy than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The classification accuracy in terms of NMX was lower compared with NBL and CP. The RF method produced severe salt-and-pepper noise. The U-Net and U-Net++ methods frequently produced error patches and the edges between different forest types were rough and blurred. In contrast, the MSG-GCN method had fewer misclassification patches and showed clear edges between different forest types. Most areas misclassified by MSG-GCN were on edges, while misclassification patches were randomly distributed in internal areas for U-Net and U-Net++. We made full use of artificial intelligence and very high-resolution remote sensing data to create accurate maps to aid forest management and facilitate efficient and accurate forest resource inventory taking in Japan.

TI  - Baseline Assessment of Ecological Quality Index (EQI) of the Marine Coastal Habitats of Tonga Archipelago: Application for Management of Remote Regions in the Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of coral habitats and associated biodiversity have direct effects both on the physical dynamics of the coast and on natural resources, threatening the survival of local populations. Conservative actions, such as the creation of new Marine Protected Areas, are urgent measures needed to face climate change. Managers need fast and simple methods to evaluate marine habitats for planning conservation areas. Here, we present the application of an Ecological Quality Index (EQI), developed for regional-scale habitat maps of the Atlas of the Marine Coastal Habitats of the Kingdom of Tonga, by processing Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery. Both the habitat mapping classification and the EQI application were focused on the importance of coral reef, seagrass and mangrove habitats, both as natural defense and sustenance for the local populations. Twelve main Pacific reef habitats were evaluated through a three-level EQI score assigned to six parameters: nursery ground, connectivity, species reservoir, fish attraction, biodiversity and primary production. The EQI was integrated into a developed georeferenced database associated to the QGIS software providing the ability to identify on the maps the area of interest and the associated habitats, and to quantify their ecological relevance. The EQI is proposed as a tool that can offer to stakeholders and environmental managers a simple and direct indicator of the value of the marine coastal environment. The index may be handled for management purposes of vast areas with remote and uninhabited islands.

TI  - Imputation of Missing Parts in UAV Orthomosaics Using PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 Data: A Case Study in a Grass-Dominated Area
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing systems have broadened the remote sensing applications for agriculture. Despite the great possibilities of using UAVs to monitor agricultural fields, specific problems related to missing parts in UAV orthomosaics due to drone flight restrictions are common in agricultural monitoring, especially in large areas. In this study, we propose a methodological framework to impute missing parts of UAV orthomosaics using PlanetScope (PS) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data and the random forest (RF) algorithm of an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) covered by grass at the time. We validated the proposed framework by simulating and imputing artificial missing parts in a UAV orthomosaic and then comparing the original data with the model predictions. Spectral bands and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from PS, as well as S2 images (separately and combined), were used as predictor variables of the UAV spectral bands and NDVI in developing the RF-based imputation models. The proposed framework produces highly accurate results (RMSE = 6.77-17.33%) with a computationally efficient and robust machine-learning algorithm that leverages the wealth of empirical information present in optical satellite imagery (PS and S2) to impute up to 50% of missing parts in a UAV orthomosaic.

TI  - Changes in wetland and other landscape elements of the Keta Municipal area of Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal landscapes, including coastal wetlands around the world, are increasingly facing devastating threats and disasters due to land use and land cover (LULC) changes and coastal processes occasioned by climate change. The coastal zone of Keta and the municipality in general are affected by human activities and geomorphological processes such as sea erosion and flooding which are upsetting the condition of the coastal wetland, the vegetal cover and other landscape features of the locality. The rationale of the study was to estimate the transformations in LULC in the wetlands and general landscape from 1991 to 2018 and investigate the driving forces behind the LULC changes. This can help wetlands managers to develop well-tailored policies towards sustainable management of wetlands in Ghana. To achieve this, the study carried out a LULC analysis using Landsat data of 1991, 2005 and 2018. The study established that, there has been a changing pattern in the major LULC types, except for bare lands. Wetlands reduced in coverage from 182.33 km(2) to 135.11 km(2) while farmlands showed a continuous increase in landmass. Increased anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, farming and geomorphic processes such as sea erosion and tidal inundation owing to climate change are the key drivers of the transformations of the landscape of the locality. Enforcement of the national wetlands conservation policy, planting of mangroves in the wetlands and the afforestation of other degraded lands of the municipality will restore the ecosystem and protect the landscape.

TI  - Wildfire Dynamics in Pine Forests of Central Siberia in a Changing Climate
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change increases the frequency of forest fires throughout the entire boreal zone. This paper examines the long-term wildfire dynamics in pine forests of Central Siberia, relationships between environmental and climatic variables on the one hand and the occurrence frequency of fires and size of burnt forest areas on the other, and the postfire dynamics of vegetation cover productivity. A coupled analysis of ground survey data, remote sensing data (spectroradiometric and gravimetric information collected by the Terra/MODIS and GRACE satellites), and dendroecological data is performed. In the period from the 18th to the 20th century, fire return intervals decreased from 33 to 20-25 years. No statistically significant trends in fire occurrence frequency were identified in the current century; however, catastrophic (i.e., affecting more than 1 million ha) fires were observed in its second decade, and both the number of fires and size of burnt areas have significantly increased (by 3.5 and 3.0 times, respectively). The frequency of fires and size of burnt areas closely correlate with wetting and temperature conditions in the prefire period. Furthermore, fire statistics parameters correlate with wetting conditions (precipitation amount, moisture content in the ground cover and soil, and the Self-Calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI)) stronger than with air temperature. It is shown that equivalent water thickness values obtained using gravimetric methods can be used in fire risk assessments. High correlation levels were identified between the growth index of pine trees and vegetation cover productivity indices (i.e., gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP)) generated based on remote sensing data. The results indicate that these indices can be used to estimate forest stand productivity dynamics. The vegetation cover productivity and the radial growth index of pine trees in burnt areas quickly (within a decade) restore to prefire values, which indicates that northern pine forests retain their carbon sequestration function despite climate change and the increasing frequency of fires.

TI  - A Circum-Arctic Monitoring Framework for Quantifying Annual Erosion Rates of Permafrost Coasts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates a circum-Arctic monitoring framework for quantifying annual change of permafrost-affected coasts at a spatial resolution of 10 m. Frequent cloud coverage and challenging lighting conditions, including polar night, limit the usability of optical data in Arctic regions. For this reason, Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data in the form of annual median and standard deviation (sd) Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter images covering the months June-September for the years 2017-2021 were computed. Annual composites for the year 2020 were hereby utilized as input for the generation of a high-quality coastline product via a Deep Learning (DL) workflow, covering 161,600 km of the Arctic coastline. The previously computed annual S1 composites for the years 2017 and 2021 were employed as input data for the Change Vector Analysis (CVA)-based coastal change investigation. The generated DL coastline product served hereby as a reference. Maximum erosion rates of up to 67 m per year could be observed based on 400 m coastline segments. Overall highest average annual erosion can be reported for the United States (Alaska) with 0.75 m per year, followed by Russia with 0.62 m per year. Out of all seas covered in this study, the Beaufort Sea featured the overall strongest average annual coastal erosion of 1.12 m. Several quality layers are provided for both the DL coastline product and the CVA-based coastal change analysis to assess the applicability and accuracy of the output products. The predicted coastal change rates show good agreement with findings published in previous literature. The proposed methods and data may act as a valuable tool for future analysis of permafrost loss and carbon emissions in Arctic coastal environments.

TI  - Differentiation of benign nevoid rests and metastatic melanoma in sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with cutaneous melanoma routinely undergo sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. If this first lymph node is clear, the entire lymph node basin is very likely to be free from the metastatic disease. Lymph node analysis is therefore of great importance with respect to prognostication and further management. Various cell types, including benign nevoid rests, can mimic metastatic melanomatous cells in the SLN. There is no standardized method to differentiate naevoid rests from metastatic melanoma. Diagnosis is based on cell location, morphology and multiple immunohistochemical techniques, with no single test being completely diagnostic. We present a patient with Lentigo Maligna melanoma, who was found to have benign nevoid rests on SLN biopsy, and discuss the diagnostic tests and considerations in differentiating benign nevoid rests from metastatic melanoma.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Response to Canopy Moisture in Mediterranean Forests before and after Fire Events
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the sensibility of Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter to the moisture content of tree canopies over an area of about 500 km(2) in north-western Portugal, with specific analysis over burnt areas. Sentinel-1 C-VV and C-VH backscatter values from 276 images acquired between January 2018 and December 2020 were assigned to five classes depending on the Drought Code (DC) scenario over several unburned and burned sites with total (>90%) forest canopy cover. Confounding variables such as tree cover and incidence angle were accounted for by masking using specific thresholds. The following results are discussed: (a) C-VV and C-VH backscatter values are inversely correlated (R-2 = 0.324 to 0.438 -p < 0.001) with local incidence angle over canopies; (b) correlation is significantly stronger over very wet scenarios (DC class = 0 to 1); (c) C-VV and C-VH backscatter values can discriminate wet to dry forest environments, but they are less sensitive to the transition between dry (DC classes = 1 to 10, 10 to 100) and extremely dry environments (DC classes = 100 to 1000); (d) C-VH is more sensible than C-VV to capture burnt canopy; and (e) the C-VH polarization captures post-fire recovery after an average minimum period of 360 days after the fire event, although with less distinction for extremely wet soils. We conclude that C-band VH backscatter intensity decreases from wet to dry canopy conditions, that this behavior of the backscatter signal with respect to canopy dryness is lost after a fire event, and that after one year it is recovered.

TI  - Unsupervised Diffusion and Volume Maximization-Based Clustering of Hyperspectral Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images taken from aircraft or satellites contain information from hundreds of spectral bands, within which lie latent lower-dimensional structures that can be exploited for classifying vegetation and other materials. A disadvantage of working with hyperspectral images is that, due to an inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial resolution, they have a relatively coarse spatial scale, meaning that single pixels may correspond to spatial regions containing multiple materials. This article introduces the Diffusion and Volume maximization-based Image Clustering (D-VIC) algorithm for unsupervised material clustering to address this problem. By directly incorporating pixel purity into its labeling procedure, D-VIC gives greater weight to pixels corresponding to a spatial region containing just a single material. D-VIC is shown to outperform comparable state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments on a range of hyperspectral images, including land-use maps and highly mixed forest health surveys (in the context of ash dieback disease), implying that it is well-equipped for unsupervised material clustering of spectrally-mixed hyperspectral datasets.

TI  - On the Mechanism of a Dramatic Drop of the Sea Surface Temperature in the Northwestern Black Sea and Off the Crimean Coast
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of high-resolution satellite data on sea surface temperature (SST) and surface wind for 2008-2021 confirmed that the areas of a dramatic SST drop exceeding several degrees per day regularly occur in the northwestern Black Sea and off the western coast of Crimea. These areas are located not only in coastal upwelling zones. Extensive areas of this type are found in the open water areas in the northwestern part of the sea and in the vicinity of the western large-scale cyclonic gyre. A reason for the formation of such areas during the period of the stable vertical thermal stratification in the upper layer is the strengthening of wind in the atmospheric surface layer and the intensification of cyclonic vorticity. This leads to the generation of upward motions, additional turbulent mixing in the upper sea layer, and, as a consequence, the SST drop within a few days after the passage of the cyclone over the sea. This mechanism is especially effective in the case of slowly moving cyclones in the presence of a blocking or a high-pressure ridge northeast of the Black Sea region.

TI  - Remote Sensing Assessment and Modeling of the Spatial Dynamics of Tree Stand Disturbance after the Impact of Siberian Silk Moth (<i>Dendrolimus sibiricus</i>)
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we have analyzed tree stand disturbance by hthe Siberian Silk Moth (Dendrolimus sibiricus Tschetverikov (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae)) in Central Siberia (Krasnoyarsk region, Russia) in 2015-2020. We considered two plots that experienced silk moth outbreaks in 2015-2018 and 2018-2020 and used satellite data (Terra/MODIS, Landsat/ETM/OLI), field forest inventory data, a meteorological data set, and a vegetation cover vector layer. Silk moth-disturbed areas were classified using NDVI, which was calculated for each 15-day period during the growing season (April-September). We obtained formalized descriptions of the temporal dynamics of the disturbed area. Next, we classified the degree of disturbance of the forest stand after the impact of the silk moth by the threshold method according to the ranges of NDVI anomalies. Based on the generalized data from the forest inventory, we performed a correlation analysis of the relationship between the main characteristics of forests and the classes of disturbance. Finally, using a series of regression equations, we described a procedure for predicting the degree of impact on the stand during the time of silk moth outbreaks in the dark-needle coniferous stands of Central Siberia.

TI  - Multimodality Imaging Review of HER2-positive Breast Cancer and Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - RADIOGRAPHICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu or ErbB2)-positive breast cancers comprise 15%-20% of all breast cancers. The most common manifestation of HER2-positive breast cancer at mammography or US is an irregular mass with spiculated margins that often contains calcifications; at MRI, HER2-positive breast cancer may appear as a mass or as nonmass enhancement. HER2-positive breast cancers are often of intermediate to high nuclear grade at histopathologic analysis, with increased risk of local recurrence and metastases and poorer overall prognosis. However, treatment with targeted monoclonal antibody therapies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab provides better local-regional control and leads to improved survival outcome. With neoadjuvant treatments, including monoclonal antibodies, taxanes, and anthracyclines, women are now potentially able to undergo breast conservation therapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy versus mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Thus, the radiologist's role in assessing the extent of local-regional disease and response to neoadjuvant treatment at imaging is important to inform surgical planning and adjuvant treatment. However, assessment of treatment response remains difficult, with the potential for different imaging modalities to result in underestimation or overestimation of disease to varying degrees when compared with surgical pathologic analysis. In particular, the presence of calcifications at mammography is especially difficult to correlate with the results of pathologic analysis after chemotherapy. Breast MRI findings remain the best predictor of pathologic response. The authors review the initial manifestations of HER2-positive tumors, the varied responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the challenges in assessing residual cancer burden through a multimodality imaging review with pathologic correlation.

TI  - Merged Multi-Sensor Ocean Colour Chlorophyll Product Evaluation for the British Columbia Coast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton phenology studies require a dataset that is continuous in time and space since missing data have been shown to affect the accuracy of seasonality metrics. The interpolated GlobColour product provided by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) meets these requirements by being 'gap filled', thus yielding the highest spatial coverage. Despite being validated on a global scale, a regional comparison to in situ Chl-a concentrations should be conducted to enable product application in optically complex waters. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the GlobColour interpolated product in British Columbia coastal waters via a statistical match-up analysis and a qualitative analysis to determine whether the data reflect the region's large-scale seasonal trends and latitudinal dynamics. Additionally, the statistical performance of the GlobColour interpolated product was compared to the original GlobColour and Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) merged chlorophyll-a products based on in situ observations. The GlobColour interpolated product performed relatively well and was comparable to the best-performing product for each water type (RMSE = 0.28, r(2) = 0.77, MdAD = 1.5, BIAS = 0.90). The statistics for all the products degraded in Case 2 waters, thus highlighting the dilemma of applying algorithms designed for Case 1 waters in Case 2 waters. Our results indicate how the quality of products can vary in different environmental conditions.

TI  - Microplastics in Terrestrial Domestic Animals and Human Health: Implications for Food Security and Food Safety and Their Role as Sentinels
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Microplastics are widespread environmental contaminants comprised of plastic pieces <5 mm. Human exposure to microplastics has been confirmed by their presence in multiple tissues. Terrestrial domestic animals may be relevant to human exposure, as they are also subjected to the same environmental contaminants, possibly acting as sentinels (i.e., help estimate exposure and risk to humans) or by being an integral part of the human food chain, as in the case of livestock. This work addresses how microplastics may impact terrestrial domestic animals, leading to consequences for food security (i.e., the availability of food) and food safety (i.e., the prevention of foodborne illnesses) and how companion animals may help estimate environmental human exposure. Terrestrial domestic animals are exposed to microplastics, therefore, contaminating the food chain, in the case of livestock, or acting as sentinels for human exposure, in the case of companion animals. The aim of this review was to address the importance of terrestrial domestic animals on human exposure to microplastics. Animal products may already show some microplastics contamination, which may occur during their lifetime, possibly also compromising productivity, and during processing, originating from equipment and packaging. Moreover, release of microplastics in animal feces (or manure) leads to the contamination of agricultural fields, with possible impacts and internalization in plants. Therefore, microplastics pose a threat to food security, compromising food productivity, and food safety, by being a foreign material found in animal products. Conversely, in urban environments, companion animals (cats and dogs) may be relevant sentinels for human exposure. While oral exposure may vary in pets compared to humans, due to indiscriminate ingestion and chewing or licking behaviors, airborne exposure is likely to be a good indicator for human exposure. Therefore, future studies should address the importance of terrestrial domestic animals for human exposure of microplastics, both in the food chain and as sentinels for environmental exposure.

TI  - Prediction of Incident Solar Radiation Using a Hybrid Kernel Based Extreme Learning Machine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting solar radiation for a given region is an emerging field of study. It will help to identify the places for installing large-scale photovoltaic-systems, designing energy-efficient buildings and energy estimation. The different machine learning kernel-based approaches for prediction problems uses either a local or global kernel. These models can provide either strong training capability or good generalization performance. In this paper, a new hybrid kernel is proposed using the combination of a local and global kernel. A novel algorithm Hybrid Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine is proposed for predictive modelling of Incident Solar Radiation (ISR) time series using new hybrid kernel. The proposed algorithm uses the surface, atmospheric, cloud properties obtained from the MODIS instrument and observed ISR at time t - 1 to predict ISR at time t. This study is conducted for 41 diverse sites of Australia for the period of 2012-2015. Further, the proposed model is experimented with other time series datasets to prove its efficacy. It is shown that the proposed methodology outperforms five other benchmarking methods in terms of MAE and Willmott's Index (WI). Therefore, the suggested approach can be used for modelling solar energy at a national scale using remotely-sensed satellite footprints.

TI  - The Habitat Map of Switzerland: A Remote Sensing, Composite Approach for a High Spatial and Thematic Resolution Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat maps at high thematic and spatial resolution and broad extents are fundamental tools for biodiversity conservation, the planning of ecological networks and the management of ecosystem services. To derive a habitat map for Switzerland, we used a composite methodology bringing together the best available spatial data and distribution models. The approach relies on the segmentation and classification of high spatial resolution (1 m) aerial imagery. Land cover data, as well as habitat and species distribution models built on Earth observation data from Sentinel 1 and 2, Landsat, Planetscope and LiDAR, inform the rule-based classification to habitats defined by the hierarchical Swiss Habitat Typology (TypoCH). A total of 84 habitats in 32 groups and 9 overarching classes are mapped in a spatially explicit manner across Switzerland. Validation and plausibility analysis with four independent datasets show that the mapping is broadly plausible, with good accuracy for most habitats, although with lower performance for fine-scale and linear habitats, habitats with restricted geographical distributions and those predominantly characterised by understorey species, especially forest habitats. The resulting map is a vector dataset available for interactive viewing and download from open EnviDat data sharing platform. The methodology is semi-automated to allow for updates over time.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The sentinel reference for antibiotic prophylaxis for radical cystectomy with ileal conduit in the AUA Guidelines reports data from 2003-2013 and has not been updated in the interim. Here, we assess adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines among patients undergoing radical cystectomy with ileal conduit for bladder cancer using a large national database. As a secondary objective, we assess the association between antimicrobial use and postoperative infection during the index admission following cystectomy.Materials and Methods: The Premier Healthcare Database was queried for all patients undergoing cystectomy with ileal conduit with diagnosis of bladder cancer between 2015 and 2020. Antibiotics used and the duration of use was determined by charge codes and grouped as guidelines-based or not according to 2019 AUA Guidelines. Association with infectious complications was assessed by logistic mixed effects regression models.Results: Among 6,708 patients undergoing cystectomy with ileal conduit, only 28% (1,843/6,708) were given prophylaxis according to AUA guidelines; 1.8% (121/6,708) of patients received an antifungal and 37% (2,482/6,708) received extended duration prophylaxis beyond postoperative day 1. Patients who received guidelines-based prophylaxis were less likely to be diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (21% vs 24%, P [.04), pyelonephritis (5.1% vs 7.7%, P <.001), bacterial infection (24% vs 27%, P [.03), or pneumonia (12% vs 17%, P <.001). There was no statistically significant difference in clostridium difficile infection between guidelines-based and nonguidelines-based prophylaxis (3.2% vs 3.7%, P [.32). In a multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, race, insurance, and hospital and provider characteristics, nonguideline antibiotic prophylaxis (OR 1.27 [1.12, 1.43], P <.001) was associated with an increased odds of infectious events, whereas a robotic approach (OR 0.82 [0.73, 0.92], P <.001) was associated with lower odds.Conclusions: Seventy-three percent of patients fail to receive guideline-based antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing radical cystectomy with conduit, which was largely driven by extended duration antibiotic use. Despite the shorter duration of antibiotics, we found that guideline-based prophylaxis was associated with a 25% decrease in the odds of infectious complications. While residual confounding is possible, these data support current AUA guidelines and suggest a need for outreach to improve guideline adherence.

TI  - Refining the Resolution of DUACS Along-Track Level-3 Sea Level Altimetry Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the demonstration of a regional high-resolution level-3 (L3) altimeter data unification and altimeter combination system (DUACS) developed with support from the French space agency (CNES). Deduced from full-rate (20 Hz to 40 Hz) level-2 (L2) altimeter measurements, this product provides sea level anomalies (SLA) and other essential physical variables at a spatial resolution of one sample every similar to 1 km over the North Atlantic Ocean. This allows us to resolve wavelengths from similar to 35 km to similar to 55 km depending on the altimeter considered. This was made possible by recent advances in radar altimeter processing for both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and low-resolution-mode (LRM) measurements, as well as improvements made to different stages of the DUACS processing chain. Firstly, the new adaptive and low-resolution with range migration correction (LR-RMC) processing techniques were considered for Jason and Sentinel-3 (S3A), respectively. They significantly reduce errors at short wavelengths, and the adaptive processing also reduces possible land contamination near the coast. Next, up-to-date geophysical and environmental corrections were selected for this production. This includes specific corrections intended to reduce the measurement noise on LRM measurements and thus enhance the observability at short wavelengths. Compared with the 1 Hz product, the observable wavelengths reached with the demonstration high-resolution product are reduced by up to one third, or up to half in the northeast Atlantic region. The residual noises were optimally filtered from full-rate measurements, taking into consideration the different observing capabilities of the altimeters processed. A specific data recovery strategy was applied, significantly optimizing the data availability, both in the coastal and open ocean areas. This demonstration L3 product is thus better resolved than the conventional 1 Hz product, especially near the coast, where it is defined up to similar to 5 km against similar to 10 km for the 1 Hz version. Multi-mission cross-calibration processing was also optimized with an improved long-wavelength error (LWE) correction, leading to a better consistency between tracks, with a 9-15% reduction in SLA variance at cross-overs. The new L3 product improves the overall consistency with tide gauge measurements, with a reduction in SLA differences variance by 5 and 17% compared with the 1 Hz product from the S3A and Jason-3 (J3) measurements, respectively. Primarily intended for regional applications, this product can significantly contribute to improving high-resolution numerical model output via data assimilation. It also opens new perspectives for a better understanding of regional sea-surface dynamics, with an improved representation of the coastal currents and a refined spectral content revealing the unbalanced signal.

TI  - Global Leaf Chlorophyll Content Dataset (GLCC) from 2003-2012 to 2018-2020 Derived from MERIS and OLCI Satellite Data: Algorithm and Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a prominent plant physiological trait and a proxy for leaf photosynthetic capacity. The acquisition of LCC data over large spatial and temporal scales facilitates vegetation growth monitoring and terrestrial carbon cycle modeling. In this study, a global 500 m LCC weekly dataset (GLCC) was produced from ENVISAT MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI satellite data using a physical radiative transfer modeling approach that considers the influence of canopy structure and soil background. Firstly, five look-up-tables (LUTs) were generated using PROSPECT-D+4-Scale and PROSAIL-D models for woody and non-woody plants. For the four LUTs applicable to woody plants, each LUT contains three sub-LUTs corresponding to three types of crown height. The one LUT applicable to non-woody vegetation type includes 25 sub-LUTs corresponding to five kinds of canopy structures and five kinds of soil backgrounds. The final retrieval was considered the aggregation of the LCC inversion results of all sub-LUTs for each plant function type (PFT). Then, the GLCC dataset was generated and validated using field measurements, yielding an overall accuracy of R-2 = 0.41 and RMSE = 8.94 mu g cm(-2). Finally, the GLCC dataset presented acceptable consistency with the existing MERIS LCC dataset. OLCI, as the successor to MERIS data, was used for the first time to co-produce LCC data from 2003-2012 to 2018-2020 in conjunction with MERIS data. This new GLCC dataset spanning nearly 20 years will provide a valuable opportunity to analyze variations in vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Does Regional Urbanization Promote Balanced Land Development? Evidence from Long Time Series Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban megaregion has been promoted as among the major urbanization forms in New-Type Urbanization in China, which aims to promote more balanced development among cities and between the urban and rural areas in a region. While numerous studies have examined developed land expansion in cities worldwide using remotely sensed imagery, fewer have investigated its dynamic process in a rural area and the differences in the growth magnitude and expansion morphology between urban and rural areas. Using Landsat imagery from 1986 to 2020, we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of developed land in both the urban and rural areas in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban megaregion, China, using morphological analysis. We found that (1) the differences in the growth magnitude between the urban and rural areas varied between the different-sized cities, with increases in the largest city of Changsha, but decreases in the smaller ones of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan, although there was a slight increase at the megaregional scale. (2) The dynamic process of developed land in rural areas was similar to that in urban areas but showed a clear time-lag effect, where the dominant expansion types in urban areas shifted from edge to infilling expansion and to another edge expansion in 1986-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2020, whereas that in rural areas changed from outlying to edge expansion in 1986-2000 and 2000-2020. (3) The positive relationships between the growth speed and outlying and edge expansion suggested that the CZT urban megaregion was in the rapid outward expansion stage. Such a pattern may cause similar ecological effects, such as habitat fragmentation and urban heat archipelagos, to that in the eastern megaregions. Understanding such differences and their changes in the urban and rural areas will help optimize the strategies of urban megaregion sustainability.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Changes in Water Use Efficiency and Its Driving Factors in Central Asia (2001-2021)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although understanding the carbon and water cycles of dryland ecosystems in terms of water use efficiency (WUE) is important, WUE and its driving mechanisms are less understood in Central Asia. This study calculated Central Asian WUE for 2001-2021 based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and analyzed its spatial and temporal variability using temporal information entropy. The importance of atmospheric factors, hydrological factors, and biological factors in driving WUE in Central Asia was also explored using a geographic detector. The results show the following: (1) the average WUE in Central Asia from 2001-2021 is 2.584-3.607 gCkg(-1)H(2)O, with weak inter-annual variability and significant intra-annual variability and spatial distribution changes; (2) atmospheric and hydrological factors are strong drivers, with land surface temperature (LST) being the strongest driver of WUE, explaining 54.8% of variation; (3) the interaction of the driving factors can enhance the driving effect by more than 60% for the interaction between most atmospheric factors and vegetation factors, of which the effect of the interaction of temperature (TEM) with vegetation cover (FVC) is the greatest, explaining 68.1% of the change in WUE. Furthermore, the interaction of driving factors with very low explanatory power (e.g., water pressure (VAP), aerosol optical depth over land (AOD), and groundwater (GWS)) has a significant enhancement effect. Vegetation is an important link in driving WUE, and it is important to understand the mechanisms of WUE change to guide ecological restoration projects.

TI  - An Innovative Signal Processing Scheme for Spaceborne Integrated GNSS Remote Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vigorous development of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has led to a boom in GNSS radio occultation (GNSS RO) and GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) techniques. Consequently, we have proposed an innovative signal processing scheme for spaceborne integrated GNSS remote sensors (SIGRS), combining a GNSS RO and a GNSS-R module. In the SIGRS, the GNSS-R module shares one precise orbit determination (POD) module with the GNSS RO module, and the GNSS-R module first achieves compatibility with GPS, BDS, and Galileo. Moreover, the programmable non-uniform delay resolution was introduced and first used by the SIGRS to generate the output DDM, which achieves a high delay resolution in the DDM central region around the specular point to improve the accuracy of basic observables but requires fewer delay bins than the conventional DDM with uniform delay resolution. The SIGRS has been successfully used to design the GNOS II onboard the Chinese FY-3E satellite, and the results of in-orbit operation validate the performance of the SIGRS, which means the SIGRS is an economically and technically efficient design and has become the first successful signal processing scheme for spaceborne integrated GNSS remote sensors around the world.

TI  - To Leave the Land So as Not to Leave the Land: The Religious Motivations of Seasonal Migrants, Including Women, in the Twentieth Century
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This chapter seeks to answer the question as to why, even though subsistence conditions militated against continuing to eke out an existence on unproductive holdings, many inhabitants in Ireland's western counties did just that. Particularly in the west of Ireland, Irish women and men found ways to remain on their lands and in their dwellings despite the enduring proclivity for permanent migration from Ireland during the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth. The answer lies in the Irish penchant to engage in a variety of vernacular religious practices reiterated via expressive cultural forms like proverbs and reinforced via plays and films. In addition, an otherworld feminine perspective permeated their consciousness. For the Irish, their implicit religion-a complex network of symbols and practices-remained intact, so much so that seasonal migration endured, and the Irish preserved their homelands.

TI  - Discrepancies in the current capabilities in measuring upstream flare volumes in the Permian Basin
T2  - UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Permian Basin in Texas is the largest and fastest-growing oil and gas producing region in the United States. Along with this growth, there have been increased methane emissions and natural gas flaring. The volume of flared gas can be measured by various methods. In this study, flared gas volumes obtained from satellites are compared with the flared gas volume and oil production reported by the operators to the State of Texas. The novelty of this study arises from the fine-grained perspective with which it is conducted, that is, the data points are spatially narrowed down to ten different flare sites located in the Permian Basin and temporally narrowed down to monthly volume comparisons. It is found that satellite data matches reported data at some sites, while in other sites it is higher or lower than the operator-reported data. The trend in flaring is compared with oil production from the wells associated with the ten flare sites. At the sites where the data matched the gas flaring was also correlated with the oil production data. This suggests that the reported flare volumes are more accurate (i.e. match with the satellite) under routine flaring, and are less accurate for episodic flaring. Only five out of the ten flares showed a correlation with oil production. For the ten sites, cumulatively, the satellite observed volumes were 16% of the operator-reported volume in 2018, 21% in 2019, 41.5% in 2020, and 111% in 2021. A discussion is included on how changes in regulations may affect these comparisons going forward.

TI  - Basosquamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nipple-Areola Complex-Report of a Case
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Basosquamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) is a rare malignancy usually arising on sun-exposed areas of the skin. BSCC is described as a rare variant of Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) which shows clinical and microscopic features of both BCC and of Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We report the case of a 70-year-old male with a cutaneous lesion of the nipple-areola complex (NAC); to the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever reported patient with BSCC in this area. The lesion had a fast growth, but, due to the COVID19 crisis, the patient only came to our observation one year after onset of this condition. Physical examination showed a bleeding red ulcerated lesion that involved the NAC, measuring 27 mm x 20 mm. Biopsy showed a BSCC. Pre-operative breast ultrasound scan, mammogram and MRI were all performed before surgery, which consisted of simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph-node biopsy. The patient was discharged home on the 4th post-operative day, and at 18-month follow-up there are no signs or clinical evidence of local recurrence or metastases. Diagnosis of BSCC of the nipple-areola complex requires high index of suspicion and a thorough differential diagnosis, management, and suitable radical treatment due to well described high rates of recurrence and of metastases. Differential diagnosis with similar lesions (e.g., Paget's disease, Bowen's disease, BCC, and SCC) should also be taken into account.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Dynamics using Geoinformatics Techniques: A Case Study on Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) in West Bengal, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most valuable approaches in spatial analysis for a better understanding of the hydrological response of a region or a watershed is certainly the analysis of the well-known land use land cover (LULC) dynamicity. The present case study delves deeper into the analysis of LULC dynamicity by using digital Landsat TM and Landsat OLI data to classify the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) into seven classes with over 90% classification accuracy for decadal level assessments of 30 years (for the years 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2019). The change index, the Dematel method for analyzing the cause-effect relationship among the LULC classes, the Jaccard Similarity Index for measuring the nature of similarity among the LULC classes, and the Adherence Index for measuring the consistency of the LULC classes after the transition was used in this study to analyze the LULC transformation. In more detail, the present study considers how urban land use is altering at the expense of other land uses. Besides the shifting pattern of mean centers of the LULC classes through time, also gives a very significant insight into the LULC dynamics over 30 years of span. The current study of LULC dynamicity and transformation patterns over the 30 years of the KMDA area is expected to assist land and urban planners, engineers, and administrators in sustainable decisions and policies to ensure inclusive urbanization that accommodates population growth while minimizing the impact on potential natural resources within the whole study area.

TI  - Omission of axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy in early invasive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Local treatment of the axilla in clinically node-negative (cN0) early breast cancer patients with routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is debated after publication of ACOSOG Z0011 data in 2010. Currently, prospective randomized surgical trials investigating the omission of SLNB in upfront breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and in the neoadjuvant setting, respectively. Several prospective randomized trials (SOUND, INSEMA, BOOG 2013-08, and NAUTILUS) with axillary observation alone versus SLNB in cN0 patients and primary BCS have primary objectives to evaluate oncologic safety when omitting SLNB. The Italian SOUND trial was the earliest to open in 2012 and has completed accrual in 2017. First oncologic outcome data are expected soon for SOUND and at the end of 2024 for INSEMA. Improvements in systemic treatments for breast cancer have increased the rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), offering the opportunity to de-escalate surgery in patients who have a pCR. Two prospective single-arm trials (EUBREAST-01, ASICS) include only patients with the highest likelihood of having a pCR after NAST (triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer) and type of surgery will be defined according to the response to NAST rather than on the classical T and N status. The ongoing trials will hopefully help us to understand whether we might take the best therapeutic decisions without the pathologic evaluation of nodal status.

TI  - Quantification of Evapotranspiration and Water Chemistry in a Remediated Wetland in Everglades National Park, USA
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Similar to most wetlands, the Florida Everglades landscape was altered to promote agriculture and human settlement, significantly altering the natural hydrologic regime. Once former agricultural land located within Everglades National Park (ENP), the Hole-in-the-Donut (HID) wetland restoration program became the first mitigation bank project in Florida. The HID program utilized a restoration technique of complete soil removal to effectively eradicate an invasive plant species. This research investigated the effects of the vegetation and soil removal on the hydrologic conditions of the HID, specifically evapotranspiration and water chemistry. Annual evapotranspiration rates were determined for the region using remotely sensed data and compared to the acres restored over a 15-year period. Groundwater and surface waters were collected from both inside the HID and from adjacent areas within ENP for major cations and anions and total nutrient concentrations. Evapotranspiration rates were found to decrease from a mean of 1083.4 mm year(-1) in the year 2000 to 891.6 mm year(-1) in 2014 as the restored area increased to 4893 acres. Concentrations of ions and nutrients were lower in groundwater and surface water within the restored areas compared to adjacent areas. We conclude that the lack of soil cover (along with reduced evapotranspiration rates) contributed to the lower ion and nutrient concentrations in the surface water and groundwater within the HID.

TI  - Environmental Drivers of Gross Primary Productivity and Light Use Efficiency of a Temperate Spruce Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Various environmental variables drive gross primary productivity (GPP) and light use efficiency (LUE) of forest ecosystems. However, due to their intertwined nature and the complexity of measuring absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) of forest canopies, the assessment of LUE and the importance of its environmental drivers are difficult. Here, we present a unique combination of measurements during the 2021 growing season including eddy covariance derived GPP, sap flow, Sentinel-2 derived canopy chlorophyll content and in situ measured APAR. The importance of environmental variables for GPP models is quantified with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. A special focus is put on photosynthesis-limiting conditions, which are identified by a comparison of GPP and sap flow hysteretic responses to Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and APAR. Results demonstrate that (a) LUE of the canopy's green part was on average 4.0% +/- 2.3%, (b) canopy chlorophyll content as a seasonal variable for photosynthetic capacity was important for GPP predictions, and (c) on days with high VPD, tree-scale sap flow and ecosystem-scale GPP both shift to a clockwise hysteretic response to APAR. We demonstrate that the onset of such a clockwise hysteretic pattern of sap flow to APAR is a good indicator of stomatal closure related to water-limiting conditions at the ecosystem-scale.

TI  - A Spectral-Spatial Method for Mapping Fire Severity Using Morphological Attribute Profiles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and accurate fire severity mapping can provide an essential resource for fire management and studying fire-related ecological and climate change. Currently, mainstream fire severity mapping approaches are based only on pixel-wise spectral features. However, the landscape pattern of fire severity originates from variations in spatial dependence, which should be described by spatial features combined with spectral features. In this paper, we propose a morphological attribute profiles-based spectral-spatial approach, named Burn Attribute Profiles (BAP), to improve fire severity classification and mapping accuracy. Specifically, the BAP method uses principal component transformation and attributes with automatically determined thresholds to extract spatial features, which are integrated with spectral features to form spectral-spatial features for fire severity. We systematically tested and compared the BAP-based spectral-spatial features and spectral index features in the extremely randomized trees machine learning framework. Sentinel-2 imagery was used for seven fires in the Mediterranean region, while Landsat-8 imagery was used for another seven fires in the northwestern continental United States region. The results showed that, except for 2 fires (overall accuracy (OA) for EMSR213_P: 59.6%, EL: 59.5%), BAP performed well for the other 12 fires (OA for the 2 fires: 60-70%, 6 fires: 70-80%, 4 fires: >80%). Furthermore, compared with the spectral indices-based method, the BAP method showed OA improvement in all 14 fires (OA improvement in Mediterranean: 0.2-14.3%, US: 4.7-12.9%). Recall and Precision were also improved for each fire severity level in most fire events. Moreover, the BAP method improved the "salt-and-pepper" phenomenon in the homogeneous area, where the results are visually closest to the reference data. The above results suggest that the spectral-spatial method based on morphological attribute profiles can map fire severity more accurately.

TI  - Management of Patients Diagnosed with Endometrial Cancer: Comparison of Guidelines
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Endometrial cancer has a high epidemiological impact, and its management is part of everyday clinical practice. International guidelines have been arranged over the years according to major recent discoveries. The application of the guidelines released by different international gynecological societies is still matter of debate as they diverge in many issues. Authors wanted to compare them and point out the differences, aiming to both draw the attention to a need of unification and to provide a useful tool for clinicians. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in Europe and its management involves a variety of health professionals. In recent years, big discoveries were made concerning the management of patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, particularly in the field of molecular biology and minimally invasive surgery. This requires the continuous updating of guidelines and protocols over the years. In this paper, we aim to summarize and compare common points and disparities among protocols for management of patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer by leading international gynecological oncological societies. We therefore systematically report the parallel among the guidelines based on the various steps patients with endometrial cancer usually undergo. The comparison between American and European protocols revealed some relevant disparities, in particular regarding surgical staging, molecular biology application as a prognostic tool and follow up regimens. This could possibly cause differences in interpreting and applying protocols in clinical practice in small centers, leading to a lack of adherence to guidelines or even prompting a confusing mix of them.

TI  - A New Approach to Monitor Soil Microbial Driven C/N Ratio in Temperate Evergreen Coniferous Forests Managed via Sentinel-2 Spectral Imagery
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are key ecosystems for climate change mitigation, playing a pivotal role in C and N land sequestering and storage. However, the sustainable management of forests is challenging for foresters who need continuous and reliable information on the status of soil conditions. Yet, the monitoring of soils in temperate evergreen forests, via satellite data, is jeopardized by the year round prevailing heavily dense canopy. In this study, the Sentinel-2 spectral imagery derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), proved to be a reliable tool to determine the C/N ratio in two managed pine-dominated forests, in southern Poland. Results showed a strong negative correlation between NDVI values and the on-site C/N ratios measured at the upper soil horizons in 100 and 99 randomly distributed sampling points across the Kup (r(2) = -0.8019) and Koniecpol (r(2) = -0.7281) forests. This indicates the feasibility of using the NDVI to predict the microbial driven soil C/N ratio in evergreen forests, and to foresee alterations in the vegetation patterns elicited by microbial hindering soil abiotic or biotic factors. Spatial/temporal variations in C/N ratio also provide information on C and N soil dynamics and land ecosystem function in a changing climate.

TI  - Efficacy of Kairomone Lures to Attract Parasitoids of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i>
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is an invasive pest of agricultural crops, ornamentals, and human structures. In its native range, populations are suppressed primarily by parasitoid wasps that attack the egg stage. A promising adventive parasitoid, the samurai wasp, Trissolcus japonicus, has become established in the U.S., including Utah. According to ecological models, Utah is marginally suitable for the samurai wasp and poses unique challenges to its establishment from extreme climates and high elevation. Biological control enhancement efforts, such as deploying stink bug kairomones to attract parasitoids, may lead to the enhanced suppression of the brown marmorated stink bug. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, experimental lures loaded with varying blends and release rates of stink bug kairomones were tested in field and mesocosm trials. This study found low parasitism in the field, while mesocosm trials demonstrated the efficacy of a single- and dual-compound blend at the 10 mg load rate for the attraction of the samurai wasp. These results support the validity of using rubber septa as a release device for kairomones of stink bugs and provide a baseline for future work on attracting samurai wasps with lures in a field environment. In its native range, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) is suppressed by parasitoids in the genus Trissolcus (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae). Trissolcus native to Utah have demonstrated low parasitism of H. halys, while adventive Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) have shown parasitism of up to 20%. Custom rubber septa lures containing stink bug kairomones, n-tridecane (attractant), and (E)-2-decenal (repellent), at 100%, 90%, and 80% levels of attractant (10 mg load rate), were placed adjacent to sentinel H. halys egg masses in northern Utah field trials. Egg masses were evaluated for the presence and intensity (proportion of parasitized eggs) of parasitism. Parasitism by T. japonicus and T. euschisti (Ashmead) was low; however, the 100% lure showed double the parasitism of the control and more than three times that of the 90% and 80%. Two-way choice mesocosm trials in the laboratory evaluated previous lures and a lower load rate of 5 mg-100% attractant treatment. Lures of 10 mg at 100% and 80% were more attractive to T. japonicus than the control, while 5 mg at 100% and 10 mg at 90% showed no significant attraction. Our results support a proof-of-concept of rubber septa as release devices for kairomones to attract T. japonicus and provide a baseline for future field-based studies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is limited information on microsatellite survival outcomes in patients with melanoma. Objective: To evaluate survival outcomes in patients with microsatellites, assess their role within stage III stratification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification, and assess the results of sentinel lymph node biopsies in patients with microsatellites. Methods: A retrospective bicenter cohort study from 1998 to 2019 included patients with a diagnosis of invasive cutaneous melanoma. Results: Of a total of 5216 patients, 108 (2.1%) had microsatellites at initial staging. Survival analysis showed that microsatellites were an independent risk factor with decreased overall survival (OS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and disease-free survival, with hazard ratios of 1.57, 1.76, and 1.76, respectively. Stratified analysis in patients with stage III melanoma showed a 5-year OS of 35% (95% CI, 17.3%-73.4%) and a MSS of 45% (95% CI, 23.1-87.5) for patients with stage IIIB melanoma with microsatellites. Limitations: Retrospective design of the study. Conclusion: Microsatellites were associated with other adverse melanoma prognostic factors. A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that they are an independent risk factor for worse OS, MSS, and disease-free survival. Patients with stage IIIB melanoma with microsatellites had worse OS and MSS, whereas patients with stage IIIC melanoma had worse OS but not MSS. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2023;88:338-47.)

TI  - PLS-PM analysis of forest fires using remote sensing tools. The case of Xur?es in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires have environmental, social and economic impacts in many areas. Various factors related to territory directly influence both the number and the surface area of each fire. The link between different variables (climate, social and environmental) in the risk of fire and in the characteristics of fires is studied here through Partial Least Squares -Path Models. In addition, images from the Sentinel-2 sensor and geographic information systems are used to create a cartographic base of fires in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Galicia and the Site of Community Importance of Xure ' s (Galicia) between 2015 and 2020. In all, seven variables are analyzed in this study area using the partial least squares-path modeling method: climate, topography, land use, type of environmental protection, the anthropogenic factor, fire defense, and fire data (severity and area). The pa-rameters for each variable are used to obtain weights and thus determine the importance of each one. The areas where the problem of forest fires is greatest are those with the greatest environmental protection. Up to 31% of the surface area of the Natura 2000 Network was burned in the 6-year study period. Topography and land use are also shown to be relevant factors in the effects of forest fires in this territory. By contrast, higher population density and the development of infrastructures such as roads and water tanks mitigate the impact of fires. The problem of forest fires encompasses many variables that need to be studied. By contextualizing each study area as far as possible, specific measures to prevent and reduce damage can be drawn up.

TI  - Estimating Above-Ground Biomass from Land Surface Temperature and Evapotranspiration Data at the Temperate Forests of Durango, Mexico
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of above-ground biomass (AGB) is important for monitoring the dynamics of the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems. The emergence of remote sensing has made it possible to analyze vegetation using land surface temperature (LST), Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) and evapotranspiration (ET) information. However, relatively few studies have evaluated the ability of these variables to estimate AGB in temperate forests. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of LST, VTCI and ET with AGB in temperate forests of Durango, Mexico, regarding each season of the year and to develop a AGB estimation model using as predictors LST, VCTI and ET, together with topographic, reflectance and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture variables. A semi-parametric model was generated to analyze the linear and non-linear responses of the predictive variables of AGB using a generalized linear model (GAM). The results show that the best predictors of AGB were longitude, latitude, spring LST, ET, elevation VTCI, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), slope and GLCM mean (R-2 = 0.61; RMSE = 28.33 Mgha(-1)). The developed GAM model was evaluated with an independent dataset (R-2 = 0.58; RMSE = 31.21 Mgha(-1)), suggesting the potential of this modeling approach to predict AGB for the analyzed temperate forest ecosystems.

TI  - Forest Segmentation with Spatial Pyramid Pooling Modules: A Surveillance System Based on Satellite Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global deforestation rate continues to worsen each year, and will eventually lead to various negative consequences for humans and the environment. It is essential to develop an effective forest monitoring system to detect any changes in forest areas, in particular, by monitoring the progress of forest conservation efforts. In general, changes in forest status are difficult to annotate manually, whereby the boundaries can be small in size or hard to discern, especially in areas that are bordering residential areas. The previously implemented forest monitoring systems were ineffective due to their use of low-resolution satellite images and the inefficiency of drone-based data that offer a limited field of view. Most government agencies also still rely on manual annotation, which makes the monitoring process time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Therefore, the goal of this study is to overcome these issues by developing a forest monitoring system that relies on a robust deep semantic segmentation network that is capable of discerning forest boundaries automatically, so that any changes over the years can be tracked. The backbone of this system is based on satellite imaging supplied to a modified U-Net deep architecture to incorporate multi-scale modules to deliver the semantic segmentation output. A dataset of 6048 Landsat-8 satellite sub-images that were taken from eight land parcels of forest areas was collected and annotated, and then further divided into training and testing datasets. The novelty of this system is the optimal integration of the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) mechanism into the base model, which allows the model to effectively segment forest areas regardless of their varying sizes, patterns, and colors. To investigate the impact of SPP on the forest segmentation system, a set of experiments was conducted by integrating several variants of SPP ranging from two to four parallel paths with different combinations of pooling kernel size, placed at the bottleneck layer of the U-Net model. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the SPP module in improving the performance of the forest segmentation system by 2.57%, 6.74%, and 7.75% in accuracy (acc), intersection over union (IoU), and F1-score (F1score), respectively. The best SPP variant consists of four parallel paths with a combination of pooling kernel sizes of 2x2, 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 pixels that produced the highest acc, IoU, and F1score of 86.71%, 75.59%, and 82.88%, respectively. As a result, the multi-scale module improved the proposed forest segmentation system, making it a highly useful system for government and private agencies in tracking any changes in forest areas.

TI  - Toward 30 m Fine-Resolution Land Surface Phenology Mapping at a Large Scale Using Spatiotemporal Fusion of MODIS and Landsat Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved land surface phenology (LSP) is a first-order control on terrestrial ecosystem productivity, which is critical for monitoring the ecological environment and human and social sustainable development. However, mapping large-scale LSP at a 30 m resolution remains challenging due to the lack of dense time series images with a fine resolution and the difficulty in processing large volumes of data. In this paper, we proposed a framework to extract fine-resolution LSP across the conterminous United States using the supercomputer Tianhe-2. The proposed framework comprised two steps: (1) generation of the dense two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) time series with a fine resolution via the spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat images using ESTARFM, and (2) extraction of the long-term and fine-resolution LSP using the fused EVI2 dataset. We obtained six methods (i.e., AT, FOD, SOD, RCR, TOD and CCR) of fine-resolution LSP with the proposed framework, and evaluated its performance at both the site and regional scales. Comparing with PhenoCam-observed phenology, the start of season (SOS) derived from the fusion data using six methods of AT, FOD, SOD, RCR, TOD and CCR obtained r values of 0.43, 0.44, 0.41, 0.29, 0.46 and 0.52, respectively, and RMSE values of 30.9, 28.9, 32.2, 37.9, 37.8 and 33.2, respectively. The satellite-retrieved end of season (EOS) using six methods of AT, FOD, SOD, RCR, TOD and CCR obtained r values of 0.68, 0.58, 0.68, 0.73, 0.65 and 0.56, respectively, and RMSE values of 51.1, 53.6, 50.5, 44.9, 51.8 and 54.6, respectively. Comparing with the MCD12Q2 phenology, the satellite-retrieved 30 m fine-resolution LSP of the proposed framework can obtain more information on the land surface, such as rivers, ridges and valleys, which is valuable for phenology-related studies. The proposed framework can yield robust fine-resolution LSP at a large-scale, and the results have great potential for application into studies addressing problems in the ecological environmental at a large scale.

TI  - Modeling Carbon Emissions of Post-Selective Logging in the Production Forests of Ulu Jelai, Pahang, Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Harvested timber and constructed infrastructure over the logging area leave massive damage that contributes to the emission of anthropogenic gases into the atmosphere. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation are the second largest source of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Even though the emissions vary from region to region, a significant amount of carbon emissions comes mostly from timber harvesting, which is tightly linked to the selective logging intensity. This study intended to utilize a remote sensing approach to quantify carbon emissions from selective logging activities in Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia. To quantify the emissions, the relevant variables from the logging's impact were identified as a predictor in the model development and were listed as stump height, stump diameter, cross-sectional area, timber volume, logging gaps, road, skid trails, and incidental damage resulting from the logging process. The predictive performance of linear regression and machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and K-nearest neighbor, were examined to assess the carbon emission from this degraded forest. To test the different methods, a combination of ground inventory plots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and satellite imagery were analyzed, and the performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and coefficient of correlation (R-2) were calculated. Among the four models tested, the machine learning model SVM provided the best accuracy with an RMSE of 21.10% and a bias of 0.23% with an adjusted R-2 of 0.80. Meanwhile, the linear model performed second with an RMSE of 22.14%, a bias of 0.72%, and an adjusted R-2 of 0.75. This study demonstrates the efficacy of remotely sensed data to facilitate the conventional methods of quantifying carbon emissions from selective logging and promoting advanced assessments that are more effective, especially in massive logging areas and various forest conditions. Findings from this research will be useful in assisting the relevant authorities in optimizing logging practices to sustain forest carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Nano-Encapsulated Antioxidant: Retinoic Acid as a Natural Mucosal Adjuvant for Intranasal Immunization against Chronic Experimental Toxoplasmosis
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tight relationship between immunity and retinoid levels provides evidence on the critical role of retinoic acid (RA) in regulating immune activity, especially the mucosal one. Mucosal immune response is the key for determination of the outcome of infection, particularly against intracellular mucosal pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii, where it plays a crucial role as a sentinel against parasite invasion. Herein, the immunomodulatory adjuvant role of RA was evaluated for prophylactic vaccination against chronic Toxoplasma infection. A quantity of 15 mu g of RA pre-encapsulated with lipid-based nanoparticles (SLNs) was intranasally used in three doses, two weeks apart, as an adjuvant to the Toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA). Afterward, mice were infected with 20 cysts of T. gondii (ME49 strain) and were sacrificed at the 4th week post-infection. Parasitological, immunological, biochemical, and histopathological studies were applied as vaccine efficacy measures. The protective role of the tested vaccine was noted using the statistically marked reduction in brain cyst count, accompanied by remarkable levels of protective IFN-gamma and antibodies, with amelioration of infection-induced oxidative stress and brain pathology. Ultimately, this experiment outlined the prospective role of a novel, natural, nano-encapsulated and mucosal vaccine adjuvant RA-SLNs as a propitious candidate against chronic toxoplasmosis.

TI  - Use of Satellite Images to Determine the Temperature of Urban Surfaces for Landscape Management Purposes, Case Study Bratislava (Slovak Republic)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution deals with the use of data obtained from Landsat 8 satellite imaging to identify surface temperature variability in the example of the city of Bratislava, with an emphasis on identifying hotspots outside the built-up area, for example, on agricultural land-locations which are part of the European Network of Protected Areas. Surface temperature variability is presented in two time periods, on the daytime image taken on 26 July 2021 and on the nighttime image from 28 June 2021. Surface temperature is projected in a profile cut of the area. It vertically illustrates the temperatures of individual types of surfaces. Surfaces are classified by Urban Atlas classes. Areas reflecting the spatial distribution of the residential development in the city of Bratislava have been identified by satellite images in the studied area, and they represent a phenomenon of the urban heat island. Such areas were also identified outside the built-up area, in agricultural areas. The results of our research show that it is important to deal with UHI outside the built-up areas of cities and to orient the attention the territory planning and also to the proposal of measures for the management of these areas. Especially if these areas also include territories of the European system of protected areas, as it is in the case of Bratislava city (e.g., SPA029 Syslovske polia). The results of reducing the impacts of climate change in cities concern not only the residents. In spatial planning, it is also necessary to address the management of non-built-up areas-localities with a quasi-natural character (e.g., areas with diverse vegetation cover). In order to recognize UHI within residential areas, it is essential to identify areas with significant differences between daytime and nighttime surface temperatures. Large differences between night and daytime surface temperatures can be seen in areas outside the built-up area in Bratislava on arable land where the difference is up to 8.0 degrees C (in the continuous housing class where the proportion of impermeable surfaces is higher than 80% with a temperature difference of 7.6 degrees C). Identification of overheated surfaces in the territory makes an important basis for modification of the landscape management and management of nature protection areas. It is important to propose measures related to the reduction in the negative impacts of climate change on the landscape and biodiversity.

TI  - Surface ALbedo VALidation (SALVAL) Platform: Towards CEOS LPV Validation Stage 4-Application to Three Global Albedo Climate Data Records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Surface ALbedo VALidation (SALVAL) online platform is designed to allow producers of satellite-based albedo products to move to operational validation systems. The SALVAL tool integrates long-term satellite products, global in situ datasets, and community-agreed-upon validation protocols into an online and interactive platform. The SALVAL tool, available on the ESA Cal/Val portal, was developed by EOLAB under the framework outlined by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) Land Product Validation (LPV) subgroup, and provides transparency, consistency, and traceability to the validation process. In this demonstration, three satellite-based albedo climate data records from different operational services were validated and intercompared using the SALVAL platform: (1) the Climate Change Service (C3S) multi-sensor product, (2) the NASA MODIS MCD43A3 product (C6.1) and (3) Beijing Normal University's Global LAnd Surface Satellites (GLASS) version 4 products. This work demonstrates that the three satellite albedo datasets enable long-term reliable and consistent retrievals at the global scale, with some discrepancies between them associated with the retrieval processing chain. The three satellite albedo products show similar uncertainties (RMSD = 0.03) when comparing the best quality retrievals with ground measurements. The SALVAL platform has proven to be a useful tool to validate and intercompare albedo datasets, allowing them to reach stage 4 of the CEOS LPV validation hierarchy.

TI  - CANTO-RT: One of the Largest Prospective Multicenter Cohort of Early Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Radiotherapy including Full DICOM RT Data
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the corner stones of the local treatment of breast cancer (BC). Toxicity factors related to RT and their consequences are poorly known because of limited DICOM data and limited analyses on contouring, dose distribution and the RT technique. This manuscript describes the methodology used and provides the first characterization of the study population and RT data in CANTO-RT (CANcer TOxicities RadioTherapy). To our knowledge, our study is the largest available multicenter prospective multicenter cohort of early breast cancer with full DICOM RT data (files (CT, RT Structure, RT Dose, RT Plan)). This study answers to a concern about toxicity factors related to radiotherapy and their consequences and aims to identify predictors of development and the persistence of long-term toxicities in breast cancer patients. Further long-term projects (heart, lung, skin, fatigue) and follow up is ongoing. This article describes the methodology used and provides a characterization of the study population in CANTO-RT (CANcer TOxicities RadioTherapy). CANTO (NCT01993498) is a prospective clinical cohort study including patients with stage I-III BC from 26 French cancer centers. Patients matching all CANTO inclusion and exclusion criteria who received RT in one of the 10 top recruiting CANTO centers were selected. Individual full DICOM RT files were collected, pseudo-anonymized, structured and analyzed on the CANTO-RT/UNITRAD web platform. CANTO-RT included 3875 BC patients with a median follow-up of 64 months. Among the 3797 patients with unilateral RT, 3065 (80.4%) had breast-conserving surgery, and 2712 (71.5%) had sentinel node surgery. Tumor bed boost was delivered in 2658 patients (68.5%) and lymph node RT in 1356 patients (35%), including internal mammary chain in 844 patients (21.8%). Most patients (3691 (95.3%)) were treated with 3D conformal RT. Target volumes, organs at risk contours and dose/volume histograms were extracted after quality-control procedures. CANTO-RT is one of the largest early BC prospective cohorts with full individual clinical, biological, imaging and DICOM RT data available. It is a valuable resource for the identification and validation of clinical and dosimetric predictive factors of RT and multimodal treatment-related toxicities.

TI  - Acute arterial occlusive disease due to tumor thrombus from lung metastasis of breast cancer with cartilaginous and osseous metaplasia: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTumor embolization due to venous infiltration of breast cancer pulmonary metastases is very rare.Case presentationA 72-year-old female was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was discontinued because of progressive disease, and a right mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. The pathological analysis of surgical specimens revealed carcinoma with cartilaginous and/or osseous metaplasia. At 22 months after surgery, lung metastasis was observed, and 6 months after initiating treatment for lung metastases, she complained of sudden numbness in the left-lower limb with trouble walking. Ultrasonography showed an embolism in the left popliteal artery, and contrast computed tomography showed enlarged lung metastases and infiltration of the left-upper lobe disease into the left superior pulmonary vein and left atrium. Acute arterial occlusive disease in the left-lower limb caused by the tumor embolism was suspected, so an endovascular thrombectomy was performed. Tumor emboli were removed by embolectomy catheter.ConclusionThis report of lung metastasis from breast cancer with cartilaginous and/or osseous metaplasia and acute lower-limb artery occlusion due to a tumor thrombus adds useful information to the literature on these extremely rare cases.

TI  - Landslides Detection and Mapping with an Advanced Multi-Temporal Satellite Optical Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are catastrophic natural phenomena occurring as a consequence of climatic, tectonic, and human activities, sometimes combined among them. Mostly due to climate change effects, the frequency of occurrence of these events has quickly grown in recent years, with a consequent increase in related damage, both in terms of loss of human life and effects on the involved infrastructures. Therefore, implementing properly actions to mitigate consequences from slope instability is fundamental to reduce their impact on society. Satellite systems, thanks to the advantages offered by their global view and sampling repetition capability, have proven to be valid tools to be used for these activities in addition to traditional techniques based on in situ measurements. In this work, we propose an advanced multitemporal technique aimed at identifying and mapping landslides using satellite-derived land cover information. Data acquired by the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) sensor aboard the Copernicus Sentinel-2 platforms were used to investigate a landslide affecting Pomarico city (southern Italy) in January 2019. Results achieved indicate the capability of the proposed methodology in identifying, with a good trade-off between reliability and sensitivity, the area affected by the landslide not just immediately after the event, but also a few months later. The technique was implemented within the Google Earth Engine Platform, so that it is completely automatic and could be applied everywhere. Therefore, its potential for supporting mitigation activities of landslide risks is evident.

AB  - Satya ED, Sabdono A, Wijayanti DP, Helmi M, Widiaratih R. Suryoputro, AAD, Handoyo, G, Puryajati, AD. 2023. Mapping coral cover using Sentinel-2A in Karimunjawa, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 24: 827-836. Coral reefs in the Karimunjawa National Park (KNP) have their own charm, especially for snorkeling and divers, it can be seen from the number of tourist visits which tends to increase every year, except for 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the impact of tourism on coral reef cover in KNP, with islands selected as representatives of high, medium and low level of tourist visits using Sentinel-2A. Comparison of Sentinel-2A coral cover area in 2020 with previous research which used Landsat 8 data in 2018 showed decrease in coral cover area by 16.5% and an increase in sand area by 24.1% for island of high tourist visits. It can be seen that tourism activities have significant impact on coral cover area, especially snorkeling and diving activities that are intentional or not potentially damaging to coral reefs. Sentinel-2A's ability to detect coral area is reliable, since field data is needed as input for data processing to identification locations in detail as needed. Coral area in 2020 using Sentinel-2A obtained for Menjangan Besar Island and Menjangan Kecil, Sintok Island, Tengah Island and Seruni Island were 1.88 km2, 0.303 km2, 0.318 km2, 0.237 km2 respectively.

TI  - Immune-Activated B Cells Are Dominant in Prostate Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Contrary to the common belief that prostate cancer is an immune desert, our study shows tumor-associated B-cell responses in prostate cancer. We demonstrate mature and activated phenotypes of B cells with an increased frequency of effector plasmablasts in tumor-draining sentinel lymph nodes. These findings indicate a B-cell-specific antitumor immune response, emphasizing the importance of further trials targeting B cells in prostate cancer immunotherapy. B cells are multifaceted immune cells responding robustly during immune surveillance against tumor antigens by presentation to T cells and switched immunoglobulin production. However, B cells are unstudied in prostate cancer (PCa). We used flow cytometry to analyze B-cell subpopulations in peripheral blood and lymph nodes from intermediate-high risk PCa patients. B-cell subpopulations were related to clinicopathological factors. B-cell-receptor single-cell sequencing and VDJ analysis identified clonal B-cell expansion in blood and lymph nodes. Pathological staging was pT2 in 16%, pT3a in 48%, and pT3b in 36%. Lymph node metastases occurred in 5/25 patients (20%). Compared to healthy donors, the peripheral blood CD19(+) B-cell compartment was significantly decreased in PCa patients and dominated by naive B cells. The nodal B-cell compartment had significantly increased fractions of CD19(+) B cells and switched memory B cells. Plasmablasts were observed in tumor-draining sentinel lymph nodes (SNs). VDJ analysis revealed clonal expansion in lymph nodes. Thus, activated B cells are increased in SNs from PCa patients. The increased fraction of switched memory cells and plasmablasts together with the presence of clonally expanded B cells indicate tumor-specific T-cell-dependent responses from B cells, supporting an important role for B cells in the protection against tumors.

TI  - Meathead materialisms: Cesar Aira's ANTsy fictions of a world without conviction
T2  - TEXTUAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay considers several tendencies that have come to define the renewed concern with matter, assemblages, and objects associated with the new materialisms. Drawing on Bruno Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT), postcritics and new formalists link the effort to revitalise and rethink the methods and aims of literary criticism to these concerns, while alerting us to the unique agency of artworks. The result is not just an idiosyncratic view of literature or of its relationship to society, but rather a peculiar vision of the world in which the notion that we can convince others or that we ourselves can be convinced holds no water. Perhaps no living writer provides a clearer picture of what it might mean to fully embrace this postcritical view of the world than Cesar Aira. This is especially true for his novella La villa (Shantytown), which, in telling the story of how Maxi - a 'meathead' and 'brainless hulk' - becomes a 'legend' among the poor, presents a world saturated with the networked agency of human and nonhuman actors alike. Drawing our attention to the aesthetic and political limits of such a worldview, Aira's ANTsy fictions illustrate how the new materialist emphasis on description, immediacy, and the spontaneous not only alters literary criticism's more foundational concepts - text, reading, interpretation, and critique - but also, and more crucially, entails a disavowal of conviction. This essay explores what this disavowal means for Aira's entire approach to fiction, and what, in turn, it ought to mean for the future of literary studies itself..

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-1 SAR to Assess Damage in Drought-Affected Temperate Deciduous Broadleaf Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding forest decline under drought pressure is receiving research attention due to the increasing frequency of large-scale heat waves and massive tree mortality events. However, since assessing mortality on the ground is challenging and costly, this study explores the capability of satellite-borne Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band radar data for monitoring drought-induced tree canopy damage. As droughts cause water deficits in trees and eventually lead to early foliage loss, the S-1 radiometric signal and polarimetric indices are tested regarding their sensitivities to these effects, exemplified in a deciduous broadleaf forest. Due to the scattered nature of mortality in the study site, we employed a temporal-only time series filtering scheme that provides very high spatial resolution (10 m x 10 m) for measuring at the scale of single trees. Finally, the anomaly between heavily damaged and non-damaged tree canopy samples (n = 146 per class) was used to quantify the level of damage. With a maximum anomaly of -0.50 dB +/- 1.38 for S-1 Span (VV+VH), a significant decline in hydrostructural scattering (moisture and geometry of scatterers as seen by SAR) was found in the second year after drought onset. By contrast, S-1 polarimetric indices (cross-ratio, RVI, H alpha) showed limited capability in detecting drought effects. From our time series evaluation, we infer that damaged canopies exhibit both lower leaf-on and leaf-off backscatters compared to unaffected canopies. We further introduce an NDVI/Span hysteresis showing a lagged signal anomaly of Span behind NDVI (by ca. one year). This time-lagged correlation implies that SAR is able to add complementary information to optical remote sensing data for detecting drought damage due to its sensitivity to physiological and hydraulic tree canopy damage. Our study lays out the promising potential of SAR remote sensing information for drought impact assessment in deciduous broadleaf forests.

TI  - C-Reactive Protein and Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio Predict Recurrence in Stage III Melanoma Patients with Microscopic Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Indicators of a potential recurrence of melanoma in patients after the detection of lymph node metastasis are needed in order to not treat patients unnecessarily with a systemic therapy. Blood parameters such as the number of white blood cells and ratios of different white blood cell subtypes are collected in the clinical routine and could be useful indicators of a possible disease relapse. The aim of our present study was to identify blood parameters which predict the recurrence of melanoma in melanoma patients with microscopic sentinel lymph node metastasis. We identified the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to be the strongest predictors for melanoma recurrence. Although adjuvant therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and BRAF/MEK inhibitors improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) in stage III melanoma patients significantly, prognostic factors are needed to identify patients with a high risk of disease recurrence. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the prognostic potential of routinely collected blood parameters for stage III melanoma patients with microscopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. Altogether, we retrospectively analyzed 138 stage III melanoma patients who were diagnosed with microscopic SLN metastasis at the skin cancer center of the University Hospital Cologne between 2011 and 2020 and who did not receive prior adjuvant therapy with ICI or BRAF/MEK-inhibitors. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess the impact of preoperatively collected blood parameters and blood ratios on recurrence-free survival (RFS; primary endpoint) and overall survival (OS). A high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), low lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and high C-reactive protein (CRP) value were significantly associated with shorter RFS in multivariate analysis. For LMR (cut-off 3.5) and for CRP (cut-off 3.0) this effect remained after dichotomization. CRP showed a stronger association with RFS than NLR or LMR, with the highest association being detected for the combination of low LMR and high CRP. Additionally, derived NLR >= 2.0 was significantly associated with shorter OS in multivariate analysis. In summary, our data suggest that CRP in combination with LMR should be considered as a marker for melanoma recurrence in stage III melanoma patients with microscopic SLN metastasis.

TI  - Optimal Sample Size and Composition for Crop Classification with Sen2-Agri's Random Forest Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sen2-Agri is a software system that was developed to facilitate the use of multi-temporal satellite data for crop classification with a random forest (RF) classifier in an operational setting. It automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and LandSat 8 images. Our goal was to provide practitioners with recommendations for the best sample size and composition. The study area was located in the Yaqui Valley in Mexico. Using polygons of more than 6000 labeled crop fields, we prepared data sets for training, in which the nine crops had an equal or proportional representation, called Equal or Ratio, respectively. Increasing the size of the training set improved the overall accuracy (OA). Gains became marginal once the total number of fields approximated 500 or 40 to 45 fields per crop type. Equal achieved slightly higher OAs than Ratio for a given number of fields. However, recall and F-scores of the individual crops tended to be higher for Ratio than for Equal. The high number of wheat fields in the Ratio scenarios, ranging from 275 to 2128, produced a more accurate classification of wheat than the maximal 80 fields of Equal. This resulted in a higher recall for wheat in the Ratio than in the Equal scenarios, which in turn limited the errors of commission of the non-wheat crops. Thus, a proportional representation of the crops in the training data is preferable and yields better accuracies, even for the minority crops.

TI  - First Results on the Systematic Search of Land Surface Temperature Anomalies as Earthquakes Precursors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year, earthquakes cause thousands of casualties and high economic losses. For example, in the time frame from 1998 to 2018, the total number of casualties due to earthquakes was larger than 846 thousand people, and the recorded economic losses were about USD 661 billion. At present, there are no earthquake precursors that can be used to trigger a warning. However, some studies have analyzed land surface temperature (LST) anomalies as a potential earthquake precursor. In this study, a large database of global LST data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and AQUA satellites during the whole year 2020 has been used to study the LST anomalies in the areas affected by earthquakes. A total of 1350 earthquakes with a magnitude larger than M4 were analyzed. Two methods widely used in the literature have been used to detect LST anomalies in the detrended LST time series: the interquartile (IQT) method and the standard deviation (STD). To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that the confusion matrix (CM), the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and some other figures of merit (FoM) are used to assess and optimize the performance of the methods, and to select the optimum combination that could be used as a proxy for their occurrence. A positive anomaly was found a few days before the studied earthquakes, followed by the LST decrease after the event. Further studies over larger regions and more extended periods will be needed to consolidate these encouraging results.

TI  - Assessing Phenological Shifts of Deciduous Forests in Turkey under Climate Change: An Assessment for <i>Fagus orientalis</i> with Daily MODIS Data for 19 Years
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how natural ecosystems are and will be responding to climate change is one of the primary goals of ecological research. Plant phenology is accepted as one of the most sensitive bioindicators of climate change due to its strong interactions with climate dynamics, and a vast number of studies from all around the world present evidence considering phenological shifts as a response to climatic changes. Land surface phenology (LSP) is also a valuable tool in the absence of observational phenology data for monitoring the aforementioned shift responses. Our aim was to investigate the phenological shifts of Fagus orientalis forests in Turkey by means of daily MODIS surface reflectance data (MOD09GA) for the period between 2002 and 2020. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated for the entire Turkey extent. This extent was then masked for F. orientalis. These "Fagus pixels" were then filtered by a minimum of 80% spatial and an annual 20% temporal coverage. A combination of two methods was applied to the time series for smoothing and reconstruction and the start of season (SOS), end of season, and length of season parameters were extracted. Trends in these parameters over the 19-year period were analyzed. The results were in concert with the commonly reported earlier SOS pattern, by a Sen's slope of -0.8 days year(-1). Lastly, the relationships between SOS and mean, maximum and minimum temperature, growing degree days (GDD), and chilling hours (CH) were investigated. Results showed that the most significant correlations were found between the mean SOS trend and accumulated CH and accumulated GDD with a base temperature of 2 degrees C, both for the February-March interval. The immediate need for a phenological observation network in Turkey and its region is discussed.

TI  - Mapping 21st Century Global Coastal Land Reclamation
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing population size and economic dependence on the coastal zone, coupled with the growing need for residential, agricultural, industrial, commercial and green space infrastructure, are key drivers of land reclamation. Until now, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the global distribution of land use on reclaimed space at the coast. Here, we analyze Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020 to quantify the spatial extent, scale, and land use of urban coastal reclamation for 135 cities with populations in excess of 1 million. Findings indicate that 78% (106/135) of these major coastal cities have resorted to reclamation as a source of new ground, contributing a total 253,000 ha of additional land to the Earth's surface in the 21st century, equivalent to an area the size of Luxembourg. Reclamation is especially prominent in East Asia, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, followed by Western Europe and West Africa. The most common land uses on reclaimed spaces are port extension (> 70 cities), followed by residential/commercial (30 cities) and industrial (19 cities). While increased global trade and the rapid urbanization have driven these uses, we argue that a city's prestigious place-making effort to gain global reputation is emerging as another major driver underlying recent reclamation projects to create tourist and green spaces Meanwhile, the study suggests that 70% of recent reclamation has occurred in areas identified as potentially exposed to extreme sea level rise (SLR) by 2100 and this presents a significant challenge to sustainable development at the coast.Plain Language Summary Coastal regions face enormous pressure from growing human footprints, especially given the current rates of sea-level rise. It is now recognized that seawards extension of the land through land reclamation and infrastructure development, at least partly in response to increased vulnerability induced by extreme storm surge events, is also a feature of recent coastal dynamics, especially in the world's coastal megacities Despite its growing global importance and reach worldwide, coastal reclamation is regarded as a local issue. Subsequently, the scale, intensity, and justification are not globally known, rather they are documented through localized case studies. By leveraging advanced satellite and cloud computing technology, this study aims to map the global state of 21st coastal land reclamation and to highlight the risk of such an anthropogenic footprint at the coast in the era of SLR.

TI  - Rainfall and Convection in ERA5 and MERRA-2 over the Northern Equatorial Western Pacific during PISTON
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates rainfall, cloudiness, and related fields in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts fifth-generation climate reanalysis (ERA5) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), gridded global reanalysis products against observations from the Office of Naval Research's Propagation of Intraseasonal Tropical Oscillations (PISTON) field campaign. We focus on the first PISTON cruise, which took place from August to October 2018 in the northern equatorial western Pacific Ocean. We find biases in the mean surface heat and radiative fluxes consistent with observed biases in high and low cloud fraction and convective activity in the reanalyses. Biases in the high, middle, and low cloud fraction are also consistent with the biases in the thermodynamic profiles, with positive biases in upper-level humidity associated with excessive high cloud in both products, whereas negative biases in humidity above the boundary layer are associated with too few low and middle clouds and increased static stability. ERA5 exhibits a profile that is more top-heavy than that of MERRA-2 during periods dominated by MCSs and stronger upward motion during rainy periods, consistent with higher total rainfall in this product during PISTON. The coarser grid size in MERRA-2 relative to ERA5 and the fact that MERRA-2 did not assimilate PISTON data likely both contribute to the overall larger biases seen in MERRA-2. The observed biases in the reanalyses during PISTON have also been seen in comparisons of these products with satellite data, suggesting that the results of this study are more broadly applicable.

TI  - Ensemble Machine Learning for Mapping Tree Species Alpha-Diversity Using Multi-Source Satellite Data in an Ecuadorian Seasonally Dry Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased variety of satellite remote sensing platforms creates opportunities for estimating tropical forest diversity needed for environmental decision-making. As little as 10% of the original seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remains for Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. Remnant forests show high rates of species endemism, but experience degradation from climate change, wood-cutting, and livestock-grazing. Forest census data provide a vital resource for examining remote sensing methods to estimate diversity levels. We used spatially referenced trees >= 5 cm in diameter and simulated 0.10 ha plots measured from a 9 ha SDTF in southwestern Ecuador to compare machine learning (ML) models for six alpha-diversity indices. We developed 1 m tree canopy height and elevation models from stem mapped trees, at a scale conventionally derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We then used an ensemble ML approach comparing single-and combined-sensor models from RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and interpolated canopy height and topography surfaces. Validation data showed that combined models often outperformed single-sensor approaches. Combined sensor and model ensembles for tree species richness, Shannon's H, inverse Simpson's, unbiased Simpson's, and Fisher's alpha indices typically showed lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and increased goodness of fit (R-2). Pielou's J, a measure of evenness, was poorly predicted. Mapped tree species richness (R2 = 0.54, F = 27.3, p = < 0.001) and Shannon's H' (R-2 = 0.54, F = 26.9, p = < 0.001) showed the most favorable agreement with field validation observations (n = 25). Small-scale model experiments revealed essential relationships between dry forest tree diversity and data from multiple satellite sensors with repeated global coverage that can help guide larger-scale biodiversity mapping efforts.

TI  - Integrated Approach for Landslide Risk Assessment Using Geoinformation Tools and Field Data in Hindukush Mountain Ranges, Northern Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most recurring and damaging natural hazards worldwide, with rising impacts on communities, infrastructure, and the environment. Landslide hazard, vulnerability, and risk assessments are critical for landslide mitigation, land use and developmental planning. They are, however, often lacking in complex and data-poor regions. This study proposes an integrated approach to evaluate landslide hazard, vulnerability, and risk using a range of freely available geospatial data and semi-quantitative techniques for one of the most landslide-prone areas in the Hindukush mountain ranges of northern Pakistan. Very high-resolution satellite images and their spectral characteristics are utilized to develop a comprehensive landslide inventory and predisposing factors using bi-variate models to develop a landslide susceptibility map. This is subsequently integrated with landslide-triggering factors to derive a Landslide Hazard Index map. A geospatial database of the element-at-risk data is developed from the acquired remote sensing data and extensive field surveys. It contains the building's footprints, accompanied by typological data, road network, population, and land cover. Subsequently, it is analyzed using a spatial multi-criteria evaluation technique for vulnerability assessment and further applied in a semi-quantitative technique for risk assessment in relative risk classes. The landslide risk assessment map is classified into five classes, i.e., very low (18%), low (39.4%), moderate (26.3%), high (13.3%), and very high (3%). The developed landslide risk index map shall assist in highlighting the landslide risk hotspots and their subsequent mitigation and risk reduction.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for Earthquake (EQ) precursors in the ionosphere and atmosphere from satellite data has provided significant information about the upcoming main shock. This study presents the abnormal atmospheric and ionospheric perturbations associated with the M-w 7.2 Haiti EQ on 14 August 2021 at geographical coordinates (18 degrees N, 73 degrees W) and shallow hypocentral depth of 10 km from the data of permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations near the epicenter, followed by Swarm satellites data. The total vertical electron (VTEC) anomalies occur within a 5-day window before the main shock in the analysis of nearby operation stations, followed by Swarm (A and C satellites) ionospheric anomalies in the same 5-day window before the main shock. Moreover, the geomagnetic activities are completely quiet within 10 days before and 10 days after the main shock. Similarly, the atmospheric parameters endorse the EQ anomalies within 5 days before the main shock day. The evolution of gases from the lithosphere at the epicentral region possessed significant atmospheric and ionospheric perturbations within the EQ preparation period of 5-day before the main shock under the hypothesis of Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC).

TI  - Groundwater vulnerability assessment phenomenon using drastic & modified drastic modeling validated with nitrate concentration
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanized areas groundwater vulnerability and contamination are serious issues that require due attention. There are other models, notably the DRASTIC models employed to assess the vulnerability of groundwater. In a modified version of the DRASTIC model known as anthropogenic influence was incorporated into DRASTICA as a model parameter. The research used a cutting-edge methodology to define the anthropogenic employing satellite data of nighttime lighting to have an impact using human settlements as a stand-in and the Palani Taluk's surrounding land use/landcover. The spatial integration of various parameter maps was done using a geographic information system. According to data on groundwater vulnerability to pollution, around 29.98% of the area is in a very high vulnerability zone, followed by 23.68% of area covers high vulnerability, 25.18% comes under the range of moderate vulnerability, 12.14% covers the area in the zones of low vulnerability, and 8.97% area covers the total area in the ranges of very low vulnerability. Utilizing the amount of nitrate in ground water, the findings were confirmed. It was determined that in an urban environment, the suggested DRASTICA model achieved enhanced than the conservative DRASTIC model. The classifications are as follows: extremely high, high, medium, and low. Very high Vulnerability zones account for 214 values in Palani taluk, the research region, whereas very low vulnerability zones account for 3 values in Palani taluk. Urbanization index showed that anthropogenic impact and the depth of the water table had a substantial impact on groundwater susceptibility to contamination, indicating that manmade effect must be carefully taken into consideration in such studies. This study's modified-DRASTIC/DRASTICA model will aid in better classifying groundwater sensitive areas to contamination where manmade pollution is high, especially in and near metropolitan centers. The groundwater susceptibility possible map that is produced can be more successfully used as the main tool for managing, organizing, and safeguarding groundwater resources. Low nitrate concentrations are found in forests and arid terrain, whereas high nitrate values are found in urban areas. The majority of the Palani taluk has low to moderate nitrate concentrations. The Melkaraipatty and Thalaiyuthu Palani Taluk's urban areas are considered by high sensitivity because of low water levels and strong manmade effect.

TI  - Analysis of Groundwater Storage Changes and Influencing Factors in China Based on GRACE Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a primary freshwater resource for human consumption and an essential source for industry and agriculture. Therefore, understanding its spatial and temporal trends and drivers is crucial for governments to take appropriate measures to manage water resources. This paper uses Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) to derive groundwater storage anomalies (GWSAs) and to analyze the spatial and temporal trends of GWSA in different regions of China (Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, North China Plain, South China, and Northeast China). It used groundwater-level observation data to verify the accuracy of GWSA estimates and analyzed the drivers of regional GWSA changes. The results showed that: (1) GWSA in South China increased at a rate of 4.79 mm/a from 2003 to 2016, and GWSA in other regions in China showed a decreasing trend. Among them, the decline rates of GWSA in Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, North China Plain, and Northeast China were -6.24 mm/a, -3.33 mm/a, -3.17 mm/a, -7.35 mm/a, and -0.75 mm/a, respectively. (2) The accuracy of the annual-scale GWSA estimates was improved after deducting gravity losses due to raw coal quality, and the correlation coefficient between GWSA and groundwater levels monitored by observation wells increased. (3) In Xinjiang, the annual water consumed by raw coal mining, industrial, and agricultural activities had a greater impact on GWSA than rainfall and temperature, so these human activities might be the main drivers of the continued GWSA decline in Xinjiang. Water consumption by raw coal mining and industry might be the main drivers of the continued decline in GWSA in Inner Mongolia and the North China Plain. The increase in groundwater storage in South China was mainly due to the recharge of rainfall.

T2  - AEROSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the characteristics of the LEO space particles radiation environment of China's Fengyun No. 3 (FY-3) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, in order to monitor the characteristics, and space-time distribution of charged particle radiation in the orbit space, it is proposed to install a three-directional high-energy particle detector (HEPD) in the three vertical orthogonal directions of FY-3E, so as to carry out the energy spectrum and flux observation of high-energy protons and electrons in the three directions of the satellite, namely, -X, +Y, and -Z. The on-orbit detection data acquired by these payloads can be used for space environment modeling and solar-terrestrial physics research, and provide data sources for operational space environment weather warning and forecasting. Through the ground accelerator calibration experiment and simulation analysis of the three-directional HEPDs developed in the flight model phase, the experimental results show that all the HEPDs' measured values meet the requirements for technical indexes, such as the detection energy range (high-energy protons: 3-300 MeV; high-energy electrons: 0.15-5.7 MeV), energy span accuracy (<15%), flux accuracy (<15%), and sensitivity (<5% (Delta N/N)).

TI  - Research on Bathymetric Inversion Capability of Different Multispectral Remote Sensing Images in Seaports
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing has become an indispensable supplementary method for determining water depth in the seaports. At present, many scholars use multi-spectral satellite data to invert the water depth of the seaports, but how to select the appropriate satellite data in the seaports area is worth exploring. In this article, the differences in the retrieving ability between domestic and foreign multispectral images are compared, through building the random forest model and the band ratio model, which use different multispectral images to conduct retrieving water depth in Nanshan Port in conjunction with the WBMS multi-beam sounding system. The band ratio model and random forest model are chosen for water depth exploration, remote sensing images use GF-6, GF-2, Sentinel-2B, and Landsat 8 OLI data, which are all popular and easily accessible. The final experiment results from the constant adjustment of the model parameter show that the domestic series of GF-6 images performed the best in this experiment. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Relative Error (MRE) of the random forest model are only 1.202 and 0.187, respectively. Simultaneously, it is discovered that the 'Red Edge' band of GF-6 is also very helpful in improving the accuracy of water depth inversion, which is rarely mentioned in previous studies. To some extent, the preceding studies demonstrate that it is possible to investigate water depth using common multispectral remote sensing images. In the case of some bathymetry inversion models or in some waters, the aforementioned study demonstrates that it is possible to examine the water depth using domestic remote sensing images that are superior to foreign multispectral images in terms of bathymetry inversion ability.

TI  - Dust Detection Over East Asia From Multispectral and Multi-Temporal Himawari-8/AHI Thermal Infrared Observations
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequent outbreak of dust storms every spring is one of the extreme weathers in East Asia. Geostationary meteorological satellite thermal infrared (TIR) imagery provides observations for high-frequency, all-day, large-scale monitoring of dust sources and transport. This study proposes an integrated method to detect dust over East Asia by using the multispectral and multi-temporal Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) TIR observations, based on a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model and the Robust Principal Component Analysis based Anomalous Dust Detection (ADD) method. The FNN model is trained to map the multispectral Brightness Temperatures (BTs) to the three category probabilities (i.e., cloud, dust, and clear sky), and the ADD method calculates the dust score by normalizing multi-temporal BT difference anomalous variation. The Integrated Dust Index (IDI) reflects the quantified dust confidence of the AHI pixel, which is defined as the sum of the dust probability and the dust score. The IDI was evaluated using 2 months of the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Ultraviolet Aerosol Index and achieved a total dust detection accuracy above 90%. A comparison with Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation nighttime observations shows that the IDI can also detect dust at night. The times series IDI of the massive 14-16 March 2021 dust storm show its capabilities to trace dust sources and monitor dust transport.

TI  - Climatic and Vegetation Response Patterns over South Africa during the 2010/2011 and 2015/2016 Strong ENSO Phases
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a significant climate phenomenon on Earth due to its ability to change the global atmospheric circulation which influences temperature and precipitation across the globe. In this study, we investigate the responses of climatic and vegetation parameters due to two strong ENSO phases, i.e., La Nina (2010/2011) and El Nino (2015/2016) in South Africa. The study aims to understand the influence of strong seasonal ENSO events on climatic and vegetation parameters over South Africa. Remote sensing data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) was used. The relationship between precipitation, temperature, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were studied using Pearson's correlation. Comparison between the La Nina, neutral year, and El Nino periods showed two interesting results: (1) higher precipitation from the south coast to the east coast of South Africa, with some low precipitation in the interior during the La Nina and El Nino periods, and (2) a drop in precipitation by similar to 46.6% was observed in the southwestern parts of South Africa during the La Nina and El Nino events. The study further showed that wind speed and wind direction were not impacted by strong ENSO events during the MAM, JJA and SON seasons, but the DJF season showed varying wind speeds, especially on the west coast, during both ENSO events. Overall, the Pearson's correlation results clearly showed that the relationship between climatic parameters such as precipitation, temperature, and vegetation parameters such a NDVI is highly correlated while other parameters, such as wind speed and direction, are not. This study has provided new insights into the relationship between temperature, precipitation, and NDVI in South Africa; however, future work will include other climatic and vegetation parameters such as relative humidity and net longwave radiation.

TI  - Mapping Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Forest Disturbances in Vietnam Using a Landsat Temporal Segmentation Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping land use/land cover changes (LULCC) and forest disturbances provides valuable information for understanding the influence of anthropogenic activities on the environment at regional and global scales. Many approaches using satellite remote sensing data have been proposed for characterizing these long-term changes. However, a spatially and temporally consistent mapping of both LULCC and forest disturbances at medium spatial resolution is still limited despite their critical contributions to the carbon cycle. In this study, we examined the applicability of Landsat time series temporal segmentation and random forest classifiers to mapping LULCC and forest disturbances in Vietnam. We used the LandTrendr temporal segmentation algorithm to derive key features of land use/land cover transitions and forest disturbances from annual Landsat time series data. We developed separate random forest models for classifying land use/land cover and detecting forest disturbances at each segment and then derived LULCC and forest disturbances that coincided with each other during the period of 1988-2019. The results showed that both LULCC classification and forest disturbance detection achieved low accuracy in several classes (e.g., producer's and user's accuracies of 23.7% and 78.8%, respectively, for forest disturbance class); however, the level of accuracy was comparable to that of existing datasets using the same reference samples in the study area. We found relatively high confusion between several land use/land cover classes (e.g., grass/shrub, forest, and cropland) that can explain the lower overall accuracies of 67.6% and 68.4% in 1988 and 2019, respectively. The mapping of forest disturbances and LULCC suggested that most forest disturbances were followed by forest recovery, not by transitions to other land use/land cover classes. The landscape complexity and ephemeral forest disturbances contributed to the lower classification and detection accuracies in this study area. Nevertheless, temporal segmentation and derived features from LandTrendr were useful for the consistent mapping of LULCC and forest disturbances. We recommend that future studies focus on improving the accuracy of forest disturbance detection, especially in areas with subtle landscape changes, as well as land use/land cover classification in ambiguous and complex landscapes. Using more training samples and effective variables would potentially improve the classification and detection accuracies.

TI  - Confessional language personality and its representational aspects in Old Believer domestic manuscripts
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The research aims to prove the validity of studying the confessional language personality (LP) by domestic written monuments and to identify the representational aspects and means of the Old Believers' worldview. The research material is original texts of two diaries (1915-1923 and 1956-1975) and personal notes (1940-1980) written by the Old Believers' community members living in the north of Tomsk Oblast. The total lexical volume of these sources is about 15 thousand word usages. The analysis is based on the sociolinguistic portraiture method, which involves describing linguistic facts reflected in texts of different levels (graphics, vocabulary, grammar, etc.) and the authors' personal qualities indicating their religious attitudes. We first examine LPs recognized a priori as confessional, then texts in search for information verifying the hypothesis of analysis in them. This analysis is based on Yuri Karaulov's idea of the three-level LP structure, as well as the experience of describing individual religious LPs presented in linguistic works by Tolstova (2007), Chikovani (2016), Plotnikova (2021). We revealed all the features identifying this confessional community: marginality, insularity, heightened selfconsciousness, self-sufficiency, traditionalism, eschatology. These features are related to each other. All of them are manifested textually by different means: special lexical items, grammatical forms, graphics, descriptions of people of one's circle and their activities in the coordinates of natural time and reclaimed areas, or by a hidden polemic suggesting the reflection of only positive aspects of being in this description. The markers of Old Believers' LP at the verbal(grammatical)-semantic level are lexical items with a confessional meaning (Isus, Rozhestvo, bratets, otche), a wide variation due to bookish and written linguistic means ( noshch', ezero, glagolit', desnitsa, sil'nAGO, vtorYY), mastery of the semi-uncial writing norms. The traditional values of the Old Believer world ( LP's cognitive level) manifested in records include the affirmation of the equality of all community members; family-like closeness of like-minded people; the recognition of authorities only in terms of spirituality (otche godfather); the high significance of labor, books, sacred texts; the realized need for strict adherence to all religious canons ( for example, the admissibility of only passive hunting, voluntary assumption of functions of community chroniclers). In our opinion, the tasks of preserving the Old Believers' sacred space that express the writers' interests and goals reflected in the records constitute the pragmatic (motivational) level of the confessional LP. Although we revealed the three-level structure mainly on the material of two specific confessional LPs, there are reasons to correlate the identified features with the generalized Old Believer's LP.

TI  - Aboveground Forest Biomass Estimation by the Integration of TLS and ALOS PALSAR Data Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest inventory parameters play an important role in understanding various biophysical processes of forest ecosystems. The present study aims at integrating Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and ALOS PALSAR L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to assess Aboveground Biomass (AGB) in the Barkot Forest Range, Uttarakhand, India. The integration was performed to overcome the AGB saturation issue in ALOS PALSAR L-band SAR data for the high biomass density forest of the study area using 13 plots. Various parameters, namely, Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures, Yamaguchi decomposition components, polarimetric parameters, and backscatter values of HH and HV band intensity, were derived from the ALOS SAR data. However, TLS was used to obtain the diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height for the sample plots. A total of 23 parameters was retrieved using TLS and SAR data for integration with the LiDAR footprint. The integration was performed using Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The statistical measures for RF were found to be promising compared with ANN for AGB estimation. The R-2 value obtained for the RF was 0.94, with an RMSE of 59.72 ton ha(-1) for the predicted biomass value. The RMSE% was 15.92, while the RMSECV was 0.15. The R-2 value for ANN was 0.77, with an RMSE of 98.46 ton ha(-1). The RMSE% was 26.0, while the RMSECV was 0.26. RF performed better in estimating the biomass, which ranged from 122.46 to 581.89 ton ha(-1), while uncertainty ranged from 15.75 to 85.14 ton ha(-1). The integration of SAR and LiDAR data using machine learning shows great potential in overcoming AGB saturation of SAR data.

TI  - Evolution of Iceberg A68 since Its Inception from the Collapse of Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research focuses on the evolution of the largest iceberg A68 and analyzes the trajectory using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The monitoring began when A68 calved Larsen C Ice shelf on 12 July 2017, and ended on 1 February 2021. A total of 47 images were analyzed and studied to ascertain the changes in the area, trajectory and the factors that might have influenced said changes. The big size of the iceberg caught the scientific community's attention when it started moving towards South Georgia Island, a habitat of penguins and seals. The pattern of decrease and increase in the iceberg's size was analyzed and compared with the surrounding sea ice extent to account for longitudinal stretching and shrinkage. Iceberg's trajectory was also studied to take into account the underlying seabed and ice rises, and their implication on A68's maneuverability, giving rise to unique motions in the coastal regime. Two subsequent calving events in the iceberg were distinctly observed in March 2019 and April 2020. Since its inception up to December 2019, its drift was fairly gradual, with the pick up in pace observed upon its entry into open waters and departure from the peninsular region. The decrease in size was also fairly gradual with only two main calving events, as mentioned above. The cold water and sea ice surrounding the iceberg potentially helped maintain a steady state. Post its sojourn into the Southern Ocean, major calving began in December 2020 and continued through January 2021. This study explores the potential of SAR remote sensing in iceberg monitoring and tracking.

TI  - An Unsupervised Burned Area Mapping Approach Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and severity of large, destructive fires have increased in the recent past, with extended impacts on the landscape, the human population, and ecosystems. Earth observations provide a means for the frequent, wide coverage and accurate monitoring of fire impacts. This study describes an unsupervised approach for the mapping of burned areas from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, which is based on multispectral thresholding, and introduces an adaptive thresholding method. It takes into account the localized variability of the spectral responses in a two-phase approach. The first phase detects areas that are burned with a high probability, while the second phase adaptively adjusts this preliminary mapping by expanding and refining its boundaries. The resulting classification contains two main classes of interest: burned and unburned. The latter is further classified into four (4) fire impact severity classes, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) and the NASA United States Geological Survey (USGS)'s widely acknowledged nomenclature examples. Three distinct wildfire events are assessed, which occurred during the summers of 2020 and 2021 in Greece and Portugal. The classification accuracy is calculated by juxtaposing the classification outputs to burned area validation maps created through the photointerpretation of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. The corresponding CEMS On-Demand Mapping products are also juxtaposed against the validation maps for comparison purposes. The accuracy assessment showcases that the unsupervised approach closely follows the capacity provided by the CEMS maps (e.g., the kappa coefficient-k-of the proposed unsupervised approach is 0.91, 0.83 and 0.83 for the events processed, while the CEMS products achieve a k of 0.94, 0.93 and 0.8, respectively). The proposed approach considers the variability of the affected areas' spectral response; thus, it generalizes well to different areas, e.g., areas characterized by different land cover types. It seems to offer an effective means of mapping the wildfire-induced changes, which can be further incorporated and used by forest fire management services and further decision support systems complementary to the CEMS maps.

TI  - Spectral Characteristics of the Dynamic World Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dynamic World product is a discrete land cover classification of Sentinel 2 reflectance imagery that is global in extent, retrospective to 2015, and updated continuously in near real time. The classifier is trained on a stratified random sample of 20,000 hand-labeled 5 x 5 km Sentinel 2 tiles spanning 14 biomes globally. Since the training data are based on visual interpretation of image composites by both expert and non-expert annotators, without explicit spectral properties specified in the class definitions, the spectral characteristics of the classes are not obvious. The objective of this study is to quantify the physical distinctions among the land cover classes by characterizing the spectral properties of the range of reflectance present within each of the Dynamic World classes over a variety of landscapes. This is achieved by comparing both the eight-class probability feature space (excluding snow) and the maximum probability class assignment (label) distributions to continuous land cover fraction estimates derived from a globally standardized spectral mixture model. Standardized substrate, vegetation, and dark (SVD) endmembers are used to unmix nine Sentinel 2 reflectance tiles from nine spectral diversity hotspots for comparison between the SVD land cover fraction continua and the Dynamic World class probability continua and class assignments. The variance partition for the class probability feature spaces indicates that eight of these nine hotspots are effectively five-dimensional to 95% of variance. Class probability feature spaces of the hotspots all show a tetrahedral form with probability continua spanning multiple classes. Comparison of SVD land cover fraction distributions with maximum probability class assignments (labels) and probability feature space distributions reveal a clear distinction between (1) physically and spectrally heterogeneous biomes characterized by continuous gradations in vegetation density, substrate albedo, and structural shadow fractions, and (2) more homogeneous biomes characterized by closed canopy vegetation (forest) or negligible vegetation cover (e.g., desert, water). Due to the ubiquity of spectrally heterogeneous biomes worldwide, the class probability feature space adds considerable value to the Dynamic World maximum probability class labels by offering users the opportunity to depict inherently gradational heterogeneous landscapes otherwise not generally offered with other discrete thematic classifications.

TI  - Low-Density Parity-Check Codes: Highway to Channel Capacity
T2  - CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are not only capacity-approaching, but also greatly suitable for high-throughput implementation. Thus, they are the most popular codes for high-speed data transmission in the past two decades. Thanks to the low-density property of their parity-check matrices, the optimal maximum a posteriori probability decod-ing of LDPC codes can be approximated by message -passing decoding with linear complexity and highly parallel nature. Then, it reveals that the approximation has to carry on Tanner graphs without short cycles and small trapping sets. Last, it demonstrates that well -designed LDPC codes with the aid of computer sim-ulation and asymptotic analysis tools are able to ap-proach the channel capacity. Moreover, quasi-cyclic (QC) structure is introduced to significantly facilitate their high-throughput implementation. In fact, com-pared to the other capacity-approaching codes, QC-LDPC codes can provide better area-efficiency and energy-efficiency. As a result, they are widely applied in numerous communication systems, e.g., Landsat satellites, Chang'e Chinese Lunar mission, 5G mobile communications and so on. What's more, its extension to non-binary Galois fields has been adopted as the channel coding scheme for BeiDou navigation satel-lite system.

TI  - Analysis and Evaluation of the Layered Precipitable Water Vapor Data from the FENGYUN-4A/AGRI over the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Layered Precipitable Water Vapor (LPW) product derived from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the first of the Chinese new generation geostationary satellite Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) has great significance for weather forecasting and climate monitoring of the Tibetan Plateau. To analysis and evaluation the reliability of the FY-4A/AGRI LPW, with respect to the complex terrain on the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau, the atmospheric precipitable water vapor values were calculated based on the radiosonde observations (RAOB TPW) of 11 radiosonde stations in the research area from 2019 to 2020, and a comparative analysis was performed with the FY-4A/AGRI LPW. The results indicated that: (1) FY-4A/AGRI LPW and RAOB TPW demonstrate excellent consistency in all of the vertical height layers, but the atmospheric precipitable water vapor was underestimated by FY-4A/AGRI LPW; (2) The mean values of FY-4A/AGRI LPW in various months were all lower than those of RAOB TPW. The low layer FY-4A/AGRI LPW was the most stable in precision from the dimension of months; and (3) The precision of FY-4A/AGRI LPW, and the deviation between FY-4A/AGRI LPW and RAOB TPW were related with RDLS. The evaluation results of the study demonstrated that FY-4A/AGRI LPW underestimated the total water vapor in the research area, but the Bias and RMSE values were relatively low. FY-4A/AGRI LPW had a relatively high precision, and the data from it had superior quality and stability in terms of time changes and spatial distribution. Therefore, the product can perfectly reflect the spatial and temporal variation of the atmospheric water vapor on the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Bedrock outcropping in the accumulation zone of the largest glacier in Mexico (Glaciar Norte of Citlaltepetl), as evidence of a possible accelerated extinction
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The highest volcano in Mexico, at the same time the third largest mountain in North America (Citlaltepetl, 5610 m a.s.l.), is home to the largest glacier in the country. Because of the extinction of the Popocatepetl glacier (5500 m a.s.l.) caused by eruptive activity, and the almost disappearance of the Iztaccihuatl glaciers (5220 m a.s.l.) due to the lower elevation of the mountain, the Glaciar Norte of Citlatepetl has been the only glacier that has shown a certain degree of stability as a response to the altitude in which it is located. However, as occurs in almost all glaciers on the planet, the retreat of its glacier terminus has been continuous. Furthermore, during the last years the thickness of its upper part began to decrease rapidly until its bedrock was exposed for the first time in 2019. Due to its ecosystem importance and because it is the main glacier in Mexico, as well as the only one in the world located at latitude 19 degrees N, in this work its current dimensions are updated, as well as the local climatology that governs the current state of the glacier is pointed out. The study was based on the analysis of high-resolution Sentinel-2 optical images, as well as through Sentinel-1 SAR images, with the support of climatological information from the study area. Therefore, the outcropping of the bedrock in the accumulation zone and the consequent horizontal retreat of the upper part of the glacier are documented; at the same time, the decrease in the thickness of the ice along it is noted. The rocky outcrop in the accumulation zone suggests that the flow dynamics of the ice towards the ablation zone will be considerably less, accelerating the retreat of the glacier terminus. Finally, the ascent of the glacial front to 5102 m a.s.l. and the modelled altitude of the equilibrium line to 5276 m a.s.l. are reported as a warning signal in terms of snow catchment and mass balance; likewise, the decrease of 23% of its surface is also indicated regarding the surface reduction monitoring that has been done until 2017. These findings may indicate that the future of this glacier is related to its possible extinction sooner than previously thought, with severe environmental consequences, especially in terms of the provision of drinking water for thousands of inhabitants of the slopes of the volcano. This research is expected to help reflect on the impacts of current climate variability and at the same time serve as a reference for the tropical glaciers on the planet.

TI  - Which Vegetation Index? Benchmarking Multispectral Metrics to Hyperspectral Mixture Models in Diverse Cropland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of agronomic parameters like biomass, water stress, and plant health can benefit from synergistic use of all available remotely sensed information. Multispectral imagery has been used for this purpose for decades, largely with vegetation indices (VIs). Many multispectral VIs exist, typically relying on a single feature-the spectral red edge-for information. Where hyperspectral imagery is available, spectral mixture models can use the full VSWIR spectrum to yield further insight, simultaneously estimating area fractions of multiple materials within mixed pixels. Here we investigate the relationships between VIs and mixture models by comparing hyperspectral endmember fractions to six common multispectral VIs in California's diverse crops and soils. In so doing, we isolate spectral effects from sensor- and acquisition-specific variability associated with atmosphere, illumination, and view geometry. Specifically, we compare: (1) fractional area of photosynthetic vegetation (F-v) from 64,000,000 3-5 m resolution AVIRIS-ng reflectance spectra; and (2) six popular VIs (NDVI, NIRv, EVI, EVI2, SR, DVI) computed from simulated Planet SuperDove reflectance spectra derived from the AVIRIS-ng spectra. Hyperspectral F-v and multispectral VIs are compared using both parametric (Pearson correlation, rho) and nonparametric (Mutual Information, MI) metrics. Four VIs (NIRv, DVI, EVI, EVI2) showed strong linear relationships with F-v (rho > 0.94; MI > 1.2). NIRv and DVI showed strong interrelation (rho > 0.99, MI > 2.4), but deviated from a 1:1 correspondence with F-v. EVI and EVI2 were strongly interrelated (rho > 0.99, MI > 2.3) and more closely approximated a 1:1 relationship with F-v. In contrast, NDVI and SR showed a weaker, nonlinear, heteroskedastic relation to F-v (rho < 0.84, MI = 0.69). NDVI exhibited both especially severe sensitivity to unvegetated background (-0.05 < NDVI < +0.6) and saturation (0.2 < F-v < 0.8 for NDVI = 0.7). The self-consistent atmospheric correction, radiometry, and sun-sensor geometry allows this simulation approach to be further applied to indices, sensors, and landscapes worldwide.

TI  - Assessing the Use of Sentinel-2 Data for Spatio-Temporal Upscaling of Flux Tower Gross Primary Productivity Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation, restoration and sustainable use of wetlands is the target of several international agreements, among which are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Earth Observation (EO) technologies can assist national authorities in monitoring activities and the environmental status of wetlands to achieve these targets. In this study, we assess the capabilities of the Sentinel-2 instrument to model Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) as a proxy for the monitoring of ecosystem health. To estimate the spatial and temporal variation of GPP, we develop an empirical model correlating in situ measurements of GPP, eight Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indexes (VIs), and different environmental drivers of GPP. The model automatically performs an interdependency analysis and selects the model with the highest accuracy and statistical significance. Additionally, the model is upscaled across larger areas and monthly maps of GPP are produced. The study methodology is applied in a marsh ecosystem located in Donana National Park, Spain. In this application, a combination of the red-edge chlorophyll index (CLr) and rainfall data results in the highest correlation with in situ measurements of GPP and is used for the model formulation. This yields a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.93, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) equal to 0.52 gC m(-2) day(-1), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) equal to 0.63 gC m(-2) day(-1), and significance level p < 0.05. The model outputs are compared with the MODIS GPP global product (MOD17) for reference; an enhancement of the estimation of GPP is found in the applied methodology.

TI  - Reimagining the Development of Downtown Cahokia Using Remote Sensing Visualizations from the Western Edge of the Grand Plaza
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of mounds, plazas, and defensive palisades associated with Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site (CMSHS) defines the core urban environment of Eastern North America's first American Indian city. The large mounds surrounding Cahokia's centrally located Grand Plaza, including the palisades that enclose them, are referred to as Downtown Cahokia. In this portion of the site, archaeologists have identified material culture (e.g., ceramics), earthen fills to level the plaza, and several earthen mound constructions. These findings suggest an occupational history for the area that occurred over the 9th-14th centuries CE, with the emergence of plaza delineation and earthwork construction beginning in the early 11th century CE. In sum, Downtown Cahokia and its Grand Plaza are considered by archaeologists to be a vibrant space characterized by ongoing American Indian transformations to an early metropolitan landscape. We conducted magnetometer and electromagnetic induction surveys at the western edge of the Grand Plaza. When compared with the LiDAR-derived visualizations we generated from this portion of the site, our aerial and terrestrial remote sensing data offered new information on the nature and sequence of monument construction in Downtown Cahokia, as well as architectural changes in domestic and special-use structures. These multi-scalar and complementary remote sensing datasets allowed us, without excavating, to trace important sequences of change in Downtown Cahokia's history.

TI  - Optimal index insurance and basis risk decomposition: an application to Kenya
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Index insurance is a promising tool to reduce the risk faced by farmers, but high basis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation between the index and individual farm yields, has limited its adoption to date. Improving adoption will require reducing one or both of the two fundamental sources of basis risk: the intrinsic heterogeneity within an insurance zone (zonal risk), and the lack of predictive accuracy of the index (design risk). Previous work has focused mostly on design risk, conflating the quality of the index with the quality of the zone. Consequently, there is currently no way to distinguish a "good index in a bad zone" from a "bad index in a good zone". Here we investigate the relative roles of zonal and design risk, with two main contributions. First, using a formal decomposition of basis risk, we show that the optimal index is the first principal component of the correlation matrix of yields between fields. This provides a simple upper bound on the insurable basis risk that any index can reach within a given zone. Second, we use 10 m resolution satellite data on maize yields in Kenya to provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of the extent of zonal versus design risk. Our results show a strong local heterogeneity in yields, underscoring the challenge of implementing index insurance in smallholder systems and the potential benefits of low-cost yield measurement approaches that can enable more local definitions of insurance zones.

TI  - Examining Thresholding and Factors Impacting Snow Cover Detection Using Nighttime Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime remote sensing data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer suite day/night band (VIIRS DNB) enable snow cover detection from full moonlight reflection. Using nighttime data is particularly relevant in areas with limited daytime hours due to high latitudes. Previous studies demonstrated the potential of using thresholding methods in detecting snow, but more research studies are needed to understand the factors that influence their accuracy. This study explored seven thresholding algorithms in four case study areas with different characteristics and compared the classified snow results to the MODIS MOD10A1 snow cover product. The results found that Li thresholding delivers higher accuracies for most case studies, with an overall accuracy between 65% and 81%, while mean thresholding performed best in mountainous regions (70%) but struggled in other areas. Most false negatives are caused by forests, especially closed and evergreen forests. The analysis of NDVI data matches these findings, with the NDVI of false negatives being significantly higher than true positives. False positives appear to be primarily located in or around built-up areas. This study provides insights into where nighttime VIIRS DNB data can be used to increase snow cover data temporal and spatial coverage.

TI  - Evaluation of Ecosystem Services Radiation Assessment of the National Ecological Sheltering Zone in China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) have been shrinking due to unreasonable development and utilization for a long time. There are many studies on ES, but the ecological information for policymakers is still complex and obscure. To address this critical omission, based on remote sensing data, combined with meteorological data, land use data, and administrative division data, using GIS spatial analysis technology and some ecological process models, we develop an ecosystem services radiation assessment framework (ESRAF) that can provide policymakers with concise and reliable ecological information. We illustrate the measurement of ESRAF through an application to specific regions of China's national ecological sheltering zone (NESZ), showing that the approach can effectively identify the beneficiary areas (SBA) for sand-stabilization service, soil conservation service, and water conservation service, and the degree of sharing of ES of SBA. ES produced by ecosystems in a specific region not only generates huge benefits locally but also a large number of ES benefit surrounding regions through cross-regional transmission. Specifically, in 2015, the area benefiting from sand-stabilization service provided by the Ordos's ecosystem is about 1.66 x 10(6) km(2), the amount of dust reduction in SBA would reduce by 28,738.67 x10(4) tons. The Loess Plateau Ecological Screen (LPES) provides critical soil conservation service, the SBA of LPES includes two parts: LPES and the Yellow River. The Northeast Forest Belt (NFB) provides vital water conservation services. The water conservation service beneficiary area is mainly located near the NFB, with 266 hydrological response units, covering an area of 8.982 x 10(4) km(2). This study also showed that the transmission distance is inversely proportional to the radiation effect, that is, the benefit level decreases with the distance from SPA. According to the degree of sharing of ES of SBA, the proposed cross-regional differentiated ecological compensation scheme is helpful to promote regional sustainable development. At the same time, this study also shows that NESZ is of great significance for ensuring China's ecological security.

TI  - Monitoring Cropland Abandonment in Southern China from 1992 to 2020 Based on the Combination of Phenological and Time-Series Algorithm Using Landsat Imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland abandonment is one of the most widespread types of land-use change in Southern China. Quickly and accurately monitoring spatial-temporal patterns of cropland abandonment is crucial for food security and a good ecological balance. There are still enormous challenges in the long-term monitoring of abandoned cropland in cloud and rain-prone and cropland-fragmented regions. In this study, we developed an approach to automatically obtain Landsat imagery for two key phenological periods, rather than as a time series, and mapped annual land cover from 1989 to 2021 based on the random forest classifier. We also proposed an algorithm for pixel-based, long-term annual land cover correction based on prior knowledge and natural laws, and generated cropland abandonment maps for Guangdong Province over the past 30 years. This work was implemented in Google Earth Engine. Accuracy assessment of the annual cropland abandonment maps for every five years during study period revealed an overall accuracy of 92-95%, producer (user) accuracy of 90-96% (73-87%), and Kappa coefficients of 0.81-0.88. In recent decades, the cropland abandonment area was relatively stable, at around 50 x 10(4) ha, while the abandonment rate gradually increased with a decrease in the cultivated area after 2000. The Landsat-based cropland abandonment monitoring method can be implemented in regions such as southern China, and will support food security and strategies for maintaining ecological balance.

TI  - Tools for Predicting Forage Growth in Rangelands and Economic Analyses-A Systematic Review
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Farmers and ranchers depend on annual forage production for grassland livestock enterprises. Many regression and machine learning (ML) prediction models have been developed to understand the seasonal variability in grass and forage production, improve management practices, and adjust stocking rates. Moreover, decision support tools help farmers compare management practices and develop forecast scenarios. Although numerous individual studies on forage growth, modeling, prediction, economics, and related tools are available, these technologies have not been comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, a systematic literature review was performed to synthesize current knowledge, identify research gaps, and inform stakeholders. Input features (vegetation index [VI], climate, and soil parameters), models (regression and ML), relevant tools, and economic factors related to grass and forage production were analyzed. Among 85 peer-reviewed manuscripts selected, Moderating Resolution Imaging Spectrometer for remote sensing satellite platforms and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, and soil moisture for input features were most frequently used. Among ML models, the random forest model was the most widely used for estimating grass and forage yield. Four existing tools used inputs of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and NDVI for large spatial-scale prediction and monitoring of grass and forage dynamics. Most tools available for forage economic analysis were spreadsheet-based and focused on alfalfa. Available studies mostly used coarse spatial resolution satellites and VI or climate features for larger-scale yield prediction. Therefore, further studies should evaluate the use of high-resolution satellites; VI and climate features; advanced ML models; field-specific prediction tools; and interactive, user-friendly, web-based tools and smartphone applications in this field.

TI  - A Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forest for Burned Area Identification with Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest and land fires are disasters that greatly impact various sectors. Burned area identification is needed to control forest and land fires. Remote sensing is used as common technology for rapid burned area identification. However, there are not many studies related to the combination of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data for burned area detection. In addition, SAR remote sensing data has the advantage of being a technology that can be used in various weather conditions. This research aims to evaluate the burned area model using a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor and random forest (CNN-RF) as classifiers on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The experiment uses five test schemes: (1) using optical remote sensing data; (2) using SAR remote sensing data; (3) a combination of optical and SAR data with VH polarization only; (4) a combination of optical and SAR data with VV polarization only; and (5) a combination of optical and SAR data with dual VH and VV polarization. The research was also carried out on the CNN, RF, and neural network (NN) classifiers. On the basis of the overall accuracy on the part of the region of Pulang Pisau Regency and Kapuas Regency, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, the CNN-RF method provided the best results in the tested schemes, with the highest overall accuracy reaching 97% using Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) images as reference data. This shows the potential of the CNN-RF method to identify burned areas, mainly in increasing precision value. The estimated result of the burned area at the research site using a hybrid CNN-RF method is 48,824.59 hectares, and the accuracy is 90% compared with MCD64A1 burned area product data.

TI  - Early Warning for Sugarcane Growth using Phenology-Based Remote Sensing by Region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is crucial to know crop growing in order to increase agricultural productivity. In sugarcane's case, monitoring growth can be supported by remote sensing. This research aimed to develop an early warning for sugarcane growth using remote sensing with Landsat 8 satellite at a crucial phenological time. The early warning was developed by identifying regional sugarcane growth patterns by analyzing seasonal trends using linear and harmonic regression models. Identification of growth patterns aims to determine the crucial phenological time by calculating the statistical value of the NDVI spectral index. Finally, monitoring the sugarcane growth conditions with various spectral indices for verification: NDVI, NDBaI, NDWI, and NDDI. All processes used Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform. The results showed that sugarcane phenology from January to June is crucial for monitoring and assessment. The value of the four corresponding indices indicated the importance of monitoring conditions to ensure a healthy sugarcane region. The results showed that two of the four regions were unhealthy during particular periods; unhealthy vegetation values were below 0.489 and vice versa, one due to excess water and the other due to drought.

TI  - Extension of Scattering Power Decomposition to Dual-Polarization Data for Tropical Forest Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new scattering power decomposition method is developed for accurate tropical forest monitoring that utilizes data in dual-polarization mode instead of quad-polarization (POLSAR) data. This improves the forest classification accuracy and helps to realize rapid deforestation detection because dual-polarization data are more frequently acquired than POLSAR data. The proposed method involves constructing scattering power models for dual-polarization data considering the radar scattering scenario of tropical forests (i.e., ground scattering, volume scattering, and helix scattering). Then, a covariance matrix is created for dual-polarization data and is decomposed to obtain three scattering powers. We evaluated the proposed method by using simulated dual-polarization data for the Amazon, Southeast Asia, and Africa. The proposed method showed an excellent forest classification performance with both user's accuracy and producer's accuracy at >98% for window sizes greater than 7 x 14 pixels, regardless of the transmission polarization. It also showed a comparable deforestation detection performance to that obtained by POLSAR data analysis. Moreover, the proposed method showed better classification performance than vegetation indices and was found to be robust regardless of the transmission polarization. When applied to actual dual-polarization data from the Amazon, it provided accurate forest map and deforestation detection. The proposed method will serve tropical forest monitoring very effectively not only for future dual-polarization data but also for accumulated data that have not been fully utilized.

TI  - Analysis of Ice Phenology of Middle and Large Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considered as a sensitive indicator of climate change, lake ice phenology can have significant influences on regional climate by affecting lake-atmosphere energy and water exchange. However, in situ measurements of ice phenology events are quite limited over high-elevation lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, where satellite monitoring can make up such deficiency. In this study, by a combination of AMSR-E (2002-2011) and AMSR-2 (2012-2021) passive microwave data, MODIS optimal products and in situ measurements of temperature profiles in four lakes, the ice phenology events of 40 high-elevation large lakes were derived and their inter-annual trends and influencing factors were analyzed. The freeze-up start date (FUS) mainly occurs in November-December with an average date of 9 December and the break-up end date (BUE) is concentrated in April-May with a multi-year average of 5 May. Under climate warming, 24 of the 34 (70.6%) lakes show delayed FUS at an average trend of 0.35 days/year, and 7 (20.6%) lakes show advanced BUE (rate of change CR = -0.17 days/year). The average ice coverage duration (ID) was 147 days, and 13 (38.2%) lakes shortened ID at an average rate of -0.33 days/year. By synthesizing other ice phenology products, we obtained the assembled products of lake ice phenology, and found that air temperature dominates during the freeze-thaw process, with a higher dependence of BUE than that of FUS on air temperature.

TI  - Assessment on Potential Suitable Habitats of the Grasshopper <i>Oedaleus decorus asiaticus</i> in North China based on MaxEnt Modeling and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Oedaleus decorus asiaticus (Bey-Bienko) populations are highly concentrated in Xilingol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where they regularly harm the ecosystems protecting northern China. In order to prevent the occurrence of O. d. asiaticus in the Xilingole grassland, the establishment of a high-precision method and extracting the area of occurrence for O. d. asiaticus is required. The primary objectives of this study were: (1) to project the potential distribution of O. d. asiaticus by MaxEnt model and remote sensing data, and (2) to explore the responses and relative contributions of habitat factors to the distribution of O. d. asiaticus. The study will help guide managers and decision-makers to prevent and control the occurrence of O. d. asiaticus early on and this work may facilitate meaningful reductions in pesticide application. Grasshopper populations can quickly grow to catastrophic levels, causing a huge amount of damage in a short time. Oedaleus decorus asiaticus (Bey-Bienko) (O. d. asiaticus) is the most serious species in Xilingol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The region is not only an important grassland but also a site of agricultural heritage systems in China. Therefore, projecting the potential geographic distribution of O. d. asiaticus to provide an early warning is vital. Here, we combined temperature, precipitation, soil, vegetation, and topography with remote sensing data to screen the predictors that best characterize the current geographical distribution of O. d. asiaticus. A MaxEnt model approach was applied to project the potential suitable distribution of O. d. asiaticus in Xilingol League (the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China) combined with a set of optimized parameters. The modeling results indicated that there were six main habitat factors that determined the suitable distribution of O. d. asiaticus such as the soil type (ST), grassland type (GT), elevation, precipitation during the growing period (GP), precipitation during the spawning period (SP), and normalized difference vegetation index during the overwintering period (ONDVI). The simulated result was good, with average AUC and TSS values of 0.875 and 0.812, respectively. The potential inhabitable areas of grasshoppers were 198,527 km(2), distributed mainly in West Urumqi, Xilinhot City, East Urumqi, Abaga Banner, and Xianghuang Banner of Xilingol League. This study is valuable to guide managers and decision-makers to prevent and control the occurrence of O. d. asiaticus early on and this study may facilitate meaningful reductions in pesticide application.

TI  - Assessment of Irrigation Demands Based on Soil Moisture Deficits Using a Satellite-Based Hydrological Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture deficit is an essential element in the estimation of irrigation demands, both spatially and temporarily. The determination of temporal and spatial variations of soil moisture in a river basin is challenging in many aspects; however, distributed hydrological modelling with remote sensing inputs is an effective way to determine soil moisture. In this research, a water demand module was developed for a satellite-based National Hydrological Model-India (NHM-I) to estimate distributed irrigation demands based on soil moisture deficits. The NHM-I is a conceptual distributed model that was explicitly developed to utilize the products from remote sensing satellites. MOD13Q1.5 data were used in this study to classify paddy and irrigated dry crops. Along with the above data, the DEM, Leaf Area Index, FAO soil map, and crop characteristics data were also used as inputs. The NHM-I with water demand module was evaluated in the Damodar river basin, India, from 2009 to 2018. The integrated NHM-I model simulated the irrigation demands effectively with remote sensing data. The temporal analysis reveals that soil moisture deficits in the Kharif season varied annually from 2009 to 2018; however, soil moisture deficits in the Rabi season were almost constant. The 50% Allowable Moisture Depletion (AMD-50) scenario can reduce the irrigation demand of 1966 MCM compared to the Zero Allowable Moisture Depletion (AMD-0) scenario. The highest annual irrigation demand (8923 MCM) under the AMD-50 scenario occurred in the 2015-2016 season, while the lowest (6344 MCM) happened in 2013-2014 season. With a new water demand module and remote sensing inputs, the NHM-I will provide a platform to assess spatial and temporal irrigation demands and soil moisture.

TI  - Estimation of Actual Evapotranspiration Using Satellite-Based Surface Energy Balance Derived from Landsat Imagery in Northern Thailand
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, satellite-based measures of surface energy balance and the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) from Landsat imagery were used to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in northern Thailand, constituting a procedure that has rarely been performed in southeast Asia. Subsequently, we compared the ETa obtained from METRIC with that calculated using the FAO-56 dual-crop coefficient method via the SIMDualKc software and found a strong correlation. An assessment of the accuracy of all the sample plots revealed the R-2, Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) values to be 0.830, 0.730, and 0.575 mm d(-1), respectively. Differences in the cumulative ETa values derived from SIMDualKc and METRIC ranged in magnitude from 0.93-3.57% for rice and 3.08-7.99% for longan. The ETa values for forestland and waterbodies were higher than those for agricultural areas and areas with other forms of land use. The spatiotemporal distribution of the seasonal ETa during the dry season was consistent with the climate, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity. Thus, our results indicate that METRIC is a reliable tool for estimating ETa for water resource management under different environmental conditions and improving water use efficiency over large areas.

TI  - The Application of SWAT Model and Remotely Sensed Products to Characterize the Dynamic of Streamflow and Snow in a Mountainous Watershed in the High Atlas
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowfall, snowpack, and snowmelt are among the processes with the greatest influence on the water cycle in mountainous watersheds. Hydrological models may be significantly biased if snow estimations are inaccurate. However, the unavailability of in situ snow data with enough spatiotemporal resolution limits the application of spatially distributed models in snow-fed watersheds. This obliges numerous modellers to reduce their attention to the snowpack and its effect on water distribution, particularly when a portion of the watershed is predominately covered by snow. This research demonstrates the added value of remotely sensed snow cover products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in evaluating the performance of hydrological models to estimate seasonal snow dynamics and discharge. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used in this work to simulate discharge and snow processes in the Oued El Abid snow-dominated watershed. The model was calibrated and validated on a daily basis, for a long period (1981-2015), using four discharge-gauging stations. A spatially varied approach (snow parameters are varied spatially) and a lumped approach (snow parameters are unique across the whole watershed) have been compared. Remote sensing data provided by MODIS enabled the evaluation of the snow processes simulated by the SWAT model. Results illustrate that SWAT model discharge simulations were satisfactory to good according to the statistical criteria. In addition, the model was able to reasonably estimate the snow-covered area when comparing it to the MODIS daily snow cover product. When allowing snow parameters to vary spatially, SWAT model results were more consistent with the observed streamflow and the MODIS snow-covered area (MODIS-SCA). This paper provides an example of how hydrological modelling using SWAT and snow coverage products by remote sensing may be used together to examine seasonal snow cover and snow dynamics in the High Atlas watershed.

TI  - Investigating the roles of different extracted parameters from satellite images in improving the accuracy of daily reference evapotranspiration estimation
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural water management, crop modeling, and irrigation scheduling are all dependent on the accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0). A satellite image can also compensate for the lack of reliable weather information. So, in this study, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been implemented for optimizing multilayer perceptron (MLP) and developing SGD-MLP to estimate daily ET0 in Tabriz (semi-arid climate) and Babolsar (humid climate) stations, Iran, using extracted data from satellite images. The estimated ET0 values were compared to the determined ET0 based on the FAO-Penman-Monteith equation. Based on satellite image data collected from 2003 to 2021, the database was constructed. During the development of the abovementioned models, data from 2003 to 2016 (70%) were used for training purposes, and residual data (30%) were used for testing purposes. Additionally, the input variables, including land surface temperature (LST) day and night, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and a fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) from MODIS sensor, were utilized to estimate the daily ET0. Thus, there are three studied models; first is based on the LST, second on the vegetation indices, and third on the combination of the LST and the vegetation indices. Additionally, four performance indexes, including the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), Willmott's index of agreement (WI), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, were utilized in order to measure the implemented model's accuracy. According to the obtained results, the SGD-MLP-3 with input parameters of LSTday & night, LSTmean, LAI, NDVI, and FPAR gave the most accurate results with RMSE and WI values of as 0.417 mm/day, 0.973, for Tabriz and 0.754 mm/day, 0.922 for Babolsar stations, respectively. Conclusively, LST of daytime, nighttime, and average may be suggested as the most influential parameter for ET0 estimation.

TI  - Exploring PlanetScope Satellite Capabilities for Soil Salinity Estimation and Mapping in Arid Regions Oases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One reason for soil degradation is salinization in inland dryland, which poses a substantial threat to arable land productivity. Remote-sensing technology provides a rapid and accurate assessment for soil salinity monitoring, but there is a lack of high-resolution remote-sensing spatial salinity estimations. The PlanetScope satellite array provides high-precision mapping for land surface monitoring through its 3-m spatial resolution and near-daily revisiting frequency. This study's use of the PlanetScope satellite array is a new attempt to estimate soil salinity in inland drylands. We hypothesized that field observations, PlanetScope data, and spectral indices derived from the PlanetScope data using the partial least-squares regression (PLSR) method would produce reasonably accurate regional salinity maps based on 84 ground-truth soil salinity data and various spectral parameters, like satellite band reflectance, and published satellite salinity indices. The results showed that using the newly constructed red-edge salinity and yellow band salinity indices, we were able to develop several inversion models to produce regional salinity maps. Different algorithms, including Boruta feature preference, Random Forest algorithm (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), were applied for variable selection. The newly constructed yellow salinity indices (YRNDSI and YRNDVI) had the best Pearson correlations of 0.78 and -0.78. We also found that the proportions of the newly constructed yellow and red-edge bands accounted for a large proportion of the essential strategies of the three algorithms, with Boruta feature preference at 80%, RF at 80%, and XGBoost at 60%, indicating that these two band indices contributed more to the soil salinity estimation results. The best PLSR model estimation for different strategies is the XGBoost-PLSR model with coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) values of 0.832, 12.050, and 2.442, respectively. These results suggest that PlanetScope data has the potential to significantly advance the field of soil salinity research by providing a wealth of fine-scale salinity information.

TI  - Othering as mediated soft-power practice: Chinese diplomatic communication of discourse about China-US trade war through the British press
T2  - DISCOURSE CONTEXT & MEDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines how Chinese Ambassador to the UK has employed Othering offensive to construct China-US trade war when publishing opinion pieces in the British press to promote China's image and seek partenership. It draws on Discourse-Historical Approach to Critical Discourse Studies. The analysis demonstrates how the Ambassador has used strategies, such as nomination, predication and argumentation, to construct the US as a negative Other to delegitimize its trade policies and actions. Meanwhile, Othering serves as a foil for indirectly constructing a positive Chinese Self as a responsible major country and a positive 'We-group' between China and the US European allies. It sheds some light on understanding the workings of Chinese diplomatic discourse in legitimating China's worldview on 'rules-based international order'. It also contributes to understanding the interplay between the media logic of British/Western press and the soft-power efforts of Chinese/non-Western government. The role of British/Western press in Chinese/counterhegemonic diplomats' mediated soft-power practice is both enabling and constraining.

TI  - Integrating Stereo Images and Laser Altimetry Points Derived from the Same Satellite for High-Accuracy Stereo Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, some mapping satellites, such as GaoFen-7 and ZiYuan3-03, are equipped with both optical stereo cameras and laser altimeters that can synchronously obtain stereo images and sparse ground laser altimetry points (LAPs). To effectively improve the geometric accuracy of these satellite stereo images, this study proposed an integrated processing method for LAPs and stereo images derived from the same satellite. This method makes full use of the advantages of synchronously obtaining stereo images and LAPs, and designs measurement technology for accurate pixel coordinates of LAPs in stereo images, which works toward solving a technical difficulty that has restricted their integration to achieve higher accuracy. The method also constructs a combined block adjustment model of LAPs and stereo images. We selected 70 GaoFen-7 stereo images and 463 GaoFen-7 LAPs from Hebei Province, China, and 12 ZiYuan3-03 stereo images and 81 ZiYuan3-03 LAPs from Heilongjiang Province, China, to conduct integrated processing experiments. The vertical accuracy of the GaoFen-7 images in all types of terrain were improved substantially and reached the accuracy requirements of 1:10,000 (even 1:5000) scale mapping in China. The vertical accuracy of the ZiYuan3-03 images in various terrain areas were also improved markedly, satisfying the accuracy requirement of 1:50,000 scale mapping. These experimental results indicate that the working mode of synchronously obtaining LAPs and stereo images using the same satellite is advanced, and the proposed method is correct and effective.

TI  - Negative Air Ion (NAI) Dynamics over Zhejiang Province, China, Based on Multivariate Remote Sensing Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative air ions (NAIs), which are known as the "air vitamin", have been widely used as a measure of air cleanness. Field observation provides an alternative way to record site-level NAIs. However, these observations fail to capture the regional distribution of NAIs due to the limited number of sites. In this study, satellite-based bio-geophysical parameters from the climate, topography, air quality, vegetation, and anthropogenic intensity were used to estimate the daily NAIs with the Random Forest model (RF). In situ NAI observations over Zhejiang Province, China were incorporated into the model. Daily NAIs were averaged to capture the spatio-temporal distribution. The results showed that (1) the RF algorithm performed better than traditional regression analysis and the common BP neural network to generate regional NAIs at a spatial scale of 500 m over the larger scale, with an RMSE of 258.62, R-2 of 0.878 for model training, and R-2 of 0.732 for model testing; (2) in the variable importance measures (VIM) analysis, 87.96% of the NAI variance was caused by the elevation, aspect, slope, surface temperature, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), relative humidity (RH), and the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), while path analysis indicated that SIF was one of the most important factors affecting NAI concentration across the whole region; (3) NAI concentrations in 87.16% of the region were classified above grade III (>500 ions cm(-3)), which was able to meet the needs of human health maintenance; (4) the highest NAI concentration was distributed over the southwest of the Zhejiang Province, where forest land dominates. The lowest NAI concentration was mostly found in the northeast regions, where urban areas are well-developed; and (5) among different land types, the NAI concentrations were ranked as forest land > water bodies > barren > grassland > croplands > urban and built-up. Among different seasons, summer and winter have the highest and lowest NAIs, respectively. Our study provided a substantial reference for ecosystem services assessment in Zhejiang Province.

TI  - Assessment of land use/land cover change impact on streamflow: a case study over upper Guder Catchment, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic nature of land use/land cover modifies the basin's hydrology and, therefore, evaluation of its impact on hydrological elements is of great importance. This research aims to quantify the impact of land use/land cover change on the streamflow of Upper Guder River Catchment, Ethiopia. In this study, a semi-distributed Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to see the static impact of LU/LC change on streamflow for 30 years (1989-2018). Landsat images were classified using a maximum likelihood classifier to generate LU/LC maps for the years 1989, 2002, and 2018. The LU/LC results show that, during the study period, forest/shrubland and grassland decreased by 6.48% and 4.23%, respectively, while Agricultural and Built-up areas increased by 8.04% and 2.69%, respectively. In this study, the SWAT model was calibrated for ten years (1995-2004) and then validated for five years (2005-2009) using daily discharge and LU/LC for the year 2002. During calibration, the R-2 and NSE were 0.84 and 0.74, while during validation 0.83 and 0.72, respectively. The calibrated and validated model parameters then were transferred to run the SWAT model with LU/LC data from 1989, and 2018. The simulated results show that due to modified LU/LC streamflow has increased in the wet season and short rainy season by 10.04% and 5.25%, respectively, while it has decreased by 6.60% in the dry season. The decrease in the streamflow during the dry season is mainly due to changing LU/LC, which has brought an alarming situation at downstream sites. Thus, to cope-up with it an effective integrated participatory approach for catchment management is required in the basin and surrounding neighborhood.

TI  - Detecting the Effects of Extreme Events on Estuarine Suspended Particulate Matter Using Satellite Remote Sensing (Scheldt Estuary): Challenges and Opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) plays an important role in controlling water quality, particularly in turbid estuaries. SPM may be impacted by changes in weather and climate, including potential changes in the frequency or intensity of extremes. Yet, the linkages between extreme events in wind and river discharge, and particularly the role these have on local dynamics and spatial patterns of estuarine SPM are, to date, largely unknown. This study investigates the effects that wind and river discharge have on SPM in a turbid estuary. It uses atmospherically corrected remotely sensed reflectances from Landsat-5, -7, and -8. From these data, we establish a 37-year-long time series, from 1984 to 2020, of satellite-derived SPM for the Scheldt Estuary. SPM was estimated using an algorithm applied to the near-infrared band and subsequently compared to in situ SPM data. Additionally, a time series of river discharge and wind speed were used to assess the frequency and severity of extreme events of wind speed and river discharge. In general, statistically significant but weak relationships between SPM and river discharge and between SPM and wind speed were observed. SPM correlated with river discharge and wind in large parts of the estuary, indicating the important role of these drivers in the entire estuarine system. Our study demonstrates how synoptic satellite snapshots can be combined with in situ time series of drivers, such as river discharge and wind, to capture where these drivers relate to (and likely affect) SPM within an estuary. However, our study demonstrates an inability to capture SPM during windstorms both from in situ and satellite data. We discuss the challenges and limitations of assessing the effects of extreme events from satellite and in situ SPM. We recommend the deployment of complementary moored turbidimeters for continuous observations at two strategic locations, as indicated by our spatial study, to improve the ability to capture the effects of extreme events in both space and time.

TI  - Seafloor Observations Eliminate a Landslide as the Source of the 1918 Puerto Rico Tsunami
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 11 October 1918 devastating tsunami in northwest Puerto Rico had been used as an example for earthquake-induced landslide tsunami hazard. Three pieces of evidence pointed to a landslide as the origin of the tsunami: the discovery of a large submarine landslide scar from bathymetry data collected by shipboard high-resolution multibeam sonar, reported breaks of submarine cable within the scar, and the fit of tsunami models to flooding observations. Newly processed seafloor imagery collected by remotely oper-ated vehicle (ROV) show, however, pervasive Fe-Mn crust (patina) on the landslide walls and floor, indicating that the landslide scar is at least several hundred years old. 14C dates of sediment covering the landslide floor verify this interpretation. Although we have not searched the region systematically for an alternative tsunami source, we propose a pos-sible source-a two-segment normal-fault rupture along the eastern wall of Mona rift. The proposed fault location matches the published normal faults with steep bathymetry and is close to the International Seismological Center-Global Earthquake Model catalog locations of the 1918 mainshock and aftershocks. The ROV observations further show fresh vertical slickensides and rock exposure along the proposed fault trace. Hydrodynamic models from an Mw 7.2 earthquake rupture along the eastern wall of the rift faithfully reproduce the reported tsunami amplitudes, polarities, and arrival times. Our analysis emphasizes the value of close-up observations and physical samples to augment remote sensing data in natural hazard studies.

TI  - Reservoir sedimentation evaluation using remote sensing and GIS approaches for the reservoirs in the upper Blue Nile Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the temporal dynamics of water stored in a reservoir using satellite remote sensing data integrated with a GIS application. The study is carried out in three reservoirs, which include Koga, Shina, and Selamko reservoirs located in the upper Blue Nile Basin. The techniques used to carry out this study have been pre and post-processing of Landsat images, modeling and identifying water pixels, evaluating reservoir capacity, and compression of results with recent bathymetric survey data. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) has been also employed to determine open water features and to improve the presence of water pixels in satellite imagery. Percentage Difference Area Index (PDAI) and Normal Difference Area Index (NDAI) techniques have been used to assess the deviation of storage area from satellite remote sensing, topo of bed elevation, and bathymetric survey. Results indicated that the Koga reservoir storage capacity has reduced from 83.10 to 81.179 Mm(3), showing an annual storage loss of 0.33% (2009-2016). For Shina and Selamko reservoirs, annual storage loss due to sediment depositions is found to be 2.53% and 2.13% in a span of 9 and 11 years, exceeding the annual average worldwide rate for reservoir sedimentation of 1%. The findings of the study showed that the sedimentation problem was relatively severe as compared with the findings of most other studies of similar reservoirs in other parts of Ethiopia. The area needs some intensive soil and water management strategies for sustainable use of the reservoirs in the Blue Nile Basin. To regain the storage capacity of the reservoirs, it would be proposed to adopt manual and or mechanical dredging with flushing for de-silting the deposited sediments, especially in Shina and Selamko reservoirs.

TI  - Development of High-Resolution Soil Hydraulic Parameters with Use of Earth Observations for Enhancing Root Zone Soil Moisture Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional quantification of energy and water balance fluxes depends inevitably on the estimation of surface and rootzone soil moisture. The simulation of soil moisture depends on the soil retention characteristics, which are difficult to estimate at a regional scale. Thus, the present study proposes a new method to estimate high-resolution Soil Hydraulic Parameters (SHPs) which in turn help to provide high-resolution (spatial and temporal) rootzone soil moisture (RZSM) products. The study is divided into three phases-(I) involves the estimation of finer surface soil moisture (1 km) from the coarse resolution satellite soil moisture. The algorithm utilizes MODIS 1 km Land Surface Temperature (LST) and 1 km Normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for downscaling 25 km C-band derived soil moisture from AMSR-2 to 1 km surface soil moisture product. At one of the test sites, soil moisture is continuously monitored at 5, 20, and 50 cm depth, while at 44 test sites data were collected randomly for validation. The temporal and spatial correlation for the downscaled product was 70% and 83%, respectively. (II) In the second phase, downscaled soil moisture product is utilized to inversely estimate the SHPs for the van Genuchten model (1980) at 1 km resolution. The numerical experiments were conducted to understand the impact of homogeneous SHPs as compared to the three-layered parameterization of the soil profile. It was seen that the SHPs estimated using the downscaled soil moisture (I-d experiment) performed with similar efficiency as compared to SHPs estimated from the in-situ soil moisture data (I-b experiment) in simulating the soil moisture. The normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) for the two treatments was 0.37 and 0.34, respectively. It was also noted that nRMSE for the treatment with the utilization of default SHPs (I-a) and AMSR-2 soil moisture (I-c) were found to be 0.50 and 0.43, respectively. (III) Finally, the derived SHPs were used to simulate both surface soil moisture and RZSM. The final product, RZSM which is the daily 1 km product also showed a nearly 80% correlation at the test site. The estimated SHPs are seen to improve the mean NSE from 0.10 (I-a experiment) to 0.50 (I-d experiment) for the surface soil moisture simulation. The mean nRMSE for the same was found to improve from 0.50 to 0.31.

TI  - Water Area Variation and River-Lake Interactions in the Poyang Lake from 1977-2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are an important part of the Earth's surface. Poyang Lake is China's largest freshwater lake with complex hydrological relationships and unique rhythmic changes. There is no systematic understanding of the relationship between lake watershed area and river-lake connectivity. In this study, using remote sensing imagery, hydrological data, meteorological data, and land use surveys, we investigated changes in the Poyang Lake water area from 1977-2021. In addition, we examined the relationship between the lake water area and potential impact factors and analyzed the influence of river-lake interactions on the lake water area. The results showed that the water area of Poyang Lake decreased during the study period. River runoff and sediment load changes in the Poyang Lake basin are the main factors affecting the lake water area. Additionally, the Three Gorges Dam water impoundment situated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River weakened and eliminated the block and reverse flow of the Yangtze River into the Poyang Lake, causing the water area to decrease toward the end of the flood season in 2005 and in the dry season in 2003. Changes in the lakebed elevation caused by sedimentation and anthropogenic activities have also accelerated the shrinkage of the water area. Overall, the results of this study indicate that variations in the river-lake interactions are the primary cause of the significant changes observed in the Poyang Lake water area in the last five decades.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring and Driving Factors Analysis of Ecological Environment Quality in Poyang Lake Basin
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological environment of Poyang Lake basin is an important part of the construction of ecological civilizations in the south of China. Based on the Landsat satellite remote sensing images, using the principal component analysis (PCA) method to construct the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) as an evaluation index of ecological environment quality, introducing the Geodetector model to quantitatively detect the explanatory power of different influencing factors on the spatial divergence of the ecological environment, and exploring the changes in ecological environment quality in the Poyang Lake basin from 1990 to 2020 and the impact of different driving factors. The results of the study showed that there were obvious regional differences in the ecological environment quality in the basin. The areas with bad and poor ecological quality were mainly distributed in the central and northern plains; the areas with high and good quality grades were mainly distributed in the hilly and mountainous region of the southwestern part of the basin; the overall ecological environment of the Poyang Lake basin has been improving over the past 30 years; and the improved areas were mainly distributed in low-altitude areas. Geodetector results showed that population density was the factor with the highest explanatory power for the spatial divergence of ecological environment quality in the Poyang Lake basin. Among different natural factors, topographic factors (slope, aspect) had a higher driving force than meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation). The night light index factor showed an increasing yearly trend, indicating that the ecological environment quality of the Poyang Lake basin was gradually increased due to the influence of urbanization development. The construction of the RSEI model based on Google Earth Engine could not only effectively ensure the accuracy of ecological environment quality evaluation in different years but could also quickly realize image preprocessing and index calculations, which greatly improved the efficiency of ecological environment evaluation. These research results can provide a theoretical basis and scientific data support for the ecological environment protection work in the Poyang Lake basin.

TI  - Enabling country-scale land cover mapping with meter-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite images can provide abundant, detailed spatial information for land cover classification, which is particularly important for studying the complicated built environment. However, due to the complex land cover patterns, the costly training sample collections, and the severe distribution shifts of satellite imageries caused by, e.g., geographical differences or acquisition conditions, few studies have applied high -resolution images to land cover mapping in detailed categories at large scale. To fill this gap, we present a large-scale land cover dataset, Five-Billion-Pixels. It contains more than 5 billion labeled pixels of 150 high -resolution Gaofen-2 (4 m) satellite images, annotated in a 24-category system covering artificial-constructed, agricultural, and natural classes. In addition, we propose a deep-learning-based unsupervised domain adaptation approach that can transfer classification models trained on labeled dataset (referred to as the source domain) to unlabeled data (referred to as the target domain) for large-scale land cover mapping. Specifically, we introduce an end-to-end Siamese network employing dynamic pseudo-label assignment and class balancing strategy to perform adaptive domain joint learning. To validate the generalizability of our dataset and the proposed approach across different sensors and different geographical regions, we carry out land cover mapping on five megacities in China and six cities in other five Asian countries severally using: PlanetScope (3 m), Gaofen-1 (8 m), and Sentinel-2 (10 m) satellite images. Over a total study area of 60,000 km(2), the experiments show promising results even though the input images are entirely unlabeled. The proposed approach, trained with the Five-Billion-Pixels dataset, enables high-quality and detailed land cover mapping across the whole country of China and some other Asian countries at meter-resolution.

TI  - Monitoring the changes of Lake Uluabat Ramsar site and its surroundings in the 1985-2021 period using RS and GIS methods
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ramsar sites are important ecosystems that are protected by international status, have great value in terms of biodiversity, and constitute a resource in terms of economic, cultural, scientific and recreational aspects. In this study, the change of Lake Uluabat Ramsar Site and its surroundings, between the years 1985-2021 has been observed. For this, Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods were used. Vegetation change in the lake and its surroundings in 1985, 2000, 2015 and 2021 with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and changes in water surfaces with the water indices Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) were analyzed by using Landsat multi-band satellite images (Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS) as RS data. The resulting changes were monitored and the success of the indices in determining these areas and the relations of the indices with each other were questioned by Accuracy index, Kappa coefficent, and Correlation analyses. The results show 36-year long-term changes and reveal a 13.06% shrinkage of Uluabat Lake wetland and surrounding water areas with the highest kappa coefficients for mNDWI as 0.83, 0.90, 0.93, 0.97, respectively, over the years studied.

TI  - SAR and Optical Data Applied to Early-Season Mapping of Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems Using Deep and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerative agricultural practices are a suitable path to feed the global population. Integrated Crop-livestock systems (ICLSs) are key approaches once the area provides animal and crop production resources. In Brazil, the expectation is to increase the area of ICLS fields by 5 million hectares in the next five years. However, few methods have been tested regarding spatial and temporal scales to map and monitor ICLS fields, and none of these methods use SAR data. Therefore, in this work, we explored the potential of three machine and deep learning algorithms (random forest, long short-term memory, and transformer) to perform early-season (with three-time windows) mapping of ICLS fields. To explore the scalability of the proposed methods, we tested them in two regions with different latitudes, cloud cover rates, field sizes, landscapes, and crop types. Finally, the potential of SAR (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) data was tested. As a result, we found that all proposed algorithms and sensors could correctly map both study sites. For Study Site 1(SS1), we obtained an overall accuracy of 98% using the random forest classifier. For Study Site 2, we obtained an overall accuracy of 99% using the long short-term memory net and the random forest. Further, the early-season experiments were successful for both study sites (with an accuracy higher than 90% for all time windows), and no significant difference in accuracy was found among them. Thus, this study found that it is possible to map ICLSs in the early-season and in different latitudes by using diverse algorithms and sensors.

TI  - InSAR Displacement with High-Resolution Optical Remote Sensing for the Early Detection and Deformation Analysis of Active Landslides in the Upper Yellow River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent landslides and other geological disasters pose a serious threat to human life and infrastructure in the Upper Yellow River. Detecting active landslides and ascertaining their impact necessitate the determination of deformation characteristics. In this study, we developed an integrated method combining interferometric synthetic aperture radar and high-resolution optical satellite remote sensing to detect active landslides in the Upper Yellow River region from Longyang Gorge to Lijia Gorge. Sentinel-1 satellite data from January 2019 to April 2021 with ascending and descending orbits were adopted to obtain deformation using the STACKING and interferometric point target analysis techniques. A 97.08% overlap rate in the detected results from the two InSAR technologies confirmed the suitability of both approaches. The missing detection rates (6.79% & 8.73%) from single line-of-sight (LOS) InSAR results indicate the necessity of different orbit direction data. Slight deformation rate changes (<4 mm/month) before and after rainy seasons of the Lijia Gorge landslide group indicate that precipitation exerted little impact on slope activity. This study supports the feasibility of integrated methods for the detection and analysis of active landslides in the Upper Yellow River and other regions.

TI  - Electrochemotherapy with Bleomycin Supported by NIRF Imaging with Indocyanine Green (ICG)-In Vitro and In Vivo Case Study
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrochemotherapy (ECT) with bleomycin has been effectively used in recent years to treat various skin tumors. Microsecond electric pulses significantly improve bleomycin (BLM) delivery and its anticancer potential. Up to now, we can determine electric field distribution in the targeted tissue, however, the distribution of the injected drug is still not well known. In this study, we propose the combination of indocyanine green (ICG) with bleomycin as a practical approach for ECT, enabling drug distribution control and detection. Normal skeletal muscle (L6) and fibrosarcoma (WEHI-164) cells were used for the viability evaluation by MTT assay after 24 and 72 h. Cells were exposed to the ESOPE protocol alone and in combination with drugs. Additionally, visualization of the uptake of ICG and ICG + BLM supported by electroporation was performed by confocal microscopy. The mast cell tumor (MCTs) was diagnosed in the feline case. The mixture of ICG + BLM was injected into the tumor, and ECT was performed under near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF). The obtained results indicate the safety of the used procedure in vitro and in vivo. ICG does not affect ECT protocols in vitro. No significant cell viability decrease was noted only in the case of WEHI-164 cells post-ECT. Moreover, it does not adversely affect the procedure; in the case of in vivo surgery, it helps to control the drug distribution before and after ECT and identify the sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Enabling soil carbon farming: presentation of a robust, affordable, and scalable method for soil carbon stock assessment
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main hurdle in instrumentalizing agricultural soils to sequester atmospheric carbon is the development of methods to measure soil carbon stocks which are robust, scalable, and widely applicable. Our objective is to develop an approach that can help overcome these hurdles. In this paper, we present the Wageningen Soil Carbon STOck pRotocol (SoilCASTOR). SoilCASTOR uses a novel approach fusing satellite data, direct proximal sensing-based soil measurements, and machine learning to yield soil carbon stock estimates. The method has been tested and applied in the USA on fields with agricultural land use. Results show that the estimates are precise and repeatable and that the approach could be rapidly scalable. The precision of farm C stocks is below 5% enabling detection of soil organic carbon changes desired for the 4 per 1000 initiative. The assessment can be done robustly with as few as 0.5 sample per hectare for farms varying from 20 to 150 hectares. These findings could enable the structural implementation of carbon farming.

TI  - Spatial Application of Southern US Pine Water Yield for Prioritizing Forest Management Activities
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management depends on forest condition data and the ability to quantify the impacts of management activities to make informed decisions. Spatially quantifying water yield (WY) from forests across large landscapes enables managers to consider potential WY changes when designing forest management plans. Current forest water yield datasets are either spatially coarse or too restricted to specific sites with in situ monitoring to support some project-level forest management decisions. In this study, we spatially apply a stand-level southern pine WY model over a forested landscape in the Florida panhandle. We informed the WY model with pine leaf area index inputs created from lidar remote sensing and field data, a spatial and temporal aridity index from PRISM and MODIS data, and a custom depth to groundwater dataset. Baseline WY conditions for the study area were created using the Esri and Python tools we developed to automate the WY workflow. Several timber thinning scenarios were then used to quantify water yield increases from forest management activities. The results of this methodology are detailed (10 m spatial resolution) forest WY raster datasets that are currently being integrated with other spatial datasets to inform forest management decisions.

TI  - Wild Mesocarnivores as Reservoirs of Endoparasites Causing Important Zoonoses and Emerging Bridging Infections across Europe
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Review
AB  - Mesocarnivores are small- or mid-sized carnivore species that display a variety of ecologies and behaviours. In Europe, wild mesocarnivores are represented by the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the golden jackal (Canis aureus), the European wildcat (Felis silvestris), the Mustelidae of the genera Meles, Martes, Mustela, Lutra, the invasive species of raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and American mink (Neogale vison). These abundant animals thrive in various habitats and often develop their activity close to human settlements. Thus, they may play an important role in the introduction, maintenance, and transmission of major parasitic zoonoses and promote bridging infections with domestic animals. Against this background, this article reports and discusses some of the most important endoparasites of wild mesocarnivores living in Europe, on the basis of their actual role as reservoirs, spreaders, or sentinels. The data derived from epizootiological studies in different European countries, and the proven or speculated implications of the detected endoparasites in human and domestic animals' health, are discussed. Through older and recent literature review, the state-of-the-art knowledge on the occurrence and prevalence of the parasites under consideration is presented, showing further, warranted investigations and the need for surveillance and vigilance.

TI  - New Spectral Index and Machine Learning Models for Detecting Coffee Leaf Miner Infestation Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coffee leaf miner (Leucoptera coffeella) is a key coffee pest in Brazil that can cause severe defoliation and a negative impact on the productivity. Thus, it is essential to identify initial pest infestation for the sake of appropriate time control to avoid further economic damage to the coffee crops. A fast non-destructive method is an important tool that can be used to monitor the occurrence of the coffee leaf miner. The present work aims to identify the occurrence of coffee leaf miner infestation through a new vegetation index, using multispectral images from the Sentinel-2 satellite and the Google Earth Engine platform. Coffee leaf miner infestation was measured in the field in four cities in the state of Minas Gerais. The largest infestations occurred in September, October, and November but particularly in October 2021, in which the rate of infestation reached 85%, followed by September 2020 with a maximum infestation of 76%. The calculation steps of the vegetation indices and mappings were carried out in the Google Earth Engine cloud processing platform through the development of a script in JavaScript programming language. Combinations of two sensitive bands were selected to detect coffee leaf miner infestation, and from these, the "Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index" was developed, which was compared with other existing vegetation indices in terms of their performance for coffee leaf miner detection. The combination of the NIR-BLUE and NIR-RED bands was more sensitive for the detection of coffee leaf miner infestation; therefore, the NIR, BLUE, and RED bands were selected to develop the new index. The "Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index" presented the best performance among those evaluated, with a coefficient of determination of about 0.87, a root mean square error of 4.92% coffee leaf miner infestation, accuracy of 89.47%, and kappa coefficient of 95.39. The R-2 range of other spectral indices which exist in the literature and which were used in this study was from 0.017 to 0.867, and the root mean square error ranged from 4.996 to 13.582% coffee leaf miner infestation. The machine learning method was then adopted using the supervised Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms to recognize patterns of coffee leaf miner infestation in the field, only the Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index was used for the identification test of the coffee leaf miner infestation. The Support Vector Machine with linear Kernel type was applied to establish a discrimination model. The number of trees for the Random Forest classifier was 100. The Support Vector Machine presented a lower performance than the Random Forest algorithm, but the performance of both were above 80% for user and producer precision. Three bands (Blue, Red, NIR) were selected for the creation of the new index, which showed capacity for remote detection of coffee leaf miner infestation on a regional scale. Thus, "Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index" can identify coffee leaf miner infestation thanks to all the complexity involved in detecting pests via orbital remote sensing.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Invasive Plants in Coastal Ecosystems: What We Know So Far and Future Prospects
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal environments are highly threatened by invasive alien plants (IAP), and Remote Sensing (RS) may offer a sound support for IAP detection and mapping. There is still a need for an overview of the progress and extent of RS applications on invaded coasts that can help the development of better RS procedures to support IAP management. We conducted a systematic literature review of 68 research papers implementing, recommending, or discussing RS tools for IAP mapping in coastal environments, published from 2000 to 2021. According to this review, most research was done in China and USA, with Sporobolus (17.3%) being the better studied genus. The number of studies increased at an accelerated rate from 2015 onwards, coinciding with the transition from RS for IAP detection to RS for invasion modeling. The most used platforms in the 2000s were aircraft, with satellites that increased from 2005 and unmanned aerial vehicles after 2014. Frequentist inference was the most adopted classification approach in the 2000s, as machine learning increased after 2009. RS applications vary with coastal ecosystem types and across countries. RS has a huge potential to further improve IAP monitoring. The extension of RS to all coasts of the world requires advanced applications that bring together current and future Earth observation data.

TI  - Multi-Annual Evaluation of Time Series of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence as a Tool for Crop Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric coherence from SAR data is a tool used in a variety of Earth observation applications. In the context of crop monitoring, vegetation indices are commonly used to describe crop dynamics. The most frequently used vegetation indices based on radar data are constructed using the backscattered intensity at different polarimetric channels. As coherence is sensitive to the changes in the scene caused by vegetation and its evolution, it may potentially be used as an alternative tool in this context. The objective of this work is to evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for this purpose. The study area is an agricultural region in Sevilla, Spain, mainly covered by 18 different crops. Time series of different backscatter-based radar vegetation indices and the coherence amplitude for both VV and VH channels from Sentinel-1 were compared to the NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 imagery for a 5-year period, from 2017 to 2021. The correlations between the series were studied both during and outside the growing season of the crops. Additionally, the use of the ratio of the two coherences measured at both polarimetric channels was explored. The results show that the coherence is generally well correlated with the NDVI across all seasons. The ratio between coherences at each channel is a potential alternative to the separate channels when the analysis is not restricted to the growing season of the crop, as its year-long temporal evolution more closely resembles that of the NDVI. Coherence and backscatter can be used as complementary sources of information, as backscatter-based indices describe the evolution of certain crops better than coherence.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach for Identification of Low-Head Dams
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying low-head dams (LHDs) and creating an inventory is a priority, as fatalities continue to occur at these structures. Because obstruction inventories do not specifically identify LHDs and they are not assigned a hazard classification, there is no official inventory of LHDs; a multi-agency taskforce is creating one now by identifying LHDs using Google Earth Pro (GE Pro). The purpose of this paper is to assess whether a machine learning approach can accelerate the creation of the national inventory. We implemented a machine learning approach to use a high-resolution remote sensing data with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model achieved 76% accuracy in identifying LHDs (true positives) and 95% accuracy identifying Non-low-head-dams (true negatives) on the validation set. We deployed the trained model for the National Hydrologic Geospatial Fabric (Hydrofabric) flowlines in the Provo River watershed. The results showed a high number of false positives and low accuracy due to the mismatch between Hydrofabric flowlines and actual waterways. We recommend improving the accuracies of the Hydrofabric waterway tracing algorithms to increase the percentage of correctly classified LHDs.

TI  - An Assessment of the Lancaster Sound Polynya Using Satellite Data 1979 to 2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Situated between Devon Island and Baffin Island, Lancaster Sound is part of Tallurutiup Imanga, which is in the process of becoming the largest marine conservation area in Canada. The cultural and ecological significance of the region is due, in part, to a recurring polynya in Lancaster Sound. The polynya is demarcated by an ice arch that generally forms in mid-winter and collapses in late spring or early summer. Advanced Very High Resolution imagery from 1979 to 2022 was analyzed to determine the position, formation and collapse of the Lancaster Sound ice arch. The location of the ice arch demonstrates high interannual variability, with 512 km between the eastern and western extremes, resulting in a polynya area that can fluctuate between 6000 km(2) and 40,000 km(2). The timing of the seasonal ice arch formation and collapse has implications with respect to ice transport through Lancaster Sound and the navigability of the Northwest Passage. The date of both the formation and collapse of the ice arch is variable from season to season, with the formation observed between November and April and collapse usually occurring in June or July. A linear trend from 1979 to 2022 indicates that seasonal ice arch duration has declined from 150 to 102 days. The reduction in ice arch duration is a result of earlier collapse dates over the study period and later formation dates, particularly from 1979 to 2000. Lancaster Sound normally freezes west to east each season until the ice arch is established, but there is no statistical relationship between the ice arch location and duration. Satellite surface temperature mapping of the region indicates that the polynya is characterized by sub-resolution leads during winter.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH ON THE EDUCATION AND LEARNING OF ADULTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate catastrophe is a clarion call to humanity to change how we live. How do radical popular educators respond to this call? We 'join the dots' using climate justice, positions to explore this question. Dominant Western worldviews which separate humans from other life forms contribute to ecological degradation. For climate justice, this hardwired worldview needs to be disrupted. Drawing on multiple examples from Africa, we conclude that ways to do this require the foregrounding of cognitive justice which includes recognising the validity of multiple knowledges, learning from others and supporting communities' in their struggles for reparation, reclamation and conservation unsustainable behaviour and policies of the wealthy. We argue that radical popular education in these times is climate just and ecofeminist.

TI  - Pacific shoreline erosion and accretion patterns controlled by El Nino/Southern Oscillation
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The El Nino/Southern Oscillation drives coherent patterns of beach erosion and accretion around the Pacific Rim, according to analysis of satellite imagery covering over 8,300 km of sandy coastline.In the Pacific Basin, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability, driving substantial changes in oceanographic forcing and impacting Pacific coastlines. Yet, how sandy coasts respond to these basin-scale changes has to date been limited to a few long-term beach monitoring sites, predominantly on developed coasts. Here we use 38 years of Landsat imagery to map shoreline variability around the Pacific Rim and identify coherent patterns of beach erosion and accretion controlled by ENSO. On the basis of more than 83,000 beach transects covering 8,300 km of sandy coastline, we find that approximately one-third of all transects experience significant erosion during El Nino phases. The Eastern Pacific is particularly vulnerable to widespread erosion, most notably during the large 1997/1998 El Nino event. By contrast, La Nina events coincide with significant accretion for approximately one-quarter of all transects, although substantial erosion is observed in southeast Australia and other localized regions. The observed regional variability in the coastal response to ENSO has important implications for coastal planning and adaptation measures across the Pacific, particularly in light of projected future changes in ENSO amplitude and flavour.

TI  - City-wide, high-resolution mapping of evapotranspiration to guide climate-resilient planning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of global change, including extreme heat and water scarcity, are threatening an ever-growing urban world population. Evapotranspiration (ET) mitigates the urban heat island, reducing the effect of heat waves. It can also be used as a proxy for vegetation water use, making it a crucial tool to plan resilient green cities. To optimize the trade-off between urban greening and water security, reliable and up-to-date maps of ET for cities are urgently needed. Despite its importance, few studies have mapped urban ET accurately for an entire city in high spatial and temporal resolution. We mapped the ET of Berlin, Germany in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution for the year of 2019. A novel machine learning (ML) approach combining Sentinel-2 time series, open geodata, and flux footprint modeling was applied. Two eddy flux towers with contrasting sur-rounding land cover provided the training and testing data. Flux footprint modeling allowed us to incorporate comprehensive land cover types in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used as model inputs included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. NDVI was used to indicate vegetation phenology and health, as plant transpiration contributes to the majority of terrestrial ET. Hourly reference ET (RET) was calculated and used as input to capture the temporal dynamics of the meteorological conditions. Predictions were carried out using Random Forest (RF) regression. Weighted averages extracted from hourly ET maps using flux footprints were compared to measured ET from the two flux towers. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET, with a mean R2 of 0.76 and 0.56 and a mean RMSE of 0.0289 mm and 0.0171 mm at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the variation of ET between Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was analyzed to support urban planning. This study demonstrated the capacity to map urban ET at an unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution with a novel methodology, which can be used to support the sustainable management of green infrastructure and water resources in an urbanizing world facing climate change.

TI  - UAV LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data Synergy for Tree Species Classification in the Maoershan Forest Farm Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate classification of single tree species in forests is important for assessing species diversity and estimating forest productivity. However, few studies have explored the influence of canopy morphological characteristics on the classification of tree species. Therefore, based on UAV LiDAR and hyperspectral data, in this study, we designed various classification schemes for the main tree species in the study area, i.e., birch, Manchurian ash, larch, Ulmus, and mongolica, in order to explore the effects of different data sources, classifiers, and canopy morphological features on the classification of a single tree species. The results showed that the classification accuracy of a single tree species using multisource remote sensing data was greater than that based on a single data source. The classification results of three different classifiers were compared, and the random forest and support vector machine classifiers exhibited similar classification accuracies, with overall accuracies above 78%. The BP neural network classifier had the lowest classification accuracy of 75.8%. The classification accuracy of all three classifiers for tree species was slightly improved when UAV LiDAR-extracted canopy morphological features were added to the classifier, indicating that the addition of canopy morphological features has a certain relevance for the classification of single tree species.

TI  - Retrieving Vertical Cloud Radar Reflectivity from MODIS Cloud Products with CGAN: An Evaluation for Different Cloud Types and Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving cloud vertical structures with satellite remote-sensing measurements is highly desirable and technically challenging. In this paper, the conditional adversarial neural network (CGAN) for retrieving the equivalent cloud radar reflectivity at 94 GHz of the Cloud Profile Radar (CPR) onboard CloudSat is extended and evaluated comprehensively for different cloud types and geographical regions. The CGAN-based retrieval model was extended with additional data samples and improved with a new normalization adjustment. The model was trained with the labeled datasets of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud top pressure, cloud water path, cloud optical thickness, and effective particle radius data, and the CloudSat/CPR reflectivity from 2010 to 2017 over the global oceans. The test dataset, containing 24,427 cloud samples, was statistically analyzed to assess the performance of the model for eight cloud types and three latitude zones with multiple verification metrics. The results show that the CGAN model possesses good reliability for retrieving clouds with reflectivity > -25 dBZ. The model performed the best for deep convective systems, followed by nimbostratus, altostratus, and cumulus, but presented a very limited ability for stratus, cirrus, and altocumulus. The model performs better in the low and middle latitudes than in the high latitudes. This work demonstrated that the CGAN model can be used to retrieve vertical structures of deep convective clouds and nimbostratus with great confidence in the mid- and lower latitude region, laying the ground for retrieving reliable 3D cloud structures of the deep convective systems including convective storms and hurricanes from MODIS cloud products and used for predicting these storms.

TI  - Simulations of Snowmelt Runoff in a High-Altitude Mountainous Area Based on Big Data and Machine Learning Models: Taking the Xiying River Basin as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential data-driven model, machine learning can simulate runoff based on meteorological data at the watershed level. It has been widely used in the simulation of hydrological runoff. Considering the impact of snow cover on runoff in high-altitude mountainous areas, based on remote sensing data and atmospheric reanalysis data, in this paper we established a runoff simulation model with a random forest model and ANN (artificial neural network) model for the Xiying River Basin in the western Qilian region The verification of the measured data showed that the NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency), RMSE (root mean square error), and PBIAS (percent bias) values of the random forest model and ANN model were 0.701 and 0.748, 6.228 m(3)/s and 4.554 m(3)/s, and 4.903% and 8.329%, respectively. Considering the influence of ice and snow on runoff, the simulation accuracy of both the random forest model and ANN model was improved during the period of significant decreases in the annual snow and ice water equivalent in the Xiying River Basin from April to May, after the snow remote sensing data were introduced into the model. Specifically, for the random forest model, the NSE increased by 0.099, the RMSE decreased by 0.369 m(3)/s, and the PBIAS decreased by 1.689%. For the ANN model, the NSE increased by 0.207, the RMSE decreased by 0.700 m(3)/s, and the PBIAS decreased by 1.103%. In this study, based on remote sensing data and atmospheric reanalysis data, the random forest model and ANN model were used to effectively simulate hydrological runoff processes in high-altitude mountainous areas without observational data. In particular, the accuracy of the machine learning simulations of snowmelt runoff (especially during the snowmelt period) was effectively improved by introducing the snow remote sensing data, which can provide a methodological reference for the simulation and prediction of snowmelt runoff in alpine mountains.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Approach for the Assessing of Ecological Environmental Quality Variations Using Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to climate change and human activities, the eco-environment quality (EEQ) of eco-fragile regions has undergone massive change, especially in the Tibet Plateau. The Qilian Mountains (QLM) region is an essential ecological function zone in the northeastern Tibet Plateau, which plays a vital role in northwestern China's eco-environmental balance. However, EEQ changes in the QLM during the 21st century remain poorly understood. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of the EEQ in the QLM were analyzed from 2000 to 2020 using a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). The EEQ driving factors are identified by the geographic detector, and the spatial influence of critical factors is represented by a geographically weighted regression model. The results show low EEQ in the QLM. From 2000 to 2020, the EEQ initially slightly improved, then deteriorated, and finally gradually recovered. Spatially, the EEQ shows an increasing trend from northwest to southeast. Moran's I of EEQ remains at around 0.95, representing high spatial aggregation. "High-High" and "Low-Low" clustering features dominate in the local spatial autocorrelation, indicating the EEQ of the QLM is polarized. Precipitation is the dominant positive factor in the EEQ, with a q statistics exceeding 0.644. Furthermore, the key factors (precipitation, distance to towns, distance to roads) affecting EEQ in different periods vary significantly in space. From results we can draw the conclusion that the natural factors mainly control the spatial patterns of EEQ, while the human factors mainly impact the temporal trend of EEQ, the EEQ in the QLM has been significantly improved since 2015. Our findings can provide theoretical support for future eco-environmental protection and restoration in the QLM.

TI  - Investigating the Coupling of Supply and Demand for Urban Blue and Green Spaces' Cooling Effects in Shandong, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to determine the level of demand for thermal environment regulation and the availability of blue-green spaces for thermal environment regulation to alleviate the effects of urban heat islands. Taking Shandong Province, China, as the study area, combined multi-source remote sensing data are used in this study to construct the index system of cold island supply capacity (CIS) and the cold island demand level (CID). We use the methods of spatial regression, quadrant division, and coupling coordination degree to analyze the correlation, matching status, and the level of coordinated development between the supply capacity and demand for the cooling effect. We also explore the change law and spatial characteristics of the blue-green spaces' cooling effects supply and demand matching. Results show that: (1) The CIS and the CID are significantly negatively correlated and spatially heterogeneous in distribution, with a significant spatial spillover effect. (2) The dominant type of supply and demand is one of low supply and high demand, which means that the supply and demand for cool islands' cooling effect are unbalanced, with significant problems of spatial mismatch and quantitative imbalance. (3) The coupling between supply capacity and demand level is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional because the uneven distribution of urban buildings, population, and blue-green spaces reduce the coupling between supply and demand levels. This research can provide a new perspective and scientific basis for the study of the cooling effects of blue and green spaces and the mitigation of the heat island effect in densely populated urban centers.

TI  - GNSS Horizontal Motion Field in the Beijing Plain in View of The Variation Characteristics of The 3D Deformation Field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the fact that there is no unified understanding of the GNSS horizontal velocity field in the Beijing Plain and the serious land subsidence in this area, we collected GNSS data from 2011 to 2021 and Sentinel 1A data from 2017 to 2021 and conducted high-precision GNSS data processing and PS-InSAR verification in order to determine the reason for the differences in the GNSS horizontal velocity field in the Beijing Plain. The results show that, under the stable Eurasian framework, the horizontal velocity of GNSS stations in the Beijing Plain is significantly inconsistent. The velocity of all GNSS stations ranged from -1.32 to 10.41 mm/yr in the E component and from -8.83 to 3.00 mm/yr in the N component. From 2011 to 2021, there was significant uneven land subsidence in the Beijing Plain, and the maximum land subsidence rate from 2017 to 2021 reached 107 mm/yr. In analyzing the observation data of the GNSS and InSAR, we conclude that the land subsidence in the Beijing Plain will indeed affect the GNSS horizontal velocity field in the subsidence area. Under the EURA_I08 reference framework, the horizontal deformation field in the Beijing Plain is mainly caused by the tectonic activity-derived overall SEE-direction movement, accompanied by the velocity field anomaly caused by local land subsidence.

TI  - Research of Seismogenic Structures of the 2016 and 2022 Menyuan Earthquakes, in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 8 January 2022, a Moment Magnitude (Mw) 6.7 earthquake occurred in Menyuan, China. The epicenter was located in the western segment of the Lenglongling fault of the Qilian-Haiyuan fault zone. In this area, the Mw 5.9 Menyuan earthquake on 26 August 1986 and the Mw 5.9 Menyuan earthquake on 21 January 2016 successively occurred. The seismogenic structures of the 1986 and 2016 earthquakes are on the Northern Lenglongling fault, which is a few kilometers away from the Lenglongling fault. After the 2022 Menyuan earthquake, we collected GF-7 and Sentinel-1 satellite images to measure the surface deformation of the earthquake sequence. Based on the elastic dislocation theory, the fault model and fault slip distribution of the 2016 and 2022 Mengyuan earthquakes were inverted using coseismic surface displacements. The results show that the 2016 event is a reverse event, with the maximum coseismic surface displacement on LOS reaching 8 cm. The strike, dip, and rake of the earthquake rupture were 139 degrees, 41 degrees, and 78 degrees, with the maximum slip reaching 0.6 m at a depth of 8 km. The surface rupture of the 2022 Mw 6.7 earthquake ran in the WNW-ESE direction with a maximum displacement on LOS of 72 cm. The main seismogenic fault of the 2022 event was the western segment of the Lenglongling fault. The strike, dip, and rake of the rupture were 112 degrees, 85 degrees, and 3 degrees, with the maximum slip reaching 4 m at a depth of 4 km. The Coulomb failure stress change shows that the earthquake sequence generated a considerable positive Coulomb failure stress of more than 2 bar. These observations suggest that the earthquake sequence around Menyuan is mainly governed by the activities of the Lenglongling fault around the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. In addition, their sequential occurrences could be related to earthquake-triggering mechanisms due to stress interaction on different deforming faults. Thus, the Lenglongling fault has received a great amount of attention regarding its potential earthquake hazards.

TI  - A Google Earth Engine-Based Framework to Identify Patterns and Drivers of Mariculture Dynamics in an Intensive Aquaculture Bay in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although mariculture contributes significantly to regional/local economic development, it also promotes environmental degradation. Therefore, it is essential to understand mariculture dynamics before taking adaptive measures to deal with it. In the present study, a framework that integrates the Google Earth Engine (GEE) based methods and GeoDetector software was developed to identify patterns and drivers of mariculture dynamics. This framework was then applied to Zhao'an Bay, which is an intensive aquaculture bay in Coastal China, based on Landsat 8 OLI (2013-2022) and Sentinel-2 (December 2015-May 2022) data. The results show that the GEE-based method produces acceptable classification accuracy. The overall accuracy values for the interpretation are >85%, where the kappa coefficients are >0.9 for all years, excluding 2015 (0.83). Mariculture increased in the study area from 2013 to 2022, and this is characterised by distinct spatiotemporal variations. Cage mariculture is primarily concentrated around islands, whereas raft mariculture is dominant in bay areas, and pond and mudflat mariculture types are mostly in nearshore areas. The growth of mariculture in Zhao'an Bay is attributed to a combination of geographic and human factors. The initial area associated with mariculture in a grid significantly impacted the expansion of the raft, cage, and mudflat mariculture. The distance to an island, spatial proximity to similar types of mariculture and types of mariculture are the main drivers of change in mariculture. Human activities greatly contribute to the dynamics of mudflat mariculture; regulation regarding the clearing of waterways directly impacts the dynamics of mariculture. The present study demonstrates that the proposed framework facilitates the effective monitoring of the mariculture dynamics and identification of driving factors. These findings can be exploited for the local planning and management of mariculture in similar coastal bays.

TI  - Extraction of Cropland Spatial Distribution Information Using Multi-Seasonal Fractal Features: A Case Study of Black Soil in Lishu County, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of cropland distribution information using remote sensing technology is a key step in the monitoring, protection, and sustainable development of black soil. To obtain precise spatial distribution of cropland, an information extraction method is developed based on a fractal algorithm integrating temporal and spatial features. The method extracts multi-seasonal fractal features from the Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing data. Its efficiency is demonstrated using black soil in Lishu County, Northeast China. First, each pixel's upper and lower fractal signals are calculated using a blanket covering method based on the Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing data in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. The fractal characteristics of the cropland and other land-cover types are analyzed and compared. Second, the ninth lower fractal scale is selected as the feature scale to extract the spatial distribution of cropland in Lishu County. The cropland vector data, the European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover data, and the statistical yearbook from the same period are used to assess accuracy. Finally, a comparative analysis of this study and existing products at different scales is carried out, and the point matching degree and area matching degree are evaluated. The results show that the point matching degree and the area matching degree of cropland extraction using the multi-seasonal fractal features are 90.66% and 96.21%, and 95.33% and 83.52%, respectively, which are highly consistent with the statistical data provided by the local government. The extracted accuracy of cropland is much better than that of existing products at different scales due to the contribution of the multi-seasonal fractal features. This method can be used to accurately extract cropland information to monitor changes in black soil, and it can be used to support the conservation and development of black soil in China.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between the Eco-Environmental Quality and Urbanization by Utilizing Sentinel and Landsat Data: A Case Study of the Yellow River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellow River Basin urban agglomeration (YRBU) is the main carrier of regional socio-economic development in the Yellow River Basin, and its eco-environmental quality, urbanization, and coupling coordination degree are facing higher demands. It is of great significance for the development of YRBU to understand the interactive coupling relationship between the eco-environment and urbanization development from the multi-scale perspective. This research intended to understand the spatio-temporal characteristics of eco-environmental quality, urbanization, and coupling coordination degree in the study area from 2013 to 2021. We proposed an Adjusted Remote Sensing Ecological Index (A-RSEI), integrated Sentinel-2A, Landsat 8, and other remote sensing data to evaluate the eco-environmental quality of the study area, from 2013 to 2021. Coupled coordination degree (CCD) model was used to obtain the CCD between eco-environmental quality and urbanization. In addition, spatio-temporal and multi-scale analysis was carried out from the perspectives of urban agglomeration, municipal, county, and pixel scales. Combined with spatial autocorrelation analysis and Tapio decoupling model, the CCD was further explored. The results show that the proposed A-RSEI model is more suitable for monitoring the eco-environmental quality of the Yellow River Basin. The coupling coordination degree of eco-environment and urbanization in most regions of the study area are rising in a relatively green development trend. The multi-scale analysis among eco-environmental quality, urbanization, and CCD can not only indicate the impact of the central city on its surrounding areas but also help to describe the details of CCD combined with the terrain. The comprehensive discrimination of urban agglomeration and county scale is helpful to express the relationship between urbanization and eco-environmental quality centered on a certain city. The results can provide scientific support for eco-environment protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - The Relationship between Socioeconomic Factors at Different Administrative Levels and Forest Fire Occurrence Density Using a Multilevel Model
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are among the main factors that disturb terrestrial ecosystems, landscapes, and the environment. Understanding the differences that the socioeconomic factors of different administrative levels have on fire occurrence remains critical to inform the driving function of ignition sources. In this study, we collected socioeconomic and land use data for 21 cities and 81 counties in the study area from 2001 to 2019 and applied a multilevel model to explore the relationship between wildfire occurrence density and the driving factors. We estimated the fixed and random effect of the factors at different levels and built three hierarchical linear models (HLMs) to quantify the impacts of socioeconomic drivers on wildfires. The results showed that the variance among cities contributed to 14.01% of the unexplained variation of random effects at the county level. At the county level, the densities of middle school student populations, gross domestic product (GDP), and impervious surface areas were significantly positively correlated with fire occurrence density. At the city level, GDP and its interaction with county-level factors were significantly negatively correlated with fire occurrence density. This study provides a new method and findings for the research of wildfire occurrence and risk.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Rapid urbanization processes have brought great challenges to the conservation of urban biodiversity. The small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) is a national first-class key protected wild animal, yet ecological research about its wild populations in urban environments is rare. The aims of this study are to: (1) understand how small Indian civets respond to stray cats and human activities in time and space in urban landscapes; (2) investigate the habitat characteristics of small Indian civets in a human-dominated landscape; and (3) evaluate habitat changes of small Indian civets during the time period of 2000-2020.Methods: We used infrared camera traps to investigate the small Indian civets in the urban environment. From June 2020 to October 2021, we conducted camera trap surveys at 25 sites in the Xinjiangwan area, Yangpu District, Shanghai. We conducted individual identification, and then analyzed species diel activity pattern and measured the overlapping index and calculated the avoidance-attraction ratios between small Indian civets and stray cats and humans, respectively. In addition, we calculated the relative abundance index (RAI) of humans, stray cats, and birds, and used an independent sample t-test to test the site differences where small Indian civets were detected and not detected. Lastly, we utilized remote sensing data to analyze the landscape changes of small Indian civet habitat during the time period of 2000-2020.Results: We have achieved a sampling effort of 1,581 camera days, and obtained 65 independent small Indian civet detections at night sites. We identified 5 small Indian civet individuals. The diel activity pattern of small Indian civet was strictly nocturnal, with two nighttime activity peaks around 21:00 and 02:00. The temporal overlap index of small Indian civet and human activities was 0.15, and that of stray cats was 0.66. The avoidance-attractive ratio between small Indian civet and stray cats was 9.94 +/- 7.84. Human activity at sites where small Indian civets were detected was significantly less than that of the sites where the species was not undetected (t = -2.539, P = 0.021). Landscape analysis results indicated that most of the green space was replaced by artificial landscapes, and the degree of fragmentation and isolation increased during the past two decades.Conclusion: Small Indian civets demonstrate spatial and temporal avoidance to human activities and stray cats. The existing landscapes that are potentially suitable for small Indian civet are fragmented, and immediate actions are needed to conserve the remaining small Indian civet population in urban landscapes.

TI  - Nongovernmental Organization Practitioners' Perspectives on the Challenges and Solutions to Changing Handwashing Behavior in Older Children: A Qualitative Study
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Increasing handwashing with soap (HWWS) among older children (aged 5-14 years) can achieve a substantial public health impact. However, HWWS interventions targeting older chil-dren have had mixed success. Recent research has attempted to quantitatively identify effective intervention techniques; however, suc-cess is likely also influenced by the wider context of implementation. We explore nongovernmental organization (NGO) practitioners' perspectives on the challenges and solutions to HWWS interventions targeting older children to enhance understanding of what is re-quired, beyond intervention content, for them to be effective. Methods: We conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews in April-November 2020 with 25 practitioners employed across 11 NGOs and involved in HWWS interventions targeting older children in development and humanitarian settings. We used pur-posive and snowball sampling to recruit participants in roles at the global, national/regional, and local levels. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed to identi-fy challenges and solutions to HWWS interventions targeting older children. Results were organized according to program de-velopment cycle stages. Results: Twelve themes relating to perceived challenges emerged: (1) lack of prioritization, (2) funding inconsistency, (3) insufficient formative research, (4) demand on resources, (5) unengaging intervention content, (6) non-enabling physical environments, (7) availability of skilled implementers, (8) reaching out-of -school children, (9) community mistrust, (10) lack of coordination, (11) lack of evaluation rigor, and (12) failure to assign older chil-dren's HWWS as a primary outcome in evaluations of hygiene interventions. Recommended solutions were at the intervention, organization, and sector levels. Conclusion: Intervention design and delivery are important for the success of HWWS interventions for older children, but contex-tual factors, such as the availability of human and material resources and the level of coordination within and beyond the NGO sector, should also be considered. NGOs need to prioritize HWWS promotion among older children and support programs accordingly.

TI  - Evaluating the Difference in Neuropsychological Profiles of Individuals with FASD Based on the Number of Sentinel Facial Features: A Service Evaluation of the FASD UK National Clinic Database
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) It might be implied that those with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) with fewer sentinel facial features have a "milder" neuropsychological presentation, or present with fewer impairments than those with more sentinel facial features. The aim of this service evaluation was to compare the neuropsychological profile of people with FASD with varying numbers of sentinel facial features. (2) A clinical sample of 150 individuals with FASD, aged between 6 and 37 years, completed various standardised assessments as part of their diagnostic profiling. These included the documented level of risk of prenatal alcohol exposure (4-Digit Diagnostic Code), sensory needs (Short Sensory Profile), cognition (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-4th Edition; WISC-IV), and communication and socialisation adaptive behaviours (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-2nd Edition; VABS-II). As FASD has high comorbidity rates of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), these were also reviewed. The profiles of the 'FASD with 2 or 3 sentinel facial features' group (n = 41; 28 male, 13 female) were compared with the 'FASD with 0 or 1 sentinel facial features' group (n = 109; 50 male, 59 female) using Chi(2) tests, independent sample t-tests, and Mann-Whitney U analyses (where appropriate). (3) There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups across any measure included in this service evaluation. (4) Whilst sentinel facial features remain an important aspect in recognising FASD, our service evaluation indicates that there is no significant relationship between the number of sentinel facial features and the neuropsychological profile of people with FASD in terms of severity of presentation.

TI  - Investigating the Potential of Crop Discrimination in Early Growing Stage of Change Analysis in Remote Sensing Crop Profiles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, remote sensing crop identification is mostly based on all available images acquired throughout crop growth. However, the available image and data resources in the early growth stage are limited, which makes early crop identification challenging. Different crop types have different phenological characteristics and seasonal rhythm characteristics, and their growth rates are different at different times. Therefore, making full use of crop growth characteristics to augment crop growth difference information at different times is key to early crop identification. In this study, we first calculated the differential features between different periods as new features based on images acquired during the early growth stage. Secondly, multi-temporal difference features of each period were constructed by combination, then a feature optimization method was used to obtain the optimal feature set of all possible combinations in different periods and the early key identification characteristics of different crops, as well as their stage change characteristics, were explored. Finally, the performance of classification and regression tree (Cart), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in recognizing crops in different periods were analyzed. The results show that: (1) There were key differences between different crops, with rice changing significantly in period F, corn changing significantly in periods E, M, L, and H, and soybean changing significantly in periods E, M, N, and H. (2) For the early identification of rice, the land surface water index (LSWI), simple ratio index (SR), B11, and normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) contributed most, while B11, normalized difference red-edge3 (NDRE3), LSWI, the green vegetation index (VIgreen), red-edge spectral index (RESI), and normalized difference red-edge2 (NDRE2) contributed greatly to corn and soybean identification. (3) Rice could be identified as early as 13 May, with PA and UA as high as 95%. Corn and soybeans were identified as early as 7 July, with PA and UA as high as 97% and 94%, respectively. (4) With the addition of more temporal features, recognition accuracy increased. The GBDT and RF performed best in identifying the three crops in the early stage. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using crop growth difference information for early crop recognition, which can provide a new idea for early crop recognition.

TI  - Research on the Spatial Expansion Characteristics and Industrial and Policy Driving Forces of Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration Based on NPP-VIIRS Night Light Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization development, exploring the driving forces and characteristics of urban agglomerations' spatial expansion not only enriches the depth and breadth of research on urban agglomerations' expansion in China, but also has great significance for future urban development planning, rational utilization of land resources, and protection of ecological environment. This study selects nighttime light data to extract the built-up areas of the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration from 2012 to 2020, and uses urban expansion speed, urban expansion intensity, urban center of gravity migration, compactness, and fractal dimension index, combined with driving force analysis, to explore its development. The results show the following: (1) From 2012 to 2020, the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration expanded around Chengdu and Chongqing, and the expansion scale of each city first increased and then decreased. (The expansion scale is a comprehensive result obtained by using the formula of urban expansion speed and expansion intensity, indicating the extent of urban expansion.) (2) The expansion direction of the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration keeps close to Chengdu and Chongqing. The urban spatial form is not stable and begins to focus on urban interior filling. (Urban interior filling refers to the infrastructure construction and content enrichment and renewal within an urban built-up area.) (3) The spatio-temporal expansion of the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration from 2012 to 2020 is most affected by the levels of economic development and regional investment.

TI  - Early Crop Classification via Multi-Modal Satellite Data Fusion and Temporal Attention
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a deep learning-based algorithm for the classification of crop types from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series data which is based on the celebrated transformer architecture. Crucially, we enable our algorithm to do early classification, i.e., predict crop types at arbitrary time points early in the year with a single trained model (progressive intra-season classification). Such early season predictions are of practical relevance for instance for yield forecasts or the modeling of agricultural water balances, therefore being important for the public as well as the private sector. Furthermore, we improve the mechanism of combining different data sources for the prediction task, allowing for both optical and radar data as inputs (multi-modal data fusion) without the need for temporal interpolation. We can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on an extensive data set from three federal states of Germany reaching an average F1 score of 0.92 using data of a complete growing season to predict the eight most important crop types and an F1 score above 0.8 when doing early classification at least one month before harvest time. In carefully chosen experiments, we can show that our model generalizes well in time and space.

TI  - Deep Clouds on Jupiter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Jupiter's atmospheric water abundance is a highly important cosmochemical parameter that is linked to processes of planetary formation, weather, and circulation. Remote sensing and in situ measurement attempts still leave room for substantial improvements to our knowledge of Jupiter's atmospheric water abundance. With the motivation to advance our understanding of water in Jupiter's atmosphere, we investigate observations and models of deep clouds. We discuss deep clouds in isolated convective storms (including a unique storm site in the North Equatorial Belt that episodically erupted in 2021-2022), cyclonic vortices, and northern high-latitude regions, as seen in Hubble Space Telescope visible/near-infrared imaging data. We evaluate the imaging data in continuum and weak methane band (727 nm) filters by comparison with radiative transfer simulations, 5 micron imaging (Gemini), and 5 micron spectroscopy (Keck), and conclude that the weak methane band imaging approach mostly detects variation in the upper cloud and haze opacity, although sensitivity to deeper cloud layers can be exploited if upper cloud/haze opacity can be separately constrained. The cloud-base water abundance is a function of cloud-base temperature, which must be estimated by extrapolating 0.5-bar observed temperatures downward to the condensation region near 5 bar. For a given cloud base pressure, the largest source of uncertainty on the local water abundance comes from the temperature gradient used for the extrapolation. We conclude that spatially resolved spectra to determine cloud heights-collected simultaneously with spatially-resolved mid-infrared spectra to determine 500-mbar temperatures and with improved lapse rate estimates-would be needed to answer the following very challenging question: Can observations of deep water clouds on Jupiter be used to constrain the atmospheric water abundance?

TI  - A Novel Dual-Encoder Model for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Joint Classification via Contrastive Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep-learning-based multi-sensor hyperspectral image classification algorithms can automatically acquire the advanced features of multiple sensor images, enabling the classification model to better characterize the data and improve the classification accuracy. However, the currently available classification methods for feature representation in multi-sensor remote sensing data in their respective domains do not focus on the existence of bottlenecks in heterogeneous feature fusion due to different sensors. This problem directly limits the final collaborative classification performance. In this paper, to address the bottleneck problem of joint classification due to the difference in heterogeneous features, we innovatively combine self-supervised comparative learning while designing a robust and discriminative feature extraction network for multi-sensor data, using spectral-spatial information from hyperspectral images (HSIs) and elevation information from LiDAR. The advantages of multi-sensor data are realized. The dual encoders of the hyperspectral encoder by the ConvNeXt network (ConvNeXt-HSI) and the LiDAR encoder by Octave Convolution (OctaveConv-LiDAR) are also used. The adequate feature representation of spectral-spatial features and depth information obtained from different sensors is performed for the joint classification of hyperspectral images and LiDAR data. The multi-sensor joint classification performance of both HSI and LiDAR sensors is greatly improved. Finally, on the Houston2013 dataset and the Trento dataset, we demonstrate through a series of experiments that the dual-encoder model for hyperspectral and LiDAR joint classification via contrastive learning achieves state-of-the-art classification performance.

TI  - Effects of Dry Vegetation Coverage Estimated from the MODIS Soil Tillage Index on Dust Occurrence: Verification by Surface Synoptic Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - In drylands, the dry vegetation coverage affects dust occurrence by modulating threshold friction velocity (or wind speed) for dust emission. However, research into quantifying the effect of dry vegetation coverage on dust occurrence is scarce. This study investigated the spatial and temporal variations of dust occurrence and three defi-nitions of strong wind frequency over the Gobi Desert and surrounding regions in March and April, months when dust occurrence is frequent, during 2001 - 2021. We evaluated the effects of variations in dry vegetation on dust occurrence using the threat scores of forecasted dust occurrences for each strong wind definition. Our results in-dicated that dry vegetation, which was derived from the MODIS Soil Tillage Index, affects dust occurrence more significantly in April than in March. In March, land surface parameters, such as soil freeze-thaw and snow cover, in addition to dry vegetation coverage, should be considered to explain dust variations in that month. However, using the threshold wind speed estimated from dry vegetation coverage improved the prediction accuracy of dust occurrence in April. Therefore, we propose that the dry vegetation coverage is a key factor controlling dust oc-currence variations in April. The findings indicate that estimation of dry vegetation coverage should be applied to dust models.

TI  - Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms for Pixel/Object-Based Classifications of Semi-Arid Grassland in Northern China Using Multisource Medium Resolution Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of grassland classification in a timely and accurate manner is essential for grassland resource management and utilization. Although remote sensing imagery analysis technology is widely applied for land cover classification, few studies have systematically compared the performance of commonly used methods on semi-arid native grasslands in northern China. This renders the grassland classification work in this region devoid of applicable technical references. In this study, the central Xilingol (China) was selected as the study area, and the performances of four widely used machine learning algorithms for mapping semi-arid grassland under pixel-based and object-based classification methods were compared: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and naive Bayes (NB). The features were composed of the Landsat OLI multispectral data, spectral indices, Sentinel SAR C bands, topographic, position (coordinates), geometric, and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture variables. The findings demonstrated that (1) the object-based methods depicted a more realistic land cover distribution and had greater accuracy than the pixel-based methods; (2) in the pixel-based classification, RF performed the best, with OA and Kappa values of 96.32% and 0.95, respectively. In object-based classification, RF and SVM presented no statistically different predictions, with OA and Kappa exceeding 97.5% and 0.97, respectively, and both performed significantly better than other algorithms. (3) In pixel-based classification, multispectral bands, spectral indices, and geographic features significantly distinguished grassland, whereas, in object-based classification, multispectral bands, spectral indices, elevation, and position features were more prominent. Despite the fact that Sentinel 1 SAR variables were chosen as an effective variable in object-based classification, they made no significant contribution to the grassland distinction.

TI  - Characterizing Spring Phenological Changes of the Land Surface across the Conterminous United States from 2001 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land surface phenology plays a fundamental role in quantifying the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Shifts in land surface spring phenology have become a hot spot in the field of global climate change research. While numerous studies have used satellite data to capture the interannual variation of the start of the growing season (SOS), the understanding of spatiotemporal performances of SOS needs to be enhanced. In this study, we retrieved the annual SOS from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) time series in the conterminous United States from 2001 to 2021, and explored the spatial and temporal patterns of SOS and its trend characteristics in different land cover types. The performance of the satellite-derived SOS was evaluated using the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) and Harvard Forest data. The results revealed that SOS exhibited a significantly delayed trend of 1.537 days/degree (p < 0.01) with increasing latitude. The timing of the satellite-derived SOS was significantly and positively correlated with the in-situ data. Despite the fact that the overall trends were not significant from 2001 to 2021, the SOS and its interannual variability exhibited a wide range of variation across land cover types. The earliest SOS occurred in urban and built-up land areas, while the latest occurred in cropland areas. In addition, mixed trends in SOS were observed in sporadic areas of different land cover types. Our results found that (1) warming hiatus slows the advance of land surface spring phenology across the conterminous United States under climate change, and (2) large-scale land surface spring phenology trends extraction should consider the potential effects of different land cover types. To improve our understanding of climate change, we need to continuously monitor and analyze the dynamics of the land surface spring phenology.

TI  - Remote Sensing Crop Recognition by Coupling Phenological Features and Off-Center Bayesian Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining accurate and timely crop area information is crucial for crop yield estimates and food security. Because most existing crop mapping models based on remote sensing data have poor generalizability, they cannot be rapidly deployed for crop identification tasks in different regions. Based on a priori knowledge of phenology, we designed an off-center Bayesian deep learning remote sensing crop classification method that can highlight phenological features, combined with an attention mechanism and residual connectivity. In this paper, we first optimize the input image and input features based on a phenology analysis. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and random forest classifier (RFC) were built based on farm data in northeastern Inner Mongolia and applied to perform comparisons with the method proposed here. Then, classification tests were performed on soybean, maize, and rice from four measurement areas in northeastern China to verify the accuracy of the above methods. To further explore the reliability of the method proposed in this paper, an uncertainty analysis was conducted by Bayesian deep learning to analyze the model's learning process and model structure for interpretability. Finally, statistical data collected in Suibin County, Heilongjiang Province, over many years, and Shandong Province in 2020 were used as reference data to verify the applicability of the methods. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the three crops reached 90.73% overall and the average F1 and IOU were 89.57% and 81.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method can be directly applied to crop area estimations in different years in other regions based on its good correlation with official statistics.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the difficulties regarding that airborne navigation equipment relies on imports and the expensive domestic high-precision navigation equipment in the manufacturing field of Chinese navigable aircraft, a dual-antenna GNSS (global navigation satellite system)/MINS (micro-inertial navigation system) integrated navigation system was developed to implement high-precision and high-reliability airborne integrated navigation equipment. First, the state equation and measurement equation of the system were established based on the classical discrete Kalman filter principle. Second, according to the characteristics of the MEMS (micro-electric-mechanical system), the IMU (inertial measurement unit) is not sensitive to Earth rotation to realize self-alignment; the magnetometer, accelerometer and dual-antenna GNSS are utilized for reliable attitude initial alignment. Finally, flight status identification was implemented by the different satellite data, accelerometer and gyroscope parameters of the aircraft in different states. The test results shown that the RMS (root mean square) of the pitch angle and roll angle error of the testing system are less than 0.05 degrees and the heading angle error RMS is less than 0.15 degrees under the indoor static condition. A UAV flight test was carried out to test the navigation effect of the equipment upon aircraft take-off, climbing, turning, cruising and other states, and to verify the effectiveness of the system algorithm.

TI  - A methodology to characterize 4D post-failure slope instability dynamics using remote sensing measurements: A case study of the Aniangzhai landslide in Sichuan, Southwest China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A massive landslide often causes long-lasting instability dynamics that need to be analyzed in detail for risk management and mitigation. Multiple satellite remote sensing observations, in-situ measurements, and geophysical approaches have been jointly implemented to monitor and interpret the life cycle of landslides and their failure mechanisms from various perspectives. In this work, we propose a framework where satellite optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing techniques are combined with feature extractions using independent component analysis (ICA) and a mathematical relaxation model to assess the complete four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal patterns of post-failure slope evolution. The large, deep-seated Aniangzhai landslide in Southwest China that occurred on 17 June 2020 is comprehensively analyzed and characterized for its post-failure mechanism. Time series of Planet high-resolution optical images are first explored to derive the large horizontal motions for the first six months after the failure. Spatiotemporal dynamics of line-of-sight (LOS) displacement in the landslide body are then derived between November 2020 and February 2022 by combining 40 TerraSAR-X (TSX) High-resolution Spotlight (HS) images and 76 medium-resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR datasets using Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) method. The InSAR-derived results are subsequently analyzed with ICA to find common deformation components of points between optical and MTI results, indicating the same temporal evolution in the deformation pattern. Finally, the complete 4D deformation field for the whole post -failure period is modeled using a decaying exponential model representing stress relaxation after the failure by integrating multiple remote sensing datasets. Cross-correlation analysis of Planet imagery shows a decaying exponential pattern of post-failure displacements with an approximately 94% reduction in the deformation rate after six months with respect to the co-failure event. MTI analysis suggests a maximum LOS displacement rate of approximately 30 cm/year over the main failure body from November 2020 to February 2022; while the high-resolution TSX datasets show irreplaceable advantages in choosing the number of measurement points in MTI analysis with the number of measurement points being five times larger than those obtained by S1 datasets. The ICA analysis reveals three main types of kinematic patterns in the temporal evolution of post-failure deformation in MTI results, the dominant one being an exponential declining pattern similar to the results from Planet observations. Integrated 4D deformation modeling suggests that the most significant post-failure displacement mainly occurred toward the west, amounting to 28 m during the entire post-failure acquisitions from June 2020 until February 2022. Additionally, maximum displacements of 17 m and 19 m occurred in this period toward the north and downward, respectively.

TI  - Dynamic Detection of Forest Change in Hunan Province Based on Sentinel-2 Images and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic detection of forest change is the fundamental method of monitoring forest resources and an essential means of preserving the accuracy and timeliness of forest land resource data. This study focuses on a deep learning-based method for dynamic forest change detection using Sentinel-2 satellite data, especially within mountainous areas. First, the performance of various deep learning models (U-Net++, U-Net, LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, and STANet) and various loss functions (CrossEntropyLoss(CELoss), DiceLoss, FocalLoss, and their combinations) are compared on a self-made dataset. Next, the best model and loss function is used to predict the annual forest change in Hunan Province from 2017 to 2021, and the detection results are evaluated in 12 sample areas. Finally, forest changes are detected in Sentinel-2 images for each quarter of 2017-2021. In addition, a dynamic detection map of forest change in Hunan Province from 2017 to 2021 is drawn. The results reveal that the U-Net++ model and the CELoss performed the best on the self-made dataset, with a Precision of 0.795, a Recall of 0.748, and an F1-score of 0.771. The results of annual and quarterly forest change detection were consistent with the changes in the Sentinel-2 images with accurate boundaries. This result demonstrates the high practicality and generalizability of the method used in this paper. This paper achieves a rapid and accurate extraction of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image forest change areas based on the U-Net++ model, which can be used as a benchmark for future large territorial areas monitoring and management of forest resources.

TI  - Limited-Samples-Based Crop Classification Using a Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping Method, Sentinel-1 Imagery, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable crop type classification supports the scientific basis for food security and sustainable agricultural development. However, it still lacks a limited-samples-based crop classification method which is labor- and time-efficient. To this end, we used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-1A/B SAR time series to develop eight types of crop classification strategies based on different sampling methods of central and scattered, different perspectives of object-based and pixel-based, and different classifiers of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) and Random Forest (RF). We carried out 30-times classifications with different samples for each strategy to classify the crop types at the North Dakota-Minnesota border in the U.S. We then compared their classification accuracies and assessed the accuracy sensitivity to sample size. The results found that the TWDTW generally performed better than RF, especially for small-sample classification. Object-based classifications had higher accuracies than pixel-based classifications, and the object-based TWDTW had the highest accuracy. RF performed better in scattered sampling than the central sampling strategy. TWDTW performed better than RF in distinguishing soybean and dry bean with similar curves. The accuracies improved for all eight classification strategies with increasing sample size, and TWDTW was more robust, while RF was more sensitive to sample size change. RF required many more samples than TWDTW to achieve satisfactory accuracy, and it performed better than TWDTW when the sample size exceeded 50. The accuracy comparisons indicated that the TWDTW has stronger temporal and spatial generalization capabilities and has high potential applications for early, historical, and limited-samples-based crop type classification. The findings of our research are worthwhile contributions to the methodology and practices of crop type classification as well as sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Cross-Comparison of Radiation Response Characteristics between the FY-4B/AGRI and GK-2A/AMI in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we compare the data of the advanced geostationary radiation imager (AGRI) on board the FY-4B and the advanced meteorological imager (AMI) on board the GK-2A, in terms of overall data, different reflectivity/brightness temperature intervals, different regions, and different underlying surfaces. The results show that the AGRI and AMI data are generally consistent; the mean biases for reflectivity channels show a range of 0.50% to 1.69%, with channel VIR004 being exceptionally good, while brightness temperature (TB) differences in the IR channels ranging from 0.11 to 0.57 K, with channel IR120 being the most accurate. The reflectivity of the AGRI is higher than that of the AMI in terms of mean bias. The dispersion of the reflectivity difference between the AGRI and AMI is smaller at the short-wavelength channels than that at the longer-wavelength channels. The TB data observed by the AGRI are higher than those of AMI at conditions above 310 K. In the case of observing the same target, the difference in infrared brightness temperature due to the random noise signal is small. The differences between the two sensors can be considerably reduced by revising mean biases. In the following studies of quantitative product algorithms, the characteristics of sensor data need to be further analyzed in detail.

TI  - A Study on the Retrieval of Ozone Profiles Using FY-3D/HIRAS Infrared Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric ozone is a pollutant gas that has an important influence on the process of atmospheric radiation transmission and climate change. The Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) has better spectral performance than other remote sensing payloads. Its observation radiation data contains abundant atmospheric vertical information, which can be used for ozone retrieval, but there are no ozone profile business products being generated at present. Therefore, for the mainland of Hong Kong, based on HIRAS infrared hyperspectral observation data, we used the traditional one-dimensional variational (1D-VAR) physical retrieval algorithm, combined with the radiative transfer model for TOVS (RTTOV), and selected the spectrum channel according to the optimal sensitive profile algorithm. The artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was used to optimize the prior profiles, and the atmospheric ozone profile retrieval system was established. Finally, a set of ozone profile retrieval schemes suitable for FY-3D/HIRAS were summarized. We used ERA5 reanalysis data and World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) data to determine true values. The retrieval results were compared with Global Forecast System (GFS) forecast data, Ozone Mapping and Profile Suite (OMPS) ozone products, and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) ozone products. The results show that our ozone profile retrieval scheme makes up for the shortcomings of the conventional physical methods in some atmospheric pressure levels. The overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the ozone from the ground to the top of the stratosphere is within 30% on average, which was better than that for the GFS forecast data; the retrieval accuracy RMSE (%) was less than 20% in the pressure layer with the highest ozone concentration (15-25 hPa), which is better than that of OMPS ozone products and AIRS ozone products. The retrieval results prove that FY3D/HIRAS observation data allow ozone profile retrieval. This paper provides a reference for generating independent HIRAS ozone profile product data sets in business, and provides support for the subsequent application of Fengyun-3 series meteorological satellites in atmospheric parameter remote sensing.

TI  - Monitoring Land Cover Change by Leveraging a Dynamic Service-Oriented Computing Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change (LCC) is increasingly affecting global climate change, energy cycle, carbon cycle, and water cycle, with far-reaching consequences to human well-being. Web service-based online change detection applications have bloomed over the past decade for monitoring land cover change. Currently, massive processing services and data services have been published and used over the internet. However, few studies consider both service integration and resource sharing in land cover domain, making end-users rarely able to acquire the LCC information timely. The behavior interaction between services is also growing more complex due to the increasing use of web service composition technology, making it challenging for static web services to provide collaboration and matching between diverse web services. To address the above challenges, a Dynamic Service Computing Model (DSCM) was proposed for monitoring LCC. Three dynamic computation strategies were proposed according to different users' requirements of change detection. WMS-LCC was first developed by extending the existing WMS for ready-use LCC data access. Spatial relation-based LCC data integration was then proposed for extracting LCC information based on multi-temporal land cover data. Processing service encapsulation and service composition methods were also developed for chaining various land cover services to a complex service chain. Finally, a prototype system was implemented to evaluate the validity and feasibility of the proposed DSCM. Two walk-through examples were performed with GlobeLand30 datasets and muti-temporal Landsat imagery, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed DSCM approach was more effective and applicable to a wider range of issues in land cover change detection.

TI  - SAR-to-Optical Image Translation and Cloud Removal Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks: Literature Survey, Taxonomy, Evaluation Indicators, Limits and Future Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to the limitation of optical images that their waves cannot penetrate clouds, such images always suffer from cloud contamination, which causes missing information and limitations for subsequent agricultural applications, among others. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is able to provide surface information for all times and all weather. Therefore, translating SAR or fusing SAR and optical images to obtain cloud-free optical-like images are ideal ways to solve the cloud contamination issue. In this paper, we investigate the existing literature and provides two kinds of taxonomies, one based on the type of input and the other on the method used. Meanwhile, in this paper, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages while using different data as input. In the last section, we discuss the limitations of these current methods and propose several possible directions for future studies in this field.

TI  - Urban Distribution and Evolution of the Yangtze River Economic Belt from the Perspectives of Urban Area and Night-Time Light
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on urban development patterns and urban sprawl in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) has received wide attention. However, existing research has always made use of statistical data, which are not often available. Considering the high availability of satellite data, this study attempts to combine two satellite-acquired indexes, including urban area and night-time light, to evaluate the urban development of the YREB during 2012-2019. The methods included using growth index, rank-size law, and the Markov transition matrix, as well as constructing urban night-time light density and unbalanced index of night-time light, derived from the Gini Index. Some important patterns were revealed. Firstly, the three reaches (Upper Reaches, Middle Reaches, and Lower Reaches) in the YREB have all shown rapid growth in urban area and night-time light, and they all have increased in urban density. Secondly, from the perspective of regional disparity, the Upper Reaches have the highest growth rate of the urban area, while the Middle Reaches have the highest growth rate of night-time light; and the Upper Reaches have more urban sprawl, while the Middle Reaches have shown more compact growth. Thirdly, higher urban density is related to more balanced development across cities. Our study suggests new knowledge can be obtained by combining the two indexes for understanding urban development in the YREB.

TI  - Tropical cyclone size estimation based on deep learning using infrared and microwave satellite data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclone (TC) size is an important parameter for estimating TC risks such as wind damage, rainfall distribution, and storm surge. Satellite observation data are the primary data used to estimate TC size. Traditional methods of TC size estimation rely on a priori knowledge of the meteorological domain and emerging deep learning-based methods do not consider the considerable blurring and background noise in TC cloud systems and the application of multisource observation data. In this paper, we propose TC-Resnet, a deep learning-based model that estimates 34-kt wind radii (R34, commonly used as a measure of TC size) objectively by combining infrared and microwave satellite data. We regarded the resnet-50 model as the basic framework and embedded a convolution layer with a 5 x 5 convolution kernel on the shortcut branch in its residual block for downsampling to avoid the information loss problem of the original model. We also introduced a combined channel-spatial dual attention mechanism to suppress the background noise of TC cloud systems. In an R34 estimation experiment based on a global TC dataset containing 2003-2017 data, TC-Resnet outperformed existing methods of TC size estimation, obtaining a mean absolute error of 11.287 nmi and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.907.

TI  - Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Fusion Combining GIHS, NSST, and PCA
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and spectral information are essential sources of information in remote sensing applications, and the fusion of panchromatic and multispectral images effectively combines the advantages of both. Due to the existence of two main classes of fusion methods-component substitution (CS) and multi-resolution analysis (MRA), which have different advantages-mixed approaches are possible. This paper proposes a fusion algorithm that combines the advantages of generalized intensity-hue-saturation (GIHS) and non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) with principal component analysis (PCA) technology to extract more spatial information. Therefore, compared with the traditional algorithms, the algorithm in this paper uses PCA transformation to obtain spatial structure components from PAN and MS, which can effectively inject spatial information while maintaining spectral information with high fidelity. First, PCA is applied to each band of low-resolution multispectral (MS) images and panchromatic (PAN) images to obtain the first principal component and to calculate the intensity of MS. Then, the PAN image is fused with the first principal component using NSST, and the fused image is used to replace the original intensity component. Finally, a fused image is obtained using the GIHS algorithm. Using the urban, plants and water, farmland, and desert images from GeoEye-1, WorldView-4, GaoFen-7 (GF-7), and Gaofen Multi-Mode (GFDM) as experimental data, this fusion method was tested using the evaluation mode with references and the evaluation mode without references and was compared with five other classic fusion algorithms. The results showed that the algorithms in this paper had better fusion performances in both spectral preservation and spatial information incorporation.

TI  - A robust index to extract paddy fields in cloudy regions from SAR time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate mapping of paddy rice cultivation is needed for maintaining sustainable rice production, ensuring food security, and monitoring water usage. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing plays an important role in the continuous monitoring and mapping of rice cultivation in cloudy regions since it is not affected by weather conditions. To date, most SAR imagery-based rice mapping methods rely on prior knowledge (e.g., the planting date) and empirical thresholds for specific regions, which limits their applications in large spatial scales. To tackle this limitation, this study proposed a new SAR-based Paddy Rice Index (SPRI) to quantify the probability of land patches planted paddy rice. SPRI fully uses unique features of paddy rice during the transplanting-vegetative period in the Sentinel-1 VH backscatter time series. With the assistance of cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, SPRI can be calculated for each cropland object with adaptive parameters. Then, SPRI values of cropland objects can be converted to paddy rice maps using the binary-classification threshold. The proposed SPRI method was tested at five sites with diverse climate conditions, landscape complexity and cropping systems. Results show that the SPRI was able to produce an accurate classification map with an overall accuracy of over 88% and an F1 score of over 0.86 at all sites. Compared with the existing SAR-based rice mapping methods, our method performed much better in heterogeneous agricultural areas where rice is mosaiced with other crops. As SPRI does not need any prior knowledge, reference samples and many predefined parameters, it has high flexibility and applicability to support paddy rice mapping in large areas, especially for cloudy regions where optical remote sensing data is often not available.

TI  - Mapping Cropland Abandonment in Mountainous Areas in China Using the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the spatial-temporal pattern of cropland abandonment is the premise for the management of abandoned croplands. Traditional mapping approaches of abandoned croplands usually utilize a multi-date classification-based land cover change trajectory. It requires quality training samples for land cover classification at each epoch, which is challenging in regions of smallholder agriculture in the absence of high-resolution imagery. Facing these challenges, a theoretical model is proposed to recognize abandoned croplands based on post-abandonment secondary succession. It applies the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) temporal segmentation algorithm to Landsat time series (1986 similar to 2021) to obtain disjoint segments, representing croplands' status. The post-abandonment secondary succession showing a greening trend is recognized using NDVI-based harmonic analysis, so as to capture its preceding abandonment. This algorithm is applied to a mountainous area in southwest China, where cropland abandonments are widespread. Validation based on stratified random samples referenced by a vegetation index time series and satellite images shows that the detected abandoned croplands have user accuracy, producer accuracy and an F1 score ranging from 43% to 71%, with variation among abandonment year. The study area has a potential cropland extent of 22,294 km(2), within which 9252 km(2) of the cropland was abandoned. The three peak years of abandonment were 1994, 2000, and 2011. The algorithm is suitable to be applied to large-scale mapping due to its automatic manner.

TI  - Cotton Fiber Quality Estimation Based on Machine Learning Using Time Series UAV Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important factor determining the competitiveness of raw cotton, cotton fiber quality has received more and more attention. The results of traditional detection methods are accurate, but the sampling cost is high and has a hysteresis, which makes it difficult to measure cotton fiber quality parameters in real time and at a large scale. The purpose of this study is to use time-series UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) multispectral and RGB remote sensing images combined with machine learning to model four main quality indicators of cotton fibers. A deep learning algorithm is used to identify and extract cotton boll pixels in remote sensing images and improve the accuracy of quantitative extraction of spectral features. In order to simplify the input parameters of the model, the stepwise sensitivity analysis method is used to eliminate redundant variables and obtain the optimal input feature set. The results of this study show that the R-2 of the prediction model established by a neural network is improved by 29.67% compared with the model established by linear regression. When the spectral index is calculated after removing the soil pixels used for prediction, R-2 is improved by 4.01% compared with the ordinary method. The prediction model can well predict the average length, uniformity index, and micronaire value of the upper half. R-2 is 0.8250, 0.8014, and 0.7722, respectively. This study provides a method to predict the cotton fiber quality in a large area without manual sampling, which provides a new idea for variety breeding and commercial decision-making in the cotton industry.

TI  - Mapping and dynamic monitoring of military training-induced vegetation cover loss using Sentinel-2 images and method comparison
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable management of the US Army installations is critical for military training and readiness of forces. However, monitoring military training-induced vegetation cover disturbances using remote sensing data is challenging due to the lack of methodology for optimizing the selection of spectral variables or predictors and spatial modeling methods. This study aimed to propose and demonstrate a methodological solution for this purpose. The study was conducted in the Fort Riley installation in which three training areas were selected to map and monitor the training-induced vegetation cover loss. Sentinel-2 images and field observations of percentage vegetation cover (PVC) were combined at a spatial resolution of 10 m by 10 m to map PVC and its dynamics by comparison of two predictor selection methods and five spatial modeling algorithms based on a total of 304 spectral variables from the images before and after the training. Results showed that overall, the correlation-based predictor selection method reduced the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of PVC predictions by 4.44% than the random forest (RF)-based predictor selection. Machine learning methods including RF, neural network, and support vector machine overall reduced the RRMSE of PVC predictions by 42.83% compared with multiple linear regression and k-nearest neighbors. Combining correlation-based predictor selection and RF modeling, coupled with leave one out cross validation, provided the greatest potential of increasing the accuracy of monitoring the vegetation cover loss. The findings provided useful implications to develop a near real-time system of monitoring military training-induced vegetation cover loss.

TI  - A Framework for High-Resolution Mapping of Soil Organic Matter (SOM) by the Integration of Fourier Mid-Infrared Attenuation Total Reflectance Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), Sentinel-2 Images, and DEM Derivatives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM), as the greatest carbon storage in the terrestrial environment, is inextricably related to the global carbon cycle and global climate change. Accurate estimation and mapping of SOM content are crucial for guiding agricultural output and management, as well as controlling the climate issue. Traditional chemical analysis is unable to satisfy the dynamic estimation of SOM due to its low timeliness. Remote and proximal sensing have significant advantages in terms of ease of use, estimation accuracy, and geographical resolution. In this study, we developed a framework based on machine learning to estimate SOM with high accuracy and resolution using Fourier mid-infrared attenuation total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), Sentinel-2 images, and DEM derivatives. This framework's performance was evaluated on a regional scale using 245 soil samples from northeast China. Results indicated that the calibration size could be shrunk to 50% while achieving a fair prediction performance for SOM content. The Lasso, partial least squares (PLS), support vector regression (SVR), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) performed well in predicting SOM from FTIR-ATR spectra, and the performance was enhanced further by using Sentinel-2 images and DEM derivates. The PLS, SVR, and CNN models created SOM maps with higher spatial resolution and variation than the Kriging approach. The PLS and SVR models provided enough variety and were more realistic in the local SOM map, making them usable at the field scale, and the suggested framework took a fresh look at high-resolution SOM mapping.

TI  - Detection of vegetation NPP influencing factors based on spatial scale effect
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is an important parameter for evaluating the quality of terrestrial ecosystems. It is of great importance to study the spatio-temporal evolution of vegetation NPP and its driving force for regional ecological environment protection and sustainable development. On the basis of MODIS NPP data, meteorological data, DEM data, population density data, GDP data, and land use type data, this study used linear regression analysis, R/S analysis, and a Geodetector model to analyze the spatio-temporal variation in vegetation NPP and its future changing trend on both regional and landform scales and to detect the influencing factors that affect the spatial differentiation of vegetation NPP. The results showed that the vegetation NPP exhibited an extremely significant upward trend in southwest China from 2000 to 2020. On the landform scale, the vegetation NPP had showed an upward trend in all landforms, except for the southern Tibet Plateau; among them, the vegetation NPP in the Sichuan Basin showed the most obvious upward trend. The variation in vegetation NPP exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity in southwest China, with the changing rate of "high in the east and low in the west." The areas with an upward trend of vegetation NPP were greater than the areas with a downward trend, but the changing trend was dominated by a decreasing trend in the future, both in southwest China and each landform unit. The Geodetector results showed that elevation was the dominant factor controlling the spatial differentiation of vegetation NPP in southwest China and all landform units, except for the Yunan-Guizhou Plateau, in which the spatial differentiation of vegetation NPP was mostly dominated by temperature. The interaction detection results showed that the interaction between the influencing factors was manifested as two-factor enhancement or nonlinear enhancement. The interaction between elevation and temperature showed the highest impact on vegetation NPP distribution. On the landform scale, the spatial differential of vegetation NPP was dominated by the interaction between elevation and climate factors or elevation and GDP in the Guangxi Hills, Sichuan Basin, Zoige Plateau, Hengduan Mountains, and southern Tibet Plateau and between climate factors in the Yunan-Guizhou Plateau. The above results indicated that vegetation NPP variation and the influencing factors that dominate its spatial differential in southwest China showed obvious scale effects. Therefore, exploring the dynamic variation in vegetation NPP and its influencing factors at different spatial scales has practical significance for a comprehensive understanding of the vegetation cover situation and formulating regional ecological restoration plans in southwest China.

TI  - Isolation, Characterization, and Transcriptome Analysis of an ISKNV-Like Virus from Largemouth Bass
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is an important commercial fish farmed in China. Challenges related to diseases caused by pathogens, such as iridovirus, have become increasingly serious. In 2017, we detected iridovirus-infected diseased largemouth bass in Zunyi, Guizhou Province. The isolated virus was identified as an infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV)-like virus (ISKNV-ZY). ISKNV-ZY induces a cytopathic effect after infecting mandarin fish brain (MFB) cells. Abundant hexagonal virus particles were observed in the cytoplasm of ISKNV-ZY-infected MFB cells, using electron microscopy. The whole genome of ISKNV-ZY contained 112,248 bp and 122 open reading frames. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that ISKNV-ZY was most closely related to BCIV, indicating that it is an ISKNV-like megalocytivirus. ISKNV-ZY-infected largemouth bass started to die on day six and reached a death peak on days 7-8. Cumulative mortality reached 100% on day 10. Using RNA sequencing-based transcriptome analysis after ISKNV-ZY infection, 6254 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) were identified, of which 3518 were upregulated and 2673 downregulated. The DEGs were associated with endocytosis, thermogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, etc. These results contribute to understanding the molecular regulation mechanism of ISKNV infection and provide a basis for ISKNV prevention.

TI  - The Creep-Sliding Deformation Mechanism of the Jiaju Ancient Landslide in the Upstream of Dadu River, Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jiaju ancient landslide is a giant landslide located upstream of the Dadu River, eastern Tibetan Plateau, with a volume of approx. 7.04 x 10(8) m(3). The Jiaju ancient landslide is complex and comprises five secondary sliding bodies, e.g., the Jiaju landslide (H01), Niexiaping landslide (H02), Xiaobawang landslide (H03), Niela landslide (H04), and Mt.-peak landslide (H05). Affected by regional neotectonic movement, heavy rainfall, river erosion, and lithology, the secondary sliding bodies of the Jiaju ancient landslide are undergoing significantly different creep-sliding deformation, which will cause great damage to villages, roads, and rivers around the sliding bodies. Combined with the SBAS-InSAR method, Sentinel-1A data from June 2018 to August 2021, remote sensing and field surveys, this study obtained the Jiaju ancient landslide deformation characteristics and deformation rate in the line-of-sight direction (V-LOS), slope (V-Slope), and vertical (V-Vertical). It is concluded that the maximum deformation rate of the Jiaju ancient landslide is significant. The maximum of V-LOS, V-Slope, and V-Vertical are -179 mm/a, -211 mm/a, and -67 mm/a, respectively. The Niela landslide (H04), Jiaju landslide (H01), and Mt.-peak landslide (H05) are very large and suffer strong deformation. Among these, the Niela landslide (H04) is in the accelerative deformation stage and at the Warn warning level, and the Jiaju landslide (H01) is in the creep deformation and attention warning level, especially heavy rainfall, which will accelerate landslide deformation and trigger reactivation. Because the geological structure is very complex for the Jiaju ancient landslide and strong neotectonic movement, under heavy rainfall, the secondary landslide creep-sliding rate of the Jiaju ancient landslide is easily accelerated and finally slides in part or as a whole, resulting in river blocking. It is suggested to strengthen the landslide deformation monitoring of the Niela landslide and Jiaju landslide and provide disaster mitigation and prevention support to the government and residents along the Dadu River watershed.

TI  - Applications of Advanced Technologies in the Development of Urban Flood Models
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past 10 years, urban floods have increased in frequency because of extreme rainfall events and urbanization development. To reduce the losses caused by floods, various urban flood models have been developed to realize urban flood early warning. Using CiteSpace software's co-citation analysis, this paper reviews the characteristics of different types of urban flood models and summarizes state-of-the-art technologies for flood model development. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology provides an innovative approach to the construction of data-driven models; nevertheless, developing an AI model coupled with flooding processes represents a worthwhile challenge. Big data (such as remote sensing, crowdsourcing geographic, and Internet of Things data), as well as spatial data management and analysis methods, provide critical data and data processing support for model construction, evaluation, and application. The further development of these models and technologies is expected to improve the accuracy and efficiency of urban flood simulations and provide support for the construction of a multi-scale distributed smart flood simulation system.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Several Popular Models for Near-Land Surface Air Temperature Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-land surface air temperature (NLSAT) is an important meteorological and climatic parameter widely used in climate change, urban heat island and environmental science, in addition to being an important input parameter for various earth system simulation models. However, the spatial distribution and the limited number of ground-based meteorological stations make it difficult to obtain a large range of high-precision NLSAT values. This paper constructs neural network, long short-term memory, bi-directional long short-term memory, support vector machine, random forest, and Gaussian process regression models by combining MODIS data, DEM data, and meteorological station data to estimate the NLSAT in China's mainland and compare them with actual NLSAT observations. The results show that there is a significant correlation between the model estimates and the actual temperature observations. Among the tested models, the random forest performed the best, followed by the support vector machine and the Gaussian process regression, then the neural network, the long short-term memory, and the bi-directional long short-term memory models. Overall, for estimates in different seasons, the best results were obtained in winter, followed by spring, autumn, and summer successively. According to different geographic areas, random forest was the best model for Northeast, Northwest, North, Southwest, and Central China, and the support vector machine was the best model for South and East China.

TI  - Double Deep Q-Network for Hyperspectral Image Band Selection in Land Cover Classification Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral data usually consists of hundreds of narrow spectral bands and provides more detailed spectral characteristics compared to commonly used multispectral data in remote sensing applications. However, highly correlated spectral bands in hyperspectral data lead to computational complexity, which limits many applications or traditional methods when applied to hyperspectral data. The dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data becomes one of the most important pre-processing steps in hyperspectral data analysis. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been introduced to hyperspectral data band selection (BS); however, the current DRL methods for hyperspectral data BS simply remove redundant bands, lack the significance analysis for the selected bands, and the reward mechanisms used in DRL only take basic forms in general. In this paper, a new reward mechanism strategy has been proposed, and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is introduced during BS using DRL to improve the network stabilities and avoid local optimum. To verify the effect of the proposed BS method, land cover classification experiments were designed and carried out to analyze and compare the proposed method with other BS methods. In the land cover classification experiments, the overall accuracy (OA) of the proposed method can reach 98.37%, the average accuracy (AA) is 95.63%, the kappa coefficient (Kappa) is 97.87%. Overall, the proposed method is superior to other BS methods. Experiments have also shown that the proposed method works not only for airborne hyperspectral data (AVIRIS and HYDICE), but also for hyperspectral satellite data, such as PRISMA data. When hyperspectral data is applied to similar applications, the proposed BS method could be a candidate for the BS preprocessing options.

TI  - Analysis of Dust Detection Algorithms Based on FY-4A Satellite Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust detection is essential for environmental protection, climate change assessment, and human health issues. Based on the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A)/Advance Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) images, this paper aimed to examine the performances of two classic dust detection algorithms (i.e., the brightness temperature difference (BTD) and normalized difference dust index (NDDI) thresholding algorithms) as well as two dust products (i.e., the infrared differential dust index (IDDI) and Dust Score products (DST) developed by the China Meteorological Administration). Results show that a threshold below -0.4 for BTD (11-12 mu m) is appropriate for dust identification over China and that there is no fixed threshold for NDDI due to its limitations in distinguishing dust from bare ground. The IDDI and DST products presented similar results, where they are capable of detecting dust over all study areas only for daytime. A validation of these four dust detection algorithms has also been conducted with ground-based particulate matter (PM10) concentration measurements for the spring (March to May) of 2021. Results show that the average probability of correct detection (POCD) for BTD, NDDI, IDDI, and DST were 56.15%, 39.39%, 48.22%, and 46.75%, respectively. Overall, BTD performed the best on dust detection over China with its relative higher accuracy followed by IDDI and DST in the spring of 2021. A single threshold for NDDI led to a lower accuracy than those for others. Additionally, we integrated the BTD and IDDI algorithms for verification. The POFD after integration was only 56.17%, and the fusion algorithm had certain advantages over the single algorithm verification.

TI  - Assessment of Ecological Environment Quality in Rare Earth Mining Areas Based on Improved RSEI
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In past decades, the reckless exploitation of rare earth mines devastated the ecological environment. Under strict regulation and governance, the exploitation has gradually gotten back on track in recent years. In this regard, timely and accurate assessment of the ecological environment quality of rare earth management areas is indispensable for regional mine development planning, ecological protection, and sustainable development. Being relatively objective and providing instant results, the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) is widely used in evaluating ecological environment quality. This paper combined Landsat 8 OLI multispectral imagery with meteorological, land type, and other data to set the Net Primary Productivity (NPP). The NPP reflects detailed regional vegetation destruction and climate variation, the greenness index of RSEI. We also used kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to obtain the improved ecological index K-RSEINPP while evaluating the ecological environment quality of rare earth mining areas in southern Jiangxi and compared this with the traditional RSEI results. The results indicate that: (1) PC1 accounts for 88.51% of the results obtained based on K-RSEINPP, and the average correlation coefficient with each index reaches 0.757, which integrates the characteristics of the four indicators; (2) Compared with other indexes, the K-RSEINPP proposed in this paper can better display the detailed information of the ecological environment in the rare earth mining areas to differentiate mining areas under various statuses and cities with different vegetation coverage, and its results were consistent with the actual verification. Therefore, our K-RSEINPP can provide an effective basis for monitoring and evaluating the ecological environment of the mining area.

TI  - An Improved DINEOF Algorithm Based on Optimized Validation Points Selection Method
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean remote-sensing satellite data have been widely applied in the areas of oceanography, meteorology, the environment, and many more fields in science and engineering. However, missing data due to cloud cover, equipment failure, etc., limit its application. Therefore, reconstruction of the missing data through an appropriate method is essential. The data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function (DINEOF) algorithm proposed by Beckers and Rixen (2003) is currently the most commonly used method for the reconstruction of missing data in large areas. However, the existing DINEOF algorithm adopts a random method to select the cross-validation points, which may underutilize effective information around the missing value points. In addition, the cross-validation points may be too concentrated in an area, thus being unable to reflect the overall characteristics of the data. This paper optimizes the method to select the cross-validation points so that the information around the missing values can be effectively utilized and to avoid the cross-validation points being too concentrated. On this basis, an improved validation-point DINEOF algorithm (IV-DINEOF) is proposed. An ideal dataset and a reanalysis dataset based on sea surface temperature (SST) are used to test the performance of the improved algorithm. Statistical analysis of the results shows that the data reconstruction performance of the IV-DINEOF algorithm is better than that of the DINEOF algorithm, and the computational efficiency is also improved. The VE-DINEOF algorithm has the highest computing efficiency, but its reconstruction accuracy is lower than that of IV-DINEOF.

TI  - Monitoring of Heat Flux Energy in the Northernmost Part of Sumatra Volcano Using Landsat 8 and Meteorological Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT-IJRED
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal energy, as a part of green and renewable energy, has been widely developed in the world to replace the current conventional fossil energy. Peut Sagoe is an active volcano in the northern part of Sumatra. The volcanic mountain has not been completely explored for geothermal and energy reserves study. This is due to the volcano locates in a high topography and surrounded by dense tropical forest, which makes it challenging to deploy geophysical instruments in the area. The Landsat 8 thermal infrared and meteorological data from 2013 - 2020 were used to estimate the energy resources by calculating the radiative heat flux (RHF) and measuring the energy lost annually through the heat discharge rate (HDR). We also used the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) for vegetation analysis, and estimation of its emissivity data. The mono-window algorithm was used to calculate the land surface temperature (LST). The Stefan-Boltzmann equation was utilized to analyze thermal infrared data for RHF, and ambient temperature and relative humidity data were acquired from the Indonesian Meteorological Agency (BMKG) database. The results showed that low vegetation values and high LST of 25 degrees C-35 degrees C were found in crater areas, which indicate the underground thermal activities of the mountain. It demonstrates that the maximum RHF values were 55 W/m2 in 2013 and 37 W/m2 in 2020. The HDR data were calculated by applying 15% of the RHF data, and the amounts of energy lost were 132.5 MWe and 64.5 MWe in 2013 and 2015 respectively. It increased to 186.4 MWe in 2017 and 89 MWe in 2020. Based on these predicted results, we conclude that the combination of thermal infrared imagery of Landsat 8 and meteorological data is an effective approach in estimating geothermal energy potential and energy loss of volcanoes situated in remote areas.

TI  - Comparison and Assessment of Data Sources with Different Spatial and Temporal Resolution for Efficiency Orchard Mapping: Case Studies in Five Grape-Growing Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most important agricultural production types in the world, orchards have high economic, ecological, and cultural value, so the accurate and timely mapping of orchards is highly demanded for many applications. Selecting a remote-sensing (RS) data source is a critical step in efficient orchard mapping, and it is hard to have a RS image with both rich temporal and spatial information. A trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution must be made. Taking grape-growing regions as an example, we tested imagery at different spatial and temporal resolutions as classification inputs (including from Worldview-2, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2) and compared and assessed their orchard-mapping performance using the same classifier of random forest. Our results showed that the overall accuracies improved from 0.6 to 0.8 as the spatial resolution of the input images increased from 58.86 m to 0.46 m (simulated from Worldview-2 imagery). The overall accuracy improved from 0.7 to 0.86 when the number of images used for classification was increased from 2 to 20 (Landsat-8) or approximately 60 (Sentinel-2) in one year. The marginal benefit of increasing the level of details (LoD) of temporal features on accuracy is higher than that of spatial features, indicating that the classification ability of temporal information is higher than that of spatial information. The highest accuracy of using a very high-resolution (VHR) image can be exceeded only by using four to five medium-resolution multi-temporal images, or even two to three growing season images with the same classifier. Combining the spatial and temporal features from multi-source data can improve the overall accuracies by 5% to 7% compared to using only temporal features. It can also compensate for the accuracy loss caused by missing data or low-quality images in single-source input. Although selecting multi-source data can obtain the best accuracy, selecting single-source data can improve computational efficiency and at the same time obtain an acceptable accuracy. This study provides practical guidance on selecting data at various spatial and temporal resolutions for the efficient mapping of other types of annual crops or orchards.

TI  - Investigation of aerosol direct radiative forcing during a dust storm using a regional climate model over Turkiye
T2  - SIGMA JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND NATURAL SCIENCES-SIGMA MUHENDISLIK VE FEN BILIMLERI DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust particles originating from arid zones can be transported long distances and change the radiation budget. Understanding atmospheric aerosols and their radiative forcing is important to determine their global and regional climate effects. The aim of this study is to simulate the dust transport event that occurred on March 22, 2018, using RegCM-4.5 and investigate the radiative forcing effect of Saharan dust particles. The model was run with the 4 dust bin chemistry option and the direct effect of aerosols on the regional radiation balance was investigated. Validation of the model was made by a comparison between simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) and MODIS satellite data. The radiative forcing at the top and surface was calculated at all sky conditions. During the dust episode, the shortwave radiative forcing was ranging between -3 and -50 W/m(2) at surface and - 2 and -22 W/m(2) at top of atmosphere while the longwave radiative forcing was between 0.5 and 8 W/m(2) at surface and 0.2 and 2 W/m(2) at top of atmosphere over Turkiye. In Istanbul it produced a cooling up to -18 W/m(2) at surface and -9 W/m(2) at top of atmosphere, a warming up to 3.5 W/m(2) at surface and 0.6 W/m(2) at top of atmosphere.

TI  - Reconstruction of Daily MODIS/Aqua Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Turbid Estuarine Waters Based on Attention U-NET
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An attention U-Net was proposed to reconstruct the missing chlorophyll-a concentration (C-chla) data. The U-Net is a lightweight full convolution neural network architecture consisting of an enccoder-decoder (i.e., down-sampling and up-sampling). The attention gates (AGs) were integrated into the U-Net. Training the U-Net with AGs could implicitly teach it to suppress irrelevant areas and highlight the salient features in the missing data areas, which would increase the network sensitivity and reconstruction accuracy. The neural network uses the satellite-derived C-chla anomalies and its variance as the input, and the reconstructed fields along with their variances as outputs. The trained network was applied to long-term daily MODIS/Aqua C-chla products in the Pearl River estuary (PRE) and adjacent continental shelf area. The model performance was evaluated by using an independent test dataset from both satellite-derived and in-situ measurements. The results showed that the proposed neural network not only had good performance in the reconstruction of valid pixels, but also provided a more reasonable reconstruction compared to the standard U-Net without AGs. This study provided a feasible method for the reconstruction task in the field of ocean color, which should be helpful in producing a creditable dataset to study the ecological effects of extreme weather conditions such as typhoons on the upper ocean in the PRE waters. Based on the reconstructed C-chla products, the footprints of the typhoons were studied. An increase in surface C-chla near the typhoons' track and a decrease in estuary were found. The composite results illustrated that the C-chla increases occurred for almost the entire area within a radius of 100 km. The time series analysis showed that the C-chla peak appeared on the fifth day after the typhoon's passage.

TI  - Changes in Land Use and Ecosystem Service Values of Dunhuang Oasis from 1990 to 2030
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining the integrity and stability of oasis ecosystems is an important topic in the field of ecological research. Assessment of ecosystem services and their changes can provide important support for the sustainable development of oases. This study took the Dunhuang oasis in the hyper-arid area as the research object and used 1990, 2010, and 2020 Landsat series satellite images to complete the land use interpretation by random forest classification. Then we estimated the ecosystem services value (ESV) by using benefit transfer method, and predicted the trend of ecosystem service value changes under three scenarios using the Analytic Hierarchy Process method and the patch generation land use simulation model (AHP-PLUS model). The results showed that the vegetation areas of the Dunhuang Oasis first decreased and then increased during 1990-2020. The decrease was largely due to the expansion of built-up land and farmland, and the increase was mainly contributed by the implementation of ecological protection policies. The path of changes in the ESV of the Dunhuang Oasis during 1990-2020 was well consistent with that of vegetation areas, with a maximum of 9068.15x10(6) yuan (in 1990) and a minimum of 6271.46x10(6) yuan (in 2010). Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that urbanization reduced ESV, and the implementation of ecological policies enhanced ESV. The ESV of the Dunhuang Oasis for the year 2030 under the ecological conservation scenario could reach 7631.07x10(6) yuan, which is 381.1x10(6) yuan higher that under the economic development scenario. The ecological conservation scenario is the optimal option to achieve sustainable development of the Dunhuang Oasis. We suggested that the government should continuously enhance the protection of forests and waterbodies, reasonably restrict production and domestic water consumption, and efficiently increase the proportion of ecological water consumption. In addition, this study improved the evaluation method of oasis ESV based on the proportion of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of grasslands with different coverage, which is important for improving the environment in arid areas.

TI  - Monitoring Cadmium Content in the Leaves of Field Pepper and Eggplant in a Karst Area Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to quickly and non-destructively monitor the cadmium (Cd) content in agricultural crops is the basic premise of effective prevention and control of Cd contamination in agricultural products. Hyperspectral technology provides a solution for this issue. The potential capability for the spectral prediction of the Cd content in the leaves of pepper and eggplant in the field was explored, and a spectral prediction model of the Cd content in these leaves was established. In this study, based on the indoor spectrum, the sensitive wavebands for predicting the Cd content in leaves were determined preliminarily by correlation analysis. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine regression (SVMR) were used to establish spectral prediction models, and the final sensitive wavebands were determined by the size of the model index. The results show that the SVMR model exhibited higher prediction accuracy than the PLSR model. The RPDp (relative percent different of prediction set) values of the best SVMR prediction models for the pepper leaves and the eggplant leaves were 1.82 and 1.49, respectively. The values of Rp(2) (coefficient of determination of prediction set), which can quantitatively estimate the Cd content in leaves, were 0.897 (p < 0.01) and 0.726 (p < 0.01), respectively. This study demonstrated that the leaf spectra of pepper and eggplant in the field can be used to predict the Cd content in leaves, providing a reference for monitoring the Cd content in the fruits of pepper and eggplant in the future.

TI  - Determination of the appropriate zone on dam surface for floating photovoltaic system installation using RS and GISc technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to reveal suitable places where floating photovoltaic-solar power plants (FPVSPPs) can be installed on the dam surface using the possibilities of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information science (GISc) technologies. Past satellite images from Landsat and Sentinel platforms allow researchers to analyse shoreline changes in the dam surface. Shoreline extraction is a crucial process for the FPV-SPP to stay afloat despite external constraints. In this study, changes in dam water levels were determined by classifying 20-year satellite images and analysing a 32-year global surface water dynamics dataset. The water surface area was calculated as 1,562.40 ha using the random forest (RF) algorithm and the normalized differences water index (NDWI) on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. In addition, solar analysis was carried out with GISc using annual solar radiation maps shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) data, which directly affects the energy production of FPVSPPs. It has been calculated that the solar radiation on the water surface varies between 1,554 kWh/m2-year and 1,875 kWh/m2-year. These calculated values were divided into five different classes, and it was observed that 88.5% of the dam surface had a very high level of solar radiation compared to other areas. Higher efficiency will be obtained from the FPV-SPP to be installed in this region compared to the systems to be installed in other regions. It has been observed that the radiation values in other parts of the water surface are lower due to topographic shading. These analyses revealed energy zones with high production potential, thereby easing the decision-making process for investors planning to establish FPV-SPPs.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval from Multi-GNSS Reflectometry on FY-3E GNOS-II by Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflected GNSS signals at the L-band is significantly advantageous in soil moisture monitoring as they are sensitive to the dielectric properties determined by the volumetric water content of topsoil, and they can penetrate vegetation, except in very dense forests. The Global Navigation satellite system Occultation Sounder (GNOS-II) with a reflectometry technique onboard the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite, launched on 5 July 2021, is the first mission that can receive reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals from GPS, BeiDou and Galileo systems. This paper presents the soil moisture retrieval results from the FY-3E GNOS-II mission using 16 months of data. In this study, the reflectivity observations from different GNSS systems were firstly intercalibrated with some differences analyzed. Observations were also corrected by considering vegetation attenuation for 16 different land cover classifications. Finally, an empirical model was constructed for volumetric soil moisture (VSM) estimation, where the reflectivity of GNOS-II was linearly related to the SMAP reference soil moisture for each 36 km ease grid. The overall root-mean-square error of the retrieved soil moisture is 0.049 compared with the SMAP product, and 0.054 compared with the in situ data. The results of the three GNSS systems show similar levels of accuracy. This paper, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of global soil moisture retrieval using multiple GNSS signals.

TI  - Surface Deformation Surrounding the 2021 Mw 7.2 Haiti Earthquake Illuminated InSAR Observations
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes pose a major threat to the people of Haiti, as tragically shown by the cata-strophic 2010 Mw 7.0 earthquake and more recently by the 2021 Mw 7.2 earthquake. Both events occurred within the transpressional Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone (EPGFZ), which runs through the southern peninsula of Haiti and is a major source of seismic hazard for the region. Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data are used to illuminate the ground deformation patterns associated with the 2021 event. The analysis of Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-2 InSAR data shows (1) the broad coseismic deformation field; (2) detailed secondary fault structures as far as 12 km from the main Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault (EPGF), which are active during and after the earthquake; and (3) postseismic shallow slip, which migrates along an similar to 40 km unruptured section of the EPGF for approximately two weeks following the earth-quake. The involvement of secondary faults in this rupture requires adjustments to the rep-resentation of hazard that assumes a simple segmented strike-slip EPGF. This work presents the first successful use of phase gradient techniques to map postseismic deformation in a vegetated region, which opens the door to future studies of a larger number of events in a wider variety of climates.

TI  - Fishery Resource Evaluation with Hydroacoustic and Remote Sensing in Yangjiang Coastal Waters in Summer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yangjiang coastal waters provide vital spawning grounds, feeding grounds, and nursery areas for many commercial fish species. It is important to understand the spatial distribution of fish for the management, development, and protection of fishery resources. In this study, an acoustic survey was conducted from 29 July to 5 June 2021. Meanwhile, remote sensing data were collected, including sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration (Chla), sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA). The spatial distribution of density and biomass of fish was analyzed based on acoustic survey data using the geostatistical method. Combining with remote sensing data, we explored the relation between fish density and the environment based on the GAMs model. The results showed that fish are mainly small individuals. The horizontal distri-bution of fish density had a characteristic of high nearshore and low offshore. In the vertical direc-tion, fish are mainly distributed in surface-middle layers in shallow waters (<10 m) and in middle-bottom layers in deeper waters (>10 m), respectively. The deviance explained in the optimal GAM model was 59.2%. SST, Chla, SSS, and longitude were significant factors influencing fish density distribu-tion with a contribution of 35.3%, 11.8%, 6.5%, and 5.6%, respectively. This study can pro-vide a scientific foundation and data support for rational developing and protecting fishery re-sources in Yangjiang coastal waters.

TI  - Analysis of the Winter AOD Trends over Iran from 2000 to 2020 and Associated Meteorological Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High aerosol levels pose severe air pollution and climate change challenges in Iran. Although regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) trends have been analyzed during the dusty season over Iran, the specific factors that are driving the spatio-temporal variations in winter AOD and the influence of meteorological dynamics on winter AOD trends remain unclear. This study analyzes the long-term AOD trends over Iran in winter during the period 2000-2020 using the updated Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. Our results showed that the winter AOD exhibited a significant upward trend during the period 2000-2010 followed by a significant decrease during the period 2010-2018. We found that the winter AOD trends are important over this arid region due to multiple meteorological mechanisms which also affect the following spring/summer dusty period. Ground-based observations from Aerosol Robotic Network data (AERONET) in the Middle East region display trends comparable to those of both MERRA-2 and MODIS and indicated that aeolian dust and the meteorological dynamics associated with it play a central role in winter AOD changes. Furthermore, this study indicated that a significant downward trend in winter sea level pressure (SLP) during the early period (2000-2010) induced hot and dry winds which originated in the desert regions in Iraq and Arabia and blew toward Iran, reducing relative humidity (RH) and raising the temperature and thus promoting soil drying and dust AOD accumulation. In contrast, a significant increase in winter SLP during the late period (2010-2018) induced cold and wet winds from northwestern regions which increased RH and lowered the temperature, thus reducing dust AOD. This suggests that the changes in AOD over Iran are highly influenced by seasonal meteorological variabilities. These results also highlight the importance of examining wintertime climatic variations and their effects on the dust aerosol changes over the Middle East.

TI  - Spatial Evolution and Multi-Scenario Simulation of Rural "Production-Ecological-Living" Space: A Case Study for Beijing, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the vigorous development of industrialization and urbanization, rural space faces many difficulties in achieving sustainable development, such as the spatial structure being unbalanced. To explore the sustainable development of rural space, this study evaluates the spatial evolution and multi-scenario simulation of rural space with reference to the three dominant functions of land use, namely "production-ecological-living" (PEL), based on the interpretation of land use remote sensing data in 2000, 2010, and 2020. The change characteristics and the formation mechanism of the territorial spatial pattern were quantitatively analyzed by gravity center transfer, territorial spatial transfer matrix, standard deviational ellipse, geo-detector, and artificial neural network CA simulation. The results showed that (1) from 2000 to 2020, the rural production space in Beijing continued to decrease, the rural living space continued to increase and then gradually contracted, and the rural ecological space as a whole also showed a downward trend. (2) During the study period, the formation and evolution of the ecological spatial pattern of rural production and living in Beijing were affected by both regional physical geographical factors and human, social, and economic factors, with significant differences; the interaction between two driving factors is stronger than that within a single factor, and the main mode of action is double factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement. (3) Compared with the other three scenarios, the performance of Beijing's rural space in 2030 under the harmonious development scenario is more compact and stable, the rural production space is basically guaranteed, the intensity of rural living space is enhanced, and the overall situation of rural ecological space is stable. Our results show that in the future decision-making of rural land and space development around a metropolis, we should fully consider the evolution law of rural spatial pattern, as well as the driving force of natural geographical factors and economic activity factors and discuss the optimization and overall management of rural production and living ecological space through multi-scenario spatial simulation.

TI  - Real-Time Moving Ship Detection from Low-Resolution Large-Scale Remote Sensing Image Sequence
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing ship target detection has become an essential means of ocean supervision, coastal defense, and frontier defense. Accurate, effective, fast, and real-time remote sensing data processing is the critical technology in this field. This paper proposes a real-time detection algorithm for moving targets in low-resolution wide-area remote sensing images, which includes four steps: pre-screening, simplified HOG feature identification, sequence correlation identification, and facilitated Yolo identification. It can effectively detect and track targets in low-resolution sequence data. Firstly, iterative morphological processing was used to improve the contrast of low-resolution ship target profile edge features compared with the sea surface background. Next, the target area after adaptive segmentation was used to eliminate false alarms. As a result, the invalid background information of extensive comprehensive data was quickly eliminated. Then, support vector machine classification of S-HOG feature was carried out for suspected targets, and interference such as islands and reefs, broken clouds, and waves were eliminated according to the shape characteristics of ship targets. The method of multi-frame data association and searching for adjacent target information between frames was adopted to eliminate the interference of static targets and broken clouds with similar contours. Finally, the sequential marks were further trained and learned, and further false alarm elimination was completed based on the clipped Yolo network. Compared with the traditional Yolo Tiny V2/V3 series network, this method had higher computational speed and better detection performance. The F1 number of detection results was increased by 3%, and the calculation time was reduced by 66%.

TI  - Wheat Lodging Segmentation Based on Lstm_PSPNet Deep Learning Network
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging is one of the major issues that seriously affects wheat quality and yield. To obtain timely and accurate wheat lodging information and identify the potential factors leading to lodged wheat in wheat breeding programs, we proposed a lodging-detecting model coupled with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image features of wheat at multiple plant growth stages. The UAV was used to collect canopy images and ground lodging area information at five wheat growth stages. The PSPNet model was improved by combining the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) timing model, inserting the convolutional attention module (CBAM) and the Tversky loss function. The effect of the improved PSPNet network model in monitoring wheat lodging under different image sizes and different growth stages was investigated. The experimental results show that (1) the improved Lstm_PSPNet model was more effective in lodging prediction, and the precision reached 0.952; (2) choosing an appropriate image size could improve the segmentation accuracy, with the optimal image size in this study being 468 x 468; and (3) the model of Lstm_PSPNet improved its segmentation accuracy sequentially from early flowering to late maturity, and the three evaluation metrics increased sequentially from 0.932 to 0.952 for precision, from 0.912 to 0.940 for recall, and from 0.922 to 0.950 for F1-Score, with good extraction at mid and late reproductive stages. Therefore, the lodging information extraction model proposed in this study can make full use of temporal sequence features to improve image segmentation accuracy and effectively extract lodging areas at different growth stages. The model can provide more comprehensive reference and technical support for monitoring the lodging of wheat crops at different growth stages.

TI  - Statistical Characteristics of the Multiscale SST Fractal Structure over the Kuroshio Extension Region Using VIIRS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean behaves as a typical multiscale fractal structure, whose dynamic and thermal variabilities extend over a wide range of spatial scales, r, spanning from 10(-3) to 10(7) m. Studying the statistical characteristics of multiscale fractal structures is crucial to understanding the interactions and energy cascade processes between different spatial scales. Remote sensing data are one of the best choices for revealing these statistical characteristics. This work analyzes the multiscale (1-1000 km) fractal structures of sea surface temperature (SST) from the Level-2+ (L2P) satellite orbit Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) products over the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region (145 degrees E-160 degrees W, 20 degrees N-50 degrees N), using a conventional method (second-order structure function, D(r)) and a newly developed statistical method (spatial variance, V(r)). The results show that both the power-law distribution slopes of D(r) and V(r) are close to 2/3, which is equivalent to the -5/3 wavenumber spectrum. V(r) is found to be more robust when depicting the fractal structure and variance density, V'(r), compared with D(r). V'(r) is slightly larger at the mesoscale (50-150 km) than at the large scale (higher than 150 km) and is much smaller than that at the submesoscale (smaller than 50 km). Additionally, V'(r) has an indiscernible diurnal variation but remarkable seasonal and latitudinal variations. For the seasonal variability, the maximum V'(r) appears in winter at the large scale and mesoscale, and gradually shifts towards spring at the submesoscale, which implies that a forward energy cascade process may occur during this period. The maximum of the latitude-dependent V'(r) appears around 40 degrees N for all the scales. It is consistent with the latitude of the strongest background SST gradient, indicating that the background SST front is the main source of the strong SST multiscale spatial variabilities over the KE region. This work benefits the application of other high-resolution remote sensing data in this research field, including the forthcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite product.

TI  - Research on the Applicability of Transformer Model in Remote-Sensing Image Segmentation
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformer models have achieved great results in the field of computer vision over the past 2 years, drawing attention from within the field of remote sensing. However, there are still relatively few studies on this model in the field of remote sensing. Which method is more suitable for remote-sensing segmentation? In particular, how do different transformer models perform in the face of high-spatial resolution and the multispectral resolution of remote-sensing images? To explore these questions, this paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three mainstream transformer models, including the segmentation transformer (SETRnet), SwinUnet, and TransUnet, by evaluating three aspects: a visual analysis of feature-segmentation results, accuracy, and training time. The experimental results show that the transformer structure has obvious advantages for the feature-extraction ability of large-scale remote-sensing data sets and ground objects, but the segmentation performance of different transfer structures in different scales of remote-sensing data sets is also very different. SwinUnet exhibits better global semantic interaction and pixel-level segmentation prediction on the large-scale Potsdam data set, and the SwinUnet model has the highest accuracy metrics for KAPPA, MIoU, and OA in the Potsdam data set, at 76.47%, 63.62%, and 85.01%, respectively. TransUnet has better segmentation results in the small-scale Vaihingen data set, and the three accuracy metrics of KAPPA, MIoU, and OA are the highest, at 80.54%, 56.25%, and 85.55%, respectively. TransUnet is better able to handle the edges and details of feature segmentation thanks to the network structure together built by its transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Therefore, TransUnet segmentation accuracy is higher when using a small-scale Vaihingen data set. Compared with SwinUnet and TransUnet, the segmentation performance of SETRnet in different scales of remote-sensing data sets is not ideal, so SETRnet is not suitable for the research task of remote-sensing image segmentation. In addition, this paper discusses the reasons for the performance differences between transformer models and discusses the differences between transformer models and CNN. This study further promotes the application of transformer models in remote-sensing image segmentation, improves the understanding of transformer models, and helps relevant researchers to select a more appropriate transformer model or model improvement method for remote-sensing image segmentation.

TI  - Multi-Feature-Based Identification of Subtropical Evergreen Tree Species Using Gaofen-2 Imagery and Algorithm Comparison
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The species and distribution of trees in a forest are critical to the understanding of forest ecosystem processes and the development of forest management strategies. Subtropical forest landscapes feature a complex canopy structure and high stand density. Studies on the effects of classification algorithms on the remote sensing-based identification of tree species are few. GF-2 is the first satellite in China with sub-meter accuracy which has the high resolution and short replay cycle. Here, we considered three representative tree types (Masson pine, Chinese fir, and broadleaved evergreen trees) in the southern subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest region of China as research objects. We quantitatively compared the effects of five machine learning algorithms, including the backpropagation neural network, k-nearest neighbour, polytomous logistic regression, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), and four features (vegetation index, band reflectance, textural features, and topographic factors) on tree species identification using Gaofen-2 panchromatic and multispectral remote sensing images and field survey data. All five classification algorithms could effectively identify major tree species in subtropical forest areas (overall accuracy [OA] > 87.40%, kappa coefficient > 81.08%). The SVM model exhibited the best identification ability (OA = 90.27%, kappa coefficient = 85.37%), followed by RF (OA = 88.90%, Kappa coefficient = 83.30%). The combination of band reflectance, vegetation index, and the topographic factor performed exhibited the best, followed by the combination of band reflectance, vegetation index, textural feature, and topographic factor. In addition, we find that the classifier constructed by a single feature is not as effective as the combination of multiple feature factors. The addition of topographic factors can significantly improve the ability of tree species identification. According to the results of the five classifiers, the separability of the three tree species was good. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy of Masson pine were more than 90%, and the evergreen broad-leaved tree and Chinese fir were more than 80%. The commission errors and omission errors of the three tree species were evergreen broadleaved tree > Chinese fir > Masson pine. The variable importance assessment results showed that the normalized difference greenness index, altitude, and the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index were the key variables. The results of this study used GF-2 to accurately identify the main tree species of subtropical evergreen forests in China, which can help forest managers to regularly monitor tree species composition and provide theoretical support for forest managers to formulate policies, monitor sustainable plans for wood mining, and forest conservation and management measures.

TI  - Radiance consistency and deviation characteristics in the regions of overlap between three new-generation GEO meteorological satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of multi-source Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites can realize simultaneous global observation with high frequency, which is significant to fine weather forecast and global climate change research. Here the radiance consistency and deviation characterization in the overlapping regions are analysed for three new generation GEO satellites, including the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite, the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-17 (GOES-17) and the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard FengYun satellite-4A (FY-4A). The result shows that the radiance has higher consistency for visible and near-infrared (VNIR) channels with correlation coefficient r > 0.98 than infrared (IR) channels with r > 0.90 in the overlapping regions of different GEO satellites. For FY-4A & Himawari-8, the average percentage deviation (APD) of VNIR channels is 5.54%-9.03%. The brightness temperature (BT) bias of IR channels is 1.16 K-2.50 K. For GOES-17 & Himawari-8, the APD of VNIR channels is 4.48%-6.71%, and the BT bias of IR channels is 0.96 K -2.76 K. Solar-viewing geometries significantly influence the radiance deviation in the over regions. The future work is to design a radiance fusion method and achieve cloud detection in ample space with high frequency by combining multi-source GEO satellites.

TI  - An Influence of Snow Covers on the Radar Interferometry Observations of Industrial Infrastructure: Norilsk Thermal Power Plant Case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This manuscript presents the results of the study of snow covers' influence on the interferometric measurements of the stability of industrial infrastructure in the vicinity of Norilsk city, Russia. Fuel tanks of the Norilsk thermal power plant (TPP) were selected as an object of study due to a well-known accident when about 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled from one of the tanks. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data acquired over the territory of Norilsk TPP were used in the DInSAR study of the possible displacements of the tanks that could be the cause of the tank's damage. For twelve days, radar interferograms that were generated in the study covered the cold and warm seasons of 2018-2020, including the catastrophic event-the rupture of the tank with diesel fuel-in order to shed light on the possible impact of the area subsidence because of permafrost thaw under the tanks. As the tank walls and adjacent concrete base constituted the virtual dihedral corner reflector, the accumulation of snow on the surface near the tanks created a distorting effect on the results of monitoring the stability of the tank's location. Three models of snow layer within the dihedral proposed could help explain the deviations in the signal amplitude and phase in the case of snowfalls occurring between radar observations. We propose three ways to minimize the influence of snow on interferometric measurements. One of them, the selection of the radar data acquired in proper observation conditions, made it possible to assess the stability of the mutual location of the tanks. Among the most important processing and analysis results in the paper is a conclusion about the high stability of the fuel tank's location on the yearly time interval, including the troubleshooting tank.

TI  - Species-Specific Contribution to Atmospheric Carbon and Pollutant Removal: Case Studies in Two Italian Municipalities
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to maximize ecosystem services (ES), a proper planning of urban green areas is needed. In this study, the urban greenery of two Italian cities (Milan and Bologna) exposed to high levels of atmospheric pollutants was examined. Vegetation maps were developed through a supervised classification algorithm, trained over remote sensing images, integrated by local trees inventory, and used as input for the AIRTREE multi-layer canopy model. In both cities, a large presence of deciduous broadleaves was found, which showed a higher capacity to sequestrate CO2 (3,953,280 g m(2) y(-1)), O-3 (5677.76 g m(2) y(-1)), and NO2 (2358.30 g m(2) y(-1)) when compared to evergreen needle leaves that, on the other hand, showed higher performances in particulate matter removal (14,711.29 g m(2) y(-1) and 1964.91 g m(2) y(-1) for PM10 and PM2,5, respectively). We identified tree species with the highest carbon uptake capacity with values up to 1025.47 g CO2 m(2) y(-1) for Celtis australis, Platanus x acerifolia, Ulmus pumila, and Quercus rubra. In light of forthcoming and unprecedent policy measures to plant millions of trees in the urban areas, our study highlights the importance of developing an integrated approach that combines modelling and satellite data to link air quality and the functionality of green plants as key elements in improving the delivery of ES in cities.

TI  - Airborne Millimeter-Wave InSAR Terrain Mapping Experiments Based on Automatic Extraction and Interferometric Calibration of Tie-Points
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited by meteorological conditions, airspace, complex terrain and other factors, airborne millimeter-wave InSAR will inevitably face the situation of no control point layout when acquiring terrain data in the difficult mapping areas in Southwest China, which increases the difficulty of subsequent data processing. Moreover, the layout of control points in difficult mapping areas consumes a lot of manpower and time, which is not suitable for large-scale high-precision topographic mapping. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an automatic extraction of tie-points and interferometric calibration technology based on tie-points. This technology develops the automatic extraction algorithm of tie-points based on SAR + SIFT + RANSAC to obtain evenly distributed tie-points of adjacent images, and uses the evenly distributed tie-points as real known points to recalibrate the interference parameters, then carries out elevation transfer and elevation inversion through the tie-points of overlapping areas, thus realizing high-precision mapping without control points for airborne millimeter-wave InSAR. This paper uses measured data to verify the technology, and compares it with the areas with control points and marking points. The comparison results of elevation accuracy prove the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. This paper also discusses the difficulties in the treatment of typical areas, such as water areas, urban areas and mountain areas, and gives reasonable solutions that have good engineering application value.

TI  - Forest Land Resource Information Acquisition with Sentinel-2 Image Utilizing Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Decision Trees and Multi-Layer Perceptron
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forestry work involves scientific management and the effective utilization of forest land resources, and finding economical, efficient and accurate acquisition methods for forest land resource information. In previous land-use classification research, machine learning algorithms have achieved good results, and Sentinel public data have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a paucity of research using these data to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms in the extracting of complex forest land resource information. Using the Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral image data, the spectral reflectance, vegetation index characteristics and image texture characteristics of different forest land resources in the study area were calculated and compared. Then, based on three groups of features, the performances of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), decision trees (DT) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) were examined and compared to identify and classify forest land resource types. The research indicates the following: (1) The SVM algorithm achieved the highest OA (95.8%). The average accuracy of the SVM algorithm was much higher than other algorithms (SVM 88.3%, KNN 87.5, RF 85.3%, MLP 85.00% and DT 77.5%). (2) The classification accuracies of each algorithm for coniferous forests were relatively high, and the recognition accuracy was above 95%, whereas the classification accuracies of the other categories varied greatly. (3) Adding texture features can improve the accuracy of the five algorithms. This study reports new references for the qualitative methods of forest land resource distribution. It has also produced more efficient and accurate acquisitions of forest land resource information, scientific management and effective use of forest land resources.

TI  - Study on Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Fuzhou Built-Up Area Based on Remote Sensing Data of Nighttime Light
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to grasp the spatio-temporal characteristics and expansion mechanism of urban built-up areas for formulating urban development strategy. This paper takes the built-up area of Fuzhou as the study area, uses multi-temporal Landsat images and remote sensing data of nighttime light (NTL) as the main data sources, and extracts the built-up area of NTL images with a higher spatial resolution comparison method. It discusses the development trends of the Fuzhou built-up area from 2000 to 2021 from the perspectives of temporal and spatial evolution characteristics and spatial morphology evolution and analyzes the relationship between population factors, economic factors, natural conditions, policy factors, and urban expansion. The results show that the urbanization level of Fuzhou is gradually improving, and the compounded nighttime light index (CNLI) increases from 0.0105 in 2000 to 0.0635 in 2021. The trend of expansion speed and expansion intensity is consistent, showing the changing trend of first fast and then slow, then accelerating and then slowing down. The expansion direction presents the trend of "expanding eastward, advancing southward and expanding westward", the spatial form tends to be irregular, and the migration range of the center of gravity is not significant. Population factors, economic factors, and expansion are positively correlated and closely related, and natural conditions and policy guidance affect the direction and mode of the expansion of the built-up area. The above results indicate that the overall urban development of Fuzhou shows an upward trend, which is consistent with the planned urbanization development trend of Fuzhou.

TI  - Extraction of Planting Structure of Winter Wheat Using GBDT and Google Earth Engine
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the fragmented planting landscape and complex planting structure of Chinese farmland, achieving high accuracy identification of target crops is of great importance for subsequent crop yield estimation, grain policy adjustment and national food security guarantee. Based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) remote sensing data processing cloud platform, this study proposes a planting structure extraction method applicable to different fertility stages of winter wheat. The method adopts multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images covering key fertility stages of winter wheat in 2021 as the data source, and integrating multi-dimensional feature variables, including spectral band features, index features, texture features and topographic features. In this study, the GBDT (gradient boosting decision tree) classifier was employed to extract the planting area and spatial distribution information of winter wheat at different fertility stages at the field scale. The best fertility period for winter wheat identification was discussed. In addition, the crop recognition performance of different common classification models at the field scale was compared and analyzed. The experiments were conducted in Chengu Town, Henan Province, China, and the experimental results showed that the accuracy of planting area recognition was relatively high in the standing and jointing stage (3.114.10) of winter wheat, with an overall classification accuracy of 94.61% and a Kappa coefficient of 92.68%. The highest recognition accuracy was achieved in the heading and flowering stage (4.115.10), with an overall classification accuracy of 97.01% and a Kappa coefficient was 95.52%; however, the classification accuracy was low in grain-filling and milky stage (5.116.10), with an overall classification accuracy of 86.23% and a Kappa coefficient of 81.33%. The results showed that the GBDT classifier could effectively extract land cover information under field-scale conditions and achieve better feature classification recognition during winter wheats heading and flowering stage. In addition, this study compared GBDT with traditional classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), CART (classification and regression tree) and Naive Bayesian (NB). The results show that the GBDT classifier has the best performance in feature recognition, with an overall classification accuracy of 1.20 and 5.99 percentage points higher than the RF and CART classifiers, respectively, and a Kappa coefficient of 1.61 and 8.04 percentage points higher than the RF and CART classifiers, respectively. Moreover, the NB classifier has the worst recognition precision, with an overall classification accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 84.43% and 78.69%, respectively. The results of this study can provide effective technical support for fine-grained crop extraction at the field scale.

TI  - Evolution of Small and Micro Wetlands and Their Driving Factors in the Yangtze River Delta-A Case Study of Wuxi Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the long-term dynamics and driving factors behind small and micro wetlands is critical for their management and future sustainability. This study explored the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on the spatiotemporal evolution of these areas in Wuxi area using the support vector machine (SVM) classification method and the geographic detector model based on Landsat satellite image data from 1985 to 2020. The results revealed that: (1) Natural wetlands were prominent in Wuxi area, with an average proportion of 70%, and although they exhibited a downward trend over the last ten years, the scale of natural small and micro wetlands increased 1.5-fold-from 4349.59 hm(2) in 1985 to 10,841.59 hm(2) in 2020. (2) The small and micro wetlands in Wuxi area had obvious seasonal variations, with most being 0.1-1 hm(2) and 1-3 hm(2), respectively. From the perspective of spatial distribution, they were primarily distributed in Yixing district, which accounts for 34% of Wuxi area. (3) The distribution of small and micro wetlands was systematically affected by natural and human activities. The main factors that affected the distribution of small and micro wetlands were the average annual temperature and GDP, with the interactions between all factors being nonlinear and bi-linear. The influences of natural factors on small and micro wetlands were weakened, with human activities steadily emerging as the dominant factor that affected their distribution. The results of this study can provide supportive data and a scientific basis for the ecological restoration and protection of wetlands.

TI  - Monitoring Land Subsidence along the Subways in Shanghai on the Basis of Time-Series InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Shanghai has entered a stage of microscale land subsidence, but the uneven subsidence is still significant, with long-term impacts on the operational safety of subways and other infrastructures. On the basis of 154 high-resolution Terra Synthetic Aperture Radar-X (TerraSAR-X) images captured from 2013 to 2020 and the time-series persistent scatterer-interferometric SAR (PS-InSAR) method, the land subsidence along the subways in Shanghai was acquired, and the levelling data of 56 benchmarks were used to validate the measurements derived by PS-InSAR. The results indicated that the two data sets agreed well, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and maximum D-value of 4.0 mm derived from six pairs of comparative data sequences. The proportion of PS points showing deformation rates between -3.0 mm/a and 3.0 mm/a reached 99.4%. These results indicated that the land subsidence trend along the subway was relatively stable overall, while significant deformation was distributed mainly along the suburban subways, especially the lines that were newly open to traffic, such as Line 5 and the Pujiang line (PJ Line); along these lines, the proportions of PS points with deformation rates exceeding +/- 3 mm/a were 7.2% and 7.6%, respectively, and the proportions were much smaller in the other lines. The maximum cumulative deformation (MCD) along the subways was located between Jiangchuan Road Station and Xidu Station of Line 5 with a value of -66.4 mm, while the second and third MCDs were -48.2 mm along Line 16 and -44.5 mm along PJ Line, respectively. Engineering constructions, such as human-induced ground loads, foundation pit constructions, and road constructions, were the main factors affecting local land subsidence. The analysis results also showed that land subsidence was relatively significant during the period before the subways were open to traffic due to subway construction, while land subsidence clearly slowed after the subway lines were open to traffic. This deceleration in land subsidence was closely related to the rise in the groundwater level.

TI  - A Data-constrained Scheme for the Reconstruction of Solar Wind Parameters in the Inner Heliosphere
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of our industrial society, the reconstruction of solar wind parameters in the inner heliosphere becomes very important to understanding the interplanetary propagation of various types of space weather disturbance. However, the situ observations of solar wind parameters are only applicable to several points where spacecraft are located. Therefore, we have to rely on the numerical technologies to reconstruct the solar wind parameters. The scheme for the reconstruction of solar wind parameters can be classified into two categories: one is based on the remote-sensing data at the Sun, and the other is based on the in situ data at 1 au. In this paper, the solar wind parameters in the inner heliosphere are reconstructed with magnetohydrodynamic simulations from 20 R ( s ) to 1 au. The inner boundary conditions are constrained by Wind observations at 1 au. The modeled results are compared with data from multispacecraft observations, such as those by Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory A and B. The results show that the solar wind parameters obtained with this new scheme agree with the in situ observations much better, which will provide a more realistic configuration for the study of various types of space weather disturbance in future.

TI  - A Novel Mine-Specific Eco-Environment Index (MSEEI) for Mine Ecological Environment Monitoring Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The excessive exploitation of mineral resources will lead to environmental pollution, resource depletion, environmental disaster, and other problems. The contradiction between the environment and development, and the management of the ecological environment in mining areas are urgent p-problems to be solved. An ecological environment assessment is an important part of the ecological environment in a mining area. The accurate evaluation of the ecological environment is the premise behind environmental governance in a mining area. However, current ecological assessment indicators were not developed specifically for mine environment monitoring and, thus, cannot provide an effective and comprehensive assessment of the mineral environment. To this end, in order to improve the environmental monitoring performance in mining areas, a novel Mine-Specific Eco-Environment Index (MSEEI) was proposed, integrating factors from five main aspects associated with minerals, including temperature, vegetation, soil moisture, atmospheric environment, and mining scale. Meanwhile, a widely concerned mine-Luanchuan mine-was used as the case area to test the performance of our MSEEI. The results showed a significant correlation between RSEI and MSEEI (p < 0.01). The mean correlation achieved between RSEI and MSEEI was 0.91, which was much higher than the correlations between RSEI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil moisture monitoring index (SMMI), normalized difference built-up and soil index (NDBSI), PM2.5 concentration (DI), and heat (LST). In addition, based on our long-term MSEEI results of Luanchuan mine from 1997 to 2021, the ecological status of Luanchuan mine showed a trend of first declining and then rising. Specifically, the MSEEI first declined from 0.85 to 0.77 between 1997 and 2012, and then rebounded to about 0.8 in recent years. The MSEEI exhibited a good applicability in the ecological assessment of mining areas. Our MSEEI can provide useful guidance for mine environment monitoring. MSEEI can directly reflect the ecological damage after mining, provide scientific guidance for the exploitation and utilization of mineral resources, and promote the protection and sustainable development of Earth's resources and mine ecological environments.

TI  - The Potential of Monitoring Carbon Dioxide Emission in a Geostationary View with the GIIRS Meteorological Hyperspectral Infrared Sounder
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the help of various polar-orbiting environment observing platforms, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been well established on a global scale. However, the spatial and temporal pattern of the CO2 emission and its flux dependence on daily human activity processes are not yet well understood. One of the limiting factors could be attributed to the low revisit time frequency of the polar orbiting satellites. With high revisiting frequency and CO2-sensitive spectrum, the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the Chinese FY-4A and FY-4B satellites have the potential to measure the CO2 concentration at a higher temporal frequency than polar-orbiting satellites. To provide a prototypical demonstration on the CO2 monitoring capability using GIIRS observations, a hybrid-3D variational data assimilation system is established in this research and a one-month-long experiment is conducted. The evaluations against the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) analysis field and Orbiting Carbon Observatory -2/-3 (OCO-2/-3) CO2 retrieval products reveal that assimilating GIIRS observations can reduce the first guess's CO2 concentration mean bias and standard deviation, especially over the lower troposphere (975-750 hPa) and improve the diurnal variation of near surface CO2 concentration.

TI  - Aerosol Information Retrieval from GF-5B DPC Data over North China Using the Dark Dense Vegetation Algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A directional polarimetric camera (DPC) is a key payload on board China's Gaofen 5B (hereafter denoted as GF-5B) satellite, a hyperspectral observation instrument for monitoring aerosols. On the basis of the dark dense vegetation (DDV) algorithm, this study applied DDV algorithm to DPC measurements. First, the reflectance of vegetation in three channels (0.443, 0.49, and 0.675 mu m) was analyzed, and inversion channels were identified. Subsequently, the decrease in normalized difference vegetation index associated with various view angles was simulated, and the optimal view angle for extracting dark pixels was determined. Finally, the top-of-atmosphere reflectance at different view angles was simulated to determine the optimal view angle for aerosol inversion. The inversion experiments were conducted by using DPC data collected over North China from November 2021 to January 2022. The results revealed that DDV algorithm could monitor pollution from 30 December 2021 to 4 January 2022, and the inversion results were strongly correlated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol product and AERONET station data (R > 0.85).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity of Forest Fire Occurrence Based on Remote Sensing Data: An Analysis in Anhui, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A forest fire is a destructive disaster that is difficult to handle and rescue and can pose a significant threat to ecosystems, society, and humans. Since driving factors and their effects on forest fires change over time and space, exploring the spatiotemporal patterns of forest fire occurrence should be addressed. To better understand the patterns of forest fire occurrence and provide valuable insights for policy making, we employed the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model to investigate the varying spatiotemporal correlations between driving factors (vegetation, topography, meteorology, social economy) and forest fires in Anhui province from 2012 to 2020. Then we identified the dominant factors and conducted the spatiotemporal distribution analysis. Moreover, we innovatively introduced nighttime light as a socioeconomic driving factor of forest fires since it can directly reflect more comprehensive information about the social economy than other socioeconomic factors commonly used in previous studies. This study applied remote sensing data since the historical statistic data were not detailed. Here, we obtained the following results. (1) There was a spatial autocorrelation of forest fires in Anhui from 2012 to 2020, with high-high aggregation of forest fires in eastern cities. (2) The GTWR model outperformed the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model and the Geographically Weighted Regression model (GWR), implying the necessity of considering temporal heterogeneity in addition to spatial heterogeneity. (3) The relationships between driving factors and forest fires were spatially and temporally heterogeneous. (4) The forest fire occurrence was mainly dominated by socioeconomic factors, while the dominant role of vegetation, topography, and meteorology was relatively limited. It's worth noting that nighttime light played the most extensive dominant role in forest fires of Anhui among all the driving factors in the years except 2015.

TI  - Deformation Monitoring and Trend Analysis of Reservoir Bank Landslides by Combining Time-Series InSAR and Hurst Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides along the Three Gorges Reservoir in China pose a threat to coastal residents and waterway safety. To reduce false positive misjudgments caused by a sudden local change in the landslide deformation curve, in this paper, we propose an effective method for predicting the deformation trend of reservoir bank landslides. We take reservoir bank landslides in the Wanzhou District of the Three Gorges Reservoir area as the research object. The Time-Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) method and 62 Sentinel-1A images from 2018 to 2022 were selected for landslide deformation monitoring, and the Hurst index was calculated to characterize the deformation trend. Furthermore, we propose a method for predicting the deformation trend based on the statistical distribution of deformation rates and the physical significance of the Hurst index. After the field survey and Global Positioning System (GPS) verification, the Time-Series InSAR results are shown to be reliable. We take the Sifangbei landslide as a representative case to analyze the validation results. It is found that the determined Sifangbei landslide deformation trend is consistent with the conclusions for the region. In addition, the deformation trend of a reservoir bank slope has obvious spatial and temporal differences. Changes in the reservoir water level and concentrated rainfall play roles similar to those of catalysts. The proposed method, involving the combination of Time-Series InSAR and the Hurst index, can effectively monitor deformation and predict the stability trend of reservoir bank landslides. The presented research results provide new ideas and solutions for landslide prevention and risk mitigation in reservoir areas.

TI  - Construction of Urban Thermal Environment Network Based on Land Surface Temperature Downscaling and Local Climate Zones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has become undeniable that global land surface temperature (LST) has continued to rise in recent years. The threat of extreme heat to humans has become self-evident, especially in arid regions. Many studies have clarified the temperature rise/fall mechanism of LST from the perspective of influencing factors. However, there are few studies on mitigating LST from the standpoint of regional networks. This paper first combines Landsat 8 with Sentinel-2 imagery for LST downscaling based on the Google Earth engine as a way to match local climate zone (LCZ) with 17 classification types. Then, the thermal environment resistance surface is constructed according to LCZ, and the essential cold sources are identified using morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and circuit theory to form the thermal environment green corridor and obtain the pinch point and barrier point areas. The results show that (1) The downscaling of LST based on random forest (RF) for the Urumqi-Changji-Wujiaqu metropolitan area has an R-2 of 0.860 and an RMSE of 3.23, with high downscaling accuracy. (2) High temperature (HT), medium temperature (MT), and low temperature (LT) have the largest proportions in the study area; HT dominates in Urumqi, LT in Changji, and MT in Wujiaqu. (3) The natural types (LCZ-D, LCZ-C, and LCZ-F) in the LCZ classification occupy a large area, and the building types are mainly concentrated in Urumqi; LCZ-D, LCZ-G, and LCZ-A contribute the most to the cooling of LST, and LCZ-F, LCZ-C, and LCZ-10 contribute the most to the warming of LST. (4) After identifying critical cold source patches according to MSPA to arrive at 253 green corridors, subsensitive corridors and sensitive corridors need to take certain measures to prevent corridor blockage; pinch point areas, as well as barrier point areas, need to be protected and repaired according to their respective characteristics. In summary, corresponding cooling measures to specific areas can improve the connectivity between cooling sources and slow down the temperature increase of the whole area. This study and experimental approach can provide new insights for urban planners and climate researchers.

TI  - Mapping the representativeness of precipitation measurements in Mainland China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological observations provide essential data for weather forecasting and climate change studies. Whether the measured data can accurately support such applications closely relates to the representativeness of the data collected, which depends on both the scale of observation and the density of the measurement network. Precipitation presents in the form of events and is discontinuous both in time and space. Gauge observations of precipitation could provide fundamental data but have difficulty quantitatively assessing precipitation system scale. Therefore, assessments on the representativeness of precipitation at synoptic and climatological scales remain needed. Here, we show the first high-resolution map of the representativeness of precipitation over Mainland China based on the latest satellite data. Our results show that the daily precipitation spatial consistency is the highest in eastern China and lowest on the Tibetan Plateau. However, the pattern of the monthly spatial consistency is different and is the highest over Northeast China Plain, the Loess Plateau, and the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain. Compared to the density of rain gauges, we find that the current national station network with similar to 2400 stations still has difficulty supporting synoptic studies in western China. However, for climate change studies based on monthly data, the density of the national reference climatological station network is sufficient, except in the western Tibetan Plateau and deserts with no available stations. For climatological studies, the quality of precipitation gauge observations is more important than its spatial density. Our results could provide great practical significance for considering the layout of rain gauges.

TI  - Investigation of lake shrinkage attributed to climate change over the past 33 years in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner Mongolia, located in northern China and bordered by Mongolia and Russia, has numerous lakes. Constrained by water scarcity, precious lakes play key roles in degraded grassland ecosystems and the social and economic development of Inner Mongolia. This study combines 1815 Landsat image interpretations and ground-based surveys to track the area changes in 573 lakes in Inner Mongolia during the period 1987-2019. Our results demonstrate that the number of dried-up lakes increased by 0.87 per year, the number of lakes with water areas below 0.1 -km(2) increased by 1.02 per year, and the number of lakes with water areas between 0.1 and 1 -km(2) increased by 0.39 per year. The number of lakes with areas larger than 1 -km(2) shows a decreased or fluctuating trend. The lake area in Inner Mongolia increased at a rate of 7.04 -km(2)/year from 1987 to 1998 but then shows an overall decreasing trend at a rate of 0.71 -km(2)/year over the next 20 years. The period from 1999 to 2010 was the most serious period of lake shrinkage in Inner Mongolia in the past 30 years, with a shrinkage rate of 33.99 -km(2)/year. The climate changes from wet to dry and from dry to wet are the main reasons for the breakpoint occurrence of the lake area time series in the 2000s and 2010s, respectively. The response of lake area changes to climate-related factors has significant regional differences. In addition, intensification of human activities, such as the rapid development of livestock and coal mining, is also the main driver of lake change. The multiple regression model shows that the contribution of climate-related variables and human activity-related variables to the change in lake area over the 1987-2019 time period was about 40% and 60%, respectively.

TI  - Construction of an Integrated Drought Monitoring Model Based on Deep Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the major global natural disasters, and appropriate monitoring systems are essential to reveal drought trends. In this regard, deep learning is a very promising approach for characterizing the non-linear nature of drought factors. We used multi-source remote sensing data such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data to integrate drought impact factors such as precipitation, vegetation, temperature, and soil moisture. The application of convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) to construct an integrated drought monitoring model was proposed and tested, using the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as an example. To better compare the monitoring performance of ConvLSTM models, three other classical deep learning models and three classical machine learning models were also used for comparison. The results show that the composite drought index (CDI) output by the ConvLSTM model had a consistent high correlation with the drought rating of the multi-scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The correlation coefficients between the CDI and the multi-scale standardized precipitation index (SPI) were all above 0.5 (p < 0.01), which was highly significant, and the correlation coefficient between CDI-1 and the monthly soil relative humidity at a 10 cm depth was above 0.45 (p < 0.01), which was well correlated. In addition, the spatial distribution of the CDI-6 simulated by the model was highly correlated with the degree of drought expressed by the SPEI-6 observations at the stations. This study provides a new approach for integrated regional drought monitoring.

TI  - Disturbance of Wind Damage and Insect Outbreaks in the Old-Growth Forest of Changbai Mountain, Northeast China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The changing climate is worsening the threats to forests, such as insect outbreaks, fires, and drought, especially old-growth forest, which is more susceptible to disturbance. Therefore, it is important to detect the disturbance areas, identify the disturbance agents, and evaluate the disturbance intensity in old-growth forest. We tried to derive the forest disturbance information based on multiple remote sensing datasets (Global Forest Change, MODIS, and ERA5-Land) from 2000 to 2021 in Changbai Mountain, Northeast China, and explored their relationship with climate factors. The results showed that (1) wind damage and insect outbreaks are two main forest disturbance agents, (2) the increasing temperature during overwintering periods and the decreasing precipitation during activity periods increase the risk of insect outbreaks, and (3) disturbances lead to significant changes in forest structure and functional indices, which can be well captured by the remote sensing data. In the study, we creatively combined low-frequency remote sensing images and high-frequency meteorological data to determine the specific time of wind damage. The final results suggested that the vulnerability of old-growth forest to climate change may be mainly reflected through indirect implications, such as the increased risk of strong winds and insect disturbances.

TI  - A Proposed Ensemble Feature Selection Method for Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass from Multiple Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature selection (FS) can increase the accuracy of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) prediction from multiple satellite data and identify important predictors, but the role of FS in AGB estimation has not received sufficient attention. Here, we aimed to quantify the degree to which FS can benefit forest AGB prediction. To this end, we extracted a series of features from Landsat, Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and climatic and topographical information, and evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art FS methods in selecting predictive features and improving the estimation accuracy with selected features. We then proposed an ensemble FS method that takes inro account the stability of an individual FS algorithm with respect to different training datasets used; the heterogeneity or diversity of different FS methods; the correlations between features and forest AGB; and the multicollinearity between the selected features. We further investigated the performance of the proposed stability-heterogeneity-correlation-based ensemble (SHCE) method for AGB estimation. The results showed that selected features by SHCE provided a more accurate prediction of forest AGB than existing state-of-the-art FS methods, with R-2 = 0.66 +/- 0.01, RMSE = 14.35 +/- 0.12 Mg ha(-1), MAE = 9.34 +/- 0.09 Mg ha(-1), and bias = 1.67 +/- 0.11 Mg ha(-1) at 90 m resolution. Boruta yielded comparable prediction accuracy of forest AGB, but could not identify the importance of features, which led to a slightly greater bias than the proposed SHCE method. SHCE not only ranked selected features by importance but provided feature subsets that enabled accurate AGB prediction. Moreover, SHCE provides a flexible framework to combine FS results, which will be crucial in many scenarios, particularly the wide-area mapping of land-surface parameters from various satellite datasets.

TI  - Monitoring of 35-Year Mangrove Wetland Change Dynamics and Agents in the Sundarbans Using Temporal Consistency Checking
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove wetlands are rapidly being lost due to anthropogenic disturbances and natural processes, such as sea-level rise (SLR), but are also recovering as a result of conservation efforts. Accurate and contemporary mangrove maps to detect their distribution and changes are urgently needed to understand how mangroves respond to global change and develop effective conservation projects. Here, we developed a new change detection algorithm called temporal consistency checking combining annual classification and spectral time series (TCC-CS) for tracking mangrove losses and gains. Specifically, mangrove change events were determined by measuring the deviation of greenness and wetness of candidate change segments from automatically collected mangrove reference samples. By applying to the world's largest mangrove patches, we monitored the 35-year mangrove trajectory in the Sundarbans from 1988 to 2022 using all available Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine platform. In the Sundarbans, 18,501.89 ha of mangroves have been gained, but these have been offset by losses of 27,009.79 ha, leading to a net mangrove loss of 1.42% (8507.9 ha) in the past 35 years. We further mapped the pixel-level change agents and found that SLR-induced erosion and degradation, instead of human activities, were the major drivers of losses in the Sundarbans. Trend analysis on loss agents indicates that mangrove losses caused by human activities, such as the expansion of croplands and aquaculture ponds, have declined, but SLR is still a persistent threat to mangrove wetlands in this iconic mangrove area. Our study provides a computationally efficient methodology for examining large-scale mangrove changes, and the resultant annual mangrove maps provide strong support for mangrove conservation in the Sundarbans.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Erosion from an Ungauged Small Watershed and Its Effect on Lake Ulansuhai, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Ulansuhai, one of the main water sources for semi-arid areas of China, has a local deposit caused by soil erosion during past decades. However, a lack of monitor stations prevents better estimation of soil erosion levels. Therefore, we try to estimate soil erosion in the Huangtuyaozi (HTYZ) watershed, an ungauged small watershed of the lake's eastern watershed, by using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model and multi-source remote sensing data, and analyze its key drivers and effect on the lake siltation. The result showed that the soil erosion rate in the HTYZ watershed ranged from 0 to 129.893 t ha(-1) yr(-1) with an average of 6.45 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during 1986-2015. In particular, 80.06% of the area was less than 10 t ha(-1) yr(-1), and just 0.06% was over 50 t ha(-1) yr(-1), mainly in the mountain area, the southern part of the HTYZ watershed. Moreover, rainfall erosivity factor is the key factor, and rainfall during flood season plays a key role in soil erosion. Due to the soil erosion of HTYZ, siltation in Lake Ulansuhai reached 223.83 ha, with the annual siltation area increasing at a rate of 7.46 ha/yr. The results could provide a reference for estimating soil erosion of ungauged small watershed in semi-arid areas.

TI  - IRS Empowered Robust Secure Transmission for Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks
T2  - IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) empowered robust secure transmission approach for an integrated satellite and terrestrial network (ISTN) with multiple eavesdroppers. The satellite transmits multicast signals to earth stations (ESs) within its coverage, while the base station (BS) serves many terrestrial users (TUs) with the aid of IRS. To improve the security of the satellite system, by assuming that only imperfect channel state information is available, we formulate a weighted sum rate maximization problem subject to the intercept probability constraints, the quality-of-service requirement of each ES and TU, and the transmit power budget of the satellite platform and BS. To tackle this non-convex problem, we jointly employ the Charnes-Cooper approach, the second order Taylor expansion and Bernstein-type inequality, and propose a successive convex approximation based algorithm to obtain the satellite beamforming weight vector, the BS power allocation and the IRS phase shifts. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can improve the spectrum efficiency and secrecy performance of ISTNs compared to the benchmarks.

TI  - A Modification to Phase Estimation for Distributed Scatterers in InSAR Data Stacks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the spatial density and quality of measurement points in multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar, distributed scatterers (DSs) should be processed. An essential procedure in DS interferometry is phase estimation, which reconstructs a consistent phase series from all available interferograms. Influenced by the well-known suboptimality of coherence estimation, the performance of the state-of-the-art phase estimation algorithms is severely degraded. Previous research has addressed this problem by introducing the coherence bias correction technique. However, the precision of phase estimation is still insufficient because of the limited correction capabilities. In this paper, a modified phase estimation approach is proposed. Particularly, by incorporating the information on both interferometric coherence and the number of looks, a significant bias correction to each element of the coherence magnitude matrix is achieved. The bias-corrected coherence matrix is combined with advanced statistically homogeneous pixel selection and time series phase optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal phase series. Both the simulated and Sentinel-1 real data sets are used to demonstrate the superiority of this proposed approach over the traditional phase estimation algorithms. Specifically, the coherence bias can be corrected with considerable accuracy by the proposed scheme. The mean bias of coherence magnitude is reduced by more than 29%, and the standard deviation is reduced by more than 18% over the existing bias correction method. The proposed approach achieves higher accuracy than the current methods over the reconstructed phase series, including smoother interferometric phases and fewer outliers.

TI  - Retrieval of Volcanic Ash Cloud Base Height Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - There are distinct differences between radiation characteristics of volcanic ash and meteorological clouds, and conventional retrieval methods for cloud base height (CBH) of the latter are difficult to apply to volcanic ash without substantial parameterisation and model correction. Furthermore, existing CBH inversion methods have limitations, including the involvement of many empirical formulae and a dependence on the accuracy of upstream cloud products. A machine learning (ML) method was developed for the retrieval of volcanic ash cloud base height (VBH) to reduce uncertainties in physical CBH retrieval methods. This new methodology takes advantage of polar-orbit active remote-sensing data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), from vertical profile information and from geostationary passive remote-sensing measurements from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) and the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) aboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and FengYun-4B (FY-4B) satellites, respectively. The methodology involves a statistics-based algorithm with hybrid use of principal component analysis (PCA) and one of four ML algorithms including the k-nearest neighbour (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) methods. Eruptions of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano (Iceland) during April-May 2010, the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex (Chilean Andes) in June 2011, and the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano (Tonga) in January 2022 were selected as typical cases for the construction of the training and validation sample sets. We demonstrate that a combination of PCA and GBDT performs more accurately than other combinations, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.152 km, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.529 km, and a Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of 0.724. Use of PCA as an additional process before training reduces feature relevance between input predictors and improves algorithm accuracy. Although the ML algorithm performs well under relatively simple single-layer volcanic ash cloud conditions, it tends to overestimate VBH in multi-layer conditions, which is an unresolved problem in meteorological CBH retrieval.

TI  - Assessment of land degradation in Inner Mongolia between 2000 and 2020 based on remote sensing data
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN) worldwide is a significant target of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG15.3). Inner Mongolia, as a typical dryland region in northern China, has carried out several large-scale ecological restoration programs to combat land degradation. However, there is a lack of comprehensive assess-ment of its land degradation situation after ecological programs implementation, which is of great significance to supporting SDG15.3 in China. This study analyzed the land degradation situation using the improved SDG15.3.1 calculation framework based on fine resolution data in Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2020, and finally compre-hensively evaluated the land status of the whole region and those subject to ecological programs. The results show that net land restoration proportion of various ecological project regions and whole region continues to increase. The scope of the Grain for Green Program (GGP) had the largest proportion of net land restoration while the Natural Reserve Program (NRP) had the lowest proportion from 2000 to 2020. The net land restoration area of Inner Mongolia during 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 was 35,800 km2 and 65,300 km2, respectively. Overall, Inner Mongolia has achieved statistically zero growth in land degradation under the governance of ecological restora-tion programs. Therefore, reasonable planning, well monitoring, and timely assessment of ecological restoration programs are crucial to support SDG15.3.

TI  - Semi-Supervised Classification of PolSAR Images Based on Co-Training of CNN and SVM with Limited Labeled Samples
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant advantages in the tasks of image classification; however, these usually require a large number of labeled samples for training. In practice, it is difficult and costly to obtain sufficient labeled samples of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised classification method for PolSAR images in this paper, using the co-training of CNN and a support vector machine (SVM). In our co-training method, an eight-layer CNN with residual network (ResNet) architecture is designed as the primary classifier, and an SVM is used as the auxiliary classifier. In particular, the SVM is used to enhance the performance of our algorithm in the case of limited labeled samples. In our method, more and more pseudo-labeled samples are iteratively yielded for training through a two-stage co-training of CNN and SVM, which gradually improves the performance of the two classifiers. The trained CNN is employed as the final classifier due to its strong classification capability with enough samples. We carried out experiments on two C-band airborne PolSAR images acquired by the AIRSAR systems and an L-band spaceborne PolSAR image acquired by the GaoFen-3 system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively integrate the complementary advantages of SVM and CNN, providing overall classification accuracy of more than 97%, 96% and 93% with limited labeled samples (10 samples per class) for the above three images, respectively, which is superior to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods for PolSAR image classification.

TI  - High-Spatial-Resolution NDVI Reconstruction with GA-ANN
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) for Landsat is not continuous on the time scale due to the long revisit period and the influence of clouds and cloud shadows, such that the Landsat NDVI needs to be filled in and reconstructed. This study proposed a method based on the genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) algorithm to reconstruct the Landsat NDVI when it has been affected by clouds, cloud shadows, and uncovered areas by relying on the MODIS characteristics for a wide coverage area. According to the self-validating results of the model test, the RMSE, MAE, and R were 0.0508, 0.0557, and 0.8971, respectively. Compared with the existing research, the reconstruction model based on the GA-ANN algorithm achieved a higher precision than the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible space-time data fusion algorithm (FSDAF) for complex land use types. The reconstructed method based on the GA-ANN algorithm had a higher root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Then, the Sentinel NDVI data were used to verify the accuracy of the results. The validation results showed that the reconstruction method was superior to other methods in the sample plots with complex land use types. Especially on the time scale, the obtained NDVI results had a strong correlation with the Sentinel NDVI data. The correlation coefficient (R) of the GA-ANN algorithm reconstruction's NDVI and the Sentinel NDVI data was more than 0.97 for the land use types of cropland, forest, and grassland. Therefore, the reconstruction model based on the GA-ANN algorithm could effectively fill in the clouds, cloud shadows, and uncovered areas, and produce NDVI long-series data with a high spatial resolution.

TI  - Evaluation of InSAR Tropospheric Delay Correction Methods in a Low-Latitude Alpine Canyon Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric delay error must be reduced during interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurement. Depending on different geographical environments, an appropriate correction method should be selected to improve the accuracy of InSAR deformation monitoring. In this study, surface deformation monitoring was conducted in a high mountain gorge region in Yunnan Province, China, using Sentinel-1A images of ascending and descending tracks. The tropospheric delay in the InSAR interferogram was corrected using the Linear, Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) and ERA-5 meteorological reanalysis data (ERA5) methods. The correction effect was evaluated by combining phase standard deviation, semi-variance function, elevation correlation, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) deformation monitoring results. The mean value of the phase standard deviation (Aver) of the linear correction interferogram and the threshold value (sill) of the semi-variogram were reduced by -20.98% and -41%, respectively, while the accuracy of the InSAR deformation points near the GNSS site was increased by 58%. The results showed that the three methods reduced the tropospheric delay error of InSAR deformation monitoring by different degrees in low-latitude mountains and valleys. Linear correction was the best at alleviating the tropospheric delay, followed by GACOS, while ERA5 had poor correction stability.

TI  - Response of Two Major Lakes in the Changtang National Nature Reserve, Tibetan Plateau to Climate and Anthropogenic Changes over the Past 50 Years
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Areal changes in alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are reliable indicators of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. This study used long-term Landsat images and meteorological records to monitor the temporal evolution patterns of lakes within the Changtang National Nature Reserve between 1972 and 2021 and examine the climatic and anthropogenic impacts on lake area changes. The results revealed that the area of Lake LongmuCo and Lake Jiezechaqia significantly expanded by 12.81% and 12.88% from 1972 to 2021, respectively. After 1999, Lake LongmuCo and Lake Jiezechaqia entered into a period of rapid expansion. During 1972-2021, the annual mean temperature significantly increased at a rate of 0.05 degrees C/a, while the change in annual precipitation was not significant. The temperature change was a major contributor to the observed changes of Lake LongmuCo and Lake Jiezechaqia between 1972 and 2021, while human intervention also played a vital role during 2013-2021. The glaciers around these two lakes decreased by 21.81%, and the increase in water supply from warming-triggered glacier melting was a reason of expansion of Lake LongmuCo and Lake Jiezechaqia. The areas of the two artificial salt lakes affiliated with Lake LongmuCo and Lake Jiezechaqia were 0.24 km(2) and 2.67 km(2) in 2013 and rose to 0.51 km(2) and 9.80 km(2) in 2021, respectively. In particular, the continuous exploitations of salt lakes to extract lithium resources have retarded the rate of expansion of Lake LongmuCo and Lake Jiezechaqia. The dams constructed by industrial enterprises have blocked the expansion of Lake LongmuCo to the south. This paper sheds new light on the influences of recent human intervention and climatic variation on alpine lakes within the TP. Due to the importance of alpine lakes in the TP, we need more comprehensive and in-depth efforts to protect the lake ecosystems within the national nature reserves.

TI  - Synergism of Multi-Modal Data for Mapping Tree Species Distribution-A Case Study from a Mountainous Forest in Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping tree species is crucial for forest management and conservation. Most previous studies relied on features derived from optical imagery, and digital elevation data and the potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and other environmental factors have, generally, been underexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of fusing freely available multi-modal data for accurately mapping tree species. Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and various environmental datasets over a large mountainous forest in Southwest China were obtained and analyzed using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Seven data cases considering the individual or joint performance of different features, and four additional cases considering a novel clustering-based feature selection method, were analyzed. All 11 cases were assessed using three machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost). The best performance, with an overall accuracy of 77.98%, was attained from the case with all features and the random forest classifier. Sentinel-2 data alone exhibited similar performance as environmental data in terms of overall accuracy. Similar species, such as oak and birch, cannot be spectrally discriminated based on Sentinel-2-based features alone. The addition of SAR features improved discrimination, especially when distinguishing between some coniferous and deciduous species, but also decreased accuracy for oak. The analysis based on different data cases and feature importance rankings indicated that environmental features are important. The random forest outperformed other models, and a better prediction was achieved for planted tree species compared to that for the natural forest. These results suggest that accurately mapping tree species over large mountainous areas is feasible with freely accessible multi-modal data, especially when considering environmental factors.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation Model for Wide-Area Coseismic Landslide Extraction Based on Embedded Multichannel Spectral-Topographic Feature Fusion: A Case Study of the Jiuzhaigou Ms7.0 Earthquake in Sichuan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate extraction of wide-area coseismic landslide locations is critical in earthquake emergencies. At present, the extraction of coseismic landslides is mainly based on post-earthquake site investigation or the interpretation of human-computer interactions based on remote sensing images. However, the identification efficiency is low, which seriously delays the earthquake emergency response. On the basis of the available multisource and multiscale remote sensing data, numerous studies have been carried out on the methods of coseismic landslide extraction, such as pixel analysis, object-oriented analysis, change detection, and machine learning. However, the effectiveness of coseismic landslide extraction was low in wide areas with complex topographic and geomorphic backgrounds. Therefore, this paper offers a comprehensive study of the factors influencing coseismic landslides and researches rapid and accurate wide-area coseismic landslide extraction methods with multisource remote sensing and geoscience technology. These techniques include digital elevation modeling (DEM) and its derived slopes and aspects. An embedded multichannel spectral-topographic feature fusion model for coseismic landslide extraction based on DeepLab V3+ is proposed, and a knowledge-enhanced deep learning information extraction method integrating geological knowledge is formed. Using the Jiuzhaigou Ms7.0 earthquake (seismic intensity VIII) in Sichuan Province, China, a comparison of landslide extraction models and strategies is carried out. The results show that the model proposed in this paper achieves the best balance in the accuracy and efficiency of wide-area extractions. Using multiple feature data of coseismic landslides, the problem of mixed pixels is solved. The rate of the misidentification of landslides as clouds, snow, buildings, and roads is significantly lower than in other methods. The identified landslide boundaries are smoother and more accurate, and the connectivity is better. Compared with other methods, ours can more accurately eliminate landslides not triggered by the Jiuzhaigou earthquake. While using the image block strategy to ensure extraction efficiency, it also improves the extraction accuracy of wide-area coseismic landslides in complex backgrounds.

TI  - Assessing Glacier Boundaries in the Ala-Archa Valley of Kyrgyzstan by Using Sentinel-1 SAR Dataset and High-Resolution UAV Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The significant retreat of glaciers in terms of climate change compels researchers to increase the frequency of studies regarding the transformations occurring in glacier boundaries. In this study, we provided glacier area delineation of Ala-Archa valley glaciers by using a Sentinel-1 SAR dataset and the InSAR Coherence technique. Since glaciers have specific patterns of movement, the low coherence method signals the presence of ice. The analysis used the pair of Sentinel-1 datasets for the summer, to ensure the lowest coherence and provide an areal estimation during the peak of ablation. The independence of the SAR images from cloud and light conditions permits us to acquire the images in a timely manner, which highly affects the results of glacier monitoring. This method has shown high potential in the mapping of debris-covered ice and the indication of dead ice. To identify and separate areas of low coherence, such as glacier lakes and unstable slopes, we used object-based mapping by using the geomorphological features of the ice. In this study, we defined a coherence value of less than 0.3 in the glacier area. Our research identified a number of 56 glaciers within the study area of 31.45 km(2) and obtained highly accurate glacier maps for the glaciers with a smooth terminus. The analysis shows that automatic and manual delineation of the glaciers' boundaries have certain limitations, but using the advantages of both scientific approaches, further studies will generate more accurate results.

TI  - Inferring Tide-Induced Ephemeral Grounding in an Ice-Shelf-Stream System: Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic ice shelves play a key role in regulating the rate of ice flow in tributary ice streams. Temporal variations in the associated ice-shelf buttressing stress are observed to impact ice flow in glaciers and ice streams. Ephemeral grounding induced by tides is an important mechanism for modulating the buttressing stress. Here, we develop an approach to inferring variations in 3-D surface displacements at an ice-shelf-stream system that explicitly accounts for ephemeral grounding. Using a temporally dense nine-month-long synthetic-aperture radar image acquisition campaign collected over Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, by the 4-satellite COSMO-SkyMed constellation, we infer the ephemeral grounding zones and the spatiotemporal variation of the fortnightly ice-flow variability. We find ephemeral grounding zones along the western ice-shelf margin as well as a few prominent ephemeral grounding points in the central trunk and in the vicinity of the grounding zone. Our observations provide evidence for tide-modulated buttressing stress and the temporally asymmetric response of ice-shelf flow to tidal forcing. Long-term oceanic warming and ice-shelf thinning will cause the loss of ephemeral grounding and decrease in ice-shelf buttressing stress.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of our work is to investigate the performance of wave breaking and its effect on wave retrieval in data acquired from the Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) at C-band and the German TerraSAR-X (TS-X) at X-band. The SAR images available for this study included 140 GF-3 images acquired in quad-polarization strip (QPS) mode and 50 dual-polarized (vertical-vertical (VV) and horizontal-horizontal (HH)) TS-X images acquired in stripmap (SM) mode. Moreover, these images were collocated with the waves simulated by the numeric WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) (version 5.16) model and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) current. In particular, a few images covered the moored buoys monitored by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The comparison between the WW3-simulated results and the significant wave heights (SWHs) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data (ERA-5) showed that the correlation coefficient (COR) was 0.4-0.6 with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 0.2 m at SWHs of 0-4 m. The winds were inverted using VV-polarized geophysical model functions (GMFs), e.g., CSARMOD-GF for the GF-3 images and XMOD2 for the TS-X images. The Bragg resonant roughness in the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) was simulated using a radar backscattering model and the SAR-derived wind, WW3-simulated wave parameters, and HYCOM current. Then, the contribution of the non-polarized (NP) wave breaking to the SAR data was estimated by the VV-polarized NRCS, the HH-polarized NRCS, and the polarization ratio (PR) of the co-polarized Bragg resonant components in the NRCS. Because co-polarized Bragg resonant components in the NRCSs have poor results, due to the saturation for wind speeds greater than 20 m/s, the analysis of wave breaking is excluded at such conditions. The results revealed that the backscattering signal in the C-band was more sensitive to wave breaking than the backscattering signal in the X-band. Interestingly, the ratio had a linear correlation with wind speed. Moreover, the variation in the bias (inverted SWH minus WW3 simulation) showed that the bias increased as the wind speed (>8 m/s) and whitecap coverage (>0.005) increased. Following this rationale, wave retrieval during tropical cyclones should consider the influence of wave breaking.

TI  - An Integrated Multi-Factor Coupling Approach for Marine Dynamic Disaster Assessment in China's Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine dynamic disasters, such as storm surges and huge waves, can cause large economic and human losses. The assessment of marine dynamic disasters is, thus, important, but improvements to its reliability are needed. The current study improved and integrated the assessment from the perspective of multi-factor coupling. Using a weighted index system, a marine dynamic disaster assessment indicator system suitable for China's coastal waters was established, and a method for calculating the weight of disaster indicators was proposed from the perspective of rapid assessment. To reduce the assessment deviation in coastal waters, a multi-factor coupling algorithm was proposed. This algorithm obtained amplitude variations of wave orbital motion in horizontal and vertical directions, which was used to evaluate the influence of background current and terrain slope on coastal ocean waves. Landsat 8 remote sensing images were used to carry out an object-oriented extraction of raft and cage aquaculture areas in China's coastal waters. The aquaculture density was then used as the main basis for a vulnerability assessment. Finally, the whole assessment system was integrated and verified during a typical storm surge process in coastal waters around the Shandong Peninsula in China. The coupled variations were also added to the assessment process and increased the risk value by an average of 12% in the High Sea States of the case study.

TI  - The Assessment of the Spatiotemporal Characteristics of the Eco-Environmental Quality in the Chishui River Basin from 2000 to 2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chishui River Basin is located in the bordering area of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces, which serves as an important ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and plays a leading role in preserving natural environments, protecting water resources, and maintaining soil functions. However, the eco-environmental quality in the basin has encountered serious challenges in recent years, and the conflict between eco-environmental protection and economic development becomes increasingly prominent. Therefore, it is particularly important to quantitatively assess the extent of the eco-environmental changes in this basin. The present study acquired Landsat series remote sensing images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, constructed a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) as the assessment index that reflects the eco-environmental quality using principal component analysis, studied the changing trend in the eco-environmental quality using the Sen-Mann-Kendall trend test, analyzed the spatial clustering distribution patterns of the eco-environmental quality, based on spatial autocorrelation analysis, and applied the geographical detector model to determine the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on the eco-environmental quality. We further applied the CA-Markov model to simulate and predict the eco-environmental quality of the basin in 2025. The results showed the following: (1) between 2000 and 2020, the eco-environmental quality of the Chishui River Basin had been greatly improved. The average RSEI value increased from 0.526 in 2000 to 0.668 in 2020, and the percentage of areas belonging to the good or excellent quality category increased from 42.65% to 68.48%. (2) The main drivers of the eco-environmental quality included population density, mean annual temperature, land use type and elevation. The interactive effect between these drivers was significantly higher than that of individual drivers, and thus possessed stronger explanatory power for quality differences. (3) It is predicted that in 2025, the eco-environmental quality of the basin will continue to improve, and the proportion of land areas with good or excellent quality will continuously increase. The present study can provide reference value for local environmental protection and regional planning.

TI  - Assessment of the Forest Fire Risk and Its Indicating Significances in Zhaoqing City Based on Landsat Time-Series Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient monitoring of forest fire risk and its dynamic changes is an important way to prevent and reduce forest fire hazards. This study integrated the ignition effect of fire sources and the impact of landform into the calculation of forest fire risk using digital-terrain-slope factor, and developed an optimized forest fire risk model (fire-potential-index slope, FPIS). Combined with Landsat 8 satellite images, the study retrieved and analyzed the variations of forest fire risk in Zhaoqing City, Guangdong province, for four consecutive periods in the dry season, 2019. It was found that the high forest fire risk area was mainly distributed in the valley plains of Huaiji district, Fengkai district and Guangning district, the depressions of the Sihui district, and mountain-edge areas of Dinghu district and Gaoyao district, and accounted for 8.9% on 20 October but expanded to 19.89% on 7 December 2019. However, the further trend analysis indicated that the forest fire risk with significant increasing trend only accounted for 6.42% in Zhaoqing. Compared to the single high forest fire risk results, the changing trend results effectively narrowed the key areas for forest fire prevention (2.48%-12.47%) given the actual forest fires in the city. For the four forest fire events (Lingshan mountain, Hukeng industrial area, Xiangang county and Huangniuling ridge forest fires), it was found that the forest fire risk with significant increasing trend in these regions accounted for 26.63%, 35.84%, 54.6% and 73.47%, respectively, which further proved that the forest fire risk changing trend had a better indicated significance for real forest fire events than the high forest fire risk results itself (1.89%-71.69%). This study suggested that the forest fire risk increasing trend could be well used to reduce the probability of misjudgment and improve the accuracy of the early-warning areas when predicting forest fires.

TI  - D-MFPN: A Doppler Feature Matrix Fused with a Multilayer Feature Pyramid Network for SAR Ship Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has become a major research field in recent years. It plays a major role in monitoring the ocean, marine rescue activities, and marine safety warnings. However, there are still some factors that restrict further improvements in detecting performance, e.g., multi-scale ship transformation and unfocused images caused by motion. In order to resolve these issues, in this paper, a doppler feature matrix fused with a multi-layer feature pyramid network (D-MFPN) is proposed for SAR ship detection. The D-MFPN takes single-look complex image data as input and consists of two branches: the image branch designs a multi-layer feature pyramid network to enhance the positioning capacity for large ships combined with an attention module to refine the feature map's expressiveness, and the doppler branch aims to build a feature matrix that characterizes the ship's motion state by estimating the doppler center frequency and frequency modulation rate offset. To confirm the validity of each branch, individual ablation experiments are conducted. The experimental results on the Gaofen-3 satellite ship dataset illustrate the D-MFPN's optimal performance in defocused ship detection tasks compared with six other competitive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based SAR ship detectors. Its satisfactory results demonstrate the application value of the deep-learning model fused with doppler features in the field of SAR ship detection.

TI  - Boba Shop, Coffee Shop, and Urban Vitality and Development-A Spatial Association and Temporal Analysis of Major Cities in China from the Standpoint of Nighttime Light
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) is a critical indicator of urban vitality and development. Using NTL as a representation of urban vitality and development, the study explores how different fresh-made beverage shops, namely boba and coffee shops, proxy various facets of urban vitality and development in four megacities in China. Existing studies mostly discuss urban vitality as a broad concept and seldom investigate the diverse urban vitality and development represented by different indicators. This study selects Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen as case study regions and explores (1) their urban vitality pattern represented by NTL. (2) the heterogeneous spatial distribution of boba and coffee shops; (3) how boba and coffee shops represent urban vitality differently; and (4) how boba and coffee shops portray the economy and population growth aspect of urban development differently. We acquired NTL data from remote sensing images to measure urban vitality and development. Cross-sectionally, the majority of urban vitality and development represented by NTL concentrates in urban centers. The distribution of coffee shops assimilates the spatial pattern of urban vitality represented by NTL while boba shops have a greater spatial extent in metropolitan fringes. Longitudinally, from 2012 to 2020, the global and local bivariate Moran's I analysis between NTL and beverage shops shows that the coffee shops capture urban vitality and development better than boba shops in Beijing, while the pattern is reversed in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Examining the evolving spatial dynamics between beverage shops' growth and urban development using bivariate Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi/Mann-Kendall emerging hot spot analysis, we found that the locations with the most intense economic growth have seen the most spatial expansion of coffee shops. In contrast, those with the fastest population growth have seen the greatest spatial development of boba businesses. These results indicate that coffee shops represent the economic aspect of urban vitality while boba shops emphasize the population growth aspects. By examining the dynamic spatio-temporal relationship between small beverage shops and urban vitality and development represented by NTL data, this study broadens the usage of remote sensing data in urban studies and expands on previous research and offers insights for urban planners and geographers to reference when choosing indicators of urban vitality and growth.

TI  - Evaluation of Linear Kernel-Driven BRDF Models over Snow-Free Rugged Terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-empirical kernel-driven models have been widely used to characterize anisotropic reflectance due to their simple form and physically meaningful approximation. Recently, several kernel-driven models have been coupled with topographic effects to improve the fitting of bidirectional reflectance over rugged terrains. However, extensive evaluations of the various models' performances are required before their subsequent application in remote sensing. Three typical kernel-driven BRDF models over snow-free rugged terrains such as the RTLSR, TCKD, and the KDST-adjusted TCKD (KDST-TCKD) were investigated in this paper using simulated and observed BRFs. Against simulated data, the fitting error (NIR/Red RMSE) of the RTLSR gradually increases from 0.0358/0.0342 to 0.0471/0.0516 with mean slopes (alpha) increases from 9.13 degrees to 33.40 degrees. However, the TCKD and KDST-TCKD models perform an overall better fitting accuracy: the fitting errors of TCKD gradually decreased from 0.0366/0.0337 to 0.0252/0.0292, and the best fit from the KDST-TCDK model with NIR/Red RMSE decreased from 0.0192/0.0269 to 0.0169/0.0180. When compared to the sandbox data (alpha from 8.4 degrees to 30.36 degrees), the NIR/Red RMSE of the RTLSR model ranges from 0.0147/0.0085 to 0.0346/0.0165, for the TCKD model from 0.0144/0.0086 to 0.0298/0.0154, and for the KDST-TCKD model from 0.0137/0.0082 to 0.0234/0.0149. Using MODIS data, the TCKD and KDST-TCKD models show more significant improvements compared to the RTLSR model in rugged terrains. Their RMSE differences are within 0.003 over a relatively flat terrain (alpha < 10 degrees). When alpha is large (20 degrees-30 degrees and >30 degrees), the RMSE of the TCKD model has a decrease of around 0.01 compared to that of the RTLSR; for KDST-TCKD, it is approximately 0.02, and can even reach 0.0334 in the savannas. Therefore, the TCKD and KDST-TCKD models have an overall better performance than the RTLSR model in rugged terrains, especially in the case of large mean slopes. Among them, the KDST-TCKD model performs the best due to its consideration of topographic effects, geotropic growth, and component spectra.

TI  - Dynamics of Vegetation Productivity in Floodplain Meadows of the Mongun-Taiginsky District of the Republic of Tyva According to Terra MODIS Data
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of studies of the dynamics of productivity, photosynthetically active radiation, and evapotranspiration according to Terra MODIS data for five test plots in the near-channel part of the floodplains of the Kargy River (glycophyte, swampy, and natural meadows), as well as willow stands along the banks of the Mugur River, are presented. An analysis of long-term changes in meadow vegetation in the study area from 2000 to 2021 showed a general positive trend in gross productivity and differences between communities. Against the background of an increase in actual evapotranspiration (by 43%), the potential evapotranspiration decreases (by 10%), which indicates the drying up of the study area. Seasonal maxima of meadow productivity were observed in 2014, 2016 and 2020-2021. The years 2001, 2003-2004, and 2009 turned out to be critical for meadow vegetation. A weak positive correlation was found between the gross productivity of vegetation and the evapotranspiration of the territory and a stronger one with photosynthetically active radiation. The seasonal dynamics of productivity corresponded to the meadow type of vegetation.

TI  - Investigation into the development of a methodology for the study of environmental discourses
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to decolonise the academy and academic writing requires that methodology for research be chosen carefully. The methodology of a study reflects the researcher's point of departure or worldview, as well as their belief system. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically influenced the functioning of higher education institutes, as well as how scholars plan and execute their research. This includes investigation into the global environmental crisis that is widely researched from various disciplines. These disciplines tend to develop and favour different methodologies. The purpose of this presentation was to report on the inquiry into a suitable methodology to study social discourses about the environmental crisis. The methodologies investigated were an eco-linguistic approach to Critical Discourse Analysis, combined with eco-criticism, which was linked to the concept of an eco-sophy, using the framework of Dark Green Religion. The umbrella-concept of Dark Green Religion as a theoretical framework allows the comparison and incorporation of disparate methodologies as well as discourses. This framework also gives prominence to the role of religion in societal response to the environmental crisis. Due to the study being situated in an African context and striving to implement a decolonising discourse, some suggestions were made on decolonising research methodology in higher education.Contribution: This article's contribution to new knowledge centred around situating current and new research in Africa in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and deliberating on the impact for future studies. The conclusion was drawn that the COVID-19 pandemic can be a catalyst for re-interpreting research methodology from a decolonised perspective.

TI  - Assessing the cropping intensity dynamics of the Gosaba CD block of Indian Sundarbans using satellite-based remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Food availability is one of the dimensions of food security, and it is necessary to analyze the crop production scenario to estimate the availability of food in a region. Cropping sequence and cropping intensity indicate the seasonal crop production, thereby indicating the seasonal availability of food. Seasonal variation of per capita or per household availability of the cropped land determines the food security status of a given region. In Indian Sundarbans region, people's livelihood is seriously threatened by the food insecurity. The present study aimed to determine the seasonality of cropped land as well as the cropping intensities of Gosaba CD block of Indian Sundarbans during 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 cropping years using Multi-dated Sentinel-2 data. Rule-based classification was applied for cropping sequence and cropping intensity mapping. Winter season cropped land was the lowest (< 16% of the village area). The area under crop-fallow-crop sequence (200% cropping intensity) decreased, while the area under crop-fallow-fallow (100% cropping intensity) sequence increased. Area under 300% cropping intensity gradually decreased. The average cropping intensity changed from 150% in 2017-2018 to 124% and 136% in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, respectively. Large variation of the seasonal cropped land per household was estimated, and it became the worst during winter when it became less than 0.5 bighas (0.07 ha). Crop cultivation during dry season depended on the rainfall pattern and surface water availability. The present study successfully addressed the cropping scenario and food insecurity of the study area, and hopefully, it will help the planners and policy makers to take necessary actions for cropping intensification and ensuring food security in the Indian Sundarbans region.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The actual forest change detection requires veracity with detailed continuous information over large areas. This paper has an overall objective to characterize forest disturbances and recovery of the region of Vatovavy Fitovinany, Madagascar over 30 years (1990-2020) using the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform (LT-GEE). On google Earth Engine, we called Landsat Time Series from the USGS website (http://landsat.usgs.gov), generated the yearly cleaned Landsat SR mosaic images, (2) computed the annual Normal Burn Ratio (NBR), (3) modeled the NBR spectral trajectory segmentation using the LandTrendr algorithm. From this, forest disturbance and recovery attributes were extracted and mapped. As a result, 52,927 ha of the forest was disturbed versus 40,341 ha recovered representing, or a difference of about 12,586 ha for the 30 years and 419.5413 ha as the annual average. "Tavy" was the main factor of the disturbance and the quick regeneration of forest recovery after the disturbance was attributed to the complex interaction between biotic, abiotic, and land-use history reigned in Humid Tropical forests. The veracity of the model Disturbance, recovery, and no-change got was estimated at 74-77% with O.A, and Kappa of about 0.61-0.65. The approach using LandTrendr on Google Earth Engine simplifies the pre-processing steps and is more reliable for continuous tropical forest dynamics monitoring. This continuous information is important for forest management policies, and political issues such as carbon stock.

TI  - Basic structural geology of Venus: A review of the gaps and how to bridge them
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The next decade will see new geological mapping of the surface of Venus spurred by multiple new science missions. Planetary scientists must be cognisant of gaps in our understanding of the geology of the second planet in order to plan and maximise the scientific value of these new missions. While our current knowledge of major aspects of volcanology and broad-scale tectonic features on Venus is reasonably advanced, within the limitations of available data. However, the same cannot be said of the basic structural geology of venusian extensional and shortening, and strike-slip features. Published interpretations of distributed extensional tectonic features on Venus do not account for the absence of associated regional strain localisation. Models of shortening tectonic features on Venus are based on structural geological analogies with potentially similar features elsewhere in the inner Solar System. However, the purported analogues on Mercury, Mars and the Moon, as well as commonly invoked terrestrial analogues, have their own issues, which have not been acknowledged or treated in the literature. In addition, empirical application of terrestrial map patterns as analogues for identifying and ana-lysing strike-slip shearing on Venus has not taken account of the established Earth-based determinants of crustal -scale shear zone development. Application of the current state of basic structural geology on Venus to provide constraints on models of planet-scale tectonic behaviour, and their potential extension to the early Earth, is premature. Accordingly, it is both appropriate and timely to critically review the current state of basic structural geological understanding of Venus, with reference to the inner Solar System as a whole. Strategies are proposed for addressing some of the fundamental gaps in our understanding of the basic structural geology of Venus using both analogue modelling and currently available remotely-sensed data while awaiting the results of the planned new science missions in the mid-2030s.

TI  - 'They Might Not Kill You Today but They're Going to Get You in the End': The Correctional Subculture and the Schematization of Danger
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Criminology has long investigated criminal justice cultures and their preoccupation with dangerousness. Over a half century ago, correctional scholars called for a richer understanding of how a 'social reality' of danger might shape the mental state of staff. More recently, correctional scholarship has demonstrated that correctional culture and perceptions of danger likely play a fundamental role in findings that staff experience conflict across domains. Drawing from 18 focus groups of correctional staff from all adult carceral facilities in one state, this study investigates: 1) how cultural workgroup concerns over danger and values of safety shape staff's worldview broadly; and, 2) how these worldviews concerning danger shape cultural cognition outside the carceral context. To answer these questions, we draw upon cultural sociology and leverage the mechanism of the schema to understand how values are recalled across domains. Through this analysis, we illustrate how an accumulation of stories concerning danger within prison shapes a worldview that structures compulsive cognition around personal safety. We show how compulsive cognition manifests as an intrinsic knowledge of the dangerous character of others and a personal drive to fortify against underspecified violent threats outside the carceral context.

TI  - Stimulating music educator worldview change through a pedagogy of provocation, critical thinking and peer-review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MUSIC EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Contemporary literature suggests that music education is stuck in a cycle of cultural reproduction in which music teachers and curriculum writers value Western art music more than culturally-diverse and modern, technology-saturated musics, and train the next generation to hold similar views. A MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) was developed to challenge music teachers' worldviews and to develop critical thinking about the field. In this mixed-methods study, we analysed 18 months of qualitative and quantitative data provided by the more than 1,600 course participants in response to paedagogical 'provocations' to assess whether it was successful in prompting critical thinking and worldview change. We used three methods to interrogate three distinct datasets: basic content analysis of participants' publicly written reflections, statistical analysis of peer marking and context-network maps of peer comments. Between-methods triangulation crystallised our findings. We find that through required peer-review of public postings, an online community of practice formed, that it encouraged teachers to engage deeply with new ideas, and engage in Critical Thinking. We find that those who had a disposition towards critical thinking in the early assessments responded most positively to the pedagogy of provocation and were consistently prepared to question their own worldview and practice.

TI  - Estimation of groundwater storage loss for the Indian Ganga Basin using multiple lines of evidence
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We used remote sensing data, field observations and numerical groundwater modelling to investigate long-term groundwater storage losses in the regional aquifer of the Ganga Basin in India. This comprised trend analysis for groundwater level observations from 2851 monitoring bores, groundwater storage anomaly estimation using GRACE and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data sets and numerical modelling of long-term groundwater storage changes underpinned by over 50,000 groundwater level observations and uncertainty analysis. Three analyses based on different methods consistently informed that groundwater storage in the aquifer is declining at a significant rate. Groundwater level trend indicated storage loss in the range - 1.1 to - 3.3 cm year(-1) (median - 2.6 cm year(-1)) while the modelling and GRACE storage anomaly methods indicated the storage loss in the range of - 2.1 to - 4.5 cm year(-1) (median - 3.2 cm year(-1)) and - 1.0 to - 4.2 cm year(-1) (median - 1.7 cm year(-1)) respectively. Probabilistic modelling analysis also indicated that the average groundwater storage is declining in all the major basin states, the highest declining trend being in the western states of Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi. While smaller compared to the western states, average groundwater storage in states further towards east-Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal within the basin are also declining. Time series of storage anomalies obtained from the three methods showed similar trends. Probabilistic storage analysis using the numerical model vetted by observed trend analysis and GRACE data provides the opportunity for predictive analysis of storage changes for future climate and other scenarios.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundDifficulty in preoperatively assessing the risk for occult invasion or surgery that precludes future accurate axillary mapping in patients with ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) account for overutilization of SLND.MethodsProspective, multicenter, cohort study, including women with any DCIS planned for mastectomy or DCIS grade 2 and > 20 mm, any DCIS grade 3, any mass-forming DCIS and any planned surgery. Patients received an interstitial SPIO injection during breast surgery, but no upfront SLND was performed. If invasion was identified on final pathology, delayed SLND (d-SLND) was performed separately with the coadministration of isotope +/- blue dye (BD). Study outcomes were proportion of upfront SLNDs that were avoided, detection rates during d-SLND, and impact on healthcare costs.ResultsIn total, 78.7% of study participants (N = 254, mean age 60 years, mean DCIS size 37.8 mm) avoided upfront SLND. On d-SLND (median 28 days, range 9-46), SPIO outperformed Tc-99 with (98.2% vs. 63.6%, p < 0.001) or without BD (92.7% vs. 50.9%, p < 0.001) and had higher nodal detection rate (86.9% vs. 32.3%, p < 0.001) and with BD (93.9% vs. 41.4%, p < 0.001). Only 27.9% of all SLNs retrieved were concordant for Tc-99 and SPIO. Type of breast procedure (WLE vs. oncoplastic BCT vs. mastectomy) affected these outcomes and accounted for the low performance of Tc-99 (p < 0.001). d-SLND resulted in a 28.1% total cost containment for women with pure DCIS on final pathology (4190 vs. 5828 USD, p < 0.001).ConclusionsMarking the SLN with SPIO may avoid overtreatment and allow for accurate d-SLND in patients with DCIS.

TI  - SHAFTS (v2022.3): a deep-learning-based Python package for simultaneous extraction of building height and footprint from sentinel imagery
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Building height and footprint are two fundamental urban morphological features required by urban climate modelling. Although some statistical methods have been proposed to estimate average building height and footprint from publicly available satellite imagery, they often involve tedious feature engineering which makes it hard to achieve efficient knowledge discovery in a changing urban environment with ever-increasing earth observations. In this work, we develop a deep-learning-based (DL) Python package - SHAFTS (Simultaneous building Height And FootprinT extraction from Sentinel imagery) to extract such information. Multi-task deep-learning (MTDL) models are proposed to automatically learn feature representation shared by building height and footprint prediction. Besides, we integrate digital elevation model (DEM) information into developed models to inform models of terrain-induced effects on the backscattering displayed by Sentinel-1 imagery. We set conventional machine-learning-based (ML) models and single-task deep-learning (STDL) models as benchmarks and select 46 cities worldwide to evaluate developed models' patch-level prediction skills and city-level spatial transferability at four resolutions (100, 250, 500 and 1000 m). Patch-level results of 43 cities show that DL models successfully produce discriminative feature representation and improve the coefficient of determination (R-2) of building height and footprint prediction more than ML models by 0.27-0.63 and 0.11-0.49, respectively. Moreover, stratified error assessment reveals that DL models effectively mitigate the severe systematic underestimation of ML models in the high-value domain: for the 100 m case, DL models reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of building height higher than 40 m and building footprint larger than 0.25 by 31 m and 0.1, respectively, which demonstrates the superiority of DL models on refined 3D building information extraction in highly urbanized areas. For the evaluation of spatial transferability, when compared with an existing state-of-the-art product, DL models can achieve similar improvement on the overall performance and high-value prediction. Furthermore, within the DL family, comparison in building height prediction between STDL and MTDL models reveals that MTDL models achieve higher accuracy in all cases and smaller bias uncertainty for the prediction in the high-value domain at the refined scale, which proves the effectiveness of multi-task learning (MTL) on building height estimation.

TI  - The urban climate of the largest cities of the European Arctic
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have found intense and persistent positive temperature anomalies associated with urban areas in high northern latitudes. However, understanding the intensity and variability of urban heat islands (UHI) in these regions remains limited. Here we study the urban climate of the seven largest cities in the European Arctic. These cities with populations ranging from 50,000 to nearly 300,000 span four countries and three bioclimatic zones in northern Fennoscandia. They include coastal and inland cities-and have complex local geography associated with topography and water bodies. We analyze land surface temperature (LST) satellite remote-sensing data with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2020. The aim is to assess the intensity and temporal (seasonal and interannual) variability and trends of LST anomalies to learn about surface UHI development over different time frames in the urban Arctic. We observed persistent urban temperature anomalies in every season in the range of 1-5 degrees C, with the highest values for the largest city Murmansk (Russia). There is a strong inverse relationship between surface UHI intensity and its temporal variability: the more substantial the surface UHI, the more stable it is and the lower its temporal variability. Murmansk and Tromso (Norway) have the highest thermal anomalies showing relatively low temporal variability, whereas the surface UHI in Bodo (Norway) is low and very volatile. We found no general direction of surface UHI change in the long term, as statistically significant changes were identified for only 10 of 56 cases. The study also suggests that in addition to the size (population) of the city, the presence of compact and dense urban infrastructure causes strong and stable urban temperature anomalies and has a more significant impact than the geographical setting of the city.

TI  - Identification and management of acute alcohol intoxication
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Acute alcohol intoxication (AAI) is a harmful clinical condition, potentially life-threatening, secondary to the intake of large amounts of alcohol. Clinical manifestations of AAI are characterized by behavioural and neurological symptoms, even if its effects involve several organs and apparatus. Moreover, severe alcohol intoxication can produce a global neurological impairment leading to autonomic dysfunction, respiratory depression, coma and cardiac arrest. The evaluation of blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) is useful to confirm the suspicion of intoxication, both for clinical and legal reasons. Most of patients with AAI are referred to Emergency Departments due to behavioural, social, traumatic or clinical complications. Patient's stabilization is the first step in the management of AAI, in order to support vital functions and to prevent complications. Metadoxine represents a useful drug to increase ethanol metabolism and elimination. Given that AAI could represent a sentinel event of chronic alcohol abuse, patients presenting with acute intoxication should be screened for the presence of an underlying alcohol use disorder and referred to and an alcohol addiction unit to start a multidisciplinary treatment to achieve long term alcohol abstinence. The present review will focus on clinical features, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies of AAI.

AB  - This paper presents the methodology of an applied geophysical and remote sensing research at river deltas for their subsurface and surface structure and its application in the deltaic plain of Pineios River (Thessaly, Greece). The scope is to primarily calculate the thickness of deltaic post alpine deposits, with the contribution of Transient Electromagnetic Method (TEM), but also iden-tify the surficial characteristics (biotic/ abiotic) of the area with the appropriate combination of spectral bands and spectral indices. Regarding the remote sensing approach, some geomorpho-logical features were outlined. This was managed from six false color composites of the area, produced by combining spectral bands and additional five false color composites by combining several spectral indices.center dot The results of the TEM method along with their statistical analysis provided important in-formation regarding the spatial distribution and thickness of the lithological units along the deltaic plain.center dot The combination of spectral bands 8, 7, 6 seems to adumbrate the hydrographic network of the area and even detects possible changes in the inflow.center dot The combination of spectral indices MSAVI2, WV-BI, WV-WI was helpful enough to geomor-phological mapping of the deltaic plain.

TI  - Estimation and mapping of water quality parameters using satellite images: a case study of Two Rivers Dam, Kenya
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous water quality monitoring (WQM) of watersheds and the existing water supplies is a crucial step in realizing sustainable water development and management. However, the conventional approaches are time-consuming, labor intensive, and do not give spatial-temporal variations of the water quality indices. The advancements in remote sensing techniques have enabled WQM over larger temporal and spatial scales. This study used satellite images and an Empirical Multivariate Regression Model (EMRM) to estimate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity. Furthermore, ordinary Kriging was applied to generate spatial maps showing the distribution of water quality parameters (WQPs). For all the samples, turbidity was estimated with an R-2 and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.763 and 0.818, respectively while TSS estimation gave respective R-2 and r values of 0.809 and 0.721. Chl-a was estimated with accuracies of R-2 and r of 0.803 and 0.731, respectively. Based on the results, this study concluded that WQPs provide a spatial-temporal view of the water quality in time and space that can be retrieved from satellite data products with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - GEE can prominently reduce uncertainties from input data and parameters of the remote sensing-driven distributed hydrological model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The coupling of multisource remote sensing data and the lack of measured runoff introduce input data and model parameters uncertainties to the remote sensing-driven distributed hydrological model (RS-DHM). The PB satellite remote sensing datasets of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) are widely used in RS-DHM and remote sensing runoff inversion research, but whether GEE can reduce the two abovementioned uncertainties is still unknown. To answer this question, twelve remote sensing data sources provided by GEE were used in this study to drive a typical RS-DHM called the remote sensing-driven distributed time-variant gain model (RS-DTVGM) and the remote sensing runoff inversion technology called remote sensing hydrological station (RSHS), and the contribution of GEE to the improving hydrological model uncertainties was quantitatively analyzed from 2001 to 2020. The results showed that (1) the GEE-based improved data preparation not only effectively reduced the uncertainty in the input data with better spatialtemporal continuity and a 6.20 % reduction in the total area occupied by invalid grids, but also enhanced the operational efficiency by reducing the image number, memory size and data processing time of the satellite remote sensing data by 83.63 %, 99.53 %, and 98.73 %, respectively; (2) the GEE-based RSHS technology provided sufficient data support for parameter adjustment and accuracy validation of the RS-DTVGM, which effectively reduced the uncertainty in the model parameters and increased the Nash efficiency coefficient (NSE) in the calibration and validation period from 0.67 to 0.87 and 0.75, respectively; and (3) the calibrated RS-DTVGM was more reliable and robust, and its runoff and evapotranspiration were consistent with the actual statistical data. In the future, GEE and RSHS technology should be

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Gulf of Mannar, Noctiluca scintillans blooms have been observed three times in September 2019, September and October 2020, and October 2021. It was determined and measured how the bloom period affects ichthyo-diversity. Noctiluca cell density varied slightly from year to year, ranging from1.8433 x 103 cells/L to 1.3824 x 106cells/L. In surface and sea bottom waters, high ammonia levels and low dissolved oxygen levels were noted. During the bloom period a significant increase in chlorophyll concentration was found. The amount of chloro-phyll in GOM was extremely high, according to remote sensing photos made using MODIS-Aqua 4 km data. Acute hypoxia caused the death of wild fish near coral reefs and also in fish reared in sea cages. The decay of the bloom resulted in significant ammonia production, a dramatic drop in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, and ultimately stress, shock, and mass mortality of fishes.

TI  - Progress in the remote sensing of groundwater-dependent ecosystems in semi-arid environments
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) has increased substantially in recent years. Of significant prominence, is the delineation and mapping of groundwater-dependent vegetation (GDV), species diversity, and water quality in these ecosystems. Groundwater-dependent ecosystems provide several ecological services such as habitat for wildlife fauna, carbon sequestration and water purification. The recent technological advancements and readily accessibility of new satellite sensors with improved sensing characteristics have resulted in numerous state-of-the-art applications for GDEs assessment and monitoring. These studies were done at varying scales, essentially in light of global climate change and variability. In this study, we review and assess the progress on the remote sensing of GDEs in semi-arid environments. We present the key trends in GDEs remote sensing that underpin many of the recent scientific research milestones and application developments. In addition, we observed a considerable shift towards the use of advanced spatial modelling techniques, using highresolution remotely sensed data to further improve the characterisation and understanding of GDEs. Thus, literature shows the successful use of freely available remotely sensed data in mapping GDEs. We conclude that the advancement in remote sensing provides unique opportunities for the assessment and monitoring of GDEs in environments currently influenced by climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Although remarkable progress has been made, this review revealed the need for further remote sensing and geospatial analysis studies to map other GDEs aspects including water quality and species diversity. Furthermore, the mapping and characterizing of the seasonal and yearly variability and changes in GDEs is required, mainly in the face of climate change and human impacts as well as water scarcity, particularly in data-limited tropical environments.

TI  - Global water resources and the role of groundwater in a resilient water future
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Water resources are threatened by human activities and climate variability. This Review discusses trends in water storage and availability and examines ways to enhance water-resource resilience through green and grey solutions.Water is a critical resource, but ensuring its availability faces challenges from climate extremes and human intervention. In this Review, we evaluate the current and historical evolution of water resources, considering surface water and groundwater as a single, interconnected resource. Total water storage trends have varied across regions over the past century. Satellite data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) show declining, stable and rising trends in total water storage over the past two decades in various regions globally. Groundwater monitoring provides longer-term context over the past century, showing rising water storage in northwest India, central Pakistan and the northwest United States, and declining water storage in the US High Plains and Central Valley. Climate variability causes some changes in water storage, but human intervention, particularly irrigation, is a major driver. Water-resource resilience can be increased by diversifying management strategies. These approaches include green solutions, such as forest and wetland preservation, and grey solutions, such as increasing supplies (desalination, wastewater reuse), enhancing storage in surface reservoirs and depleted aquifers, and transporting water. A diverse portfolio of these solutions, in tandem with managing groundwater and surface water as a single resource, can address human and ecosystem needs while building a resilient water system.

TI  - Modelling, mapping and monitoring of forest cover changes, using support vector machine, kernel logistic regression and naive bayes tree models with optical remote sensing data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is designed to monitor the spatio-temporal changes in forest cover using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information system (GIS) techniques from 1990 to 2017. Landsat data from 1990 (Thematic mapper [TM]), 2000 and 2010 (Enhanced Thematic Mapper [ETM+]), and 2013 to 2017 (Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor [OLI/TIRS]) were classified into the classes termed snow, water, barren land, built-up area, forest, and vegetation. The method was built using multitemporal Landsat images and the machine learning techniques Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Tree (NBT) and Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR). According to the results, forest area was decreased from 19,360 km2 (26.0%) to 18,784 km2 (25.2%) from 1990 to 2010, while forest area was increased from 18,640 km2 (25.0%) to 26,765 km2 (35.9%) area from 2013 to 2017 due to "One billion tree Project". Ac-cording to our findings, SVM performed better than KLR and NBT on all three accuracy metrics (recall, precision, and accuracy) and the F1 score was >0.89. The study demonstrated that concurrent reforestation in barren land areas improved methods of sustaining the forest and RS and GIS into everyday forestry organization practices in Khyber Pakhtun Khwa (KPK), Pakistan. The study results were beneficial, especially at the decision-making level for the local or pro-vincial government of KPK and for understanding the global scenario for regional planning.

TI  - AerialWaste dataset for landfill discovery in aerial and satellite images
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Illegal landfills are sites where garbage is dumped violating waste management laws. Aerial images enable the use of photo interpretation for territory scanning and landfill detection but this practice is hindered by the manual nature of this task which also requires expert knowledge. Deep Learning methods can help capture the analysts' expertise and build automated landfill discovery tools. However, this goal requires public high-quality datasets for model training and testing. At present no such datasets exist and this gap penalizes the research toward scalable and accurate landfill discovery methods. We present a dataset for landfill detection featuring airborne, WorldView-3, and GoogleEarth images annotated by professional photo interpreters. It comprises 3,478 positive and 6,956 negative examples. Most positive instances are characterized by metadata: the type of waste, its storage mode, the type of the site, and the evidence and severity of the illicit. The dataset has been technically validated by building an accurate landfill detector and is accompanied by a visualization and annotation tool.

TI  - Exploring the impact of urban features on the spatial variation of land surface temperature within the diurnal cycle
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive heat in urban areas affects thermal comfort and livability. In order to improve local thermal envi-ronment, correlations patterns between urban features and land surface temperature (LST) have been widely studied. However, the majority of these studies were conducted only during the daytime. Due to the limitations of polar orbiting satellites such as Landsat series and Terra, it was still unclear how urban features affect the spatial variation of LST in a 24-hour cycle. In summer, with Beijing, China as an example, five machine learning models were used to perform regression analysis between urban features and ECOSTRESS LST within the diurnal cycle. The main findings of this study are: (1) The impact of urban features on LST was mainly in relation to the intensity of sunlight. (2) Building and vegetation coverage affected LST most in the morning and afternoon respectively. (3) Point of interest (such as shops, schools, and car parks etc.) density and surface albedo were the dominant factors influencing LST from dusk to dawn. (4) Higher buildings lowered LST during the day, but raised it at night. We believed that these findings can provide quantitative insights into UHI adaptation measures for sustainable urban planning and design.

TI  - Street-view and traditional greenness metrics with adults' sitting time in high-density living in Hong Kong: Comparing associations, air pollution and noise roles, and population heterogeneity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Emerging evidence suggests neighborhood greenness is associated with physical activity; however, the sitting-specific associations with multi-source greenness metrics remain unclear, especially in high-density cities.Objectives: This cross-sectional study examined: 1) the associations of street-view greenness (SVG) and traditional greenness metrics (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetable Index (NDVI) and park density) with sitting time; 2) the po-tential moderating/mediating roles of objective/perceived air pollution and perceived roadside noise; and 3) how the associations vary by demographics and socioeconomic status. Methods: Interview survey data of 1977 adults in Hong Kong from 2014 and 2015 was linked to environmental data. Using an object-based image classification algorithm, SVG was derived from Google Street View images, capturing human-viewed street-level greenery. NDVI was derived from Landsat 8 satellite images using the normalized differ-ence between the near-infrared and red bands. Park density was calculated by point density. In the main analyses including regressions, parallel mediation, interaction, and stratified models, the environmental metrics were measured within a 1000-m Euclidean buffer of residence.Results: SVG and park density were negatively associated with sitting time after adjusting for covariates including phys-ical activity while NDVI was not significantly associated with sitting time, and results were robust with 800-1800 m Euclidean and 1400-1800 m network distance. Greenness-sitting associations were not moderated/mediated by per-ceived air pollution/roadside noise while SVG-sitting associations were moderated by objective NO2, O3, and PM2.5 and mediated by O3. SVG-sitting associations differed by age, having under-school-aged children, birthplace, educa-tion, and occupation type while associations between traditional greenness metrics and prolonged sitting showed no significant population heterogeneity.Conclusions: SVG appears to be more accurate in estimating exposure than traditional metrics to reflect greenness -sitting associations, objective air pollution moderating and mediating roles, and population heterogeneity, which em-phasizes the importance of street-level greenness planning for health promotion in terms of reducing sitting time.

TI  - Ocean responses to Shaheen, the first cyclone to hit the north coast of Oman in 2021
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - On October 3rd, 2021, cyclone Shaheen made landfall on the northeast coast of Oman as a firstcategory cyclone after crossing the Sea of Oman. It is the first time in more than 130 years that a storm has made such extraordinary landfall on the northeast coast of Oman. This study intends to examine the effects of cyclone Shaheen on ocean cooling and biological response in the Sea of Oman (SO) and the the Arabian Sea (AS) using satellite remote sensing data, an Argo float, and the HYCOM model. The validation analysis of the HYCOM model and the Argo float showed strong correlations between vertical temperature profiles (R = 0.99) and vertical salinity profiles (R = 0.89). Furthermore, winds during the cyclone caused mixing and upwelling leading to Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) dropping 2.5 degrees C along southern Iranian coastlines, decreasing 5 degrees C along northern Oman's coastlines, and rising 1 degrees C across the Arabian Sea. As a result of the exitance of the cyclonic eddies in the Sea of Oman, a significant drop of 5 degrees C in SST was observed along the coastline of Oman caused by cold upwelled water from southern Iranian coastlines. Cyclone Shaheen's heavy rainfall caused the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) in the Sea of Oman to drop from 36.7 to 36.8 psu. According to the results, Ekman pumping and upwelling processes predominated along the southern Iranian coast resulting in nutrient uplift and phytoplankton blooms (3 mg/m3). In contrast, strong stratification near the coast of Oman prevented nutrient uplift and led to low Chl-a concentrations. Due to the unique nature of cyclone Shaheen, it is essential to examine the complex dynamic and interaction between the ocean and atmosphere in the Sea of Oman and the Arabian Sea.

TI  - Forest regeneration pathways in contrasting deforestation patterns of Amazonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary vegetation is increasingly recognized as a key element for biodiversity conservation and carbon stocks in human-modified landscapes. Contrasting deforestation patterns should lead to distinct patterns of forest regeneration, but this relationship is yet to be unveiled for long-term studies. Using Landsat data from 1985-2015, we analyzed the surface area, spatial distribution, and age of secondary vegetation in Fishbone and Geometric patterns of deforestation. Additionally, we investigated to which extent secondary vegetation reduces forest patch isolation at the landscape level across time. We found the Fishbone pattern to consistently have more secondary vegetation over time than the Geometric pattern, despite having the same size of the deforested area. However, the Fishbone pattern showed more secondary vegetation area with less than 5 years old, while the Geometric pattern showed more area with secondary vegetation with more than 30 years old. Regarding spatial distribution, we found secondary vegetation to be more spread across the entire landscape at the Fishbone pattern and to consistently reduce forest patch isolation across time. This is congruent with the land use typically found in Geometric (industrial cropping and ranching) and Fishbone (fallow agriculture with small-scale ranching) patterns. These findings indicate that the Fishbone pattern of deforestation produces a more biodiversity-friendly landscape structure than the Geometric pattern. On the other hand, older secondary vegetation found in the Geometric deforestation pattern could indicate more carbon stocked in those landscapes. Future public policies of land use and occupation should consider better landscape planning and management to overcome this duality and create synergies between biodiversity conservation and secondary vegetation carbon stock.

TI  - Building a high-resolution site index map using boosted regression trees: the Norwegian case
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate estimation of site productivity is essential for forest projections and scenario modelling. We present and evaluate models to predict site index (SI) and whether a site is productive (potential total stem volume production >= 1 m3 center dot ha-1 center dot year-1) in a wall-to-wall high-resolution (16 m x 16 m) SI map for Norway. We investigate whether remotely sensed data improve predictions. We also study the advantages and disadvantages of using boosted regression trees (BRT), a machine-learning algorithm, to create high-accuracy SI maps. We use climatic and topographical data, soil parent material, a land resource map, and depth to water, together with Sentinel-2 satellite images and airborne laser scanning metrics, as predictor variables. We use the SI observed at more than 10 000 National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots throughout Norway to fit BRT models and validate the models using 5822 independent temporary plots from the NFI. We benchmark our results against SI estimates from forest monitoring inventories. We find that the SI from BRT has root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 2.3 m (hardwoods) to 3.6 m (spruce) when tested against independent validation data from the NFI temporary plots. These RMSEs are similar or marginally better than an evaluation of SI estimates from operational forest management plans where SI normally stems from manual photo interpretation.

TI  - Brackish-water desalination plant modulates ground deformation in the city of Cape Coral, Florida
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The groundwater abstraction and injection cycle in coastal aquifer systems can locally change the piezometric head in aquifer system, leading to differential settlement on the ground that may compromise infrastructure safety. Furthermore, long-term, extensive groundwater extraction may cause significant damage to water resources. Ironically, Florida, a state known for its abundant water resources, has been experiencing major water supply issues in some areas that began to intensify with rapid population growth over the last five decades. As the demand for drinking water in Florida continues to rise, local authorities have turned to using brackish and saline water sources. As of 2022, more than 80% of the desalination plants in the United States are concentrated in the coastal areas of central and south Florida. Using satellite radar interferometry, we have investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of surface subsidence driven by groundwater pumping for brackish-water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination facilities in the City of Cape Coral, Florida. We employed Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) to process all available Sentinel 1A and 1B scenes over the region along two ascending orbits. The deformation time-series obtained from independent SAR data sets are compared spatiotemporally with the groundwater level that provides feed water to the BWRO facilities. The deformation pattern shows one main lobe of subsidence with rates of up to 25 mm/year centred around the operating wells in the north BWRO wellfield that we interpret as human-induced compaction. The spatial correlation between the subsiding area and the active production wells argues in favour of surface deformation induced by the BWRO operations. Based on the InSAR-derived displacement field and well data, we propose a model to explain the spatial heterogeneity of the subsidence process. The ground deformation is reproduced by an elastic model mimicking the reservoir compaction using planar negative closing dislocations. Modelling of the subsidence shows similar to 0.67 Mm(3) yr(-1) vol loss due to compaction of the aquifer. The subsidence deformation was also used to compute the cumulative drainage area of the producing wells.

TI  - Estimates of the spatially complete, observational-data-driven planetary boundary layer height over the contiguous United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to generate a spatially complete planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) product over the contiguous United States (CONUS). An eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) regression model was developed using selected meteorological and geographical data fields as explanatory variables to fit the PBLH values derived from Aircraft Meteorological DAta Relay (AMDAR) reports hourly profiles at 13:00-14:00 LST (local solar time) during 2005-2019. A preprocessing step was implemented to exclude AMDAR data points that were unexplainable by the predictors, mostly under stable conditions. The PBLH prediction by this work as well as PBLHs from three reanalysis datasets (the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate - ERA5; the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research andApplications, Version 2 - MERRA-2; and the North American Regional Reanalysis - NARR) were compared to reference PBLH observations from spaceborne lidar (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations, CALIPSO), airborne lidar (High Spectral Resolution Lidar, HSRL), and in situ research aircraft profiles from the Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) campaigns. Compared with PBLHs from reanalysis products, the PBLH prediction from this work shows closer agreement with the reference observations, with the caveat that different PBLH products and estimates have different ways of identifying the PBLH; thus, their comparisons should be interpreted with caution. The reanalysis products show significant high biases in the western CONUS relative to the reference observations. One direct application of the dataset generated by this work is that it enables sampling of the PBLH at the sounding locations and times of sensors aboard satellites with an overpass time in the early afternoon, e.g., the Afternoon Train (A-train), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), and the Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite sensors. As both AMDAR and ERA5 are continuous at hourly resolution, the observational-data-driven PBLHs may be extended to other daytime hours.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in urbanization forced the change in land-use patterns from agriculture to impermeable residential. This phenomenon will negatively affect both direct and indirect agricultural employment opportunities and productivity. A systematic technique helps in recovering the decremental agricultural land proportion. Spatial analysis of a region is a leading scientific method for land characteristics and suitability assessment. Land suitability can assist in the creation of agricultural productivity growth strategies. Geographic Information System (GIS) is successful in multiple criterion-based decision approaches. This study considered bare land extracted by supervised classification on the collected georeferenced Landsat-8 satellite image as the study area. Organic compounds, conductivity, pH, and soil texture were the criteria for estimating the suitable regions for agricultural activities in our study area, Sivanthipatti village, Tirunelveli district. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) helped to assign weightage for the selected criteria. The combined AHP and GIS technique includes creating an AHP hierarchy, defining evaluation criteria, conducting pairwise comparisons, and creating criterion maps and land suitability analysis maps. The criterion weightage determined from AHP for pH, organic carbon content, salinity, and soil texture is 54.86%, 28.05%, 11.51%, and 5.58%, respectively. This analysis estimated that around 1750 acres of land are readily suitable for agricultural land-use conversion from its existing bare land surface.

TI  - Sentinel Node Procedure to Select Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Patients with Occult Nodal Metastases for Whole Pelvis Radiotherapy
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate identification of men who harbor nodal metastases is neces-sary to select patients who most likely benefit from whole pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT). Limited sensitivity of diagnostic imaging approaches for the detection of nodal micrometastases has led to the exploration of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Objective: To evaluate whether SLNB can be used as a tool to select pathologically node-positive patients who likely benefit from WPRT. Design, setting, and participants: We included 528 clinically node-negative primary prostate cancer (PCa) patients with an estimated nodal risk of >5% treated between 2007 and 2018. Intervention: A total of 267 patients were directly treated with prostate-only radio-therapy (PORT; non-SLNB group), while 261 patients underwent SLNB to remove lymph nodes directly draining from the primary tumor prior to radiotherapy (SLNB group); pN0 patients were treated with PORT, while pN1 patients were offered WPRT. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) and radiological recurrence-free survival (RRFS) were compared using propensity score weighted (PSW) Cox proportional hazard models. Results and limitations: The median follow-up was 71 mo. Occult nodal metastases were found in 97 (37%) SLNB patients (median metastasis size: 2 mm). Adjusted 7-yr BCRFS rates were 81% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77-86%) in the SLNB group and 49% (95% CI 43-56%) in the non-SLNB group. The corresponding adjusted 7-yr RRFS rates were 83% (95% CI 78-87%) and 52% (95% CI 46-59%), respectively. In the PSW multivariable Cox regression analysis, SLNB was associated with improved BCRFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.25-0.59, p < 0.001) and RRFS (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28-0.69, p < 0.001). Limitations include the bias inherent to the study's Conclusions: SLNB-based selection of pN1 PCa patients for WPRT was associated efit from the addition of pelvis radiotherapy.

Results There were significant (negligible to low, rho = 0.16-0.28; p < 0.05) relationships between the IAPCC-SV total and three constructs with IDI Perceived Orientation scores, and the IAPCCSV total and two constructs with the IDI Developmental Orientation scores. There were significant (negligible to low, rho = 0.18-0.35; p < 0.05) relationships between IAPCC-SV total and construct scores with the IDI Acceptance and Adaptation orientation scores. Students with scores in an IDI DO of Acceptance or Adaptation were sig-nificantly more likely to have an IAPCC-SV score in the category of Culturally Competent (X2 = 3.70, p = 0.05).Conclusions The discordance of the two measures suggests that the instruments measure unrelated constructs (worldviews, attributes or skills) of cultural competence that are exclusive to each measure and context dependent. Context specific measures may not be generalized to a greater worldview, and visa versa. Multimodal assessment that triangulates data and supports student learning outcomes may be the most effective strategy to capture the impact of curriculum and/or a global learning experience on students' development of cultural competence.
