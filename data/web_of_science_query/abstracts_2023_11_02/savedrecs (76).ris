TI  - Geotechnologies applied to surface temperature characterization in Teresina city (PI)
T2  - REVISTA ACTA GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Regarding the tropical characteristics of Brazil, many works have been developed focusing on the temperature climate element, which is the first to receive changes resulting from urbanization. In this perspective, the present research had as general objective to analyze the relationship between the soil cover and the surface temperature in Teresina (PI). The methodological procedures included the use of images generated by remote sensors and geoprocessing techniques, with the intention of characterizing the city surface, and relating it to the space-time expression of its thermal field. For this, an interval of 30 years was contemplated, october of 1985 and october of 2015, with comparison of images referring to these two years. Through their processing, land use and cover maps and surface temperature maps were produced for the years considered. At the end, it was possible to verify the relation between the highest values of surface temperature and the areas most intensely transformed by human action, through the urbanization process.

TI  - Relative Azimuthal-Angle Matching (RAM): A Screening Method for GEO-LEO Reflectance Comparison in Middle Latitude Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduced a data screening method for comparing the reflectances in middle latitude forest regions collected by a Geostationary Earth Observing (GEO) satellite and a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. This method attempts to reduce the differences between the relative azimuth angles of the GEO and LEO observations. The method, called relative azimuthal-angle matching (RAM), takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of the GEO satellites, which enables collection of a wide range of relative azimuth angles within a day. The performance of the RAM method was evaluated using data in the visible and near-infrared bands collected by the Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and the Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The consistency of the reflectance pairs of MODIS and AHI selected by the RAM method was compared with the consistency of the reflectance pairs acquired simultaneously by the two sensors. The data were matched pixel-by-pixel after applying atmospheric corrections and cloud screening. The results show that RAM improved the reflectance ratio by approximately 10% for the red and NIR bands on average relative to the simultaneous observations. Significant improvements in the two bands were observed (20%), especially among data collected in the fall and winter. Performance of RAM depends largely on season. Especially in summer, the reflectance pair chosen by RAM showed less consistency than solar zenith-angle matching (SZM). The results also indicated the relatively large influence of the spectral response functions on the green and red bands of the two sensors.

TI  - A Mixed Model Approach to Vegetation Condition Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Case of Kenya's Operational Drought Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts, with their increasing frequency of occurrence, especially in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA), continue to negatively affect lives and livelihoods. For example, the 2011 drought in East Africa caused massive losses, documented to have cost the Kenyan economy over 12 billion US dollars. Consequently, the demand is ever-increasing for ex-ante drought early warning systems with the ability to offer drought forecasts with sufficient lead times The study uses 10 precipitation and vegetation condition indices that are lagged over 1, 2 and 3-month time-steps to predict future values of vegetation condition index aggregated over a 3-month time period (VCI3M) that is a proxy variable for drought monitoring. The study used data covering the period 2001-2015 at a monthly frequency for four arid northern Kenya counties for model training, with data for 2016-2017 used as out-of-sample data for model testing. The study adopted a model space search approach to obtain the most predictive artificial neural network (ANN) model as opposed to the traditional greedy search approach that is based on optimal variable selection at each model building step. The initial large model-space was reduced using the general additive model (GAM) technique together with a set of assumptions. Even though we built a total of 102 GAM models, only 20 had R-2 0.7, and together with the model with lag of the predicted variable, were subjected to the ANN modelling process. The ANN process itself uses the brute-force approach that automatically partitions the training data into 10 sub-samples, builds the ANN models in these samples and evaluates their performance using multiple metrics. The results show the superiority of 1-month lag of the variables as compared to longer time lags of 2 and 3 months. The best ANN model recorded an R-2 of 0.78 between actual and predicted vegetation conditions 1-month ahead using the out-of-sample data. Investigated as a classifier distinguishing five vegetation deficit classes, the best ANN model had a modest accuracy of 67% and a multi-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 89.99%.

TI  - Land use and land cover dynamics with special emphasis on shifting cultivation in Eastern Ghats Highlands of India using remote sensing data and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continual, historical, and accurate information about the land use/land cover (LULC) changes of the earth's surface is extremely important for sustainable management of natural resources. In this study, historical topographic sheets, IRS P6 LISS-III, and LANDSAT TM images were used to provide recent and historical LULC conditions of the Eastern Ghats Highlands of east India. The supervised classification results were further improved by employing image enhancement and visual interpretation. Ratio Vegetation Index with fuzzy-based possibilistic c-means classification approach has improved the classification accuracy of the shifting cultivated area. Post-classification comparisons of the classified images indicated that the major change consisted of barren land and forestland changing into agricultural land and scrubland. Between 1931 and 2008, forest cover was decreased from 52.7% to 29.6% of total area. There was an increase in the scrub area from 874 (10.4%) to 1269km(2) (15.2%), and agricultural land from 978 (11.7%) to 2864km(2) (34.2%) during the same period. The rate of deforestation was found to be 0.65km(2) per year for reserve forest and 24.50km(2) per year for mixed forest. The shifting cultivated area in the district was 308.7km(2) during 2004, and that has been reduced since then and now is stabilized to 186.4 km(2) area. Among this 186.4 km(2) area, nearly half is covered by abandoned shifting cultivation. The decadal rate of decrease of shifting cultivated area is 0.15% per year. The shifting cultivated areas were mainly distributed at elevations 580-810 and 810-907m and slopes 20-30 and 30-40%. Southeast and south facing slopes were preferred for shifting cultivation. Based on the identified causes of the change in shifting cultivation, policy recommendations for their better management were made.

TI  - Micro-scale spatial variability in soil heat flux (SHF) in a wine-grape vineyard
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In vineyards, hourly soil heat flux (SHF) may account for as much as 30% of net radiation. Therefore, inaccurate estimates of SHF may lead to non-negligible errors when quantifying the surface energy balance. The typical canopy height to width ratio of two along with widely spaced rows (row spacing exceeding canopy height), and leaf biomass concentrated in the upper half of the vine canopy result in variable shading conditions producing sharp, sometimes abrupt, differences in SHF between adjacent points within the interrow space. Drip irrigation, which is also a typical practice in many vineyards in semi-arid regions, adds an additional source of variability in the interrow soil moisture which strongly affects SHF. Lastly, the common practice in Californian wine-grape vineyards to plant cover crop in the interrow, forming two distinct areas below the canopybare soil and crop cover, further increases SHF variability in the interrow. This small-scale variability challenges the measurement of SHF in such agrosystems. The objective of the research was to assess the micro-scale (within the interrow between two vine rows) spatial variability in SHF, and to determine which of the three variablesnon-uniform (in both space and time) shading patterns, non-uniform surface cover (bare soil vs. cover crop) and non-uniform soil water content (due to the drip irrigation)is the most significant driver for the local heterogeneity. The variability of incoming solar radiation reaching the ground was found to be the primary source for the spatial and temporal variation of SHF once the vine canopy was fully developed. The water content distribution and the grass cover in the interrow both had minor impacts on the spatial and temporal variation in SHF. It was further found that a transect of five equally distributed sensors across the interrow accurately represented the area-average SHF given by the 11-sensor array, particularly during the growing season.

TI  - Touch Imprint Cytology: Can It Serve as an Alternative to Frozen Section in Intraoperative Assessment of Cervical Metastasis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The purpose was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of touch imprint cytology (TIC) compared with frozen section (FS) analysis as an intraoperative diagnostic tool to assess nodal metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.Materials and Methods: We intraoperatively assessed 38 patients undergoing neck dissection for oral squamous cell carcinoma, wherein a total of 248 nodes were sectioned and subjected to TIC and, subsequently, FS analysis and were finally submitted to the gold-standard histopathologic examination. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs) of TIC and FS analysis for the detection of metastasis in the cervical nodes were determined with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.Results: TIC had a sensitivity of 62.86%, specificity of 96.24%, PPV of 73.33%, NPV of 94.04%, and accuracy of 91.53% compared with histopathologic results. The sensitivity of FS analysis was 60%, specificity was 98.12%, PPV was 84%, NPV was 93.72%, and accuracy was 92.74% compared with histopathologic examination. These results of TIC were comparable to those of FS analysis.Conclusions: TIC is a straightforward, quick, and reliable technique. It has a definitive role in being used as an adjunct to FS analysis to increase intraoperative diagnostic accuracy. It can serve as a useful technique in centers that do not have FS availability.

TI  - Analysis of satellite derived solar irradiance in islands with site adaptation techniques for improving the uncertainty
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrical energy production using renewable energies is one of the most important challenges in recent years. Among renewable energies, it is worth highlighting photovoltaic and thermoelectric systems due to their adaptaticin to the Canary Islands. One of the most important issues to ensure the stability for solar power systems, mostly in insular grids as Canary Islands, is the precise knowledge of solar radiation. In this paper, we focus in Gridded Satellite data suitability for modelling Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) in islands with complicated orography, as Canary Islands. Solar radiation data retrieved from CM SAF and McClear model were analysed and compared with 22 ground measurement stations in Canary Islands. Moreover, this analysis presents the results of including a site-adaptation methodology for improving satellite suitability. We used different procedures to perform this site adaptation depending on the solar radiation conditions (clear sky or cloudy sky hours), the location of the measurement station (we establish two clusters according to the climate conditions) and the season. This study could provide information about satellite models suitability in islands and a better knowledge of solar radiation behavior. Furthermore, accurate satellite radiation data for wide spatial and temporal coverage could improve solar radiation modelling and forecasting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Elevation-dependent warming of land surface temperatures in the Andes assessed using MODIS LST time series (2000-2017)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we report on the assessment of elevation-dependent warming processes in the Andean region between 7 degrees S and 20 degrees S, using Land Surface Temperature (LST). Remotely sensed LST data were obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor in an 8-day composite, at a 1 km resolution, and from 2000 to 2017 during austral winter (June-July-August, JJA). We analysed the relation between mean monthly daytime LST and mean monthly maximum air temperature. This relation is analysed for different types of coverage, obtaining a significant correlation that varies from 0.57 to 0.82 (p < 0.01). However, effects of change in land cover were ruled out by a previous comparative assessment of trends in daytime LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The distribution of the winter daytime LST trend was found to be increasing in most areas, while decreasing in only a few areas. This trend shows that winter daytime LST is increasing at an average rate of 1.0 degrees C/decade. We also found that the winter daytime LST trend has a clear dependence on elevation, with strongest warming effects at higher elevations: 0.50 degrees C/decade at 1000-1500 masl, and 1.7 degrees C/decade above 5000 masl. However, the winter nighttime LST trend shows a steady increase with altitude increase. The dependence of rising temperature trends on elevation could have severe implications for water resources and high Andean ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluating urban growth and its implication on flood hazard and vulnerability in Srinagar city, Kashmir Valley, using geoinformatics
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the urban growth in the Srinagar city of Kashmir Valley during 1972-2014 and the effect of 2014 Kashmir flood on the urban environment. Srinagar is the capital city in Kashmir Valley which has been affected by the devastating flood in 2014. The built-up growth for the past 42years was 1565% with concomitant population growth of 224% in the Srinagar city. The built-up development was more pronounced in the central part of the city and along the river Jhelum during 1972-1989 which later on spread largely in the southernmost part of Srinagar city during the period of 1996-2014. High-Resolution Satellite (HRS) data-based observations indicated that 2014 flood inundation occupied 108sq.km area within the Srinagar municipal limits. The increase of built-up inundation was monitored from 1972 to 2014, which reveals that the built-up inundation was 3.7sq.km and increased to 39.2sq.km. The spatial analysis revealed that nine wards located in the topographically low regions and in the proximity to Jhelum river were completely (100%) inundated during the flood. The past built-up inundation spatial analysis with reference to 2014 flood inundation indicated decrease in the percentage built-up area inundation (72.4% in 1972 to 46% in 2014) which reveals that the new built-up growth in the Srinagar city mostly occurred in the relatively safer zones. It is also observed that very high flood hazard and vulnerability zones were located in the western, southern, and central parts of the city in only 10 wards which rendered these wards with very high flood risk. The study demonstrated that geoinformatics-based spatial analysis of flood inundation can be effectively used for flood risk and related strategic planning.

T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the impact of various coastal developments on mangrove cover along the Cherating Estuary, Pahang, Malaysia between 1997 and 2016. Series of Landsat imageries at Cherating Estuary have been analyzed using supervised classification. Over 19.99% (26.275 ha) of mangrove cover was degraded along the Cherating estuary from its total area of 131.642 ha during the past 20 years. The expansion of development or urban area can be observed in 1997 (27.93 ha) and in 2016 (111.02 ha), showing an increase by 297.0% in 20 years. We identified several causes of mangrove degradation, including mangrove clearing to commercial or residential area, and aquaculture activities. Cherating is one of the main tourism attractions in Pahang. The pace of coastal development throughout the estuary and the coast area had suppressed the mangroves propagation over the years. Long term monitoring of mangrove ecosystems is essential to ensure the survival and sustainability of mangrove associated biodiversity.

TI  - Identifying Retrofitting Opportunities for Federated Satellite Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at identifying retrofitting possibilities to incorporate existing spacecraft into a network of federated satellite systems. The paper presents a systematic review of possible retrofitting options, such as direct modifications including replacement and addition of interfaces, and indirect modifications through the addition of intermediary federated negotiators. The paper considers existing frequency regulations for the analysis in the technical domain, but does not take into consideration how complex or time-consuming any legislative changes might be. Although the paper concludes that direct modifications of existing satellites are nonfeasible from a technical point of view, it identifies a possible scenario of retrofitting by adding intermediary negotiator satellites. The link budget for the intersatellite link between an existing satellite mission, such as SPOT-6, and a conceptual satellite negotiator was estimated. The work concludes that from a link budget point of view and existing technology, such a configuration can provide a slant range from several hundred to thousands of kilometers. The work defines models for trade-off analysis identifying correlations between satellite negotiator parameters and the number of covered satellites. The paper concludes proposing several possible satellite negotiator architectures and high-level technical requirements based on analysis of characteristics of existing and planned satellites.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, geologic lineaments have been extracted by automatic lineament extraction algorithm of Geomatica software, using digital elevation model (DEM) derived shaded relief images being illuminated with multiple illumination directions. Fieldwork has been carried out for ground truth and in search of any possible evidence of movement along the extracted lineaments in the Kandiah valley in Kohistan district. A regional lineament (possible fault) has been inferred in recent a geological study (e.g. Zeilinger, 2002) that has been found to cross the Kandiah valley. The analysis and ground verification of automatic extracted geologic lineaments revealed that Kandiah valley is in one block without having any regional geological lineament. However, a good correlation was found among the predominant orientations of extracted geologic lineaments and the measured trends of rock features such as rock foliation, drainage pattern and linear ridges. Based on extracted lineaments, no pronounced lineament or fault with the regional extension was identified. This finding is consistent with the field observations as no defenite evidence of fault was found in the study area.

AB  - The information society, to which we have aspired and which we have been building, while being facilitative of extensive technological and economic growth, is also known to entail some social costs, like information inequality, information/psychological warfare, and information deprivation, which are causing declines in people's standard and quality of living, stimulating a social phenomenon such as poverty. The purpose of this empirical study is to explore the key features of poverty in the nation and the nation's administration potential for minimizing and preventing undesirable impacts from social transformations during the making of the information-type society. The study's empirical basis is grounded in the findings from a sociological study on one of the nation's northern regions, which involved interviews with at-risk (disadvantaged) families. The study's practical part includes a secondary analysis of data, based on comparing the findings from a body of fundamental sociological research on the issue. The study has helped identify a set of risk factors linked to social inequality and the formation of the culture and worldview of disadvantagedness by reference to the social and economic characteristics of a specific northern region.

TI  - Severe Acute Respiratory Infections With Influenza and Noninfluenza Respiratory Viruses: Yemen, 2011-2016
T2  - INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2010, Yemen started the surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) by establishing 2 sentinel sites in Sana'a and Aden city. This study aims to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza viruses among SARI patients and to determine the severity of SARI and its associated factors. The data of SARI patients who were admitted to SARI surveillance sites at Al Johory hospital in Sana'a and Al Wahdah hospital in Aden city during the period 2011-2016 were analyzed. The proportions of positive influenza viruses (type A, B) and noninfluenza viruses (respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, human parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and fatality rate among SARI patients were calculated. A total of 1811 of SARI patients were admitted during 2011-2016. Of those, 78% were <15 years old. A total of 89 (5%) patients had influenza viruses and 655 (36%) had noninfluenza viruses. The overall ICU admission rate was 40% and the case-fatality rate was 8%. Infection by influenza type (A, B) and mixed (adenovirus, human parainfluenza) was significantly associated with lower ICU admission. Age <15 years old, infection with influenza B, pre-existence of chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site were significantly associated with higher fatality rate among patients. In conclusion; SARI patients in Yemen had a high ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Influenza type B, chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site are associated with higher fatality rate. Expanding surveillance sites and panel of laboratory tests to involve other pathogens will help to provide accurate diagnosis for SARI etiology and give more comprehensive picture. Training staff for SARI case management will help to reduce severe outcomes.

TI  - Integrating Landsat TM/ETM plus and Numerical Modeling to Estimate Water Temperature in the Tigris River under Future Climate and Management Scenarios
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling the water quality of rivers and assessing the effects of changing conditions is often hindered by a lack of in situ measurements for calibration. Here, we use a combination of satellite measurements, statistical models, and numerical modeling with CE-QUAL-W2 to overcome in situ data limitations and evaluate the effect of changing hydrologic and climate conditions on water temperature (T-w) in the Tigris River, one of the largest rivers in the Middle East. Because few in situ estimates of T-w were available, remotely-sensed estimates of T-w were obtained from Landsat satellite images at roughly 2 week intervals for the year 2009 at the upstream model boundary (Mosul Dam) and two locations further downstream, Baeji and Baghdad. A regression was then developed between air temperature and Landsat T-w in order to estimate daily T-w. These daily T-w were then used for the upstream model boundary condition and for model calibration downstream. Modeled T-w at downstream locations agreed well with Landsat-based statistical estimates with an absolute mean error of <1 degrees C. A model sensitivity analysis suggested that altering upstream river discharge had little impact on downstream T-w. By contrast, a climate change scenario in which air temperatures were increased by 2 degrees C resulted in a 0.9 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C increase in T-w at Baeji and Baghdad, respectively. Since T-w is a fundamental state variable in water quality models, our approach can be used to improve water quality models when in situ data are scarce.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As Sabriya area is located in the NW sector of the Arabian Gulf, bounded from the north by Umm-Niqa natural reserve, from the east by Khor Al-Subiyah tidal channel, and from the south by Ras Al-Subiyah area. As Sabriya area is mainly characterized by sabkha deposits, wide tidal flats, and well-developed drainage system and receives sediments through Khor Al-Subiyah from Iraqi marshes by Al-Basra canal and Shatt Al-Arab estuary. The geomorphological features in the study area have been subjected to severe changes due to natural and anthropogenic activities. The geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics were investigated and presented a new geomorphic classification of the surface features in As Sabriya area. The study aims to investigate the geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics and discuss the influence of Al-Basra canal in the study area. The main objective of the study is to perform a new geomorphic classification of the surface features of As Sabriya area and detect the geomorphic changes in the coastal line. The study is based on integrating in situ and remotely sensed data from 2002 until 2017, which were used as a source of land-use and land-cover information. Lab analyses for surface sediment samples were made; geographic information system (GIS) and remotely sensed techniques were applied. Change detection results showed geomorphic changes in the area particularly along the coastline during the periods of (2002-2014), (2014-2017), and (2002-2017) due to the influences of Al-Basra canal as increasing in the tidal flat from 2002 to 2015 into Khor Al-Subiyah. During the periods from (2002 to 2014) and (2002 to 2017), the largest class changes in coastal line were shown by the coastal sabkhas at 61.917%, and 37.116% respectively, while during the period from (2014-2017), the largest effect was noticed by the sand sheet at 39.484%, which may be attributed to the eolian sedimentation driven from the lower Mesopotamian flood plain by the northwesterly winds. The particle size statistical parameter analyses indicated the variety in the sediments characteristics and depositional environments and the change detection maps revealed the major effect of sand sheet movement and alluvial deposits on geomorphic features along the coastline in As Sabriya area, as well as eolian sedimentation processes in the area.

TI  - Integrated Use of Satellite Remote Sensing, Artificial Neural Networks, Field Spectroscopy, and GIS in Estimating Crucial Soil Parameters in Terms of Soil Erosion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the main causes of soil degradation among others (salinization, compaction, reduction of organic matter, and non-point source pollution) and is a serious threat in the Mediterranean region. A number of soil properties, such as soil organic matter (SOM), soil structure, particle size, permeability, and Calcium Carbonate equivalent (CaCO3), can be the key properties for the evaluation of soil erosion. In this work, several innovative methods (satellite remote sensing, field spectroscopy, soil chemical analysis, and GIS) were investigated for their potential in monitoring SOM, CaCO3, and soil erodibility (K-factor) of the Akrotiri cape in Crete, Greece. Laboratory analysis and soil spectral reflectance in the VIS-NIR (using either Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, or field spectroscopy data) range combined with machine learning and geostatistics permitted the spatial mapping of SOM, CaCO3, and K-factor. Synergistic use of geospatial modeling based on the aforementioned soil properties and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) erosion assessment model enabled the estimation of soil loss risk. Finally, ordinary least square regression (OLSR) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) methodologies were employed in order to assess the potential contribution of different approaches in estimating soil erosion rates. The derived maps captured successfully the SOM, the CaCO3, and the K-factor spatial distribution in the GIS environment. The results may contribute to the design of erosion best management measures and wise land use planning in the study region.

TI  - Cellular Statistical Models of Broken Cloud Fields. Part IV: Effects of Pixel Size on Idealized Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the fourth part of our "Cellular Statistical Models of Broken Cloud Fields" series we use the binary Markov processes framework for quantitative investigation of the effects of low resolution of idealized satellite observations on the statistics of the retrieved cloud masks. We assume that the cloud fields are Markovian and are characterized by the "actual" cloud fraction (CF) and scale length. We use two different models of observations: a simple discrete-point sampling and a more realistic "pixel" protocol. The latter is characterized by a state attribution function (SAF), which has the meaning of the probability that the pixel with a certain CF is declared cloudy in the observed cloud mask. The stochasticity of the SAF means that the cloud-clear attribution is not ideal and can be affected by external or unknown factors. We show that the observed cloud masks can be accurately described as Markov chains of pixels and use the master matrix formalism (introduced in Part III of the series) for analytical computation of their parameters: the "observed" CF and scale length. This procedure allows us to establish a quantitative relationship (which is pixel-size dependent) between the actual and the observed cloud-field statistics. The feasibility of restoring the former from the latter is considered. The adequacy of our analytical approach to idealized observations is evaluated using numerical simulations. Comparison of the observed parameters of the simulated datasets with their theoretical expectations showed an agreement within 0.005 for the CF, while for the scale length it is within 1% in the sampling case and within 4% in the pixel case.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite images as a complement in irrigation management constitutes a primordial basis in the decision-making process for irrigated agriculture. In this context, the present study aimed to monitor through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) an irrigated sugarcane field belonging to the Mafambisse company, located at the District of Nhamatanda/Sofala, Republic of Mozambique, and establish its relationship with the crop coefficient established by FAO (kc(FAO)) and fit a regression model to estimate crop coefficient (kc) from the relationship between NDVI and kc(FAO). The study was conducted using a series of Sentinel-2A/MSI images, relative to the period from October 2016 to October 2017. Based on the NDVI images generated, it was possible to monitor the sugarcane crop in the field and analyse the sensitivity of the index to its vegetative vigor. A similar pattern was observed between kc(FAO) profiles and NDVI values, which allowed the adjustment to be performed, demonstrating that this index is an alternative to obtain the crop coefficient.

AB  - Makassar is one of the metropolitan cities located in Indonesia which recently experiences massive an increased construction because of population growth. Mapping the spatial distribution and development of the built-up region is the best method that can use as an indicator to set the urban planning policy. The purpose of this study is to identify changes in land use and density in Makassar City that occurred in 2013 and 2017 primarily for built areas, including settlements using optical data, especially Landsat data. The data analyzed by using multi-temporal Landsat OLI 8 data taken from 2013 to 2017. Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Urban Index (UI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are the spectral indices produced from Landsat OLI band covering Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) wavelength, visible Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR) areas that can be revealed by examining changes in land use and area cover. The result shows that both spectral indices namely NDBI and UI indicate an increased built-up area approximately 18 and 6%, respectively over four years. Also, based on NDBI reveals that most an increased built-up area distributes in the north of Makassar (Biringkanaya sub-district), meanwhile UI shows that Biringkanaya and Manggala sub-districts experience an increased built-up area. The development of the city will also never be separated from the history of city growth, current conditions, and the growth of the town to come. The phenomenon of the development of the town will include the development of city elements in detail, aspects of the shape of the town and the development of city regulations.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of albedo and climate in the sparse forests of Zagros
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is an important parameter affecting the climate locally and globally. A synthesis of current studies urgently calls for a better understanding of the impact of climate change on the surface albedo. The Middle East is expected to experience major climatic changes during the coming decades and has already undergone major losses in its vegetation cover. This study explores how climate change related disturbances, such as severe drought and fire events, influence albedo trends in the largest remaining forest area of the Middle East, the Zagros Mountains. We analyzed time series of albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), burn severity (dNBR), and the number of fire events all obtained from MODIS satellite images between 2000 and 2016, together with climatic data from 1950 to 2016. The Zagros area is continuously suffering from low precipitation, high temperatures, and evermore-frequent wildfire events. Our large-scale analysis revealed that albedo is linked to precipitation, number of fire events, dNBR, and LAI with the average correlation coefficients of -0.26, -0.50, 0.17, and -0.72, respectively. Using four study sites located in different parts of the Zagros area, we showed disturbances influence albedo differently. Drought condition resulted in a marginal increasing trend in albedo, whereas fire events resulted in a decreasing trend. This article is the first report linking climate change with albedo in Iran.

TI  - Canopy damage by spring frost in European beech along the Apennines: effect of latitude, altitude and aspect
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Late spring frost plays a major role in the structure and function of forest ecosystems with potential consequences on species distribution at both local and regional scales. Paradoxically, in a warmer world the incidence and impact of frost is increasing because of earlier leaf unfolding and flowering as a response to warmer temperatures. In this regard, European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), a native tree species widely distributed in European forests, is considered particularly sensitive to changes in spring temperature regimes associated with climate change and thus especially subject to the risk of frost damage. Although several studies concerning F. sylvatica frost damage have been conducted in northern and central Europe, no extensive studies are available for the southern part of its range, i.e. central and southern Italy as well as Greece.In this paper the effect of a late spring frost occurring at the end of April 2016 is extensively documented with high spatial detail all along the Apennine Chain through satellite image data. Three different remote-sensing greenness indexes, namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the greenness index (GI) derived from Landsat-8 satellite images acquired from May to July in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 at a spatial resolution of 30 m, were used to gauge the spatial response of common beech forests to this late frost event with relation to latitude, altitude and slope exposure. Frost damage was evaluated as a difference (Delta) of NDVI, GI and EVI between the mean of years 2014 and 2015 (i.e. MRY, mean of reference years), and 2016 (i.e. FEY, frost reference year). The three satellite remote-sensing indexes were efficient at detecting leaf damage with detailed spatial resolution and proved consistent with one another.The greatest damage occurred in the middle altitudinal range between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. with a decreasing trend toward both lower and higher elevations due to warmer temperatures below, and delayed phenology above. Exposure also influenced frost injury, with south-facing slopes of the mountain more damaged than the north. This difference was due to earlier spring leaf phenology of southern beech trees in response to a greater heat sum in the warm weeks preceding. Less damage in the northern Apennines is consistent with the spatial extent of minimum freezing temperatures. To sum up, frost damage is strongly related to site-specific conditions, i.e. on the one hand to minimum temperatures, and on the other to the phonological stage of the trees involving both altitude and exposure. Hence focusing on detailed sub-regional studies can be helpful for predicting future consequences of climate change on forests.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the main land uses and determine the level of landscape anthropization in oil palm expansion areas (Uba, Arauai and Mamorana), in the years 2013 and 2017, in eastern Para. We used Landsat 8 satellite images from 2013 and 2017. The land uses were classified using the decision tree method. Anthropic pressure was analyzed using the Anthropic Transformation Index (ITA), which was considered regular and degraded, in the areas. The area with the highest pressure was Arauai and Ubi is the area with the lowest pressure. Deforestation of the primary forest and the expansion of agriculture and palm oil, were the main pressures and we confirm the need for control and preservation of forest remnants in the analyzed territory.

AB  - Acknowledging the importance of evapotranspiration as a mediating factor for efficient irrigation management and water balance, the objective of study is to compare the Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER) to the standard method proposed by FAO-56 for real evapotranspiration, as well as prove its value as an implement in irrigation management for the Brazilian Savanna. Data used refers to 2015's harvest of seven center pivots, located in the municipality of Sao Desiderio in western Bahia. For the SAFER algorithm, the images used were acquired by the Landsat-8 satellite during the entire maize crop cycle. The SAFER algorithm estimation demonstrates the spatial and temporal distribution of the evapotranspiration. A maximum evapotranspiration of 5.38 mm d(-1) was observed during the crop's reproductive stage. In relation to the standard method, SAFER showed a mean absolute error of 0.40 mm Thus, concluding that the algorithm can be used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration crop as an alternative to the standard method proposed by FAO-56 for water resources management.

TI  - Multitemporal SAR RGB Processing for Sentinel-1 GRD Products: Methodology and Applications
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 mission has finally reached its maturity with the launch of the second Sentinel radar. Among the products delivered by the agency, the ground range detected class is raising more and more interest among users due to its reduced computational demand for information extraction and availability on cloud exploitation platforms, like the Google Earth Engine. In this paper, we present a novel multitemporal processing chain, suitable to be applied to Sentinel-1 ground range detected products to obtain RGB images, using a series of single polarization detected images. These products aim at being the equivalent for the recently introduced Level-1 alpha, exploiting a texture measure instead of the interferometric coherence, to properly render and enhance the presence of built-up areas. The discussion is supported by experiments showing the reliability of this newly introduced class of products in classic synthetic aperture radar applications like image photointerpretation, flood mapping, and long-term urban area monitoring.

TI  - Rodents and satellites: Predicting mice abundance and distribution with Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data is widely used in numerous ecological applications. The Sentinel-2 satellites (S2 A and B), recently launched by the European Spatial Agency's (ESA), provide at present the best revisit time, spatial and spectral resolution among the freely available remote sensing optical data. In this study, we explored the potential of S2 enhanced spectral and spatial resolution to explain and predict mice abundances and distribution in border habitats of agroecosystems. We compared the predictive ability of different vegetation and water indices derived from S2 and Landsat 8 (L8) imagery. Our analyses revealed that the best predictor of mice abundance was L8-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). S2-based indices, however, outperformed those computed from L8 bands for indices estimated simultaneously to mice trappings and for mice distribution models. Furthermore, indices including S2 red-edge bands were the best predictors of the distribution of the two most common rodent species in the ensemble. The findings of this study can be used as guidelines when selecting the sensors and vegetation variables to be included in more complex models aimed at predicting the distribution and risk of various vector-borne diseases, and especially rodents in other agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Meta-analysis of completion lymph node dissection in sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The role of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma continues to be debated. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated survival and recurrence rate in these patients who underwent CLND, compared with observation.Methods: A comprehensive MEDLINE and Embase database search was performed for cohort studies and RCTs published between January 2000 and June 2017 that assessed the outcomes of CLND compared with observation in patients with SLN-positive melanoma. The primary outcome was survival and the secondary outcome was recurrence rate. Studies were assessed for quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Pooled relative risk or hazard ratio with 95 per cent confidence intervals were calculated for each outcome. The extent of heterogeneity between studies was assessed with the I2 test. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017070152).Results: Fifteen studies (13 cohort studies with 7868 patients and 2 RCTs with 2228 patients) were identified for qualitative synthesis. Thirteen studies remained for quantitative meta-analysis. Survival was similar in patients who underwent CLND and those who were observed (risk ratio (RR) for death 0.85, 95 per cent c. i. 0.71 to 1.02). The recurrence rate was also similar (RR 0.91, 0.79 to 1.05).Conclusion: Patients with SLN-positive melanoma do not have a significant benefit in survival or recurrence rate if they undergo CLND rather than observation.

TI  - Relationship between Soil Burn Severity in Forest Fires Measured In Situ and through Spectral Indices of Remote Detection
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires in Galicia have become a serious environmental problem over the years. This is especially the case in the Pontevedra region, where in October 2017 large fires (>500 hectares) burned more than 15,000 Ha. In addition to the area burned being of relevance, it is also very important to know quickly and accurately the different severity degrees that soil has suffered in order to carry out an optimal restoration campaign. In this sense, the use of remote sensing with the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites becomes a very useful resource due to the variations that appear in soil after a forest fire (changes in soil cover are noticeably appreciated with spectral information). To calculate these variations, the spectral indices NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) are used, both before and after the fire and their differences (dNBR and dNDVI, respectively). In addition, as a reference for a correct discrimination between severity degrees, severity data measured in situ after the fire are used to classified at 5 levels of severity and 6 levels of severity. Therefore, this study aims to establish a methodology, which relates remote-sensing data (spectral indices) and severity degrees measured in situ. The R-2 statistic and the pixel classification accuracy results show the existing synergy of the Sentinel-2 dNBR index with the 5 severity degrees classification (R-2 = 0.74 and 81% of global accuracy) and, for this case, the good applicability of remote sensing in the forest fire field.

TI  - Liberal Justice: Teleology and Worldview
T2  - APUNTES UNIVERSITARIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The philosophical and economic doctrine of the "Invisible Hand" was formulated by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723-1790), who is considered one of the greatest exponents of classical economics, as well as the father of political economy. His capital work is The Wealth of Nations. The main thesis of his work is that the key to social welfare lies in economic growth and this is enhanced by an adequate division of labor and competition between free, equal and relatively selfish human beings. Here we analyze how it emerged during Modernity, and even deepening in the last scholastic tracing in Ockham its remote origins, the liberal doctrine of rights and security, in definite accounts, the idea of justice and the worldview that sustains it. In the interregnum of both ages, it is not possible to avoid the convincing fact of the transformation of natural law into positive law and its impact on politics, sociology and economics. This school completes and applies mainly to contemporary economics and social theory with the theoretical outcome on the liberal theory of justice developed by John Rawls, especially between the years 1971-1995. We will dedicate ourselves to these connections and their criticism in what follows.

TI  - ERISNet: deep neural network for <i>Sargassum</i> detection along the coastline of the Mexican Caribbean
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, Caribbean coasts have experienced atypical massive arrivals of pelagic Sargassum with negative consequences both ecologically and economically. Based on deep learning techniques, this study proposes a novel algorithm for floating and accumulated pelagic Sargassum detection along the coastline of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Using convolutional and recurrent neural networks architectures, a deep neural network (named ERISNet) was designed specifically to detect these macroalgae along the coastline through remote sensing support. A new dataset which includes pixel values with and without Sargassum was built to train and test ERISNet. Aqua-MODIS imagery was used to build the dataset. After the learning process, the designed algorithm achieves a 90% of probability in its classification skills. ERISNet provides a novel insight to detect accurately algal blooms arrivals.

TI  - Preliminary assessment of spatial and short-term variability of bio-optical properties in a tidal dominated estuary (Bahia Blanca, Argentina)
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine environments are very complex systems whose productivity is defined by multiple biological and physicochemical interactions. Thus, monitoring the biophysical properties of estuarine waters becomes fundamental to our understanding of their ecosystem functions. Remote sensing retrieval of biochemical and biological variables appears as a complementary tool, providing information at a high spatial and temporal resolution and thus allowing us to study processes that cannot be comprehended based only on in situ data. However, the quality of remotely sensed data strongly depends on ground-truthing, using discrete in situ measurements. The aim of this study was to describe temporal (short term) and spatial (across short distances) variations of optically active water components in the Bahia Blanca Estuary (BBE, Argentina), and to characterize their relationship with bio-optical properties. Concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), as well as the absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (a(cdom) (443)), considered as a proxy for the concentration of colored dissolved organic matter, were tightly coupled to tidal forcing, causing significant short-term variations. Along the estuary, a steep gradient of these variables was observed with higher concentrations through the head of the channel. Considering bio-optical properties, absorption by non-algal particles (a(nap) (443)) dominate the absorption budget of these optically complex waters, followed by absorption by phytoplankton (a(ph) (443). a(ph) (443) was closely related to variations in Chl-a, and a(nap) (443) showed increased values under the influence of sewage discharge. Considering in situ measurements of water reflectance, a high short-term variability was observed in response to tidal forcing, as well as large differences across relatively short distances. For the first time in the BBE, bio-optical properties of seawater were quantified, and their variations described at different scales. These results revealed a highly variable environment from the optical perspective and have large implications for the validation of remote sensing products. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analysis of land use/land cover changes using geospatial techniques in Salem district, Tamil Nadu, South India
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon, but the rate of urban growth is relatively faster in developing countries like India. The drastic urban growth in India has resulted in a huge loss of agricultural land and water bodies, which needs to be quantified for future planning and development. In this context, the present study depicts a combined approach of remote sensing and GIS techniques for delineating the land use/land cover dynamics of Salem district of Tamil Nadu in South India. The Landsat Thematic Mapper data of the years 1992, 2001 and 2010 and Operational Land Imager data of the year 2015 were used to assess the changes in the land use and land cover. The supervised classification technique-maximum likelihood algorithm, was used in this study to classify the remote sensing data. The results indicate that the deciduous forests, croplands, cultivation and plantation lands and water bodies have decreased from 1992 to 2015 by about 398 km(2). 250 km(2). 45 km(2) and 16 km(2). respectively. At the same time, evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, builtup lands and mines and barren lands have increased by about 288 km(2). 293 km(2) and 128 km(2), respectively.The accuracy of the present study has been assessed by using error matrix method. The overall accuracy of the land use/land cover classification of the years 1992, 2001, 2010 and 2015 is about 88%, 95%, 93% and 93%, respectively. The study showed that the combination of remote sensing and GIS is an efficient tool to detect the changes in land use/land cover. The land use/land cover information thus obtained can be used to the decision-makers for effective land use planning and management.

TI  - Unbiased assessment of disease surveillance utilities: A prospect theory application
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives We contribute a new methodological approach to the ongoing efforts towards evaluating public health surveillance. Specifically, we apply a descriptive framework, grounded in prospect theory (PT), for the evaluation of decisions on disease surveillance deployment. We focus on two attributes of any surveillance system: timeliness, and false positive rate (FPR).Methods In a sample of 69 health professionals from a number of health related networks polled online, we elicited PT preferences, specifically respondents' attitudes towards gains, losses and probabilities (i.e., if they overweight or underweight extreme probabilities) by means of a series of lotteries for either timeliness or FPR. Moreover, we estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements in the two surveillance attributes. For contextualization, we apply our framework to rabies surveillance.Results Our data reveal considerable probability weighting, both for gains and losses. In other words, respondents underestimate their chances of getting a good outcome in uncertain situations, and they overestimate their chances of bad outcomes. Moreover, there is convex utility for losses and loss aversion, that is, losses loom larger than gains of the same absolute magnitude to the respondents. We find no differences between the estimated parameters for timeliness and FPR. The median WTP is $7,250 per day gained in detection time and $30 per 1/10,000 reduction in FPR.Conclusion Our results indicate that the biases described by PT are present among public health professionals, which highlights the need to incorporate a PT framework when eliciting their preferences for surveillance systems.Author summary In this paper we contribute a new methodological approach to the ongoing efforts towards evaluating public health surveillance.

TI  - Geomagnetic jerks and rapid hydromagnetic waves focusing at Earth's core surface
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomagnetic jerks are abrupt changes in the second time derivative-the secular acceleration-of Earth's magnetic field that punctuate ground observatory records. As their dynamical origin has not yet been established, they represent a major obstacle to the prediction of geomagnetic field behaviour for years to decades ahead. Recent jerks have been linked to short-lived, temporally alternating and equatorially localized pulses of secular acceleration observed in satellite data, associated with rapidly alternating flows at Earth's core surface. Here we show that these signatures can be reproduced in numerical simulations of the geodynamo that realistically account for the interaction between slow core convection and rapid hydromagnetic waves. In these simulations, jerks are caused by the arrival of localized Alfven wave packets radiated from sudden buoyancy releases inside the core. As they reach the core surface, the waves focus their energy towards the equatorial plane and along lines of strong magnetic flux, creating sharp interannual changes in core flow and producing geomagnetic jerks through the induced variations in magnetic field acceleration. The ability to numerically reproduce jerks offers a new way to probe the physical properties of Earth's deep interior.

TI  - Geomorphological effects of the 1840 Ahora Gorge catastrophe on Mount Ararat (Eastern Turkey)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ahora Gorge is a 400 m deep canyon located along the North Eastern flank of Mt. Ararat (Turkey), a compound volcanic complex covered by an ice cap. In the past, several diarists and scientific authors reported a calamitous event on July 2, 1840, when a landslide triggered by a volcanic eruption and/or an earthquake obliterated several villages located at the foot of the volcano. The reasons and effects of this Ahora Gorge Catastrophe (AGC) event have been obscure and ambiguous. To reappraise the 1840 catastrophe and the geomorphic evolution of the Ahora Gorge, we used high-resolution satellite images, remote sensing thermal data supplemented by observations collected during two field surveys. According to our interpretation, an earthquake in 1840 triggered an abrupt volcanic eruption, which caused the consequent rapid melting of glacial ice and mountain snow. This event produced significant mud and ice flow along the Ahora Gorge that inundated the villages downslope. The flooding, which we interpret as a lahar, deposited a wide alluvial fan at the foot of the volcano. Today, an elongated landform present within the Ahora Gorge has alternately been interpreted as a landslide deposit. Our multi-data integrated analysis and ground-based observations demonstrate that this feature is an unmapped glacier. The shape of the landform coupled with ASTER thermal satellite data and ground-based observations reveal that a debris-covered glacier (DCG) formed soon after the catastrophic lahar. Our discovery of the Ahora Gorge Glacier in context of a reappraisal of the Ahora Gorge Catastrophe demonstrates the contribution of glaciers in shaping the landscape near ice-capped volcanoes. Moreover, our data underscore the importance of being more aware of the potential future geo-hazards posed by Mount Ararat, particularly where glaciers are still present along several valleys and seismically-induced lahar events might occur.

TI  - Improving Jujube Fruit Tree Yield Estimation at the Field Scale by Assimilating a Single Landsat Remotely-Sensed LAI into the WOFOST Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies were focused on yield estimation of perennial fruit tree crops by integrating remotely-sensed information into crop models. This study presented an attempt to assimilate a single leaf area index (LAI) near to maximum vegetative development stages derived from Landsat satellite data into a calibrated WOFOST model to predict yields for jujube fruit trees at the field scale. Field experiments were conducted in three growth seasons to calibrate input parameters for WOFOST model, with a validated phenology error of -2, -3, and -3 days for emergence, flowering, and maturity, as well as an R-2 of 0.986 and RMSE of 0.624 t ha(-1) for total aboveground biomass (TAGP), R-2 of 0.95 and RMSE of 0.19 m(2) m(-2) for LAI, respectively. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed better performance for LAI estimation than a Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), with a better agreement (R-2 = 0.79) and prediction accuracy (RMSE = 0.17 m(2) m(-2)). The assimilation after forcing LAI improved the yield prediction accuracy compared with unassimilated simulation and remotely sensed NDVI regression method, showing a R-2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 0.74 t ha(-1) for 2016, and R-2 of 0.59 and RMSE of 0.87 t ha(-1) for 2017. This research would provide a strategy to employ remotely sensed state variables and a crop growth model to improve field-scale yield estimates for fruit tree crops.

TI  - Perioperative morbidity of radical trachelectomy with lymphadenectomy in early-stage cervical cancer: a French prospective multicentric cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the predictive factors of postoperative morbidity of patients who have undergone a radical trachelectomy (RT) for early-stage cervical cancer and to assess the oncologic outcomes.Methods: We retrospectively analysed the data of 2 prospective trials on sentinel node biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I and II). Patients having a RT for early-stage cervical cancer with negative sentinel lymph node and safe margins, were included.Results: Forty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty-five patients had a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal technique and 4 patients a total laparoscopic technique. The median age was 32 years (range, 22-46 years). 83.7% of patients had a stage IB1 disease. There were 63.3% squamous cell carcinomas and 34.7% adenocarcinomas. The median follow-up was 46 months (range, 1-85 months). Two patients (3.3%) had a severe postoperative complication (Clavien-Dindo >= III and/or CTCAE >= 3). The main postoperative complications were urinary (28.6%), lymphovascular (26.5%) and neurologic (14.3%). On a multivariate analysis, postoperative complications were significantly associated with history of pelvic surgery and IB1 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage. Inclusion in high surgical skills centers decrease the risk of postoperative complications. During the follow-up, 3 patients (6.1%) had a local recurrence and one patient died from a breast cancer. Between group with complications and group without any complications, overall survival and recurrence-free survival did not significantly differ at 5-year of follow-up.Conclusion: RT has few severe postoperative complications and appears as a safe alternative to spare fertility of young patients. To guarantee best surgical outcomes, patients should be referred to expert center.

This study evaluated the precipitation products CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM-3B42, and ERA-Interim temperature on the basin of the Catamayo River, located in southern Ecuador. CMORPH overestimates in average 50 % of the precipitation observed, while PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM-3B42 underestimate in average 20 and 10 %. Thus, the bias of the precipitation products was corrected with rain gauges. The CEQUEAU model was calibrated with the observed and estimated data (original and corrected) at 0.25 degrees/-27 km of spatial resolution with the objective of modelling the daily discharges of the Catamayo River at Vicin station. The efficiency of the modelling was quantified with the following mathematical criteria: Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), BIAS percentage (PBIAS) and coefficient of determination (r(2)). The results according to the NSE criterion, in the periods of calibration and validation, were 0.80 and 0.75 with the observed data, and with the satellite data (original): TRMM-3B42, 0.84 and 0.79, PERSIANN-CDR, 0.80 and 0.65, and CMORPH, 0.59 and 0.39. Correction of the bias of the estimated rainfall was positive when modelling with the CMORPH product and quite low with PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM-3B42. This study reveals the advantage of using satellite products to simulate the discharges in ungauged basins, in addition to using these data in their original spatial scale on the distributed hydrological models.

TI  - Prevention, education and counselling: the worldwide role of the community pharmacist as an epidemiological sentinel of headaches
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Multidisciplinary Seminar (Stresa Headache)
CL  - Stresa, ITALY
AB  - Headache disorders are the third among the worldwide causes of disability, measured in years of life lost to disability. Given the pharmacies' importance in general in headache patient and, in particular in migraine patient management, various studies have been carried out in recent years dealing with this issue. Indeed, in 2014, our research group first analysed publications on a number of studies conducted worldwide. As five years have passed since our first analysis of the literature and having carried out a number of specific studies in Italy since 2014, we wish to analyse once again the studies carried out globally on this topic to evaluate how the situation has evolved in the meantime. The key words used for the bibliographic search were community pharmacy and headache; we considered articles published between 2014 and 2018. The selected studies regarded Sweden USA, Belgium, Ireland, Jordan and Ethiopia. From the analysis of the international research papers, it is evident that, despite the time that has passed since the previous analyses and the general agreement that pharmacists find themselves in an ideal position to offer adequate levels of counselling to headache patients, the knowledge of pharmacists is not yet sufficient. Clearly, there is a strong need to develop training programmes specifically focused on this subject. Regarding Italy, a national study, commenced in 2016, was designed as a cross-sectional survey employing face-to-face interviews between pharmacist and patient using a questionnaire drawn up by experts in compliance with best practice from scientific literature. Six hundred ten pharmacists followed a specific training course; 4425 questionnaires were correctly completed. The use of pharmacies as epidemiological sentinels, given their capillarity and daily contact with the local population in Italy, enabled us to obtain an epidemiological snapshot closer to the real-life situation compared to specialist headache centres. Over the course of this study, data on headaches were gathered in Italian pharmacies with the highest levels of numerosity in the world.

TI  - Factors associated with neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in infants with an umbilical artery pH less than 7.00
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Our objective was to identify factors associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) among newborns with an umbilical pH < 7.00.Study design: Case-control study during a four-year study period in a single academic tertiary-center, including all neonates >= 35 weeks with an umbilical pH < 7.00. Cases were neonates with HIE, regardless of Sarnat classification, and controls were neonates without signs of HIE. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to compare the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal characteristics of cases and controls.Results: Among 21,211 births, 179 neonates >= 35 weeks (0.84%) had an umbilical pH < 7.00. One hundred and forty-seven(82.1%) newborns had severe asphyxia without HIE, 32(17.9%) had HIE and 21(11.7%) needed therapeutic hypothermia. Neonates with HIE were significantly more likely to have 5-minute Apgar score<7(75% versus 15.7% P < 0.01), together with a lower mean umbilical arterial pH (6.84 versus 6.95, P < 0.01) and lower mean base deficits (-17.0 versus -12.7, P < 0.01). Factors significantly associated with HIE were the mother being overweight(28.1% for cases versus 14.3% for controls, adjusted OR=4.6 [1.4-15.2]) or obese(25.0% versus 13.6%, aOR=15.5[1.1-12.5]), smoking(18.7% versus 5.4%, aOR=5.8[1.6-21.2]), a sentinel event as cord prolaps or placenta abruption (34.4% versus 13.6%, aOR=2.7[1.1-7.2]), and decreased fetal heart rate variability(68.7% versus 44.2%, aOR=2.8[1.1-6.9]).Conclusion: Among neonates with an umbilical cord pH < 7.00, those with HIE had a more severe metabolic acidosis. Maternal factors associated with HIE among newborns with an umbilical pH < 7.00, were being overweight or obese, and smoking, and the associated obstetric factors were a sentinel event and decreased fetal heart rate variability.

T2  - SPACE POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean Basin Observation COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) is one of the most advanced and powerful assets in the Earth observation field in which Italy plays a key role at world level. CSK has been designed for dual-use purposes to fulfill both civilian and defense needs, providing useful scientific and commercial applications and strategic monitoring. Since 2008, thanks to its features, the Italian Constellation is able to provide a strong contribution in several application domains such as Geo-hazard Risk Management (seismic events, volcano eruptions, landslides monitoring, and so forth), Ocean and Marine Applications, Land Cover and Vegetation, Polar Research, Cultural Heritage Monitoring, Water Resources and Hydrology. The focus of this article is to analyze the CSK data exploitation to monitor the trend over the last 4 years (2014-2017). Specifically, statistics have been provided based on different acquisition modes, application domains, and the geographic area of interest. The article also highlights the role of the CSK system in the context of international cooperation, focusing on the ongoing partnerships and agreements signed by the Italian Space Agency to facilitate CSK data exploitation.

TI  - Assessment of Surface Water Quality by Using Satellite Images Fusion Based on PCA Method in the Lake Gala, Turkey
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water quality with classical methods is not an easy task. Remote sensing with wide coverage and multiple temporal monitoring is the best solution for surface water quality monitoring. This paper demonstrates the determination of surface water quality parameters by using principal component analysis (PCA) data fusion and mining techniques with the aid of Landsat 8 OLI (L8 OLI), Sentinel 2A (S2A), and Gokturk-2 (GK2) satellite sensors. Chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, Secchi disk depth, total dissolved substance, and pH were the parameters selected for surface water quality analysis. High spectral resolution of L8 OLI/S2A images and the high spatial resolution of GK2 images were fused and analyzed by a suite of data mining models to provide more reliable images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Surface water quality parameters calculated by PCA-based response surface regression (RSR) method were compared with results obtained from multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machines (SVMs) data mining methods. The performance of the data mining models derived using only multispectral band data and PCA fused data were quantified using four statistical indices; such as mean-square error (MSE), root MSE, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination (R-2). The analysis confirmed that the PCA-based RSR method is superior to MLR, ANN, and SVM data mining models to accurately estimate water quality parameters in lakes.

TI  - S2k guidelines for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) - update 2018
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC, ICD-O M8247 /3) is a rare malignant primary skin tumor with epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation. The neoplastic cells share many morphological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics with Merkel cells of the skin. The diagnosis of MCC is rarely made on clinical grounds. Histological and immunohistochemical studies are usually required to confirm the clinical suspicion. Given the frequent occurrence of occult lymph node metastasis, sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed once distant metastasis has been ruled out by cross-sectional imaging. Primary tumors without evidence of organ metastases are treated with complete surgical excision with appropriate surgical margins. Radiation therapy should be considered at all stages of the disease. For advanced MCC that is no longer amenable to curative treatment by surgery or radiation therapy, there is currently no established systemic therapy for which an improvement in recurrence-free survival or overall survival has been demonstrated in a prospective randomized trial. However, immunotherapy using PD-1/PD-L1 blockade seems to be superior to chemotherapy. Various factors warrant that further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions be determined by an interdisciplinary tumor board. These factors include the tumor's aggressiveness, the frequent indication for sentinel lymph node biopsy along with the frequent occurrence in the head and neck region, the potential indication for adjuvant radiation therapy as well as the complexity of the required diagnostic workup.

TI  - A Partial Amelanotic Mucosal Melanoma of the Vulva
T2  - AKTUELLE DERMATOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mucosal vulvo-vaginal melanoma are rare and often identified and treated at late stages due to their hidden localization, frequently partiell amelanotic expression and absent risk factors. We report the case of a patient of 70 years of age who presented with a sore feeling of the vulva with two pigmented lesions at the labium majus dextrum. A partiell amelanotic mucosal melanoma was identified by histopathological analysis. Resection with dissection of the sentinel lymph node revealed a maximum 1.1mm tumor depth. The indicated additional resection required an anterior vulvectomy. The excised specimen presented with remnants of the in-situ component of the melanoma without affected sentinel lymph node (SLNB 0/1) at then pathological negative margins. The final tumor staging according to AJCC (2017) was IB. At uneventful postoperative course the patient is been taken care of by interdisciplinary dermatological-gynecological supervision.

M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo establish the surgical, demographic and histopathological factors associated with inaccurate sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identification using indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging in uterine and cervical neoplasms during both open and laparoscopic surgery.MethodsWe reviewed patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), clinical stage I and II cervical cancer or uterine malignancies who underwent primary surgery with SLN mapping between September 2015 and January 2018. An analysis of patients' demographics, tumor factors and surgical approach was conducted. Bilateral and overall detection rates were calculated and univariate analysis was performed to estimate factors associated with failed SLN mapping.ResultsA total of 32 patients with uterine and cervical neoplasms were included in the study. The overall detection rate of the SLN was 84% and bilateral detection rate was 75%. There were no statistically relevant differences in overall and bilateral SLN detection rates by BMI, surgical approach or age. Regarding endometrial cancer, there were no differences in SLN detection rates when comparing tumor grade, histology nor myometrial invasion. For SLN detection failure, only the presence of metastatic lymph nodes and lack of surgical experience significantly increased the disability to detect SLNs (p=0.03, p=0.04, respectively).ConclusionsSLN mapping technique using NIR fluorescence imaging with ICG appears to be accurate method in most of the patients with cervical or endometrial carcinoma, regardless of demographic characteristics, tumor-related features and surgical approach. Surgeons' expertise in that field allows obtaining excellent detection rates.

TI  - Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound With Perflubutane for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Cutaneous Melanoma: A Pilot Study
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To study the feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for identification of SLN associated with cutaneous melanoma. Study Design Single arm pilot study in a swine animal model. Methods One milliliter of perflubutane (Sonazoid, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) was injected into the peritumoral dermis in five swine with cutaneous melanoma. Ultrasonography was used to follow enhancing lymphatic channels to lymph nodes (LN). Intradermal injection of vital blue (VB) dye was used as a positive control. LN identified by either method were excised and examined histologically. Results There were five primary cutaneous melanomas with mean area of 4.36 +/- 4.75 cm(2) and Breslow depth of 3.6 +/- 1.5 mm. Six possible sentinel lymph node (SLN)s were identified with CEUS, and nine were identified with VB. SLN averaged 12.44 +/- 6.15 cm from the primary tumor. Four of six (67%) SLNs identified by CEUS and four of nine (44%) candidate SLNs identified by VB contained histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma. All six CEUS-identified SLNs were also identified with VB. Two LNs not containing melanoma were identified by CEUS; three were identified with VB. In all SLN with metastases, metastatic cells were scattered throughout the LN and not clustered in a discrete mass. Conclusion CEUS with perflubutane feasibly identifies SLN associated with cutaneous melanoma and may be a useful adjunct technology in facilitating precise SLN dissection. Our work supports a clinical trial investigating the use of CEUS for this application. Level of Evidence NA Laryngoscope, 129:1117-1122, 2019

Constraints imposed by rapid population growth in developing countries for achievement of Sustainable Development Goals are discussed and evidence is presented on "unwanted" fertility from India. Second, comparisons are made for India during 2002-2016 for average well depths in 495 districts and terrestrial water storage anomalies assessed via GRACE satellites for 2741 degrees x 1 degrees grids using estimated parameters from dynamic random effects models. Lastly, migration patterns especially of the highly educated from 39 sending countries to OECD countries during 2000-2010 are analyzed using dynamic random effects models and total fertility rates were significantly associated with higher migration rates for the highly educated. Implications of the empirical evidence for enhancing global sustainability are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and timing of sentinel lymph node biopsy in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer with clinically negative axilla
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to determine the optimal time to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with clinically node-negative (cN(0)) disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).MethodFrom April 2008 to April 2018, 592 patients with breast cancer underwent after NAC were included in this study. Patients with cN(0) before and ycN(0) disease after NAC received SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in case of positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). For patients with clinically node-positive (cN(+)) disease, the axillary surgery is based on the doctor's decision.ResultIn general, 17.6% (104/592) of patients achieved total pathologic complete response (pCR), which was 6.9%, 33.3%, 32.3% and 15.3%, respectively, among patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive/ human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) negative (HR+/HER2-) subtype, triple-negative (TN) subtype, HER-2 positive (HER2+) subtype with and without targeted therapy (p<0.001). Among the 525 cN(+) patients, the axillary nodal pCR (apCR) rate was 34.5%, and the apCR rate was significantly higher in patients with HER2+ (58.6% with and 28.2% without targeted therapy respectively) and TN subtype (53.2%) than that in patients with HR+/HER2-subtype (21.2%, p<0.001). Among the 67 cN(0) patients, the positive rate of SLNs was 19.4% (13/67), which was 28.1% (9/32), 13.3% (2/15) and 10.0% (2/20), respectively, among patients with HR+/HER2-, TN and HER2+subtypes.ConclusionThe pCR rates were significantly related to molecular subtype. Combining the apCR rates in different molecular subtypes of cN(+) patients and the excellent locoregional control of AOSOG Z0011 and AMAROS trials in cN(0) patients, it would be preferable to perform SLNB prior to NAC for cN(0) patients with HR+/HER2-subtype, and SLNB after NAC for those cN(0) patients with TN and HER2+subtype to increase the chance of avoiding ALND. Among cN(0) patients, TN and HER2+subtypes would benefit more from axillary de-escalating surgery after NAC than HR+/HER2- subtype.

TI  - Quality Assessment and Glaciological Applications of Digital Elevation Models Derived from Space-Borne and Aerial Images over Two Tidewater Glaciers of Southern Spitsbergen
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assess the accuracy and precision of digital elevation models (DEM) retrieved from aerial photographs taken in 2011 and from Very High Resolution satellite images (WorldView-2 and Pleiades) from the period 2012-2017. Additionally, the accuracy of the freely available Strip product of ArcticDEM was verified. We use the DEMs to characterize geometry changes over Hansbreen and Hornbreen, two tidewater glaciers in southern Spitsbergen, Svalbard. The satellite-based DEMs from WorldView-2 and Pleiades stereo pairs were processed using the Rational Function Model (RFM) without and with one ground control point. The elevation quality of the DEMs over glacierized areas was validated with in situ data: static differential GPS survey of mass balance stakes and GPS kinematic data acquired during ground penetrating radar survey. Results demonstrate the usefulness of the analyzed sources of DEMs for estimation of the total geodetic mass balance of the Svalbard glaciers. DEM accuracy is sufficient to investigate glacier surface elevation changes above 1 m. Strips from the ArcticDEM are generally precise, but some of them showed gross errors and need to be handled with caution. The surface of Hansbreen and Hornbreen has been lowering in recent years. The average annual elevation changes for Hansbreen were more negative in the period 2015-2017 (-2.4 m a(-1)) than in the period 2011-2015 (-1.7 m a(-1)). The average annual elevation changes over the studied area of Hornbreen for the period 2012-2017 amounted to -1.6 m a(-1). The geodetic mass balance for Hansbreen was more negative than the climatic mass balance estimated using the mass budget method, probably due to underestimation of the ice discharge. From 2011 to 2017, Hansbreen lost on average over 1% of its volume each year. Such a high rate of relative loss illustrates how fast these glaciers are responding to climate change.

TI  - Care of general practice patients preceding and following a suicide attempt: observational study in Flemish general practices
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives First, to examine general practitioner (GP) knowledge about the care (needs) of their patients; second, to examine the quality of GP follow-up care; third, to examine the transmission of patient care information from hospitals/emergency services (ES) to GPs.Setting 105 general practices from the representative Belgian Network of Sentinel General Practices (SGP) in Flanders, the largest region of Belgium, during 2013-2016.Participants 245 suicide attempts by regular patients.Outcomes measures Ten care-related measures, including three indicators of quality of follow-up care, were based on data reported by the SGP on structured forms at baseline and at two follow-up points in time.Results As for GP knowledge, 10.5% of SGP failed to report whether suicidal risk was noticed in patients seen in the month preceding the attempt; 9.0% whether there were previous attempts; 22.5% whether the patient was receiving mental health treatment at follow-up and 22.0% whether suicidal behaviour was repeated at follow-up. Relatively more patients >= 65 years had no suicide risk evaluation (OR 3.54; 95% CI 1.11 to 11.26). As for quality of follow-up care, there was a GP-patient contact following 90.5% of the attempts, follow-up appointments were planned following 43.4% of the attempts and there was a GP contact with patient proxies following 62.8% of the attempts. Patient age >= 65 years (OR 4.09; 95% CI 1.79 to 9.33), a recent GP-patient contact preceding the attempt (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.13 to 3.43), depression of patient (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.37) and a suburban SGP area (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.13 to 4.82) were determinants of an increased quality of care sum. GPs received patient care information from a hospital (ES) for 67.8% of eligible attempts, with SGP practice location being a determinant.Conclusions GPs are highly involved in the care of suicide attempters but there is room for improvement, also in informational continuity from hospital (ES) to GPs.

TI  - Axillary ultrasound-guided core biopsy in breast cancer: identifying higher nodal burden and more aggressive clinicopathological characteristics
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases may not require axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) but it remains unclear if patients with a positive ultrasound-guided axillary core biopsy (ACB) would satisfy such criteria.Aims The aim of this study was to assess if breast cancer patients with a positive pre-operative ACB have more aggressive tumour characteristics/higher axillary nodal burden compared to those with a positive SLN.Methods Data was extracted from a prospectively maintained breast cancer database between 2012 and 2015. Patients who underwent ALND after either positive ACB or SLN were included and tumour characteristics/nodal burden were compared.Results One hundred eighty patients underwent ALND, 125/180 after positive ACB and 55/180 after positive SLNB. Patients with positive ACB were more likely to undergo mastectomy (chi-square test; p = 0.03) and have higher tumour grades (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.01) compared to the SLNB group. Median positive nodes excised during ALND were 2 (1-22) and 1 (1-11) for ACB and SLNB groups respectively (p < 0.001). Fifty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). Of 72/125 patients in the ACB group not receiving NCT, the median number of positive nodes was 4 (range, 1-22). Ten patients within the ACB group satisfied ACOSOG Z011 criteria.Conclusion Breast cancer patients with a positive ACB are more likely to have aggressive tumour characteristics and higher nodal burden compared to those identified as having axillary nodal disease on SLNB, which may affect surgical decision making.

AB  - Designing indigenous rural tourist accommodations in Toribio-Cauca (Colombia) becomes relevant in the framework of the post-agreement due to the alternatives for touristic development in territories that experienced the armed conflict. Three types of alternatives are proposed for a gradual intervention in traditional indigenous settlements, starting from the adaptation of a room, until the construction of an independent module, with the purpose of developing tourist services. These designs arise from consultation with the tourist planning groups in Toribio to preserve the worldview and culture of this territory.

TI  - Integrated Markov chains and uncertainty analysis techniques to more accurately forecast floods using satellite signals
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing the readily available, inexpensive, remotely-sensed satellite data products in combination with Markov Chain methods for estimating water levels and discharge anywhere along the vast river networks around the world is one of the most interesting and promising fields in hydrology. This study presents two new extensions of Markov Chain (MC) methods, namely the Online-Markov Chains (O-MC) and Extreme Online-Markov Chains (EO-MC) methods to improve the prediction accuracy. The O-MC method has the advantage of the online implementation of the correct variable states, and the EO-MC method has the advantage of online updating the Markov Matrix (MM) along with the online implementation of the correct variable states. The new O-MC and the EO-MC methods were evaluated using short-term satellites signal predictions for six different case study rivers. The Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was used to measure the reliability of the new MC-based methods. Each model was developed 1000 times to calculate two indices, namely the 95 Percent Predicted Uncertainties (95PPU) and average distance factor (d-factor). The performances of MC and two extensions of O-MC and EO-MC were also examined for cases where we lack the training data. The Training Percent (TrPr) of the entire dataset gradually decreased from 90% to 1%, and the performance of the models in producing accurate future signals in the non-observed dataset is calculated. The Input Variable Imitation (IVI) problem was considered for the MC-based methods, and the results were compared with the Linear Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression methods. The results showed that the performance of EO-MC and O-MC are better than the simple MC method. In addition, it is concluded that EOMC and O-MC have very similar performance in the uncertainty analysis and both methods are robust techniques. The main advantage of EO-MC compared with the O-MC method is highlighted when the number of training samples are very low. Finally, considering the IVI problem, the new O-MC and EO-MC methods significantly outperformed the LR, MLP, ELM, and RBF methods.

TI  - Measurement of Aerosols Optical Thickness of the Atmosphere using the GLOBE Handheld Sun Photometer
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we describe the measurement of aerosol optical thickness using the GLOBE handheld sun photometer. Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) was measured at Xavier University of Louisiana (XULA, 29.96 degrees N, 90.11 degrees W and 3 m above sea level). The measurements were done at two different wavelengths, 505 nm and 625 nm. AOT measurements were done 6 times a day (7 AM, 9 AM, 11 AM, solar noon, 3 PM and 5 PM). The data shown in this paper are the monthly average AOT values taken at solar noon. During each measurement time; at least five values of the sunlight voltage V and the dark voltage Vdark are taken for each channel. The mean for these five measurements is taken as the average for that measurement time. Other meteorological data such as temperature, surface pressure, rainfall and relative humidity are also measured at the same time. The whole protocol is completed within a time span of 10-15 min. The measured AOT values at 505 nm and 625 nm are then used to extrapolate the AOT values for wavelengths 667 nm, 551 nm, 532 nm and 490 nm. The measured and extrapolated AOT values were then compared with values from the nearest AERONET station at Wave CIS site 6 (AERONET, 28.87 degrees N, 90.48 degrees W and 33 m above sea level), which is about 96 km south of XULA. In this study we tracked the annual and daily variations of AOT for a 12 month period from September 2017 to August 2018. We also compared AOT data from two independently calibrated GLOBE handheld sun photometers at the XULA site. The data show that the two instruments are in excellent agreement.

TI  - Climate-specific and global validation of MODIS Aqua and Terra aerosol optical depth at 452 AERONET stations
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a highly influential variable in solar resource assessment and clear-sky radiation modelling. Hence, the accuracy of solar energy estimates ultimately depends on the accuracy of the measured or assumed AOD. Gridded satellite information is often used for solar modelling due to its geographical coverage, and so a global validation of commonly utilised AOD products is imperative. Here, all Level-3 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily observations of AOD (at 470, 550 and 660 nm, noted AOD470, AOD550 and A0D660, respectively) from the Aqua and Terra satellites (of 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution) from 2000 to 02/2018 are compared and validated against all of NASA's ground sensing Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) V3 Level 2 AOD daily averages from sites that reported at least one year of observations during 2000-2018 (452 sites representing at least 653,000 observations per variable). Furthermore, sub-categorisation by Koppen-Geiger climate regions enables a novel climate-specific validation to ascertain any distinct climatic influence. The results demonstrate significant climatological influences that impact the derived AOD product at all three wavelengths. It is found that blending the two Aqua and Terra products results in a higher accuracy of daily estimates of all AOD products. Each AOD product is validated similarly and separately. AOD550, which is most commonly used in solar resource assessment, is found worst in the equatorial climate (absolute root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.194) and best in the temperate climate (RMSE of 0.126). Globally, the combined Aqua + Terra AOD550 experiences an absolute RMSE of 0.106 and a mean absolute error of 0.109. The most common MODIS AOD retrievals are between 0.01 and 0.25, suggesting that the MODIS daily AOD products may introduce a significant source of uncertainty in modelled irradiance estimates, and that other sources of input data should be used instead whenever their applications demand high accuracy.

AB  - Chest radiographs (CXRs) and laboratory testing have historically been performed as a part of low-risk melanoma (clinical stage 1/2) workup. This study evaluates the utility of routine CXRs and laboratory testing during the staging of clinical stage 1 and 2 melanoma patients. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Wake Forest University. A database of sentinel lymph node biopsies performed for clinical stage 1 or 2 melanoma was used to identify early-stage melanoma patients. The medical records of patients with melanoma were reviewed and pre-operative workup procedures were recorded. Four hundred sixty-three patients were reviewed. A total of 315 patients underwent a preoperative CXR, whereas 309 received some laboratory testing. After sentinel node biopsies, 168 patients had pathologic stage 1 disease, 103 stage 2, and 44 stage 3. None of the CXRs (0%) correctly identified metastatic melanoma. Suspicious locations on CXRs and laboratory testing did not lead to metastatic findings in any patient within a year. Metastatic melanoma was not found in any patient by screening with CXRs or laboratory testing during preoperative workup. We recommend not conducting CXRs or laboratory testing during workup for surgical melanoma patients because of charges and anxiety these tests can cause. CXRs, blood tests, and metabolic panels have historically been ordered for early melanoma patients, although debate remains on their efficacy. Surgical patient records were retrospectively reviewed for these tests and no benefit was found.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of wetland ecosystem carbon sinks is an estimation of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, prediction of climate change and its impact on wetland ecosystems. In this study, using remote sensing data and 351 wetland sample sites in 2015, a remote sensing multiple linear regression model (RS-MLRM) was constructed to clarify the carbon storage capacity and its changing process from 2000 to 2015 and their controlling factors in arid regions wetlands. The results are as follows: (1) The studied wetlands acted as atmospheric carbon sinks from 2000 to 2015, increasing by 3.88 x 10(4) tC/a. Moreover, the soil carbon sink (0-40 cm) was approximately twice that of the vegetation carbon sink. (2) Carbon sinks had a clear spatial distribution, with high concentrations in Helan and Pingluo Counties in the central Ningxia Plain. From 2005 to 2015, constructed wetlands significantly increased the carbon sink (P < 0.05) and were the main contributors to carbon sequestration, indicating that positive human intervention enhances the carbon sink effect of wetlands. (3) Human activities, policy factors, soil physical and chemical properties and nutrients were the main factors affecting carbon sink in Ningxia Plain Wetland in arid regions. (4) The results provides a scientific basis for the protection and management of wetland ecosystems in arid areas.

TI  - The Power of Language in the Classical Period of Kalam
T2  - NAZARIYAT-JOURNAL FOR THE HISTORY OF ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - When examining classical-era Warn books, we may be at first surprised by the great importance given to language in their theological discussions and the recognition of linguists (ahl al-lugha) as authorities. Whenever Muslim theologians (mutakallimun) deal with any issue, they first determine how the linguists would have made sense of the relevant terms and then explain it in a way that is appropriate for use in Arabic. This sensitivity to language is not only limited to defining the Islamic terms such as "belief" (iman), "unbelief" (kufr), "disobedience" (ma'siya), and "justice" (adl), but also includes defining the terms of physics and cosmology. In other words, when conceptualizing terms such as "universe" (a-alam), "body" (jism), "substance (jawhar), "accident" ('arad), "motion" (haraka), and "rest" (sukun), these theologians mostly take into account how the speakers of language commonly use them. This article seeks to answer the question of why they regard language as an important discipline, alongside cosmological issues, in the context of the language-thought-existence relationship. Perhaps by making a thought system based on Arabic, which happened to emerge in their regions as a result of long-time interactions with the natural environment and consequently became conveyers of a particular worldview and way of thinking, they sought to resist the impact of the Greek worldview and logic that poured into the Islamic world from all lands via translations. In other words, the primary reason why the theologians considered language as the authority in theological and cosmological discussions was because they saw it, along with its structure and concepts, as a carrier of their traditional worldviews and way of thinking.

TI  - Assessing responses of <i>Betula papyrifera</i> to climate variability in a remnant population along the Niobrara River Valley in Nebraska, USA, through dendroecological and remote-sensing techniques
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remnant populations of Betula papyrifera Marshall have persisted in the Great Plains after the Wisconsin Glaciation along the Niobrara River Valley, Nebraska. Population health has declined in recent years, which has been hypothesized to be due to climate change. We used dendrochronological techniques to assess the response of B. papyrifera to microclimate (1950-2014) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery (Landsat 5 TM(1985-2011) and MODIS (2000-2014)) as a proxy for population health. Growing-season streamflow and precipitation were positively correlated with raw and standardized tree-ring widths and basal area increment increase. Increasing winter and spring temperatures were unfavorable for tree growth, while increasing summer temperatures were favorable in the absence of drought. The strongest predictor for standardized tree rings was the Palmer Drought Severity Index, suggesting that B. papyrifera is highly responsive to a combination of temperature and water availability. The NDVI from the vegetation community was positively correlated with standardized tree-ring growth, indicating the potential of these techniques to be used as a proxy for ex situ monitoring of B. papyrifera. These results aid in forecasting the dynamics of the species in the face of climate variability and change in both remnant populations and across its current distribution in northern latitudes of North America.

T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between differences in microwave humidity sounder (MHS)-channel biases which represent measured brightness temperatures and model-simulated brightness temperatures, and cloud ice water path (IWP) as well as the influence of the cloud liquid water path (LWP) on the relationship is examined. Seven years (2011-17) of NOAA-18 MHS-derived measured brightness temperatures and IWP/LWP data generated by the NOAA Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System Microwave Surface and Precipitation Products System are used. The Community Radiative Transfer Model, version 2.2.4, is used to simulate model-simulated brightness temperatures using European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis data as background fields. Scan-angle deviations of the MHS window channel biases range from -1.7 K to 1.0 K. The relationships between channels 2, 4, and 5 biases and scan angle are symmetrical about the nadir. The latitude-dependent deviations of MHS window channel biases are positive and range from 0-7 K. For MHS non-window channels, the latitudinal deviations between measured brightness temperatures and model-simulated brightness temperatures are larger when the detection height is higher. No systematic warm or cold deviations are found in the global spatial distribution of difference between measured brightness temperatures and model-simulated brightness temperatures over oceans after removing scan-angle and latitudinal deviations. The corrected biases of five different MHS channels decrease differently with respect to the increase in IWP. This decrease is stronger when LWP values are higher.

AB  - With the continuous development of urbanization, urban population, economy and other factors have a close impact on the geometry and distribution of urban buildings. Obtaining information of urban buildings from aerial images or satellite images quickly and accurately is not only conducive to updating geospatial data, but also of great significance for effective monitoring of new thematic information such as new buildings. Moreover, in recent years, the research and improvement of building recognition and contour extraction algorithms based on satellite images or aerial images are helpful to the recognition and classification of urban buildings. It is of great significance to the acquisition of GIS data, the understanding of images, large-scale mapping and many other applications of remote sensing data. With the development of artificial intelligence and computer technology, the image processing of intelligent building environment based on pattern recognition technology has become an important research direction in the field of intelligent building image recognition. Based on the concept, principle and technology analysis of pattern recognition technology, this paper studies the application of pattern recognition technology in the image processing of intelligent building environment. In this paper, based on image processing of intelligent building as the basic theoretical platform, with the pattern recognition technology as the basic research means, three problems of image processing, image extraction and image recognition in image processing of building intelligent environment are studied respectively, and corresponding reasonable solutions are put forward.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of urban green space and its impact on the urban thermal environment based on remote sensing data: A case study of Fuzhou City, China
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the main city of Fuzhou as the study area, the relationship between the spatiotemporal evolution of urban green space (UGS) and the urban thermal environment from 1993 to 2013 was investigated using a set of remote sensing images. The evolution of UGS is obvious in the study area, where UGS loss (42.83 km(2)) > UGS extension (4.99 km(2)) > UGS exchange (2.61 km(2)). UGS loss affects forest/grass > water > wetland. Furthermore, the area defined as high temperature zones increased by 23.11 km(2) in 2013, twice as much as that in 1993. However, the influence of UGS on the urban thermal environment differs by type and evolution: water has the greatest cooling effect, followed by wetland and forest/grass, and UGS loss (8.67 degrees C) > UGS exchange (4.00 degrees C) > UGS extension (2.90 degrees C) > UGS unchanged (2.45 degrees C). Finally, the vegetation and cooling index classified the mechanism of temperature response induced by different types of UGS evolution. The evolution of UGS loss usually simulated the movement of the corresponding pixel from the low land surface temperature and high vegetation coverage to the opposite situation. Regression analyses demonstrated that the effect of elevated land surface temperature generated from the reduction of water and forest/grass reached 0.81 degrees C and 0.72 degrees C, respectively, in 20 years, indicating that the loss of a significant amount of UGS during urbanization was the primary influence on the urban thermal environment. This study may provide more useful information for researchers and decision-makers engaged in urban planning, urban regeneration, and sustainable land development, especially focusing on the issues of climate adaption and the urban heat island (UHI) effect mitigation.

TI  - A sentinel in Mitraclip intervention: Catch the enemy!
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerebral ischemic lesions occurring during transcatheter valve interventions are common feared complications and the use of filter device seems to reduce their incidence. We report the case of an 84-year old female patient with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing MitraClip. During the trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided procedure was detected the presence of a little fibrin strand adherent to the steerable guide catheter for which we decided to implant the Claret CE Pro (Claret Medical, Inc. Santa Rosa, CA, USA) cerebral protection device and to continue the procedure during which the thrombus disappeared. At the end of the procedure a big thrombus was detected in the distal filter. The histologic analysis of the debris captured by the filters showed the presence of a thrombus, compatible with the image identified by TEE.

TI  - Ground temperature model from shallow soundings and remote sensing for geothermal area of Paipa, Boyaca-Colombia
T2  - BOLETIN DE GEOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature models were generated from Shallow Temperature Surveys (SST) and Remote Sensing (SR) with Landsat 8 TIRS images for Paipa geothermal area. The temperature range at 20 cm depth fluctuates between 17.04 degrees C and 19.14 degrees C. At 150 cm depth, the temperature values range from 16.81 degrees C to 19.66 degrees C. The normalization of the temperature values in depth (20 cm and 150 cm) as a function of the surface temperature eliminates the effect of the solar radiation and allows to compare the temperatures calculated with SR both in surface and depth. Pearson correlation coefficient measure shows that there are mostly negative correlations in depth (-0.1955) and some positive surface correlations (0.3125) between SST and SR anomaly maps. In turn, an analysis of uranium (U-38) (0 ppm and 205.7 ppm). thorium (Th-32) (0.6 ppm and 94.2 ppm) and potasio (K-40) (0% and 11.8%) anomalies by gamma ray spectrometry, topography (between 2500 mats and 3200 coals) and the estimated temperature anomalies, finding highs and lows with spatial matching between the variables.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing for Salt Marsh Mapping and Change Analysis at Fire Island National Seashore
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are changing due to natural and anthropogenic stressors such as sea level rise, nutrient enrichment, herbivory, storm surge, and coastal development. This study analyzes salt marsh change at Fire Island National Seashore (FIIS), a nationally protected area, using object-based image analysis (OBIA) to classify a combination of data from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 satellites, topobathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imageries acquired from 1994 to 2017. The salt marsh classification was trained and tested with vegetation plot data. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive overwash and breached a section of the island. This study quantified the continuing effects of the breach on the surrounding salt marsh. The tidal inundation at the time of image acquisition was analyzed using a topobathymetric LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to create a bathtub model at the target tidal stage. The study revealed geospatial distribution and rates of change within the salt marsh interior and the salt marsh edge. The Worldview-2/Worldview-3 imagery classification was able to classify the salt marsh environments accurately and achieved an overall accuracy of 92.75%. Following the breach caused by Hurricane Sandy, bayside salt marsh edge was found to be eroding more rapidly (F-1,F- 1597 = 206.06, p < 0.001). However, the interior panne/pool expansion rates were not affected by the breach. The salt marsh pannes and pools were more likely to revegetate if they had a hydrological connection to a mosquito ditch (2 = 28.049, p < 0.001). The study confirmed that the NAIP data were adequate for determining rates of salt marsh change with high accuracy. The cost and revisit time of NAIP imagery creates an ideal open data source for high spatial resolution monitoring and change analysis of salt marsh environments.

TI  - GPS Precipitable Water Vapor Estimations over Costa Rica: A Comparison against Atmospheric Sounding and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of water vapor in tropical regions like Central America is necessary to estimate the influence of climate change on its distribution and the formation of precipitation. This work reports daily estimations of precipitable water vapor (PWV) using Global Positioning System (GPS) delay data over the Pacific region of Costa Rica during 2017. The GPS PWV measurements were compared against atmospheric sounding and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. When GPS PWV was calculated, relatively small biases between the mean atmospheric temperatures (T-m) from atmospheric sounding and the Bevis equation were found. The seasonal PWV fluctuations were controlled by two of the main circulation processes in Central America: the northeast trade winds and the latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). No significant statistical differences were found for MODIS Terra during the dry season with respect GPS-based calculations (p > 0.05). A multiple linear regression model constructed based on surface meteorological variables can predict the GPS-based measurements with an average relative bias of -0.02 +/- 0.19 mm/day (R-2 = 0.597). These first results are promising for incorporating GPS-based meteorological applications in Central America where the prevailing climatic conditions offer a unique scenario to study the influence of maritime moisture inputs on the seasonal water vapor distribution.

TI  - An Agricultural Drought Index for Assessing Droughts Using a Water Balance Method: A Case Study in Jilin Province, Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, which causes the economic, social, and environmental losses, also threatens food security worldwide. In this study, we developed a vegetation-soil water deficit (VSWD) method to better assess agricultural droughts. The VSWD method considers precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and soil moisture. The soil moisture from different soil layers was compared with the in situ drought indices to select the appropriate depths for calculating soil moisture during growing seasons. The VSWD method and other indices for assessing the agricultural droughts, i.e., Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI) and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), were compared with the in situ and multi-scales of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEIs). The results show that the VSWD method has better performance than SDCI, VHI, and TVDI. Based on the drought events collected from field sampling, it is found that the VSWD method can better distinguish the severities of agricultural droughts than other indices mentioned here. Moreover, the performances of VSWD, SPEIs, SDCI and VHI in the major historical drought events recorded in the study area show that VSWD has generated the most sensible results than others. However, the limitation of the VSWD method is also discussed.

TI  - Susceptibility to erosion in the Corrego Guariroba watershed, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul
T2  - ACTA BRASILIENSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water capture for domestic use for the city of Campo Grande consists of superficial springs and aquifers, of which the Guariroba reservoir is the main surface source. This study evaluated the susceptibility to erosion, and land use and cover in the Guariroba Stream watershed, in order to assist environmental management. Topographic attributes extracted from a digital elevation model obtained by photogrammetry were used to evaluate susceptibility to erosion. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), obtained from Sentinel 2B images, was used for land use and land cover analysis. The topo -graphic attributes showed the most susceptible sites for the development of erosive processes, which are found along watercourses, drainage headwaters and convergent concave slopes. Here, the surface water flows have higher energy, consequently, their erosive power is greater, increasing the susceptibility to loss of sediment and adsorbed pollutants. The remaining natural vegetation is found in small fragments along the water course. Eucalyptus plantations encroach pasture areas, forming mosaics in the landscape. The generated maps can be used by administrators for the identification of priority areas for environmental recovery.

TI  - Western Bluetongue virus serotype 3 in Sardinia, diagnosis and characterization
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 20 years, Italy has experienced multiple incursions of different serotypes of Bluetongue virus (BTV), a Culicoides-borne arbovirus, the causative agent of bluetongue (BT), a major disease of ruminants. The majority of these incursions originated from Northern Africa, likely because of wind-blown dissemination of infected midges. Here, we report the first identification of BTV-3 in Sardinia, Italy. BTV-3 circulation was evidenced in sentinel animals located in the province of Sud Sardegna on September 19, 2018. Prototype strain BTV-3 SAR2018 was isolated on cell culture. BTV-3 SAR2018 sequence and partial sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing from nucleic acids purified from the isolate and blood samples, respectively, were demonstrated to be almost identical (99-100% of nucleotide identity) to BTV-3 TUN2016 identified in Tunisia in 2016 and 2017, a scenario already observed in past incursions of other BTV serotypes originating from Northern Africa.

TI  - Surface Temperature Multiscale Monitoring by Thermal Infrared Satellite and Ground Images at Campi Flegrei Volcanic Area (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) from satellite data is a key component in many aspects of environmental research. In volcanic areas, LST is used to detect ground thermal anomalies providing a supplementary tool to monitor the activity status of a particular volcano. In this work, we describe a procedure aimed at identifying spatial thermal anomalies in thermal infrared (TIR) satellite frames which are corrected for the seasonal influence by using TIR images from ground stations. The procedure was applied to the volcanic area of Campi Flegrei (Italy) using TIR ASTER and Landsat 8 satellite imagery and TIR ground images acquired from the Thermal Infrared volcanic surveillance Network (TIRNet) (INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano). The continuous TIRNet time-series images were processed to evaluate the seasonal component which was used to correct the surface temperatures estimated by the satellite's discrete data. The results showed a good correspondence between de-seasoned time series of surface ground temperatures and satellite temperatures. The seasonal correction of satellite surface temperatures allows monitoring of the surface thermal field to be extended to all the satellite frames, covering a wide portion of Campi Flegrei volcanic area.

TI  - A Neural Network Correction to the Scalar Approximation in Radiative Transfer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The next generation of advanced high-resolution sensors in geostationary orbit will gather detailed information for studying the Earth system. There is an increasing desire to perform observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for new sensors during the development phase of the mission in order to better leverage information content from the new and existing sensors. Forward radiative transfer calculations that simulate the observing characteristics of a new instrument are the first step to an OSSE, and they are computationally intensive. The scalar approximation to the radiative transfer equation, a simplification of the vector representation, can save considerable computational cost, but produces errors in top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance as large as 10% due to neglecting polarization effects. This article presents an artificial neural network technique to correct scalar TOA radiance over both land and ocean surfaces to within 1% of vector-calculated radiance. A neural network was trained on a database of scalar-vector TOA radiance differences at a large range of solar and viewing angles for several thousand realistic atmospheric vertical profiles that were sampled from a high-resolution (7 km) global atmospheric transport model. The profiles include Rayleigh scattering and aerosol scattering and absorption. Training and validation of the neural network was demonstrated for two wavelengths in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectral range (354 and 670 nm). The significant computational savings accrued from using a scalar approximation plus neural network correction approach to simulating TOA radiance will make feasible hyperspectral forward simulations of high-resolution sensors on geostationary satellites, such as Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO), GOES-R, Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), and Sentinel-4.

TI  - Cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery based on deep convolutional neural networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper formulates cloud and cloud shadow detection as a semantic segmentation problem and proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to detect them in Landsat imagery. Different from traditional machine learning methods, deep CNN-based methods convolve the entire input image to extract multi-level spatial and spectral features, and then deconvolve these features to produce the detailed segmentation. In this way, multi-level features from the whole image and all the bands are utilized to label each pixel as cloud, thin cloud, cloud shadow or clear. An adaption of SegNet with 13 convolutional layers and 13 deconvolution layers is proposed in this study. The method is applied to 38 Landsat 7 images and 32 Landsat 8 images which are globally distributed and have pixel-wise cloud and cloud shadow reference masks provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). In order to process such large images using the adapted SegNet model on a desktop computer, the Landsat Collection 1 scenes are split into non-overlapping 512 * 512 30 m pixel image blocks. 60% of these blocks are used to train the model using the backpropagation algorithm, 10% of the blocks are used to validate the model and tune its parameters, and the remaining 30% of the blocks are used for performance evaluation. Compared with the cloud and cloud shadow masks produced by CFMask, which are provided with the Landsat Collection 1 data, the overall accuracies are significantly improved from 89.88% and 84.58% to 95.26% and 95.47% for the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images respectively. The proposed method benefits from the multi-level spatial and spectral features, and results in more than a 40% increase in user's accuracy and in more than a 20% increase in producer's accuracy for cloud shadow detection in Landsat 8 imagery. The issues for operational implementation are discussed.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial and cervical cancer: a survey of practices and attitudes in gynecologic oncologists
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine patterns among gynecologic oncologists in sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) for endometrial cancer (EC) and cervical cancer (CC).Methods: A online survey assessing the practice of SLNM, including incidence, patterns of usage, and reasons for non-use was distributed to Society of Gynecologic Oncology candidate and full members in August 2017. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis was performed.Results: The 1,117 members were surveyed and 198 responses (17.7%) were received. Of the 70% (n=139) performing SLNM, the majority reported use for both CC and EC (64.0%) or EC alone (33.1%). In those using SLNM in EC, the majority (86.6%) performed SLNM in >50% of cases for all patients (56.3%), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade 1 (43.0%) and 2 (42.2%). Reported benefits of SLNM in EC were reduced surgical morbidity (89.6%), lymphedema (85.2%), and operative time (63.7%). Among those using SLNM for CC, the majority (73.1%) did so in >50% of cases. In EC, 77.2% and 21.3% reported that micro-metastatic disease (0.2-2.0 cm) and isolated tumor cells (ITCs) should be treated as node positive, respectively. In those not using SLNM for EC (n=64) and CC (n=105), concerns were regarding efficacy of SLNM and lack of training. When queried regarding training, 73.7% felt that SLNM would impact skill in full lymphadenectomy (LND).Conclusion: The SLNM is utilized frequently among gynecologic oncologists for EC and CC staging. Common reasons for non-uptake include uncertainty of current data, lack of training and technology. Concerns exist regarding impact of SLNM in fellowship training of LND.

TI  - Development of Supraglacial Ponds in the Everest Region, Nepal, between 1989 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several supraglacial ponds are developing and increasing in size and number in the Himalayan region. They are the precursors of large glacial lakes and may become potential for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Recently, GLOF events originating from supraglacial ponds were recorded; however, the spatial, temporal, and seasonal distributions of these ponds are not well documented. We chose 23 debris-covered glaciers in the Everest region, Nepal, to study the development of supraglacial ponds. We used historical Landsat images (30-m resolution) from 1989 to 2017, and Sentinel-2 (10-m resolution) images from 2016 to 2018 to understand the long-term development and seasonal variations of these ponds. We also used fine-resolution (0.5-2 m) WorldView and GeoEye imageries to reveal the high-resolution inventory of these features and these images were also used as references for accuracy assessments. We observed a continuous increase in the area and number of ponds from 1989-2017, with minor fluctuations. Similarly, seasonal variations were observed at the highest ponded area in the pre- and postmonsoon seasons, and lowest ponded area in the winter season. Substantial variations of the ponds were also observed among glaciers corresponding to their size, slope, width, moraine height, and elevation. The persistency and densities of the ponds with sizes >0.005 km(2) were found near the glacier terminuses. Furthermore, spillway lakes on the Ngozompa, Bhote Koshi, Khumbu, and Lumsamba glaciers were expanding at a faster rate, indicating a trajectory towards large lake development. Our analysis also found that Sentinel-2 (10-m resolution) has good potential to study the seasonal changes of supraglacial ponds, while fine-resolution (<2 m) imagery is able to map the supraglacial ponds with high accuracy and can help in understanding the surrounding morphology of the glacier.

TI  - Application of 3PG carbon production model in the gross primary productivity estimation of broadleaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - With the flux data of ChinaFLUX and the concurrent satellite remote sensing data in Changbai Mountain, we recombined parameters of four models, i.e. , vegetation photosynthesis model ( VPM) , eddy covariance-light utility efficiency model ( EC-LUE ) , terrestrial ecosystem model ( TEM) and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model ( CASA ) within 3PG model. The most suitable parameters of 3PG model were determined by comparing the root mean square error, coefficient of determination and average error between measured and observed flux values. To improve its accuracy in estimating gross primary productivity ( GPP) of broadleaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain, the fitness of the optimal model was validated using the observed flux data. The results showed that when temperature, enhanced vegetation index , and surface water index were used to characterize the temperature limiting factor, photosynthetic active radiation absorption ratio and water limiting factor in the original model to estimate GPP of broadleaved Korean pine forest, the simulation results were the best. The precision of the optimized model (R-2 = 0.948, RMSE = 0.035 mol . m(-2) . month(-1)) was better than that of the original model ( R-2 = 0. 854 , RMSE = 0. 177 mol . m(-2) . month(-1)) , which could effectively improve the phenomenon of obvious overestimation of the original model in the growing season. Results from the parameter sensitivity analysis showed that the uncertainty of GPP estimation was dominated by temperature, followed by enhanced vegetation index , photosynthetically active radiation and land surface water index , as well as their interactions.

TI  - A dual band algorithm for shallow water depth retrieval from high spatial resolution imagery with no ground truth
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For shallow water depth retrieval from high spatial resolution satellite images, although numerous empirical models have been developed, it remains impossible to estimate shallow water depths without collection of required ground truth depth. To address this limitation, a new physically based dual band algorithm is developed to estimate shallow water depths using blue and green bands from high spatial resolution multispectral image with no ground truth. The dual band log-linear model is first analytically formulated, which then is used for shallow water depths retrieval by solving all unknown model parameters based on different types of sampling pixels directly extracted from the multispectral image. The adjacent pixel pairs from the intersecting edges of different bottom types across various depths over shallow water area, are employed to calculate the optimal band rotation coefficient unit vector by minimization method. On the basis, the bottom parameter is estimated through the pixels from the coastline. Additionally, the pixels from various depths of same bottom type are also employed to achieve the blue to green band ratio of diffused attenuation coefficient. The sum of the diffuse attenuation coefficients of green band for upwelling and downwelling light is estimated by QAA and Kd algorithms. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the GeoEye-1 image covered Jinqing Island and the Chinese Gaofen-2 image across Kaneohe Bay are chosen to achieve shallow water depth by using the proposed algorithm after geo-rectification and atmospheric correction. The validations using the actual water depths show the overall root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the derived water depths are 1.18 m for Jinqing Island and 1.34 m for Kaneohe Bay respectively. Compared to the Lyzenga empirical model, the developed approach can generally achieve slightly better results for shallow water depths with no ground truth data. Finally, the effects of the variation in the model parameters to water depth retrieval are discussed and analyzed.

TI  - Automatic mapping of planting year for tree crops with Landsat satellite to time series stacks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - California's Central Valley faces serious challenges of water scarcity and degraded groundwater quality due to nitrogen leaching. Orchard age is one of the key determinants for fruit and nut production and directly affects consumptive water use and fertilizer demand. However, regional and statewide spatially explicit information on orchard planting years in California is still lacking, despite some attempts to estimate tree ages using multi temporal satellite imagery in other regions. Here we developed a robust detection method to track crop cover dynamics and identify the planting year through time series of Landsat imagery within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We used the full archive of Landsat data (Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM +, and Landsat-8 OLI) from 1984 to 2017 as inputs and automated the GEE workflow for the on-fly-mapping. Preprocessing was initially performed using JavaScript to obtain high quality reflectance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for each Landsat pixel. Annual maximum NDVI was then aggregated to the orchard level based on the field boundary. Our change detection algorithm incorporated a set of decision rules, including adaptive identification of potential years with robust Z-score thresholds, elimination of false detections based on the post-planting growth curve, and estimation of planting year using the most recent minimum strategy. Our method showed a very high accuracy of estimating tree crop ages, with a R-2 of 0.96 and a mean absolute error of less than half a year, when compared with 142 records provided by almond growers. We further evaluated the accuracy of the statewide mapping of planting years for all fruit and nut trees in California, and found an overall agreement of 89.2%. This automatic cloud-based application is expected to greatly strengthen our ability to forecast yield dynamics, estimate water use and fertilizer inputs, at individual field, county and statewide basis.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-2 data for alteration extraction in coal-bed methane reservoirs
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study illustrates the potential of alteration extraction in coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs using the recently available Sentinel-2 data. This study then evaluates the capabilities for mapping the altered minerals and vegetation. In the alteration mapping process, we separately analyzed the key remote sensing signatures of altered minerals and geobotanical anomalies based on the hydrocarbon micro-seepage theory. The diagnostic spectral characteristics of irons, clays and altered vegetation were concentrated and demonstrated the distribution of hydrocarbon micro-seepage. In the bare soil region, the altered minerals, including irons and clays were extracted through band math and principal component analysis (PCA) methods. In the vegetation area mapping, the diagnostic spectral feature parameters, such as the locations and slopes of three feature edges, were calculated. In addition, the mapping accuracy was assessed based on the extraction results of Hyperion data through full spectral profile matching method and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results. The results show that: 1) compared with band math and PCA methods, the different extraction methods were suitable for different minerals; 2) the extraction results of iron and clay minerals were most accurate (78.33% and 76.67%, respectively) with XRD analysis; 3) the highest rate of change of the feature edge slope was up to 39% with a reference spectrum; and 4) the distribution of alteration information was consistent with the Hudi coal mining area in Jincheng, Shanxi province. The potential geological application of Sentinel-2 data was revealed to identify the direction of CBM exploration in a large scale, highly efficient, convenient, and inexpensive way.

TI  - Detecting and monitoring long-term landslides in urbanized areas with nighttime light data and multi-seasonal Landsat imagery across Taiwan from 1998 to 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring long-term landslide activity is of importance for risk assessment and land management. Daytime airborne drones or very high-resolution optical satellites are often used to create landslide maps. However, such imagery comes at a high cost, making long-term risk analysis cost-prohibitive. Despite the widespread use of open-access 30 m Landsat imagery, their utility for landslide detection is often limited due to low classification accuracy. One of the major challenges is to separate landslides from other anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we produce landslide maps retrospectively from 1998 to 2017 for landslide-prone and highly populated Taiwan (35,874 km(2)). To improve classification accuracy of landslides, we integrate nighttime light imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), with multi-seasonal daytime optical Landsat time-series, and digital elevation data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). We employed a non-parametric machine-learning classifier, random forest, to classify the satellite imagery. The classifier was trained with data from three years (2005, 2010, and 2015), and was validated with an independent reference sample from twelve years. Our results demonstrated that combining nighttime light data and multi-seasonal imagery significantly improved the classification (p < 0.001), compared to conventional methods based on single-season optical imagery. The results confirmed that the developed classification model enabled mapping of landslides across Taiwan over a long period with annual overall accuracy varying between 96% and 97%, user's and producer's accuracies between 73% and 86%. Spatiotemporal analysis of the landslide inventories from 1998 to 2017 revealed different temporal patterns of landslide activities, showing those areas where landslides were persistent and other areas where landslides tended to reoccur after vegetation regrowth. In sum, we provide a robust method to detect long-term landslide activities based on freely available satellite imagery, which can be applied elsewhere. Our mapping effort of landslide spatiotemporal patterns is expected to be of high importance in developing effective landslide remediation strategies.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding changes in vegetation productivity and carbon use efficiency and their responses to climate change is significant to accurately assess and predict regional carbon budget in Northeast forest area, a region being an important carbon sink and sensitive to global change. Based on MODIS monitoring data and vegetation type distribution data, I analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of ecosystem productivity ( net primary productivity (NPP), gross primary productivity (GPP)) and carbon use efficiency (NPP/GPP) of Northeast forest from 2000 to 2015. Results showed that the average NPP and GPP were 346.4 and 773 g C . m(-2) . a(-1), respectively, and the average NPP/GPP was 0.45 during 2000 and 2015. NPP and GPP of different forest types were following the order : coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests > deciduous broad-leaved forests > coniferous forests, while the difference in NPP/GPP was not significant among different forest types. NPP and GPP were high in Southeast part and low in Northwest part. From 2000 to 2015, the NPP , GPP and NPP/GPP of Northeast forest showed a fluctuating increase, suggesting the carbon sequestration capacity was gradually enhanced. However, the trends and rates of NPP , GPP and NPP/GPP showed spatial variation. NPP, GPP and NPP/GPP increased significantly in the southern part of the Daxing' anling while decreased significantly in the northern part of the Daxing' anling, and showed a weak increasing trend in the rest of Northeast forest. The increase of annual precipitation was the main factor driving the fluctuating increase of NPP, GPP and NPP/GPP in Northeast forest.

TI  - Important surgical concepts and techniques in inguinal lymph node dissection
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Penile cancer is a rare disease with significant physical and psychosocial morbidity. It has a propensity to spread to the inguinal lymph nodes where it can progress to the pelvis and beyond. Here, we present a contemporary review on the surgical management of the lymph nodes. Recent findings Appropriate management of the lymph nodes is critical, and has been shown to impact survival for these patients. Those with lower stage disease can achieve cure with inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND), whereas a multidisciplinary approach is required in those with more extensive disease. Tertiary referral center should be strongly considered. Advances in surgical techniques have allowed for improved outcomes and lower morbidity postoperatively. Modified ILND can be safely performed for those with nonpalpable nodes, whereas diagnostic sentinel node biopsy is a good alternative in centers of experience. Minimally invasive ILND has recently gained popularity with favorable results at short-term follow-up. For those with more advanced disease, the literature remains scarce with no high-level evidence as of yet. Summary Early upfront surgery appears the best way to approach men with early involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes, whereas systemic therapy is typically reserved for higher volume disease. Clinical trial enrollment continues to be a priority to garner more evidence-based recommendations for this aggressive malignancy.

TI  - Tracking ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> build-up in Delhi national capital region during the dry season over 15 years using a high-resolution (1 km) satellite aerosol dataset
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) is among the most polluted areas in the world. We tracked ambient PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) build-up in Delhi NCR during the dry season (October-June) by analysing 15 years (2001-02 to 2015-16) of high-resolution (1 km) satellite data that has been bias corrected using coincident in-situ data. Ambient PM2.5 concentrations are 1.25 times lower in the upwind regions compared to the downwind areas of Delhi NCR, with the difference being attributed to outflow from the Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT). We identify two major peak pollution episodes - the first occurs from the end of October to early November, while the second occurs toward the end of December through early January. Mean ambient PM2.5 concentrations remain > 300 mu g/m(3) (five times the Indian 24-h national standard) for several weeks around the two peak pollution episodes. The first peak is attributed to pollution transport from upwind areas affected by open biomass burning, coupled with stable atmospheric conditions, while the second is attributed to enhanced local emissions and perhaps secondary aerosol formation under favorable meteorological conditions. The implementation of the "Sub-soil Water Preservation Act" in 2009 in Punjab (a state upwind of Delhi NCI) reduced the time between paddy and wheat cultivation seasons; as a result, open biomass burning increased, resulting in a 9% increase in weekly PM2.5 concentration over Delhi NCT since 2009 during the first pollution episode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time MODIS MAIAC 1 km satellite data are used to generate pollution statistics over India. Our results demonstrate the potential of high resolution satellite data in tracking pollution build-up at an urban scale and may help in air quality management.

TI  - A Methodology for Flash Drought Identification: Application of Flash Drought Frequency across the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing use of the term "flash drought" within the scientific community, Otkin et al. provide a general definition that identifies flash droughts based on their unusually rapid rate of intensification. This study presents an objective percentile-based methodology that builds upon that work by identifying flash droughts using standardized evaporative stress ratio (SESR) values and changes in SESR over some period of time. Four criteria are specified to identify flash droughts: two that emphasize the vegetative impacts of flash drought and two that focus on the rapid rate of intensification. The methodology was applied to the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) to develop a 38-yr flash drought climatology (1979-2016) across the United States. It was found that SESR derived from NARR data compared well with the satellite-based evaporative stress index for four previously identified flash drought events. Furthermore, four additional flash drought cases were compared with the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), and SESR rapidly declined 1-2 weeks before a response was evident with the USDM. From the climatological analysis, a hot spot of flash drought occurrence was revealed over the Great Plains, the Corn Belt, and the western Great Lakes region. Relatively few flash drought events occurred over mountainous and arid regions. Flash droughts were categorized based on their rate of intensification, and it was found that the most intense flash droughts occurred over the central Great Plains, Corn Belt, and western Great Lakes region.

TI  - Evaluation of single-date and multi-seasonal spatial and spectral information of Sentinel-2 imagery to assess growing stock volume of a Mediterranean forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate growing stock volume (GSV) estimation is essential for forest inventory updating, terrestrial carbon stocks reporting, and ecosystem services assessment. This study investigates the potential of spectral and spatial features derived from single-date and multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (Sentinel-2 MSI) images, for GSV estimation in a Mediterranean region of Northeastern Greece. Original spectral bands, spectral indices, first-order statistics, Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures, and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), based on the multi-seasonal and single-date Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, were used for GSV model development using the bagging LASSO algorithm. For both single and multi-date approaches, the spectral indices models were more accurate compared to the respective ones developed with the original Sentinel-2 MSI bands. Also, models based on texture were more efficient than the spectral models. The GLCM measures derived from July image, provided the most accurate single-date estimate of GSV (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 35.21), while their multi-seasonal counterparts improved slightly the accuracy (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 32.77). Fusion of spatial and textural information resulted in marginal or no-improvement on the texture model accuracy, however the fused models yielded higher predictive results than the spectral models alone.

TI  - Utility of Spatial Point-Pattern Analysis Using Residential and Workplace Geospatial Information to Localize Potential Outbreak Sources
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the source of an outbreak facilitates its control. Spatial methods are not optimally used in outbreak investigation, due to a mix of the complexities involved (e.g., methods requiring additional parameter selection), imperfect performance, and lack of confidence in existing options. We simulated 30 mock outbreaks and compared 5 simple methods that do not require parameter selection but could select between mock cases' residential and workplace addresses to localize the source. Each category of site had a unique spatial distribution; residential and workplace address were visually and statistically clustered around the residential neighborhood and city center sites respectively, suggesting that the value of workplace addresses is tied to the location where an outbreak might originate. A modification to centrographic statistics that we propose-the center of minimum geometric distance with address selection-was able to localize the mock outbreak source to within a 500 m radius in almost all instances when using workplace in combination with residential addresses. In the sensitivity analysis, when given sufficient workplace data, the method performed well in various scenarios with only 10 cases. It was also successful when applied to past outbreaks, except for a multisite outbreak from a common food supplier.

TI  - Historical background and current developments for mapping burned area from satellite Earth observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire has a diverse range of impacts on Earth's physical and social systems. Accurate and up to date information on areas affected by fire is critical to better understand drivers of fire activity, as well as its relevance for biogeochemical cycles, climate, air quality, and to aid fire management. Mapping burned areas was traditionally done from field sketches. With the launch of the first Earth observation satellites, remote sensing quickly became a more practical alternative to detect burned areas, as they provide timely regional and global coverage of fire occurrence. This review paper explores the physical basis to detect burned area from satellite observations, describes the historical trends of using satellite sensors to monitor burned areas, summarizes the most recent approaches to map burned areas and evaluates the existing burned area products (both at global and regional scales). Finally, it identifies potential future opportunities to further improve burned area detection from Earth observation satellites.

AB  - Purpose: Develop a flexible analytic tool for the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Sentinel System to assess adherence to safe use recommendations with two capabilities: characterize adherence to patient monitoring recommendations for a drug, and characterize concomitant medication use before, during, and/or after drug therapy.Methods: We applied the tool in the Sentinel Distributed Database to assess adherence to the labeled recommendation that patients treated with dronedarone undergo electrocardiogram (ECG) testing no less often than every 3 months. Measures of length of treatment, time to first ECG, number of ECGs, and time between ECGs were assessed. We also assessed concomitant use of contraception among female users of mycophenolate per label recommendations (concomitancy 4 weeks before through 6 weeks after discontinuation of mycophenolate). Unadjusted results were stratified by age, month-year, and sex.Results: We identified 21 457 new episodes of dronedarone use of greater than or equal to 90 days (July 2009 to September 2015); 86% had greater than or equal to one ECG, and 22% met the recommendation of an ECG no less often than every 3 months. We identified 21 942 new episodes of mycophenolate use among females 12 to 55 years (January 2016 to September 2015); 16% had greater than or equal to 1 day of concomitant contraception dispensed, 12% had concomitant contraception use for greater than or equal to 50% of the 4 weeks before initiation through 6 weeks after mycophenolate; younger females had more concomitancy. These results may be underestimates as the analyses are limited to claims data.Conclusions: We developed a tool for use in databases formatted to the Sentinel Common Data Model that can assess adherence to safe use recommendations involving patient monitoring and concomitant drug use over time.

TI  - Variability in Trends and Indicators of CO<sub>2</sub> Exchange Across Arctic Wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic wetlands store nearly half of the world's soil organic carbon and are crucial to the global carbon cycle. However, most Earth system models fail to account for wetlands given heterogeneity and uncertainty surrounding the response of different wetland types to climate change. We analyzed summer (June-August) carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, meteorological conditions, and ecological conditions at four Arctic wetlands. Micrometeorological flux tower data were used to assess CO2 exchange and meteorological conditions across 7 to 9years of data. Climate data were used to assess meteorological conditions across 30years of data. Satellite data described ecological conditions. Each site acted as a CO2 sink, but strength varied, ranging from -49 to -93gC/m(2) per summer. A trend analysis was used to investigate how CO2 balance and surrounding conditions may have changed. CO2 exchange significantly changed at one site, becoming a stronger sink. Changes in meteorological conditions were variable across sites with the exception of air temperature which, when considering significant trends, unanimously increased across sites. Ecological conditions suggested increased vegetation cover regardless of statistical significance at all sites. A conditional random forest algorithm was used to evaluate drivers of CO2 exchange. Cumulative precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of net ecosystem exchange and gross primary productivity, while ecosystem respiration was primarily driven by air temperature, suggesting that projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns will influence the carbon balance of Arctic wetlands. Variability across sites emphasizes the need for long-term observations across wetland types and climatic gradients.

TI  - Machine learning regressors for solar radiation estimation from satellite data
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we evaluate the performance of several Machine Learning regression techniques in a problem of global solar radiation estimation from geostationary satellite data. Different types of neural networks, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Processes have been selected as regression techniques to be evaluated, due to their good performance in similar problems in the past. The study area is located in the surroundings of the radiometric station of Toledo, Spain. In order to train the regression techniques considered, one complete year of hourly global solar radiation data is used as the target of the experiments, and different input variables are considered: a cloud index, a clear-sky solar radiation model and several reflectivity values from Meteosat visible images. To assess the results obtained by the Machine Learning algorithms, we have selected as a reference three different physical-based methods, a model based on the Heliosat-2 method (Heliosat-2), the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the SolarGIS model (Soevaluate the performance of Machine Learning regressors when the physical models are included as input variables, in a class of post-processing of these physical approaches. The results obtained show the capacity of Machine Learning regressors to obtain reliable global solar radiation estimation by using satellite measurements.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance by veterinary practitioners: a pilot study in the pig sector
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional indicator-based livestock surveillance has been focused on case definitions, definitive diagnoses and laboratory confirmation. The use of syndromic disease surveillance would increase the population base from which animal health data are captured and facilitate earlier detection of new and re-emerging threats to animal health. Veterinary practitioners could potentially play a vital role in such activities. In a pilot study, specialist private veterinary practitioners (PVP) working in the English pig industry were asked to collect and transfer background data and disease incident reports for pig farms visited during the study period. Baseline data from 110 pig farms were received, along with 68 disease incident reports. Reports took an average of approximately 25 minutes to complete. Feedback from the PVPs indicated that they saw value in syndromic surveillance. Maintenance of anonymity in the outputs would be essential, as would timely access for the PVPs to relevant information on syndromic trends. Further guidance and standardisation would also be required. Syndromic surveillance by PVPs is possible for the pig industry. It has potential to fill current gaps in the collection of animal health data, as long as the engagement and participation of data providers can be obtained and maintained.

TI  - Exploring the potential of LANDSAT-8 for estimation of forest soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest soil carbon dioxide efflux (FCO2) is important as it contributes significantly to terrestrial ecosystem respiration and is hence a major factor in global carbon cycle. FCO2 monitoring is usually conducted by the use of soil chambers to sample various point positions, but this method is difficult to replicate at spatially large research sites. Satellite remote sensing is accustomed to monitoring environmental phenomenon at large spatial scale, however its utilisation in FCO2 monitoring is under-explored. To this end, this study explored the potential of LANDSAT-8 to estimate FCO2 with the specific aims of deriving land surface temperature (LST) from LANDSAT-8 and then develop FCO2 model on the basis of LANDSAT-8 LST to account for seasonal and inter-annual variations of FCO2. The study was conducted over an old European beech forest (Fagus sylvatica) in Czech Republic. In the end, two kinds of linear mixed effect models were built; Model-1 (inter-annual variations of FCO2) and Model-2 (seasonal variations of FCO2). The difference between Model-1 and Model-2 lies in their random factors; while Model-1 has 'year' of FCO2 measurement as a random factor, Model-2 has 'season' of FCO2 measurement as a random factor. When modelling without random factors, LANDSAT-8 LST as the fixed predictor in both models was able to account for 26% (marginal R-2 = 0.26) of FCO2 variability in Model-1 whereas it accounted for 29% in Model-2. However, the parameterisation of random effects improved the performance of both models. Model-1 was the best in that it explained 65% (conditional R-2 = 0.65) of variability in FCO2 and produced the least deviation from observed FCO2 (RMSE = 0.38 pmol/m(2)/s). This study adds to the limited number of previous similar studies with the aim of encouraging satellite remote sensing integration in FCO2 observation.

TI  - Altered lipid homeostasis in a PCB-resistant Atlantic killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>) population from New Bedford Harbor, MA, USA
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel species such as the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) living in urban waterways can be used as toxicological models to understand impacts of environmental metabolism disrupting compound (MDC) exposure on both wildlife and humans. Exposure to MDCs is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome, including impaired lipid and glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, appetite control, and basal metabolism. MDCs are ubiquitous in the environment, including in aquatic environments. New Bedford Harbor (NBH), Massachusetts is polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and, as we show for the first time, tin (Sn). PCBs and organotins are ligands for two receptor systems known to regulate lipid homeostasis, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), respectively. In the current study, we compared lipid homeostasis in laboratory-reared killifish from NBH (F2) and a reference location (Scorton Creek, Massachusetts; F1 and F2) to evaluate how adaptation to local conditions may influence responses to MDCs. Adult killifish from each population were exposed to 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126, dioxin-like), 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153, non-dioxin-like), or tributyltin (TBT, a PPAR gamma ligand) by a single intraperitoneal injection and analyzed after 3 days. AHR activation was assessed by measuring cypla mRNA expression. Lipid homeostasis was evaluated phenotypically by measuring liver triglycerides and organosomatic indices, and at the molecular level by measuring the mRNA expression of pparg and ppara and a target gene for each receptor. Acute MDC exposure did not affect phenotypic outcomes. However, overall NBH killifish had higher liver triglycerides and adiposomatic indices than SC killifish. Both season and population were significant predictors of the lipid phenotype. Acute MDC exposure altered hepatic gene expression only in male killifish from SC. PCB126 exposure induced cypla and pparg, whereas PCB153 exposure induced ppara. TBT exposure did not induce ppar-dependent pathways. Comparison of lipid homeostasis in two killifish populations extends our understanding of how MDCs act on fish and provides a basis to infer adaptive benefits of these differences in the wild.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF URBAN EXPANSION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CAMPO GRANDE, RIO DE JANEIRO, IN THE PERIOD FROM 1986 TO 2016
T2  - REVISTA FORMACAO ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The neighborhood of Campo Grande is located in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, in the Western Zone, which is recognized by its great most populous territorial extent in the city. This place has been undergoing modifications and urban sprawl over the past few decades, mainly after 1990 and 2000, when it has seen double-digit growth driven by residential condominiums and commercial buildings. Faced with this fact, this research aims at analyzing urban expansion from recognition of the historical process of land occupation and land cover for a period of thirty years. For this purpose, a bibliographic survey was carried out to help understand the initial land occupation up to its urbanization in the neighborhood, using mapping images from the Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI satellites for the years 1986 and 2016, respectively. After examination and approval of images, the maps were generated for purposes of comparison. With the results obtained, through land use and land cover mapping, it was possible to identify the changes that have occurred between 1986 and 2016, due to the increase of urbanization in some areas of the neighborhood, and vegetal suppression and regeneration.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE DETECTION ERRORS OF HEAT FOCUS ESTIMATED BY THE GOES IMAGER SENSOR
T2  - GEOSABERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative impacts on the environment caused by fires represent one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time. The demand for products with greater accuracy in fire characterization and behavior has increased significantly in recent decades. In this regard, in relation to the importance of the systematization of fire products, as well as their significant use, the limitations related to the accuracy of information need to be remedied. The main objective of this work was to analyze the accuracy of the information contained in the product WFABBA / GOES, of heat focus detection. It was found that overestimation of the outbreaks in all the years of the analyzed series suggests that this result can be based on other research regarding the relationship between the errors found and their impacts on the emission inventories of gases and aerosols from biomass burning.

TI  - Comparison of Compact and Fully Polarimetric SAR for Multitemporal Wetland Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments are effective tools for monitoring and mapping wetlands. With the availability of SAR instruments providing various polarization options, the scope of this study is to evaluate the new compact polarization for wetland multitemporal change detection using simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR data. A series of fully polarimetric (FP) SAR images were collected over a test site located in Ontario, Canada, and used to simulate RCM compact polarimetric (CP) data. The simulated data were evaluated for multitemporal change detection and the results were compared to those from FP SAR data. WorldView imagery andwater level data were used for analysis and validation of the change detection results. The study shows potential for using the CP SAR for multitemporal change detection over three major wetland classes: shallow water, marsh, and swamp. Although FP SAR was slightly more effective in multitemporal change detection compared to CP SAR, the percentage of agreement between the change detection results of FP and CP SAR was always greater than 90% for all wetland classes. The highest overall percentage of agreement (98.4%) between the results of FP and CP SAR was observed over the shallow water, while the lowest (92.5%) was observed over swamp.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of dust patterns over Mesopotamia and their impact on Khuzestan province, Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are yet quite frequent in various parts of the world, particularly ancient Mesopotamia (approximately corresponding to most parts of Iraq as well as certain surrounding regions toward its north). To add to the ongoing difficulty, monitoring dust patterns has been proven to be a rather difficult endeavor given the absence of reliable ground-based monitoring stations in the corresponding area. Additionally, western provinces of Iran, especially Khuzestan in the southwest of Iran, have been severely affected by dust storms carried by the westerly winds, blown through neighboring countries in ancient Mesopotamia. This study proceeds to employ aerosol optical depth (AOD), extracted from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Terra spacecraft, to assess spatial dust variations between 2001 and 2017 over the Khuzestan province and ancient Mesopotamia. The variations were also correlated with the temporal dust changes in the Khuzestan province. Frequency of occurrence for AOD>1 was used to identify and categorize major dust sources in the aforementioned regions. The findings were indicative of an increasing trend in the annual AODs of the Khuzestan province, which eventually led to a significant increase from 2008 toward the end of 2012, but decreased again in the following years. Correspondingly, the entire time period (2001-2017) was further divided into three sub-periods: the first time period spanning from 2001 to 2007, followed by the second from 2008 to 2012 and finally a third time period from 2013 to 2017. Dust source identification was speculative of numerous dust spots in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait and also the southern parts of Khuzestan province which have become more active in recent years. Additionally, a large active dust spot was pinpointed between the northwest Iraq and eastern Syria border which has become extremely active during the second time period, possibly due to a severe drought in the Fertile Crescent.

TI  - MODIS Derived Sea Surface Salinity, Temperature, and Chlorophyll-a Data for Potential Fish Zone Mapping: West Red Sea Coastal Areas, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a multi-linear regression model for potential fishing zone (PFZ) mapping along the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coasts of Yanbu' al Bahr and Jeddah was developed, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data derived parameters, such as sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). MODIS data was also used to validate the model. The model expanded on previous models by taking seasonal variances in PFZs into account, examining the impact of the summer, winter, monsoon, and inter-monsoon season on the selected oceanographic parameters in order to gain a deeper understanding of fish aggregation patterns. MODIS images were used to effectively extract SSS, SST, and Chl-a data for PFZ mapping. MODIS data were then used to perform multiple linear regression analysis in order to generate SSS, SST, and Chl-a estimates, with the estimates validated against in-situ data obtained from field visits completed at the time of the satellite passes. The proposed model demonstrates high potential for use in the Red Sea region, with a high level of congruence found between mapped PFZ areas and fish catch data (R-2 = 0.91). Based on the results of this research, it is suggested that the proposed PFZ model is used to support fisheries in determining high potential fishing zones, allowing large areas of the Red Sea to be utilized over a short period. The proposed PFZ model can contribute significantly to the understanding of seasonal fishing activity and support the efficient, effective, and responsible use of resources within the fishing industry.

TI  - Determination of sediment deposition of Hasanlar Dam using bathymetric and remote sensing studies
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hasanlar Dam and Hydroelectric Power Plant are located on Kucuk Melen Creek in the Western Black Sea Basin of Turkey. The dam was constructed in 1974 to provide domestic water needs of the Duzce Province, to supply irrigation water need, to control and mitigate floods and to produce hydroelectric power. This dam has been subjected to severe sedimentation since its construction in 1974. Therefore, bathymetric field survey studies were conducted to determine storage loss in the Hasanlar Dam reservoir by sedimentation. Bathymetric survey data from the reservoir site of the Hasanlar Dam were obtained in 1979, 1999 and 2014. Analysis of the bathymetric data, GIS and remotes sensing techniques showed that storage loss in reservoir active volume between 1974 and 1999 was 24% and between 1974 and 2014 storage loss was 26%. Analysis of the bathymetric maps also showed that sediment accumulation is severe near and around the dam body and the spillway whose discharge capacity was decreased by sediment accumulation. This is extremely critical because the flood of May 1998 caused the high risk of collapse of dam due to reduced capacity of the spillway. Remote sensing technique was used to determine the future deposition of sediment in the reservoir. For this purpose, 35 points in the reservoir area were determined by comparing the relative water depths and actual water depths using satellite image of the bathymetry in July 2017 and Lake Observation Station. High correlation (R-2=0.833) was calculated by using logarithmic nonlinear regression analysis between actual and relative water depths for those 35 control points. The average of absolute values of differences between the estimated and actual water depths was found as 1.06m, and RMSE was calculated as 1.25m. This analysis shows that in the future, remote sensing data can be used in the studies of determining the depth of water and the total sediment thickness. In addition, the volume of the entire reservoir can be predicted by measuring the actual water depth only at those 35 control points without making a bathymetric map of the whole dam reservoir.

TI  - Loss Of SNAP Is Associated With Food Insecurity And Poor Health In Working Families With Young Children
T2  - HEALTH AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps working families meet their nutritional needs. Families whose earned income increases in a given month may have their SNAP benefits abruptly reduced or cut off in the following month. Using sentinel sample data from 2007-15 for families with children younger than age four, we investigated how SNAP benefit reductions or cutoffs resulting from increased income were related to economic hardships (food and energy insecurity, unstable housing, forgone health and/or dental care, and health cost sacrifices) and to caregiver and child health. After we controlled for covariates, we found that the groups whose SNAP benefits were reduced or cut off had significantly increased odds of household and child food insecurity, compared to a group with consistent participation in SNAP. Reduced benefits were associated with 1.43 and 1.22 times greater odds of fair or poor caregiver and child health, respectively. Policy modifications to smooth changes in benefit levels as work incomes improve may protect working families with young children from increased food insecurity, poor health, and forgone care.

TI  - Probabilistic inference of subsurface heterogeneity and interface geometry using geophysical data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geophysical methods provide remotely sensed data that are sensitive to subsurface properties and interfaces. Knowledge about discontinuities is important throughout the Earth sciences: for example, the saltwater/freshwater interface in coastal areas drive mixing processes; the temporal development of the discontinuity between frozen and unfrozen ground is indicative of permafrost development; and the regolith-bedrock interface often plays a predominant role in both landslide and critical-zone investigations. Accurate detection of subsurface boundaries and their geometry is challenging when using common inversion routines that rely on smoothness constraints that smear out any naturally occurring interfaces. Moreover, uncertainty quantification of interface geometry based on such inversions is very difficult. In this paper, we present a probabilistic formulation and solution to the geophysical inverse problem of inferring interfaces in the presence of significant subsurface heterogeneity. We implement an empirical-Bayes-within-Gibbs formulation that separates the interface and physical property updates within a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. Both the interface and the physical properties of the two sub-domains are constrained to favour smooth spatial transitions and pre-defined property bounds. Our methodology is demonstrated on synthetic and actual surface-based electrical resistivity tomography data sets, with the aim of inferring regolith-bedrock interfaces. Even if we are unable to achieve formal convergence of the Markov chains for all model parameters, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm offers distinct advantages compared to manual-or algorithm-based interface detection using deterministic geophysical tomograms. Moreover, we obtain more reliable estimates of bedrock resistivity and its spatial variations.

TI  - A Method for Diagnosing Summer Mountain Pastures' Vulnerability to Climate Change, Developed in the French Alps
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer mountain pastures are complex coupled ecological and human systems. They provide vital forage for livestock during summer, and their traditional use is decisive for the maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and open landscapes, which benefit local populations and tourists. With climate change, the increased intensity and frequency of climatic hazards threaten the sustainable management of these systems. To foster climate adaptation in such complex systems, we developed a tool to assess their climate change-related vulnerability. The tool consists of a 3-step vulnerability analysis: first, of the inherent exposure of mountain pastures to climatic hazards based on their physical features; second, of vegetation sensitivity to climatic hazards and changes in practices; and third, of adaptive capacities that lie in the options for managing mountain pastures together with the farms using them. This work was carried out within the research and development network Sentinel Mountain Pastures, which addresses climate change adaptation issues on mountain pastures across the French Alps. We used a transdisciplinary approach that included participatory work with experts and interviews with stakeholders. We believe this diagnostic tool has high potential for practical application to support adaptation on summer mountain pastures, by allowing a shared integrative understanding of the complexity of mountain pasture systems by stakeholders. We hope this will provide new information for policymaking that enhances the resilience of summer mountain pasture systems.

TI  - The Lipoprotein NlpE Is a Cpx Sensor That Serves as a Sentinel for Protein Sorting and Folding Defects in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> Envelope
T2  - JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a complex compartment that is essential for viability. To ensure survival of the bacterial cells in fluctuating environments, several signal transduction systems, called envelope stress response systems (ESRSs), exist to monitor envelope biogenesis and homeostasis. The Cpx two-component system is an extensively studied ESRS in Escherichia coli that is active during exposure to a vast array of stresses and protects the envelope under those harmful circumstances. Overproduction of NlpE, a two-domain outer membrane lipoprotein of unclear function, has been used in numerous studies as a molecular trigger to turn on the system artificially. However, the mechanism of Cpx activation by NlpE, as well as its physiological relevance, awaited further investigation. In this paper, we provide novel insights into the role played by NlpE in the Cpx system. We found that, among all outer membrane lipoproteins in E. coli, NlpE is sufficient to induce Cpx when lipoprotein trafficking is perturbed. Under such conditions, fitness is increased by the presence of NlpE. Moreover, we show that NlpE, through its N-terminal domain, physically interacts with the Cpx sensor kinase CpxA. Our data suggest that NlpE also serves to activate the Cpx system during oxidative folding defects in the periplasm and that its C-terminal domain is involved in the sensing mechanism. Overall, our data demonstrate that NlpE acts as a sentinel for two important envelope biogenesis processes, namely, lipoprotein sorting and oxidative folding, and they further establish NlpE as a bona fide member of the Cpx two-component system.IMPORTANCE Bacteria rely on a sophisticated envelope to shield them against challenging environmental conditions and therefore need to ensure correct envelope assembly and integrity. A major signaling pathway that performs this role in Gram-negative species is the Cpx system. An outer membrane lipoprotein of unclear function, NlpE, has long been exploited as a research tool to study Cpx in E. coli, since it triggers this system when overproduced or mislocalized; however, the mechanism and physiological relevance of the NlpE-Cpx connection have awaited further investigation. We elucidate a new function for NlpE by showing that it physically interacts with the Cpx sensor CpxA and acts as a sentinel that specifically monitors two essential envelope biogenesis processes, namely, lipoprotein sorting and oxidative folding.

TI  - Scaling Up SLIC Superpixels Using a Tile-Based Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation techniques are challenging to apply to large-size remote sensing imagery. Indeed, if the data to be processed are larger than the computer's available memory, it must be split into smaller pieces. Without precaution, segmentation errors appear along the edges of these pieces. The goal of this paper is to present a tilewise processing method to overcome this issue for superpixel segmentation, applied in particular to the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm. Incidentally, tilewise methods allow for several pieces of the image to be processed simultaneously, which enables the deployment of these methods in a parallel processing environment. Estimations of the speed-up when using multiple processors are provided. Then, it is demonstrated that the result of the tilewise segmentation is equivalent to the segmentation of the complete image, with respect to a number of global unsupervised segmentation criteria. Finally, experimental results on a large-size Sentinel-2 time series validate the method's feasibility.

TI  - Flagellin-independent effects of a Toll-like receptor 5 polymorphism in the inflammatory response to Burkholderia pseudomallei
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sentinel receptors of the innate immune system. TLR4 detects bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR5 detects bacterial flagellin. A common human nonsense polymorphism, TLR5:c.1174C>T, results in a non-functional TLR5 protein. Individuals carrying this variant have decreased mortality from melioidosis, infection caused by the flagellated Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Although impaired flagellin-dependent signaling in carriers of TLR5:c.1174C>T is well established, this study tested the hypothesis that a functional effect of TLR5:c.1174C>T is flagellin-independent and involves LPS-TLR4 pathways.Methodology/Principal findings Whole blood from two independent cohorts of individuals genotyped at TLR5:c.1174C>T was stimulated with wild type or aflagellated B. pseudomallei or purified bacterial motifs followed by plasma cytokine measurements. Blood from individuals carrying the TLR5:c.1174C>T variant produced less IL-6 and IL-10 in response to an aflagellated B. pseudomallei mutant and less IL-8 in response to purified B. pseudomallei LPS than blood from individuals without the variant. TLR5 expression in THP1 cells was silenced using siRNA; these cells were stimulated with LPS before cytokine levels in cell supernatants were quantified by ELISA. In these cells following LPS stimulation, silencing of TLR5 with siRNA reduced both TNF- and IL-8 levels. These effects were not explained by differences in TLR4 mRNA expression or NF-B or IRF activation.Conclusions/Significance The effects of the common nonsense TLR5:c.1174C>T polymorphism on the host inflammatory response to B. pseudomallei may not be restricted to flagellin-driven pathways. Moreover, TLR5 may modulate TLR4-dependent cytokine production. While these results may have broader implications for the role of TLR5 in the innate immune response in melioidosis and other conditions, further studies of the mechanisms underlying these observations are required.Author summary Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important receptors of the innate immune system. TLR4 detects bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR5 detects bacterial flagellin. A common human polymorphism in TLR5 encodes a shortened protein and blunts the immune response to flagellin. Individuals carrying this variant have decreased mortality from melioidosis, infection caused by the flagellated Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. The mechanism of protection is not known. We tested the hypothesis that the observed effect of the polymorphism is independent of flagellin and involves LPS-TLR4 pathways. We found that blood from individuals carrying the polymorphism produced lower levels of cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in response to an aflagellated B. pseudomallei mutant and less IL-8 in response to purified B. pseudomallei LPS than blood from individuals without the variant. We further observed that in THP1 cells stimulated with LPS, silencing of TLR5 with siRNA reduced levels of both TNF- and IL-8. These effects were not explained by differences in TLR4 mRNA expression. We conclude that the effects of the TLR5 polymorphism on the host inflammatory response to B. pseudomallei may not be restricted to flagellin-driven pathways. These results provide insights into the role of TLR5 in the innate immune response in melioidosis and other conditions.

TI  - Wave parameters retrieval for dual-polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar using a theoretical-based algorithm under cyclonic conditions
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Theoretical-based ocean wave retrieval algorithms are applied by inverting a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity spectrum into a wave spectrum, that has been developed based on a SAR wave mapping mechanism. In our previous studies, it was shown that the wave retrieval algorithm, named the parameterized first-guess spectrum method (PFSM), works for C-band and X-band SAR at low to moderate sea states. In this work, we investigate the performance of the PFSM algorithm when it is applied for dual-polarization c-band sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR acquired in extra wide-swath (EW) and interferometric wide-swath (IW) mode under cyclonic conditions. Strong winds are retrieved from six vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization S-1 SAR images using the c-band cross-polarization coupled-parameters ocean (C-3PO) model and then wave parameters are obtained from the image at the vertical-vertical (VV) polarization channel. significant wave height (SWH) and mean wave period (MWP) are compared with simulations from the WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) model. The validation shows a 0.69 m root mean square error (RMSE) of SWH with a -0.01 m bias and a 0.62 s RMSE of MWP with a -0.17 s bias. Although the PFSM algorithm relies on a good quality SAR spectrum, this study confirms the applicability for wave retrieval from an S-1 SAR image. Moreover, it is found that the retrieved results have less accuracy on the right sector of cyclone eyes where swell directly affects strong wind-sea, while the PFSM algorithm works well on the left and rear sectors of cyclone eyes where the interaction of wind-sea and swell is relatively poor.

TI  - Validation of the Sentinel Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) for mapping cropland biophysical variables using Sentinel-2/MSI and Landsat-8/OLI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) for estimating Leaf Area index (LAI), fraction of vegetation cover (fCover) and Canopy Water Content (CWC) from Sentinel-2/MSI and Landsat-8/OLI data was validated over an agricultural region. In-situ data collected during the SMAP Validation Experiment 2016 field campaign were used as a reference. SL2P processor performance varied substantially between crop type and biophysical variable. Over all crops, SL2P underestimated in-situ LAI and CWC measurements when using either MSI (slope (bias) of 0.70 (- 0.37) for LAI and 0.42 (- 0.37 kg/m(2)) for CWC) or OLI (slope (bias) of 0.59 (-1.21) for LAI and 0.24 (- 0.23 kg/m (2)) for CWC) data. The accuracy of SL2P fCover estimates, over all crops, was higher (slope (bias) of 0.99 (1.84%) using MSI and 0.93 (- 3.75%) using OLI). The RMSE between biophysical variables estimated using SL2P from MSI (OLI) in comparison to in-situ data was 0.98 (1.63) for LAI, 11.39% (10.95%) for fCover and 0.66 kg/m(2) (0.96 kg/m (2)) for CWC. Slightly better results are generally obtained using locally calibrated vegetation indices models, when compared to SL2P estimates using the corresponding sensor data. Uncertainty metrics of vegetation biophysical variables derived from both MSI and OLI, when compared to interpolated in-situ data time series, are found comparable to results obtained for cross-validation suggesting the possibility of using interpolated in-situ data time series for validating decametric resolution remote sensing products sparsely sampled in time.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Canopy Height in Hilly Areas Using Lidar Waveform Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height (FCH) is a key parameter in the estimation of forest biomass and productivity. However, areas with hilly or mountainous terrain present a genuine challenge to extract the vertical structural parameters by using the large footprint Li-dar full waveform data. In this study, a mathematical method based on the inflection point of Lidar waveform is developed and applied to process geoscience laser altimeter system data. Furthermore, an improved model, the centroid-terrain index model (CTIM), is proposed to estimate FCH of different forest types in hilly areas. The accuracy of the CTIM model is evaluated by using different field measurement data collected from multiple forest districts in China. For conifer and broadleaf forests, the RMSE is 3.8 m in areas with slope angles larger than 5 degrees. Compared to the ground-based Lidar data, the accuracy is satisfactory in hilly areas. The proposed approach makes a significant contribution toward improving the FCH estimation in hilly areas from large footprint full waveform data, and toward the forest ecosystem monitoring at the global scale.

TI  - Drivers for the development of an Animal Health Surveillance Ontology (AHSO)
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive reviews of syndromic surveillance in animal health have highlighted the hindrances to integration and interoperability among systems when data emerge from different sources. Discussions with syndromic surveillance experts in the fields of animal and public health, as well as computer scientists from the field of information management, have led to the conclusion that a major component of any solution will involve the adoption of ontologies. Here we describe the advantages of such an approach, and the steps taken to set up the Animal Health Surveillance Ontological (AHSO) framework. The AHSO framework is modelled in OWL, the W3C standard Semantic Web language for representing rich and complex knowledge. We illustrate how the framework can incorporate knowledge directly from domain experts or from data-driven sources, as well as by integrating existing mature ontological components from related disciplines. The development and extent of AHSO will be community driven and the final products in the framework will be open-access.

T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic yeast capable of a unique and intriguing form of cell-to-cell transfer between macrophage cells. The mechanism for cell-to-cell transfer is not understood. In this study, we imaged mouse macrophages with CellTracker Green 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate-labeled cytosol to ascertain whether cytosol was shared between donor and acceptor macrophages. Analysis of several transfer events detected no transfer of cytosol from donor-to-acceptor mouse macrophages. However, blocking Fc and complement receptors resulted in a major diminution of cell-to-cell transfer events. The timing of cell-to-cell transfer (11.17 min) closely approximated the sum of phagocytosis (4.18 min) and exocytosis (6.71 min) times. We propose that macrophage cell-to-cell transfer represents a nonlytic exocytosis event, followed by phagocytosis into a macrophage that is in close proximity, and name this process Dragotcytosis ("Dragot" is a Greek surname meaning "sentinel"), as it represents sharing of a microbe between two sentinel cells of the innate immune system.

M3  - Article
AB  - In classifier (or regression) fusion, the aim is to combine the outputs of several algorithms to boost overall performance. Standard supervised fusion algorithms often require accurate and precise training labels. However, accurate labels may be difficult to obtain in many remote sensing applications. This paper proposes novel classification and regression fusion models that can be trained given ambiguously and imprecisely labeled training data in which the training labels are associated with sets of data points (i.e., "bags") instead of individual data points (i.e., "instances") following a multiple-instance learning framework. Experiments were conducted based on the proposed algorithms on both synthetic data and applications such as target detection and crop yield prediction given remote sensing data. The proposed algorithms show effective classification and regression performance.

TI  - Validation of Collection 6 MODIS land surface temperature product using in situ measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important physical quantity at the land-atmosphere interface. Since 2016 the Collection 6 (C6) MODIS LST product is publicly available, which includes three refinements over bare soil surfaces compared to the Collection 5 (C5) MODIS LST product. To encourage the use of the C6 MODIS LST product in a wide range of applications, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product. In this study, we validated the C6 MODIS LST product using temperature-based method over various land cover types, including grasslands, croplands, cropland/natural vegetation mosaic, open shrublands, woody savannas, and barren/sparsely vegetated. In situ measurements were collected from various sites under different atmospheric and surface conditions, including seven SURFRAD sites (BND, TBL, DRA, FPK, GCM, PSU, and SXF) in the United States, three KIT sites (EVO, KAL, and GBB) in Portugal and Namibia, and three HiWATER sites (GBZ, HZZ, and HMZ) in China. The spatial representativeness of the in situ measurements at each site was separately evaluated during daytime and nighttime using all available clear-sky ASTER LST products at 90 m spatial resolution. Only six sites during daytime are selected as sufficiently homogeneous sites despite the usually high spatial thermal heterogeneity, whereas during nighttime most sites can be considered to be thermally homogeneous and have similar LST and air temperature. The C6 MODIS LST product was validated using in situ measurements from the selected homogeneous sites during daytime and nighttime: except for the GBB site, large RMSE values ( > 2 K) were obtained during daytime. However, if only satellite LST with a high spatial thermal homogeneity on the MODIS pixel scale are used for LST validation, the best daytime accuracy (RMSE < 1.3 K) for the C6 MODIS LST product is achieved over the BND and DRA sites. Except for the DRA site, the RMSE values during nighttime are < 2 K at the selected homogeneous sites. Furthermore, the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product was compared with that of the C5 MODIS LST product during nighttime at the selected homogeneous sites. Except for the GBB site, there are only small differences ( < 0.4 K) between the RMSE values for the C5 and C6 MODIS LST products.

AB  - The present study describes glacial-geomorphological landforms in and around Thangu area, North Sikkim, India, and also provides significant insights about the evolution of pro- and paraglacial landscapes. Paraglacial processes are the governing mechanism of landscape evolution in deglaciating valleys and are now studied to understand the deglacial and postglacial landscape dynamics. We here present and describe detailed glacial geomorphology of Lashar and Chopta valleys as the area is strongly modified by the erosional and depositional imprints of late Pleistocene glaciations (MIS 2). Using geomorphological and stratigraphical methods, field surveys, SRTM DEM, Landsat ETM+and Google Earth Pro data, we have mapped glacial and glaciofluvial landforms and established moraine stratigraphy in the study area. Based on the morphostratigraphical mapping of the moraines supported by limited optical chronology, four events of glaciations have been identified in the in the Lashar, Chopta and Kalip valleys and date back to last glacial maximum and advocate for a widespread ice cover with large outlet tributary glaciers. The disposition of the lateral and terminal moraines has been used to estimate the area of paleoglacial extent and their corresponding ice volume during different stages. The presence of proglacial lakes, sensitive indicators of climate change, suggests that the glaciers in the region are melting and radically responding to global warming and are potentially vulnerable for generating glacial lake outburst floods.

TI  - Integrated hydrogeological modelling of hard-rock semi-arid terrain: supporting sustainable agricultural groundwater use in Hout catchment, Limpopo Province, South Africa
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated hydrogeological modelling approach applicable to hard-rock aquifers in semi-arid data-scarce Africa was developed using remote sensing, rainfall-runoff modelling, and a three-dimensional (3D) dynamic model. The integrated modelling approach was applied to the Hout catchment, Limpopo Province, South Africa, an important agricultural region where groundwater abstraction for irrigation doubled during 1968-1986. Since the 1960s, groundwater levels in irrigated areas have displayed extended periods of decline with partial or full recovery in response to major decadal rainfall events or periods. The integrated dynamic 3D hydrogeological flow model, based on the One-Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MODFLOW-OWHM), helped to understand recharge and flow processes and inform water use and management. Irrigation abstraction was estimated based on irrigated crop area delineated using the Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and crop water requirements. Using groundwater level data, the model was calibrated (2008-2012) and validated (2013-2015). Estimated mean diffuse recharge (3.32.5% of annual rainfall) compared well with estimates from the Precipitation Runoff Modelling System model. Recharge and groundwater storage showed significant inter-annual variability. The ephemeral river was found to be losing, with mean net flux to the aquifer (focused recharge) of similar to 1.1% of annual rainfall. The results indicate a delicate human-natural system reliant on the small but highly variable recharge, propagating through variable pumping to an even more variable storage, making the combined system vulnerable to climate and anthropogenic changes. The integrated modelling is fundamental for understanding spatio-temporal variability in key parameters required for managing the groundwater resource sustainably.

TI  - Pulse-to-Pulse Correlation Effects in High PRF Low-Resolution Mode Altimeters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we revisit the pulse-to-pulse correlation properties of nadir-looking pulse-limited altimeters, with the objective of determining the effect of the partial correlation of radar echoes transmitted at much higher rate than the conventional pulse repetition frequency (PRF). This is particularly relevant for the Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission. The pulse-to-pulse echo power autocorrelation shows much shorter decorrelation times toward the trailing edge of the waveform than those observed for range gates close to the leading edge. At high PRFs this creates a significant variability in the statistical properties of the range gates in the 20-Hz multilooked waveforms. By processing an extensive data set of CryoSat-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar mode data in a pseudo-low resolution mode fashion, we determined that despite the fact that at higher PRFs the noise in the estimation of geophysical parameters is reduced, significant sea-state-dependent biases are also introduced during the retracking process, which are particularly relevant for sea surface height and significant wave height. Those biases will need to be appropriately accounted for when integrating Sentinel-6/Jason-CS data in a climatological data record.

TI  - Trends in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Enactment for Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Over recent years, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) recommendations in guidelines for cutaneous melanoma have changed considerably. We aimed to assess trends in enactment of SLNB to evaluate to what extent guidelines were adhered to, and to identify clinical and pathological determinants of (non-)adherence.Methods. Clinicopathological data from the Dutch nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology were retrieved from patients diagnosed with primary cutaneous melanoma in The Netherlands between 2003 and 2014. SLNB enactment was analyzed per year. Multivariable regression models were developed to assess the determinants of SLNB enactment.Results. A total of 51,510 primary cutaneous melanomas in 49,514 patients were diagnosed, of which 24,603 melanomas were eligible for SLNB as they were staged T1b or higher. In practice, only 9761 (39.7%) patients underwent SLNB, with an increasing trend from 39.1% in 2003 to 47.8% in 2014 (p < 0.001). A total of 759 (2.9%) of 26,426 patients without SLNB indication underwent SLNB anyway. Variables significantly associated with enactment of SLNB were male sex, younger age, and melanoma on sites other than the head and neck.Conclusions. Although there was an increasing trend in time in SLNB enactment, enactment of SLNB did not comply well with recommendations in (inter)national guidelines. Female sex, higher age, and melanoma located on the head and neck were associated with non-enactment of SLNB.

M3  - Article
AB  - The creative maturity of the Georgian emigre writer and scholar Viktor Nozadze coincided with the period when the newly established communist authorities in Georgia blocked the way for all those that could not adapt to the new political system. During his thirty-year exile in France, Germany, Austria, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Spain, and finally again France, Nozadze created six monumental volumes devoted to The Knight in the Panther's Skin (Georgian: Vepkhistqaosani) by Shota Rustaveli, reviewing its ideology, worldview, and ethical and aesthetic ideals. Like all Georgians living in emigration, Viktor Nozadze was labeled an "enemy of the people" and, naturally, the totalitarian regime could not permit a place for him among Soviet scholars. In the Soviet Union before Perestroika, the research method for any work in any field was based on Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Viktor Nozadze could not fit into the ideological context governing Georgian research when he created his study of The Knight in the Panther's Skin. Examining the scholarly works at his disposal, Nozadze realized that Rustaveli's personality, perspective, and artistic-aesthetic thinking were viewed and considered superficially and ideologically by Soviet scholarship. This was especially true regarding Rustaveli's religious beliefs and worldview. Consequently, mentioning and citing Nozadze was banned in the Soviet Union, and his life passed in vain expectation of returning to his native land.

M3  - Article
AB  - Weather is by far the most important factor in air traffic delays in the United States' National Airspace System (NAS) according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Geostationary satellites have been an effective tool for the monitoring of meteorological conditions that affect aviation operations since the launch of the first Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (SMS) in the United States in 1974. This paper will review the global use of geostationary satellites in support of aviation weather since their inception, with an emphasis on the latest generation of satellites, such as Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-R (16) with its Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). Specific applications discussed in this paper include monitoring of convective storms and their associated hazards, fog and low stratus, turbulence, volcanic hazards, and aircraft icing.

TI  - Selection of PolSAR Observables for Crop Biophysical Variable Estimation With Global Sensitivity Analysis
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is to quantify and rank the most influential features for biophysical variable estimation. In this letter, an approximation model, called high-dimensional model representation (HDMR), is utilized to develop a regression method in conjunction with a GSA in the context of determining key input drivers in the estimation of crop biophysical variables from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data. A multitemporal Radarsat-2 data set is used for the retrieval of three biophysical variables of barley: leaf area index, normalized difference vegetation index, and Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemische Industrie stage. The HDMR technique is first adopted to estimate a regression model with all available polarimetric features for each biophysical parameter, and sensitivity indices of each feature are then derived to explain the original space with a smaller number of features in which a final regression model is established. To evaluate the applicability of this methodology, root-mean square and coefficient of determination were performed under different amounts of samples. Results highlight that HDMR can be used effectively in biophysical variable estimation for not only reducing computational cost but also for providing a robust regression.

TI  - Effectiveness of Various Floor Contamination Control Methods in Reducing Environmental Organic Load and Maintaining Colony Health in Rodent Facilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Floor contamination control practices in rodent housing facilities commonly include disposable shoe covers despite the lack of evidence for their usefulness in bioexclusion. Contamination control flooring mats are advertised as an economical and environmentally-responsible alternative to shoe covers, yet little is published regarding their efficacy in preventing the transfer of organic material and the introduction of infectious agents into facilities. We evaluated 4 floor contamination control strategies-shoe covers (ShCv), contamination control flooring (CCF), using both products concurrently (ShCv+CCF) compared with using neither-in preventing bacterial transfer and reducing organic load on facility floors and maintaining murine colony health status. According to PCR assay and culture analysis, ShCv provided the greatest reduction in bacterial numbers. Either ShCv, CCF, or ShCv+CCF significantly decreased ATP levels within the facility compared with those at facility entrances, with ShCv+CCF yielding the greatest reduction; however, even when neither ShCv nor CCF was used, intrafacility floor ATP levels were about half those at entrances. According to PCR analyses, no murine parasitic, viral, and bacterial pathogens excluded at the institution were detected in any floor, exhaust air dust, or sentinel samples at any time or location, regardless of the floor contamination control method in use. These findings show that floor contamination control methods help to reduce the organic load in rodent IVC facilities but do not enhance protection from environmental contamination due to murine pathogens.

TI  - Gust characteristics of near-ground typhoon winds
T2  - JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on 14 sets of records observed by 4 meteorological stations during 10 typhoons, a comprehensive investigation of gust characteristics, which are usually quantitatively expressed as the turbulence intensity and gust factor, for the near-ground typhoon winds was conducted. The direction- and mean-wind-speed-dependent features of these two gust parameters are analyzed at different heights. It is found that, in general, mean wind speed has little effect on gust parameters for off-sea winds coupled with a small number of over-land winds over 15 km of upstream fetch. Statistical characteristics, including the first four-order moments together with the probability distribution, are examined and turbulence intensity and gust factor profiles are compared with those given in various codes and standards for open-sea and flat-area conditions. The estimation of peak factor based on observations and a Gaussian distribution-based model is also presented, and they show generally good accordance for the level of mean values. The relationship between turbulence intensity and gust factor is also studied and compared with several pioneer results. Two typical upstream conditions, off-sea and over-land winds are separately analyzed, and they show an opposite tendency, i.e., the off-sea gust factor a 10 m is 8% higher than the over-land value while other heights show little difference. We attempt a rapid estimation of gust factor using the model coupled with the MODIS land-use roughness length data and compare the results with observations. Finally, some uncertainties that would induce scatter of gust characteristics and imperfections of the theoretical model are identified and discussed.

TI  - Measuring surface water salinity of Pearl River Estuary by MODIS 250-m imageries
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m imageries were used to evaluate the performance for developing the effective model of salinity using field spectra, the absorption coefficient of color dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)) collected on October 21and November 2, 2012 in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China.Methodology: Remote sensing reflectance of the four simulated MODIS bands (R,(Bi)) with a(CDOM) data were used for algorithms development, which include least squares regression of the single band, difference between bands, band ratios, sediment index and their varieties with a(CDOM) (lambda) based on the dataset of November 2, 2012 (N=18)Additionally, the model of salinity with a(CDOM) (lambda) data was also calibrated (N=18).Results: Results illustrated the optimum performance of quadratic model of sediment index for estimation of a(CDOM)(355) (R-2= 0.67, N=18, P<0.001), and the reverse linear model of (355) is of the best accuracy for estimation of salinity (R-2=0,83, N=18. P<0.001). An effective method to estimate surface water salinity from simulated MOD IS 250-m bands was calibrated and validated using the independent dataset of October 21, 2012 (RMSE = 1.9596, MRE = 9,65%, N = 17) in the Lingding Bay of PRE. The preferred models were further applied to retrieve a(CDOM) (355) and salinity data from the MODIS 250-m data in the coastal and inner Lingding Bay of PRE. The result presented rationality of salinity distribution of PRE. The MODIS 250-m salinity mapping was validated based on in-situ measurements, and presented a good salinity mapping accuracy (RMSE=1.72 parts per thousand MRE=8.24%, N=10). The study proved the robustness of these algorithms for a(CDOM) (355) and salinity estimation in the coastal and inner Lingding Bay of PRE by MODIS remote sensing.Interpretation: Therefore, the effective method can be applicable in detecting variability of a(CDOM) concentration and salinity during tidal cycle in a high frequency (two times during daytime), which proves the detection ability of MODIS 250-m imageries in estuarine and coastal waters. It provides the water supply and conservancy authorities spatially and temporally understand the marine intrusion in the Lingding Bay of PRE.

T2  - Journal of the advanced practitioner in oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - ES is a 41-year-old transgender male who presented to medical oncology as a referral from surgical oncology for T2N0M0 right breast cancer. At that time, he was receiving weekly testosterone injections intramuscularly at 0.25 mg, and had been on this regimen for 7 months. He was planning bilateral mastectomies in the spring. That winter, he palpated a mass in his right breast, and imaging revealed a 2.5-cm hypoechoic mass. A biopsy of the mass revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, with a nuclear grade of 3. His tumor was estrogen receptor positive (H-score of 180), progesterone receptor positive (H-score of 90), androgen receptor positive (H-score of 220), and HER-2/neu positive by FISH, with a Ki-67 of 90%. The clinical experience of ES illustrates challenges common to the sexual and gender minority population. ES presented to the clinic with a female friend. At that time, his name and gender in the electronic medical record (EMR) matched his driver's license, and not his preferred name or gender. Consequently, when he was called from the waiting room, he was called by his former name. The staff had not been notified of the appropriate name or pronoun to use prior to ES's arrival, and consequently was associating ES with a female gender, as indicated in the EMR. When the question about menstrual status was addressed, he stated that he had not had a period in 7 months since beginning testosterone treatment. The medical assistant questioned the use of testosterone, and ES had to explain his gender reassignment journey. By the time the physician assistant (PA) entered the room to perform the first part of the shared visit, ES was visibly upset, expressing anger with nonverbal cues. During the conversation, the PA did not acknowledge or establish the relationship of ES's female friend. The PA did not address the issue of gender identity, the use of testosterone, or plans for reassignment surgery. The physician also deferred discussion of gender reassignment during his portion of the visit and, without asking about gender reassignment, recommended cessation of testosterone therapy. Neoadjuvant docetaxel/cyclophosphamide/trastuzumab/pertuzumab was ordered, and ES agreed to treatment, but declined following the suggestion to stop testosterone. At each treatment visit, ES had to check in at the desk with his former name, resulting in confusion from the staff. With each lab draw, his name and birthdate were confirmed using the former name. With every administration of chemotherapy, double-nurse verification at the chairside was performed by reading his arm band and comparing it to the drug label. For each visit, ES had to use his old name six times. With new staff assigned to him each week, he felt pressured to explain his gender identity to several new people at each visit. At one particular visit, a patient's family in the next cubicle overheard this conversation, and ES overheard them discussing and laughing about his gender identity. ES dreaded his chemotherapy appointments not just due to the expected toxicity, but also because of the insensitivity toward his chosen gender. ES tolerated chemotherapy and proceeded to surgery. He underwent bilateral mastectomies by the surgical oncologist, who had discussed his gender reassignment with him and had referred him to plastic surgery for co-management of the surgical intervention. The plastic surgery team planned for reconstruction to include skin and soft-tissue rearrangement to give an incision line along the lower border of the pectoralis for better male cosmetic outcomes. Together, they performed bilateral mastectomies with right sentinel lymph node biopsy, horizontal mastopexy, and nipple-areolar grafting. Ultimately, the pathology revealed a complete response, and ES was pleased with the cosmetic outcome. ES was then started on tamoxifen. Again it was suggested that he discontinue testosterone therapy. He determined that he was more comfortable with an increased risk of recurrence than he was with feminine physical characteristics and chose to continue testosterone. After 6 weeks of tamoxifen, his menses resumed. He elected to discontinue tamoxifen. He had no more vaginal bleeding after that episode. He was referred for bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy (BSO), with the intent to treat with an aromatase inhibitor. He proceeded with BSO and opted against the aromatase inhibitor, citing concerns about unknown interactions with gender-affirming medication. He completed 1 year of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and continued surveillance visits.

TI  - Integrating Multitemporal Sentinel-1/2 Data for Coastal Land Cover Classification Using a Multibranch Convolutional Neural Network: A Case of the Yellow River Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal land cover classification is a significant yet challenging task in remote sensing because of the complex and fragmented nature of coastal landscapes. However, availability of multitemporal and multisensor remote sensing data provides opportunities to improve classification accuracy. Meanwhile, rapid development of deep learning has achieved astonishing results in computer vision tasks and has also been a popular topic in the field of remote sensing. Nevertheless, designing an effective and concise deep learning model for coastal land cover classification remains problematic. To tackle this issue, we propose a multibranch convolutional neural network (MBCNN) for the fusion of multitemporal and multisensor Sentinel data to improve coastal land cover classification accuracy. The proposed model leverages a series of deformable convolutional neural networks to extract representative features from a single-source dataset. Extracted features are aggregated through an adaptive feature fusion module to predict final land cover categories. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MBCNN shows good performance, with an overall accuracy of 93.78% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.9297. Inclusion of multitemporal data improves accuracy by an average of 6.85%, while multisensor data contributes to 3.24% of accuracy increase. Additionally, the featured fusion module in this study also increases accuracy by about 2% when compared with the feature-stacking method. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mine and fuse multitemporal and multisource Sentinel data, which improves coastal land cover classification accuracy.

TI  - A Hierarchical Extraction Method of Impervious Surface Based on NDVI Thresholding Integrated With Multispectral and High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imageries
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on extraction of impervious surface has developed for decades, but it is still quite challenging to obtain impervious surface information with high accuracy, especially from multispectral remote sensing imageries. Linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) is a major method for estimating impervious surface areas. When LSMA is conducted, an important phenomenon is often neglected: the spectral signature is frequently interfered by the dominant component (impervious surface, vegetation, or soil) within a mixed pixel, namely the effects of mixed-pixel spectral interference. The primary objective of this study is to design a hierarchical extracting method based on normal difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholding to eliminate these effects and improve mapping accuracy. In this method, NDVI was used and divided into different values within the range of 0.1-0.9 at intervals of 0.05. Every NDVI value was used to divide the Landsat OLI data into two segmented layers that were respectively unmixed using LSMA. The critical step was to seek out an optimal NDVI threshold by accuracy assessment, through which, a segmented layer that produced impervious surface extraction with best mapping accuracy could be identified. The results demonstrated that NDVI = 0.70 was the optimal threshold, indicating that Landsat image with NDVI <= 0.70 was not affected by spectral interference. Therefore, LSMA was implemented to extract impervious surface based on the Landsat image with NDVI <= 0.70, and the remaining area was classified by Gaofen-2 imagery to produce a complete map using object-based image analysis. This hierarchical method is effective to remove or minimize the effects of mixed-pixel spectral interference with a promising accuracy improvement of 29.3% on average. Furthermore, it provides a novel idea to enhance urban impervious surface mapping by LSMA based on NDVI thresholding.

TI  - Neural network predictions of pollutant emissions from open burning of crop residues: Application to air quality forecasts in southern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Open burning of crop residues is a strong seasonal source of air pollutants in many parts of China, but the large day-to-day variability of the associated emissions pose a great challenge for air quality forecasts. Here we developed back-propagation neural network (BPNN) ensembles to forecast the daily fire pixel counts in Southern China during the month of January. The BPNN ensembles were trained using daily assimilated surface meteorological data (including air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and winds) and daily fire pixel observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the month of January during the years 2003-2012. We showed that the BPNN ensembles successfully forecasted the day-to-day variability and the interannual variability of fire pixel counts over Southern China in January of the years 2013-2015, with correlation coefficients of 0.6-0.8 against the MODIS observations. We used the forecasted daily fire pixel counts in January 2014 and January 2015 to scale the climatological January biomass burning emissions from the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) and applied the resulting forecasted daily biomass burning emissions to drive the WRF-Chem regional air quality model. The use of BPNN-ensemble-forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions led to significant improvements in the daily forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations in Southern China for January 2014, with the mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from -9.1% to -1.2%. We repeated the sensitivity simulations for January 2015 and also found a modest improvement when using the forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions (mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from -5.8% to -2%). Our approach can be applied to other source regions of biomass burning emissions to improve the accuracy of daily air quality forecasts.

TI  - Application of Indocyanine Green in Gynecology: Review of the Literature
T2  - SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL-INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SURGERY AND SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The present review aims to analyze the current data available on the different applications of indocyanine green (ICG) in gynecology. A semantic review of English-language publications was performed by searching for MeSH terms and keywords in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies were finally selected by one author according to the aim of this review. ICG is a highly water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye that fluoresces in the NIR spectrum. Approved by the FDA in 1959, it can be administered either IV (usual dose of 5 mg) or locally/submucosally (usual dose of 5-6.25 mg) according to the pathology or indication. It is used most often in the setting of oncology, endometriosis and other gynecological conditions. In oncological applications, ICG is used to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) using near-infrared light in endometrial, cervical and vulvar cancers. The main advantages that it offers include a reduction of surgical time, improved SLN detection rates, and the ability to avoid radioactivity. In cases of endometrial (submucosal or hysteroscopic applications) or cervical (intracervical administration) cancer, ICG can detect SLN at an accuracy of 95% to 98%. For vulvar cancer, the SLN detection rate can reach 100%. In endometriosis, the lack of good evidence hinders the final evaluation of this method in both diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios. An analytical, well-designed, prospective study is currently underway.

TI  - New approach to determining the surface temperature without thermal band of satellites
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature (LST) is one of the main variables that involve the physical processes present on the surface of a planet and is one of the variables of greater relevance in the process of energy and water balance. Due to the importance of LST in the energy balance equation and in irrigated agriculture management, it is important to develop an estimation of methods for orbital sensors, such as Sentinel 2A and 2B, that do not have the capacity to capture the electromagnetic radiation emitted in the thermal infrared region. Thus, the aim of this work was to estimate the surface temperature from the MSI/Sentinel 2A sensor using the LST obtained from the TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) present on the Landsat-8 platform as a reference. In this context, we used different methodologies of pattern recognition algorithms to establish the best model: SVMlinear (support vector machine linear), SVMradial (support vector machine radial), LM (linear regression), RIDGE, RF (random forest), Cubist, PLS (partial least squares), PCR (principal components regression), GBM (generalized boosted regression), and BRNN (Bayesian regularized neural network). After the LST was estimated by the different techniques, a set of statistical metrics was used to select the best model, which in this case was the RF. With the best model defined, we calculated the actual and reference evapotranspiration ratio (r) using the LST of this model and compared it with the LST that was obtained by Landsat-8, considered a standard, to verify the applicability of our methodology.

TI  - On Extreme Winds at L-Band with the SMAP Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we discuss some observations of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission's high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for extreme winds and tropical cyclones. We find that the L-band cross-polarized backscatter is far more sensitive to wind speed at extreme winds than the co-polarized backscatter and it is essential to observations of extreme winds with L-band SAR. We introduce a cyclone wind speed retrieval algorithm and apply it to the limited SMAP SAR dataset of cyclones. We show that the SMAP SAR instrument is capable of measuring extreme winds up to the category 5 (70 m/s) wind speed regime providing unique capabilities as compared to traditional scatterometers with C and Ku-band radars.

TI  - Spectral Super Resolution of Hyperspectral Images via Coupled Dictionary Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spectral resolution imaging systems play a critical role in the identification and characterization of objects in a scene of interest. Unfortunately, multiple factors impair spectral resolution, as in the case of modern snapshot spectral imagers that associate each hyperpixel with a specific spectral band. In this paper, we introduce a novel postacquisition computational technique aiming to enhance the spectral dimensionality of imaging systems by exploiting the mathematical frameworks of sparse representations and dictionary learning. We propose a coupled dictionary learning model which considers joint feature spaces, composed of low- and high-spectral resolution hypercubes, in order to achieve spectral superresolution performance. We formulate our spectral coupled dictionary learning optimization problem within the context of the alternating direction method of multipliers, and we manage to update the involved quantities via closed-form expressions. In addition, we consider a realistic spectral subsampling scenario, taking into account the spectral response functions of different satellites. Moreover, we apply our spectral superresolution algorithm on real satellite data acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors. Finally, we have investigated the problem of hyperspectral image unmixing using the recovered high-spectral resolution data cube, and we are able to demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides significant value in hyperspectral image understanding techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to synthesize high-spectral-resolution 3-D hypercubes, achieving better performance compared to state-of-the-art resolution enhancement methods.

TI  - FORCELandsat + Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data and Beyond
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ever increasing data volumes of satellite constellations call for multi-sensor analysis ready data (ARD) that relieve users from the burden of all costly preprocessing steps. This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an all-in-one' solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+. FORCE is open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License v. >= 3, and can be downloaded from http://force.feut.de.

TI  - Treatment response as predictor for brain metastasis in triple negative breast cancer: A score-based model
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has worse prognosis than other subtypes of breast cancer, and many patients develop brain metastasis (BM). We developed a simple predictive model to stratify the risk of BM in TNBC patients receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), surgery, and radiation therapy (RT).Methods: Patients with TNBC who received NAC, surgery, and RT were included. Cox proportional hazards method was used to evaluate factors associated with BM. Significant factors predictive for BM on multivariate analysis (MVA) were used to develop a risk score. Patients were divided into three risk groups: low, intermediate, and high. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the value of the risk group in predicting BM. This predictive model was externally validated.Results: A total of 160 patients were included. The median follow-up was 47.4 months. The median age at diagnosis was 49.9 years. The 2-year freedom from BM was 90.5%. Persistent lymph node positivity, HR 8.75 (1.76-43.52, P = 0.01), and lack of downstaging, HR 3.46 (1.03-11.62, P = 0.04), were significant predictors for BM. The 2year rate of BM was 0%, 10.7%, and 30.3% (P < 0.001) in patients belonging to low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Area under the ROC curve was 0.81 (P < 0.001). This model was externally validated (C-index = 0.79).Conclusions: Lack of downstaging and persistent lymph node positivity after NAC are associated with development of BM in TNBC. This model can be used by the clinicians to stratify patients into the three risk groups to identify those at increased risk of developing BM and potentially impact surveillance strategies.

TI  - A Long-Term Historical Aerosol Optical Depth Data Record (1982-2011) Over China From AVHRR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term historical aerosol optical depth (AOD) data set from 1982 to 2011 over China (15-45 degrees N; 75-135 degrees E) with 0.1 spatial resolution has been produced from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended level-2B data. The spatial distribution pattern shows that high AOD values are found in central and eastern China over the entire period with AODs larger in summer and spring than in autumn and winter. As the high-quality products from AERONET were absent for this period over mainland China, AOD data obtained using the broadband extinction method from solar radiation stations have been used to verify the quality of the AVHRR AOD data set over China. The intercomparison results show that the interannual variation of AOD has been well captured in the variation curve of the AOD monthly mean and the variation trend is also consistent over the whole period. The correlation coefficient of the monthly mean is mostly larger than 0.55, the agreement index is larger than 0.57, and the relative error is less than 21%. Both AVHRR and visibility data sets show high values in regions with rapid economic development. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOD data as references, it is found that AVHRR AOD from this paper has better accuracy in general than that from Deep Blue (DB) algorithm over China, especially over eastern and southern China, while DB provides more coverage especially over bright surface such as northwest China. This long-term historic AOD data set can be used together with other AOD data sets to study the climate and environmental changes, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.

TI  - Rise and fall of forest loss and industrial plantations in Borneo (2000-2017)
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The links between plantation expansion and deforestation in Borneo are debated. We used satellite imagery to map annual loss of old-growth forests, expansion of industrial plantations (oil palm and pulpwood), and their overlap in Borneo from 2001 to 2017. In 17 years, forest area declined by 14% (6.04 Mha), including 3.06 Mha of forest ultimately converted into industrial plantations. Plantations expanded by 170% (6.20 Mha: 88% oil palm; 12% pulpwood). Most forests converted to plantations were cleared and planted in the same year (92%; 2.83 Mha). Annual forest loss generally increased before peaking in 2016 (0.61 Mha) and declining sharply in 2017 (0.25 Mha). After peaks in 2009 and 2012, plantation expansion and associated forest conversion have been declining in Indonesia and Malaysia. Annual plantation expansion is positively correlated with annual forest loss in both countries. The correlation vanishes when we consider plantation expansion versus forests that are cleared but not converted to plantations. The price of crude palm oil is positively correlated with plantation expansion in the following year in Indonesian (not Malaysian) Borneo. Low palm oil prices, wet conditions, and improved fire prevention all likely contributed to reduced 2017 deforestation. Oversight of company conduct requires transparent concession ownership.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of urban expansion in Xi'an from 1984 to 2016
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images and social statistical data of Xian in 1984, 1996, 2006 and 2016, the construction land information in the main urban area of Xian City was extracted through the ArcGIS 10.5. The spatiotemporal expansion characteristics of Xian City were analyzed using expansion intensity, fractal dimension, and elasticity coefficient. The driving forces and the urban sprawl trend of Xian were also studied. The results showed that the construction land increased by 478.62 km(2) from 1984 to 2016, being 3.27 times larger than that in 1984. The average annual expansion intensity was 6.88% with a growth rate of 14.50 km(2) . a(-1). The Bary-center of Xian City moved toward the northwest by 1.53 km. There were two types of urban expansion pattern including filling and expansion. The urban spatial expansion was unbalance. The city was expanded from center areas (Lianhu district, Xincheng district, Beilin district) to periphery suburb (Baqiao district, Yanta district, Weiyang district and Changan district). In general, the coordination relationship between the urban expansion and population growth was weak, with faster urban expansion than the population growth. Under the scenarios of the restriction of land space planning and the delimitation of urban boundary line, the core construction of Xian City should focus on protecting the historical culture. The development of population, environment, and economy should be coordinated and population distribution should be rationally planned, with the aim to build a unique national modern central city.

TI  - Filter tensor analysis: A tool for multi-temporal remote sensing target detection
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology, more and more multi-temporal multispectral imagery becomes easily available, thus the research of target detection for this type of data will become indispensable. However, the traditional technology of target detection is generally designed for the single-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the multilinear function as a mathematical tool to deal with the multi-temporal target detection problem for the first time. For an M time phases multispectral data set, we design an Mth-order tensor filter, which corresponds to an M-linear function, to minimize the filter output energy while keeping the target output value invariant, named filter tensor analysis (FTA). Experiments using Landsat time series with two temporally changed targets (i.e. farmland and airport) and two temporally constant targets (i.e. roof and reservoir) all show the effectiveness of FTA for multi-temporal target detection under several commonly used evaluation indices.

TI  - A New Approach to Defining Uncertainties for MODIS Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of land surface temperature (LST) observations is critical to many applications. Any observation of LST is subject to incomplete knowledge, so an accurate assessment of the uncertainty budget is critical. We present a comprehensive and consistent approach to determining an uncertainty budget for LST products. We apply this approach to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on-board the Aqua satellite. In order to generate the uncertainty model, a new implementation of the generalised split-window algorithm is applied, in which retrieval coefficients are categorised by viewing angle and water vapour. Validation of the LST against in situ data shows a mean absolute bias of 0.37 K for daytime and 0.73 K for nighttime. The average standard deviation per site is 1.53 K for daytime and 1.21 K for nighttime. Uncertainties from the implemented model are estimates in their own right and are also validated. We do this by comparing the standard deviation of the differences between the satellite and in situ LSTs, and the total uncertainties of the validation matchups. We show that the uncertainty model provides a good fit. Our approach offers a framework for quantifying uncertainties for LST that is equally applicable across different sensors and different retrieval approaches.

TI  - A Novel Framework to Harmonise Satellite Data Series for Climate Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fundamental and thematic climate data records derived from satellite observations provide unique information for climate monitoring and research. Since any satellite only operates over a relatively short period of time, creating a climate data record also requires the combination of space-borne measurements from a series of several (often similar) satellite sensors. Simply combining calibrated measurements from several sensors can, however, produce an inconsistent climate data record. This is particularly true of older, historic sensors whose behaviour in space was often different from their behaviour during pre-launch calibration and more scientific value can be derived from considering the series of historical and present satellites as a whole. Here, we consider harmonisation as a process that obtains new calibration coefficients for revised sensor calibration models by comparing calibrated measurements over appropriate satellite-to-satellite matchups, such as simultaneous nadir overpasses and which reconciles the calibration of different sensors given their estimated spectral response function differences. We present the concept of a framework that establishes calibration coefficients and their uncertainty and error covariance for an arbitrary number of sensors in a metrologically-rigorous manner. We describe harmonisation and its mathematical formulation as an inverse problem that is extremely challenging when some hundreds of millions of matchups are involved and the errors of fundamental sensor measurements are correlated. We solve the harmonisation problem as marginalised errors in variables regression. The algorithm involves computation of first and second-order partial derivatives using Algorithmic Differentiation. Finally, we present re-calibrated radiances from a series of nine Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensors showing that the new time series has smaller matchup differences compared to the unharmonised case while being consistent with uncertainty statistics.

TI  - Testing a New Ensemble Model Based on SVM and Random Forest in Forest Fire Susceptibility Assessment and Its Mapping in Serbia's Tara National Park
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objectives of this paper are to demonstrate the results of an ensemble learning method based on prediction results of support vector machine and random forest methods using Bayesian average. In this study, we generated susceptibility maps of forest fire using supervised machine learning method (support vector machine-SVM) and its comparison with a versatile machine learning algorithm (random forest-RF) and their ensembles. In order to achieve this, first of all, a forest fire inventory map was constructed using Serbian historical forest fire database, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS), Landsat 8 OLI and Worldview-2 satellite images, field surveys, and interpretation of aerial photo images. A total of 126 forest fire locations were identified and randomly divided by a random selection algorithm into two groups, including training (70%) and validation data sets (30%). Forest fire susceptibility maps were prepared using SVM, RF, and their ensemble models using the training dataset and 14 selected different conditioning factors. Finally, to explore the performance of the mentioned models we used the values for area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The results depicted that the ensemble model had an AUC = 0.848, followed by the SVM model (AUC = 0.844), and RF model (AUC = 0.834). According to achieved AUC results, it can be deduced that SVM, RF, and their ensemble method had satisfactory performance. The study was applied in the Tara National Park (West Serbia), a region of about 191.7 sq. km distinguished by a very high forest density and a large number of forest fires.

TI  - Relating ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Parameters to Biomass and Structure of Temperate Broadleaf Hyrcanian Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of forest biomass is required for sustainable forest management, efficiency valuation and exploring variations in carbon resources. In this research, we studied the possibility of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) features in order to approximation of forest biomass in Hyrcanian forests. Our study sought to resolve the following inquiries: (1) Does the relevance between aboveground biomass (AGB) and SAR features depend on forest type and structure? (2) Does the use of polarimetric decomposition components elevate the saturation point of SAR response to biomass? (3) What are the most impressive texture parameters for mapping Hyrcanian vegetation biomass? For this purpose, we recorded 115 circular sample plots with 0.1ha area in four sites, with various forest structures and biomass. Quad-pol PALSAR-2 data were used to apply decomposition methods and investigate the relationship between AGB and PolSAR attributes. To measure the efficiency of PolSAR data for biomass estimation, we used regression analysis, in which second-order and linear models were fit to forecast biomass per hectare, as defined from the field computations. Our results indicated that decomposition features have a high ability to enhance the saturation point and can produce more favorable outcomes than the backscatter coefficients for biomass estimation. Experimental results showed that the response of backscattering coefficients to biomass is affected by the forest type and canopy structure. These findings confirmed that the HH polarization backscatter is better suited for sparse areas, while HV polarization backscatter is qualified for dense areas.

TI  - Desert locust detection using Earth observation satellite data in Mauritania
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert locust plagues have threatened food security in northern African countries for centuries. To prevent their effects, current early warning systems in arid environments need to be improved using the latest and most advanced modelling techniques and Earth observation datasets. Previous studies have analysed certain environmental predictors such as NDVI or soil moisture individually in an effort to detect suitable areas. However, we introduce new variables (Surface Temperature, LAI and Soil Moisture Root Zone) from the SMAP satellite and apply different machine learning methods in our species distribution model in order to identify desert locust presence. We obtain highly satisfactory model results (KAPPA & TSS = 0.901 and ROC = 0.986) to detect the probability of presence and, hence, likely breeding areas based on environmental factors. The most relevant variables were surface temperature, NDVI and soil moisture at root zone under different time scenarios. This study also confirms the potential of the SMAP satellite to retrieve critical temperatures due to its time pass, in addition to reinforcing the NDVI product from MODIS as a reliable environmental predictor. These results demonstrate the validity of this new approach based on machine learning methods to identify favourable breeding areas in Mauritania.

TI  - Eurasian Large-Scale Hazes in Summer 2016
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The technique for constructing the spatial distribution of maximum aerosol optical depth (MAOD) has been used to estimate the optically dense haze expansion scales from July 15 to 31, 2016 (over an area of 20 million km(2)), including the record-scale Siberian smoke haze (SSH) with an area of around 16million km(2), smog over the Northern China Plain (around 2 million km(2)) and the adjacent offshore zones, a dust haze in the Taklamakan Desert (around 0.8 million km(2)), and hazes in India and Pakistan (almost 1million km(2)). The empirical distribution function (EDF) of the MAOD is approximated by a linear function of the MAOD logarithm. The spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at a wavelength of 550nm in the SSH has been analyzed. The total mass of smoke aerosol in the SSH has been estimated to be 3.2 million t, including around 2 million t over the territory of Siberia (50-70 degrees N, 60-120 degrees E) during the peak haze from July 22 to July 26, 2016. The qualitative composition of smoke aerosol in the SSH during its transport is illustrated through spatial and temporal variations in the aerosol index (AI). It is shown that AI variations are correlated with AOD variations. Aerosol radiative forcings (ARFs) at the upper and lower atmospheric boundaries over Siberia from July 22 to 26, 2016, have been estimated (with an average ARF of -68 and -98 W/m(2)). The EDFs of AOD and ARF at the upper atmospheric boundary have been approximated by exponential and power function of AOD, respectively.

TI  - The impact of spatiotemporal patterns of land use land cover and land surface temperature on an urban cool island: a case study of Bengaluru
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In most of the developing countries, man-made developments in the environment have led to the growing demand to contextualize the land use land cover (LULC) changes and land surface temperature (LST) variations. Due to the modification in the surface properties of the cities, a difference in energy balance between the cities and its nonurban surroundings is observed. The aim of this study is to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of LULC and LST and its interrelationship in Bengaluru urban district, India, during the period from 1989 to 2017 using remote sensing data. Intensity analysis was performed for the interval to analyze the LULC change and identify the driving forces. The impact of LULC change on LST was assessed using hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistics). The results of this study show that (a) dominant LULC change experienced is the increase in urban area (approximately 40%) and the rate of land use change was faster in the time period 1989-2001 than 2001-2017; (b) the major transition witnessed is from barren and agricultural land to urban; (c) over the period of 28years, LST patterns for different land use classes exhibit an increasing trend with an overall increase of approximately 6 degrees C and the mean LST of urban area increased by about 8 degrees C; (d) LST pattern change can be effectively analyzed using hot spot analysis; and (e) as the urban expansion occurs, the cold spots have increased, and it is mainly clustered in the urban area. It confirms the presence of an urban cool island effect in Bengaluru urban district. The findings of this work can be used as a scientific basis for the sustainable development and land use planning of the region in the future.

TI  - Two common invertebrate predators show varying predation responses to different types of sentinel prey
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel prey (an artificially manipulated patch of prey) are widely used to assess the level of predation provided by natural enemies in agricultural systems. Whilst a number of different methodologies are currently in use, little is known about how arthropod predators respond to artificially manipulated sentinel prey in comparison with predation on free-living prey populations. We assessed how attack rates on immobilized (aphids stuck to cards) and artificial (plasticine lepidopteran larvae mimics) sentinel prey differed to predation on free-moving live prey (aphids). Predation was assessed in response to density of the common invertebrate predators, a foliar-active ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and a ground-active beetle Pterostichus madidus (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Significant increases in attack rates were found for the immobilized and artificial prey between the low and high predator density treatments. However, an increased predator density did not significantly reduce numbers of free-living live aphids included in the mesocosms in addition to the alternate prey. We also found no signs of predation on the artificial prey by the predator H. axyridis. These findings suggest that if our assessment of predation had been based solely on the foliar artificial prey, then no increase in predation would have been found in response to increased predator density. Our results demonstrate that predators differentially respond to sentinel prey items which could affect the level of predation recorded where target pest species are not being used.

TI  - The "plantspec' r package: A tool for spectral analysis of plant stoichiometry
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on plant elemental stoichiometry are essential for ecologists investigating ecosystem function, nutrient cycling, plant-herbivore interactions and leaf economics.A cost-effective approach to leaf elemental analysis is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), whereby components such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) can be predicted using NIR spectra from plant material. However, a major factor limiting the widespread use of NIRS by plant ecologists is the availability of free software and calibration data for developing plant chemistry datasets from spectra. Here, we present a pair of companion r packages (plantspec' and plantspecDB') that satisfy this need by providing an entire workflow, from spectra to predicted elemental data.The main r package, called plantspec', allows users to manipulate spectral data and develop custom partial least square (PLS) models for predicting the elemental composition of their own datasets. The second package, plantspecDB', provides NIR spectra, and matched elemental data obtained with standard analytical techniques, for herbaceous samples collected from 18 grassland sites around the world, primarily sourced from the Nutrient Network experiment. The plantspecDB' data package also provides calibrations for C, N, P and K for bulk samples and separated by plant functional type: grasses, forbs and legumes. Finally, we provide an example of the plantspec' workflow, and external validation of these models, and an example application to the stoichiometry of East African grasses as it relates to their evolutionary relationships.The r package plantspec', and our associated workflow, provides a template to produce robust calibration models and increase the application of NIR in ecology. Although, we focus on plant stoichiometry, the workflow presented here can be applied broadly for a broad range of applications, including soils, remote sensing data, solutions and tissues. Finally, our global dataset provides unprecedented access to NIR calibration data as they pertain to tissue concentrations of key plant limiting elements.

TI  - Evaluation of Regression Analysis and Neural Networks to Predict Total Suspended Solids in Water Bodies from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of suspended solids in water is one of the quality parameters that can be recovered using remote sensing data. This paper investigates the data obtained using a sensor coupled to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in order to estimate the concentration of suspended solids in a lake in southern Brazil based on the relation of spectral images and limnological data. The water samples underwent laboratory analysis to determine the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS). The images obtained using the UAV were orthorectified and georeferenced so that the values referring to the near, green, and blue infrared channels were collected at each sampling point to relate with the laboratory data. The prediction of the TSS concentration was performed using regression analysis and artificial neural networks. The obtained results were important for two main reasons. First, although regression methods have been used in remote sensing applications, they may not be adequate to capture the linear and/or non-linear relationships of interest. Second, results show that the integration of UAV in the mapping of water bodies together with the application of neural networks in the data analysis is a promising approach to predict TSS as well as their temporal and spatial variations.

M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic contamination of beaches in the south of Brazil was assessed by detection of Escherichia coli, hwnan mastadenovirus species C (HAdV-C) and F (HAdV-F) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Sampling was carried out in October (2016), and in January, April and July (2017). Water, sediment, sea surface microlayer (SML), bivalves, and air sentinel samples were evaluated. Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) was used to estimate the probability of swimmer infection. HAdV-C was present in 26% of the samples, for both qPCR and viral isolation. The highest rates of detection in genomic copies (GC) were in water (2.42E + 10 GC/L), SML (2.08E +10 GC/L), sediment (3.82E +08 GC/g) and bivalves (3.91E+07 GC/g). QMRA estimated daily and annual risks with a maximum value (9.99E-01) in almost all of the samples. Viable HAdV-C was often detected in the SML, pointing that this is a source of infection for people bathing in these waters.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of soil salinization in Yellow River Delta utilizing MSAVI-SI feature space models with Landsat images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the surface eco-environmental landscape of the Yellow River Delta, two different models based on Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index-Salinized Index (MSAVI-SI) feature spaces have been proposed, and then, comparisons and analyses among the above two models have been conducted to find and recommend the optimal monitoring model of soil salinization for the Yellow River Delta. Results showed that: (1) the MSAVI-SI feature space model considering the soil line had greater efficiency and applicability for monitoring salinized soil in the Yellow River Delta with R-2=0.8975 and an overall precision of 86.7% validation of salinization classification; (2) the soil salinization was widely and discontinuously distributed over the whole region. During 1987-2016, soil salinization had improved with an increased area of slight salinization and a decreased area of severe and moderate salinization; (3) the relationship between salinization detection indices (SDI2) and organic content differed with increasing organic content. There was a positive relationship between SDI2 and organic content with the organic content (OC)<0.8%, while relationship was negative with the OC>0.8%. These results can be helpful for the dynamic and periodical monitoring of soil salinity, and provide a scientific basis for properly managing soil and water resource in the Yellow River Delta. In addition, the optimal MSAVI-SI feature space model (SDI2) can also be utilized to monitor the soil salinization of zones with similar environmental conditions to Yellow River Delta with monsoon climate and wetland ecosystem.

TI  - Detecting spatio-temporal changes of arable land and construction land in the Beijing-Tianjin corridor during 2000-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid peri-urbanization has become a new challenge for sustainable urban-rural development worldwide. To clarify how unprecedented urban sprawl at the metropolitan fringe impacts urban-rural landscape, this study took the Beijing-Tianjin corridor of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area, one of the largest urban clusters in China, as a typical example. By using Landsat-based landscape metrics and a practical methodology, we investigated the landscape changes and discussed the potential reasons in the context of rapid peri-urbanization of China. Specifically, multi-temporal land use maps derived from Landsat images were used to calculate landscape metrics and analyze their characteristics along the urban-rural gradients. The practical methodology was used to monitor spatio-temporal characteristics of landscape change in large metropolitan areas. The results showed that landscape patterns in the area had changed greatly from 2000 to 2015 with characteristics of construction land sprawl and arable land shrinkage. The intensity and scale of landscape changes varied along the urban-rural gradients. Sampled plots in urbanized areas and rural areas demonstrated distinguishable landscape patterns and significant differences. Urban areas had more heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes than rural areas. Peri-urban areas in general experienced higher levels of land diversification than rural areas. Rural residential land appeared to be more aggregated near Beijing and Tianjin cities. Besides, our findings also indicated that urban expansion was largely responsible for landscape patterns. The findings of this study potentially provide strategical insights into landscape planning around mega cities and sustainable coordinated urban-rural development.

TI  - Don't Get Stuck: A Quality Improvement Project to Reduce Perioperative Blood-Borne Pathogen Exposure
T2  - JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Blood-borne pathogen exposure (BBPE) represents a significant safety and resource burden, with more than 380,000 events reported annually across hospitals in the United States. The perioperative environment is a high-risk area tor BBPE, and efforts to reduce exposures are not well defined. A multidisciplinary group of nurses, surgical technologists, surgeons, and employee health specialists created a BBPE prevention bundle to reduce Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable cases.Methods: Mandatory double gloving, a safety zone, engineered-sharps injury prevention devices, and clear communication when passing sharps were implemented in an evidence-based fashion at one institution. Days between exposures and total number of exposures were monitored. Analysis by specialty, role, location, type of injury, and timing was performed.Results: During fiscal year (FY) 2015, 45 cases were reported. During the first year of implementation, cases decreased to 38 (a 15.6% decrease; p < 0.65). In the postimplementation period (FY 2017), only 21 cases were reported (an additional 44.7% decrease; p < 0.12), for a total decrease of 53.3% (p < 0.01). The mean number of days between injuries significantly increased (2.5 to 16.3) over the study period. For FY 2017, the main cause of BBPE was needlestick while suturing (47.6%); fellows and attendings combined had the most injuries (52.4%); among divisions, pediatric surgery (19.0%), operating room staff (19.0%), and orthopedics (19.0%) had the most events.Conclusion: A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to employee safety, focused on reduction of BBPE resulted in a significant progressive annual decrease of injuries among perioperative staff.

TI  - Grassland disturbance increases monarch butterfly oviposition and decreases arthropod predator abundance
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many species of conservation concern depend on disturbance to create or maintain suitable habitat. We evaluated effects of disturbance on the eastern migratory monarch butterfly (Denaus plexippus L.), which has declined markedly in recent decades, primarily attributed to the loss of milkweed host plants from annual crop fields in the US Midwest. Currently, remaining milkweeds in this region primarily occur in perennial grasslands, where disturbance is infrequent, predatory arthropods are abundant, and seasonal patterns of plant phenology differ from crop fields. In a two-year study in Michigan, USA, we applied three treatments to 23 patches of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.); one-third of each patch was left undisturbed, while the remaining thirds were mowed in either mid-June or mid-July, respectively, and allowed to regenerate. We subsequently measured effects on monarch oviposition, predator abundance, survival of sentinel eggs and larvae, and tested how milkweed phenology and aphid colonization-both of which are reset by disturbance-structure predation risk for immature monarchs. Monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating versus undisturbed stems under both mowing regimes. Predators were strongly suppressed by mowing treatments, requiring 2-4 weeks to recolonize milkweed after disturbance, and were more abundant on flowering or aphid-infested stems. We found no significant differences in monarch egg/larval survival, although it tended to be higher in mowed plots. Overall, monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating stems where their offspring may also experience enemy-free space. Future work should focus on testing grassland disturbance as a management tool to improve productivity of existing monarch breeding habitat.

TI  - Preparation of <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Labeled Mannan-<i>S</i>-Cysteine and Effect of Molecular Size of Mannan on Its Biodistribution
T2  - BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophage mannose receptor (MMR/CD206) is a promising target for the detection and identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN). MMR-targeting probes have been developed using mannosylated dextran, however, impairment of efficient targeting of SLN was often caused because of retention of injection site in which macrophages and dendritic cells exist. In this study, we prepared new MMR-targeting probes from yeast mannan (85kDa), and its bioditribution was investigated. In-vivo evaluation showed that 11.9% of injected dose of Tc-99m-labeled mannan-S-cysteines (Tc-99m-MSCs) was accumulated in popliteal lymph node (the SLN in this model), however, significant level of radioactivity (approximately 80%) was remained in injection site. Interestingly, Tc-99m-labeled low molecular weight mannan-S-cysteine mannan (Tc-99m-LSC) prepared from 50 and 25kDa mannan showed a decreased specific accumulation of Tc-99M-LSC in the popliteal lymph node, while the radioactivity at the injection site remained unchanged. These results suggest that the molecular size, or nature/shape of the sugar chain is important for the specific accumulation of Tc-99m-MSC in popliteal lymph node.

TI  - The Center for Regional and Tribal Child Welfare Studies: Reducing disparities through indigenous social work education
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This research addresses one of the most pressing and controversial issues facing child welfare policymakers and practitioners today: the dramatic overrepresentation of Indigenous families in North American public child welfare systems. Effective, inclusive education is one necessary component of efforts to reduce such disparities. Yet recruiting students from various cultural communities to the field and educating white social work students and professionals to practice in culturally responsive ways are ongoing challenges. In this ethnography, we examine an apparently successful model of inclusive education: the Center for Regional and Tribal Child Welfare Studies (the Center) at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, School of Social Work. For over a decade, the Center has graduated Indigenous and non -Indigenous child welfare workers with MSWs now practicing within tribal communities, as well as provided continuing education for child welfare professionals. At the Center, Indigenous scholars and social workers, tribal leaders and their allies design and sustain a model of honoring and integrating Indigenous worldviews with Western social work. Experiential learning engaging the "heart and head" is a cornerstone of the Center's educational practices. Students and professional colleagues are approached with a "good heart" as "relatives" with positive intentions. They learn about the spirituality, language, culture and history of Indigenous people. The strengths -based curriculum also includes challenging content on the legacy of genocide and historical trauma on Indigenous families and communities, as well as contemporary laws and policies such as the Indian Child Welfare Act. The educational worldview and practices of the Center provide understanding for social work, generally, and child welfare, specifically, that supports effective practice and policy within diverse communities.

TI  - A Collaborative Change Detection Approach on Multi-Sensor Spatial Imagery for Desert Wetland Monitoring after a Flash Flood in Southern Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to present a technique that combines multi-sensor spatial data to monitor wetland areas after a flash-flood event in a Saharan arid region. To extract the most efficient information, seven satellite images (radar and optical) taken before and after the event were used. To achieve the objectives, this study used Sentinel-1 data to discriminate water body and soil roughness, and optical data to monitor the soil moisture after the event. The proposed method combines two approaches: one based on spectral processing, and the other based on categorical processing. The first step was to extract four spectral indices and utilize change vector analysis on multispectral diachronic images from three MSI Sentinel-2 images and two Landsat-8 OLI images acquired before and after the event. The second step was performed using pattern classification techniques, namely, linear classifiers based on support vector machines (SVM) with Gaussian kernels. The results of these two approaches were fused to generate a collaborative wetland change map. The application of co-registration and supervised classification based on textural and intensity information from Radar Sentinel-1 images taken before and after the event completes this work. The results obtained demonstrate the importance of the complementarity of multi-sensor images and a multi-approach methodology to better monitor changes to a wetland area after a flash-flood disaster.

TI  - Atmospheric Investigation of Frontal Dust Storms in Southwest Asia
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an atmospheric investigation of frontal dust storms in southwest Asia is presented. Atmospheric analysis is done on six severe frontal dust storms which occurred on the Tigris and Euphrates alluvial plain dust sources in non-summer seasons during the last two decades. NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis Data were used for synoptic analysis, and the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data were used to identify the dusty days, dust plumes, and estimation of the dust load over the area. Atmospheric analysis results demonstrated that in non-summer seasons, the high pressure system over the southeastern Arabian Peninsula and neighboring areas with the low pressure system over the east of the Mediterranean Sea and neighboring areas are responsible for noticeable frontal dust storms over the Tigris and Euphrates rivers valley dust sources. These circulation systems provide a favorable condition for southeastward, northeastward, and eastward transport of the dust plumes. An investigation on the affected area by the dust plumes demonstrated that southern Iraq, Kuwait and the Khuzestan province in Iran have the highest AODs and dust load during the investigated dust events. Central Iraq, western and southwestern Iran, and northeastern Saudi Arabia are the regions which were affected by frontal dust storms dust plumes more than the other areas in the Middle East. Studies have shown that the most severe frontal dust storms occurred during March and April and the analysis of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AODs data demonstrated that the maximum dust load over the area exceeded 5gm(-2).

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5 m (PM2.5) is of great importance to assess its adverse effects on human health, especially densely populated regions. In this paper, an improved linear mixed effect model (LMEM) was developed. The model introduced meteorological variable, column water vapor (CWV), which has as the same resolution as satellite-derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT), to enhance PM2.5 estimation accuracy by considering spatiotemporal consistency of CWV and AOT. The model was implemented to urban agglomeration of Chengdu Plain during 2015. The results show that model accuracy has been improved significantly compared to linear regression model (R-2 = 0.49), with R-2 of 0.81 and root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) of 15.47 g/m(3), mean prediction error (MPE) of 11.09 g/m(3), and effectively revealed the characteristics of spatiotemporal variations PM2.5 level across the study area: The PM2.5 level is higher in the central and southern areas with dense population, while it is lower in the northwest and southwest mountain areas; and the PM2.5 level is higher during autumn and winter, while it is lower during spring and summer. The product data in this paper are valuable for local government pollution monitoring, public health research, and urban air quality control.

TI  - Mixture End-Members Extraction Method For Coverage Calculation of Sea Oil Spills Based on Hyper-spectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - How to estimate the coverage rate of oil spills is an important part of the sea oil spills detection. To be limited by spatial resolution of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing image, it is difficult to detect the coverage of oil spills accurately. Under the action of ocean waves and broken waves, the oil spill tends to be banded distribution. Because there are a lot of oil and water mixed pixels in the hyperspectral data, the traditional image segmentation method which is used to calculate the oil spill area was mistaken in many ways. It is difficult to find the pure spectral spectrum because the traditional extraction method is influenced by the angle and height of the sensor and the spectral variation. In this paper, we proposed a second extraction method of endmembers. Firstly, N-FINDR algorithm is used for the endmembers' preselection. Secondly, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used for the ultimate refinement of endmembers' selection and the candidate endmembers are obtained according to the maximum output of negative entropy. Thirdly, the ground synchronous reference spectra are used as constraints to identify the similar oil spill terminals. Finally, the end members' abundances are obtained based on the nonnegative matrix decomposition method (NMF) and the real oil spill coverage are obtained through correction of solar flare region. The extraction of partitioned mixed endmembers is a good solution to the problem of global endmembers mutation and poor environment adaptability, so that the selected endmembers have better environment robustness. In order to evaluate the accuracy of this algorithm, the simulation data and the real hyperspectral image data are combined to verify the experiment. In the simulation experiment, the difference between the estimated abundance and the set abundance are evaluated by using the mean square error (RMSE) and the abundance estimation error, the algorithm adaptability and anti-noise experiment are designed. The result indicated that, under two hyperspectral compression case by MNF and PCA, estimation error of abundance is less than 3%. The minimum RMSE of reconstructed image is up to 0. 030 6 and has good anti-noise ability.The accuracy evaluation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In the real experiment, 8 hyper-spectral remote sensing image collected by airborne of Shandong Changdao in 2011 are used for real test data. Because the real remote sensing data often lacks the ground synchronization abundance data, it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. The combination of simulation data with verification and visual interpretation data are used to evaluate the accuracy. The total oil spill coverage area of airborne hyperspectral imaging estimated by the flare area is 1. 17 km(2), the oil spill coverage is t 22. 85% and the field artificial estimation area deviation is 2. 15%. Obviously the method is superior to the traditional method. It is difficult to analyze the abundance of single pixel in ocean oil spill remote sensing because it is influenced by the ocean breaking wave, spectral variability and the limitation of ground resolution of aerospace remote sensor. Based on the idea of the abundance decomposition of the image, this paper discusses the problem of the coverage of ocean oil spill, and puts forward a comparatively perfect method for calculating the covering degree of ocean oil spill. The method is validated through the simulation data and the actual hyperspectral oil spill data. The method is an objective automatic oil spill coverage (abundance) detection method and could realize the automatic monitoring of oil spill coverage rate. It is meaning for fine detection of oil spills area.

AB  - Agriculture faces the challenge of providing food, fibre and energy from limited land resources to satisfy the changing needs of a growing world population. Global megatrends, e.g., climate change, influence environmental production factors; production and consumption thus must be continuously adjusted to maintain the producer-consumer-equilibrium in the global food system. While, in some parts of the world, smallholder farming still is the dominant form of agricultural production, the use of digital information for the highly efficient cultivation of large areas has become part of agricultural practice in developed countries. Thereby, the use of satellite data to support site-specific management is a major trend. Although the most prominent use of satellite technology in farming still is navigation, Earth Observation is increasingly applied. Some operational services have been established, which provide farmers with decision-supporting spatial information. These services have mostly been boosted by the increased availability of multispectral imagery from NASA and ESA, such as the Landsat or Copernicus programs, respectively. Using multispectral data has arrived in the agricultural commodity chain. Compared to multispectral data, spectrally continuous narrow-band sampling, often referred to as hyperspectral sensing, can potentially provide additional information and/or increased sampling accuracy. However, due to the lack of hyperspectral satellite systems with high spatial resolution, these advantages mostly are not yet used in practical farming. This paper summarizes where hyperspectral data provide additional value and information in an agricultural context. It lists the variables of interest and highlights the contribution of hyperspectral sensing for information-driven agriculture, preparing the application of future operational spaceborne hyperspectral missions.

TI  - Land Use Change and Climate Variation in the Three Gorges Reservoir Catchment from 2000 to 2015 Based on the Google Earth Engine
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Possible environmental change and ecosystem degradation have received increasing attention since the construction of Three Gorges Reservoir Catchment (TGRC) in China. The advanced Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform and the large number of Geosciences and Remote Sensing datasets archived in GEE were used to analyze the land use and land cover change (LULCC) and climate variation in TGRC. GlobeLand30 data were used to evaluate the spatial land dynamics from 2000 to 2010 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were applied for land use in 2015. The interannual variations in the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and seasonally integrated normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) were estimated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The climate factors including air temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration were investigated based on the data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The results indicated that from 2000 to 2015, the cultivated land and grassland decreased by 2.05% and 6.02%, while the forest, wetland, artificial surface, shrub land and waterbody increased by 3.64%, 0.94%, 0.87%, 1.17% and 1.45%, respectively. The SINDVI increased by 3.209 in the period of 2000-2015, while the LST decreased by 0.253 degrees C from 2001 to 2015. The LST showed an increasing trend primarily in urbanized area, with a decreasing trend mainly in forest area. In particular, Chongqing City had the highest LST during the research period. A marked decrease in SINDVI occurred primarily in urbanized areas. Good vegetation areas were primarily located in the eastern part of the TGRC, such as Wuxi County, Wushan County, and Xingshan County. During the 2000-2015 period, the air temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration rose by 0.0678 degrees C/a, 1.0844 mm/a, and 0.4105 mm/a, respectively. The climate change in the TGRC was influenced by LULCC, but the effect was limited. What is more, the climate change was affected by regional climate change in Southwest China. Marked changes in land use have occurred in the TGRC, and they have resulted in changes in the LST and SINDVI. There was a significantly negative relationship between LST and SINDVI in most parts of the TGRC, especially in expanding urban areas and growing forest areas. Our study highlighted the importance of environmental protection, particularly proper management of land use, for sustainable development in the catchment.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of vegetation and its determinants in the National Key Ecological Function Area on Loess Plateau between 2000 and 2015
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - China defined 25 National Key Ecological Function Areas in 2010 and adopted various measures to support ecosystem restoration in these areas. During the process of environment policymaking, it is important to observe the variation of vegetation and its driving factors. In this paper, we chose the National Key Ecological Function Area (NKEFA) on Loess Plateau as the study area. Based on MODIS-NDVI data between 2000 and 2015, the trend analysis was used to depict the change in NDVI and the stepwise regression analysis method was used to quantitatively assess its determinants. The results show that: (a) The vegetation coverage in study area was low in the northwest and high in the southeast, corresponding to the distribution of precipitation and temperature. (b) NDVI in the growing season increased remarkably from 0.2841 in 2000 to 0.4199 in 2015 with a linear tendency of 0.085/10a. About 71.22% of the study area experienced an extremely significant increasing of NDVI, while only 0.03% of the total area suffered from significant decreasing of NDVI. (c) Compared to climatic factors, ecosystem conservation policies, and labor transfer contributed more to the vegetation changes in the study area. In order to ensure ecological security and sustainable development in these areas, it is necessary to maintain the continuity of ecological compensation policy. Moreover, developing targeted eco-compensation policies and encouraging farmers to participate in nonfarm employment are effective ways to reach a win-win outcome of reducing the ecosystem pressure and improving the welfare of rural households.

TI  - Multi-temporal image change mining based on evidential conflict reasoning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection monitoring on multi-temporal remote sensed images is a persistent methodological challenge where the Dempster-Shafer, or evidence, Theory (DST) has been often applied. This paper presents a new method based on the use of DST for mining bi-temporal remotely sensed images change. The main idea is based on the investigation, analysis and interpretation of different types of conflict between two bi-temporal mass distributions. The reasoning process is focused on the conflict significance and its "partial" causes. In fact, the global conflict that occurs during the joint exploitation of multi-temporal images gives general and non-sufficiently concise information. However, the partial conflict provides rich and important information with regards to the disagreement between knowledge sources. For computing the partial conflict between focal elements, the geometric representation of mass distributions is exploited. The obtained conflict measures, caused by change, are analyzed latter by a new algorithm for drifting binary change map and identifying change directions. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach are shown through experimentations on simulated changed images as well as using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images where qualitative criteria as well as quantitative measures are applied. The performances of the proposed approach, in terms of changed area recognition, are compared to three different and widely used conflict measures: the Empty-set mass, the Jousselme's distance and the Cosine measure. It is shown that the developed change detection approach outperforms these conflict measures.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of daily climate variables by aggregating multiple spatial data sets with the random forest algorithm over the conterminous United States
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution gridded climate data products are crucial to research and practical applications in climatology, hydrology, ecology, agriculture, and public health. Previous works to produce multiple data sets were limited by the availability of input data as well as computational techniques. With advances in machine learning and the availability of several daily satellite data sets providing unprecedented information at 1 km or higher spatial resolutions, it is now possible to improve upon earlier data sets in terms of representing spatial variability. We developed the NEX (NASA Earth Exchange) Gridded Daily Meteorology (NEX-GDM) model, which can estimate the spatial pattern of regional surface climate variables by aggregating several dozen two-dimensional data sets and ground weather station data. NEX-GDM does not require physical assumptions and can easily extend spatially and temporally. NEX-GDM employs the random forest algorithm for estimation, which allows us to find the best estimate from the spatially continuous data sets. We used the NEX-GDM model to produce historical 1-km daily spatial data for the conterminous United States from 1979 to 2017, including precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation. In this study, NEX-GDM ingested a total of 30 spatial variables from 13 different data sets, including satellite, reanalysis, radar, and topography data. Generally, the spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature produced were similar to previous data sets with the exception of mountain regions in the western United States. The analyses for each spatially continuous data set show that satellite and reanalysis led to better estimates and that the incorporation of satellite data allowed NEX-GDM to capture the spatial patterns associated with urban heat island effects. The NEX-GDM data is available to the community through the NEX data portal.

TI  - Effective Cloud Detection and Segmentation Using a Gradient-Based Algorithm for Satellite Imagery: Application to Improve PERSIANN-CCS
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective identification of clouds and monitoring of their evolution are important toward more accurate quantitative precipitation estimation and forecast. In this study, a new gradient-based cloud-image segmentation algorithm is developed using image processing techniques. This method integrates morphological image gradient magnitudes to separate cloud systems and patches boundaries. A varying scale kernel is implemented to reduce the sensitivity of image segmentation to noise and to capture objects with various finenesses of the edges in remote sensing images. The proposed method is flexible and extendable from single to multispectral imagery. Case studies were carried out to validate the algorithm by applying the proposed segmentation algorithm to synthetic radiances for channels of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-16) simulated by a high-resolution weather prediction model. The proposed method compares favorably with the existing cloud-patch-based segmentation technique implemented in the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) rainfall retrieval algorithm. Evaluation of event-based images indicates that the proposed algorithm has potentials comparing to the conventional segmentation technique used in PERSIANN-CCS to improve rain detection and estimation skills with an accuracy rate of up to 98% in identifying cloud regions.

TI  - Prospective cohort study of ultrasound surveillance of regional lymph nodes in patients with intermediate-risk cutaneous melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: For patients with intermediate-thickness melanoma, surveillance of regional lymph node basins by clinical examination alone has been reported to result in a larger number of lymph nodes involved by melanoma than if patients had initial sentinel node biopsy and completion dissection. This may result in worse regional control. A prospective study of both regular clinical examination and ultrasound surveillance was conducted to assess the effectiveness of these modalities.Methods: Between 2010 and 2014, patients with melanoma of thickness 1.2-3.5mmwho had under-gone wide local excision but not sentinel node biopsy were recruited to a prospective observational study of regular clinical and ultrasound nodal surveillance. The primary endpoint was nodal burden within a dissected regional lymph node basin. Secondary endpoints included locoregional or distant relapse, progression-free and overall survival.Results: Ninety patients were included in the study. After a median follow-up of 52 months, ten patients had developed nodal relapse as first recurrence, four had locoregional disease outside of an anatomical nodal basin as the first site of relapse and six had relapse with distant disease. None of the patients who developed relapse within a nodal basin presented with unresectable nodal disease. The median number of involved lymph nodes in patients undergoing lymphadenectomy for nodal relapse was 1 (range 1-2; mean 1.2).Conclusion: This study suggests that ultrasound surveillance of regional lymph node basins is safe for patients with melanoma who undergo a policy of nodal surveillance.

AB  - Preliminary analyses at ESA have shown that space objects in LEO with masses above 500 kg might already imply an on-ground casualty risk higher than 1E-4 in case of uncontrolled re-entry. Compliance to this casualty risk requirement may be achieved through controlled re-entry, but this solution has a major impact at system level. Sometime it requires a full re-design of the spacecraft and may involve switching to a completely different launcher performance (consequently a significant mission cost impact).This option may be avoided with achievement of compliant ablation (demise) of the spacecraft upon uncontrolled atmospheric re-entry. The so-called Design-for Demise discipline (D4D) is a highly multidisciplinary approach that can bring significant benefits in the future missions in the medium to long term. (Klinkrad, 2006; Johnson, 2012) [1,2].ESA created in 2012 the "Cleanspace" initiative and team to promote actions on green aspects and debris remediation (ESA Clean Space Team, 2015) [3]. Recently ALTRAN was involved inside THALES ALENIA Space consortium in those ESA activities on S/C D4D techniques and proposed several D4D concepts. This ESA D4D study had the objective to find D4D solutions for the Sentinel-1 study case (around 2 tons). This objective were about to be theoretically achieved. [4].The outcomes of those D4D studies performed in parallel at level of 3 LSI (Large System Integrator) were concluded in early 2016 [4,5] and used mainly ESA Sentinels S/C as study cases. Those studies all demonstrated that S/C dismantlement (controlled and earlier to natural break-up) has a major benefit in reduction of S/C Debris Casualty Area (DCA). Then this technique has to be considered with high priority in a global approach for D4D improvement. (ESA, 2015; CleanSat Workshop presentations, 2015) [6,7].The proposed ALTRAN/NIMESIS study CLEANSAT Building Block 10: Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) Dismantlement Mechanisms has investigated several technological devices and SMA material options for their suitability to be implemented in LEO satellite H/W of main European LSI for dismantlement during atmospheric re-entry.

TI  - Associations of presence or absence of exercise and/or physical activity with non-restorative sleep by gender and age: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Non-restorative sleep (NRS) is related to qualitative aspects of sleep. The associations of NRS with exercise (EX; a planned and purposeful activity) and physical activity (PA; daily bodily movement) by gender and age have not yet been clarified. We investigated the associations of EX and/or PA with NRS by gender and age.Design A cross-sectional study.Setting The data on gender, age, presence of NRS and engagement in EX and/or PA were obtained from database and questionnaire of specified medical check-ups in FY 2013 in Japan. The analysis was conducted in 2017.Participants The subjects comprised 90 122 residents (38 603 males and 51 519 females), aged 40-74 years, who had completed the specified medical check-ups.Outcome measure The presence of NRS was assessed using a question asking whether or not the subjects usually got enough sleep. NRS was considered to be present when the subjects answered 'No'. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations of presence or absence of EX and/or PA with NRS. The OR and 95% CI of NRS prevalence were calculated and compared between those engaged in both EX and PA and the others.Results Except for 40s and 70s among males and 40s and 50s among females, the absence of EX or PA was associated with higher ORs of NRS than referent. ORs were more than twice compared with the referents in males in their 50s (OR 2.030(95% CI 1.675 to 2.459)) and 60s (OR 2.148(95% CI 1.970 to 2.343)) and females in their 60s (OR 2.142(95% CI 1.994 to 2.302)) when they engaged in neither EX nor PA.Conclusions Healthcare providers must take into account the similarities and differences in the associations of EX and/or PA with NRS by gender and age when they support people with NRS.

TI  - Laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) for the gastrointestinal tract: Updated indications
T2  - ANNALS OF GASTROENTEROLOGICAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) is a procedure combining laparoscopic gastric resection with endoscopic submucosal dissection for local resection of gastric tumors with appropriate, minimal surgical resection margins. The LECS concept was initially developed from the classical LECS procedure for gastric submucosal tumor resection. Many researchers reported that classical LECS was a safe and feasible technique for resection of gastric submucosal tumors, regardless of tumor location, including the esophagogastric junction. Recently, LECS was approved for insurance coverage by Japan's National Health Insurance plan and widely applied for gastric submucosal tumor resection. However, the limitations of classical LECS are the risk of abdominal infection, scattering of tumor cells in the abdominal cavity, and tumor cell seeding in the peritoneum. The development of modified LECS procedures, such as inverted-LECS, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery, a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with a non-exposure technique, and closed-LECS, has almost resolved these drawbacks. This has led to a recent increase in the indication of modified LECS to include patients with gastric epithelial neoplasms. The LECS concept is also beginning to be applied to tumor excision in other organs, such as the duodenum, colon and rectum. Further evolution of LECS procedures is expected in the future. Sentinel lymph node mapping could also be combined with LECS, resulting in a portion of early gastric cancers being treated by LECS with sentinel node mapping.

TI  - Bright lights in the big cities: migratory birds' exposure to artificial light
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many species of migratory birds have evolved the ability to migrate at night, and the recent and rapid expansion of artificial light at night has markedly altered the nighttime sky through which they travel. Migrating birds regularly pass through heavily illuminated landscapes, and bright lights affect avian orientation. But risks to migrating birds from artificial light are not spatially or temporally uniform, representing a challenge for mitigating potential hazards and developing action plans to catalog risks at continental scales. We leveraged over two decades of remote-sensing data collected by weather surveillance radar and satellite-based sensors to identify locations and times of year when the highest numbers of migrating birds are exposed to light pollution in the contiguous US. Our continental-scale quantification of light exposure provides a novel opportunity for dynamic and targeted conservation strategies to address the hazards posed by light pollution to nocturnally migrating birds.

TI  - MULTI-TEMPORAL MODIS FOR DETECTION AND PUBLISHED LITERATURES FOR VALIDATION OF ALGAL BLOOMS IN SABAH AND SARAWAK, MALAYSIA
T2  - JURNAL TEKNOLOGI
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal region of Sabah, Malaysia is mostly affected by harmful algal blooms (HABs) that often cause massive fish kills, and sometimes human casualties. Lack of a well-agreed, transparent and reproducible method, aperiodic nature and limited (technical) ability to monitor HAB at large regional scale, have all led to reinforced methodological improvement for bloom prediction, scientific management of coastal water resources, and regulatory attention. MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), one of the well validated ocean colour sensors, enables acquiring high spectral resolution images, with short revisit time, freely accessible, and bay-wide coverage. Yet, the relative efficiency of MODIS-derived Chl-alpha (Chlorophyll-alpha), ABI (Algal Bloom Index), and nFLH (normalized Fluorescence Line Height) have not been compared in coastal regions of Malaysia. Fifteen MODIS Level 2 images acquired between 2005 and 2013 were considered as time series data that matched HAB events mentioned in previous studies. As historical real time in-situ data collection is often difficult (inaccessible), and thus unavailable; this project had to validate results obtained from literature, assuming that in-situ, would indicate HAB location at least during MODIS acquisition dates. Variations of HAB affected areas with temporal and spatial scales derived from bloom indices are shown in colour maps. Reliability of bloom information was measured by subjectively comparing HAB results provided by indices, and previously published in-situ results. ABI outperformed Chl-a and nFLH indices based on comparisons in both normal and HAB conditions occurring in the coastal waters of Sabah and Sarawak. The configuration and reliability retrieved from MODIS-ABI allowed their application in different likely tropical region as automated HAB monitoring systems and coastal water management programmes.

TI  - Automatic building extraction from high-resolution aerial images and LiDAR data using gated residual refinement network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated extraction of buildings from remotely sensed data is important for a wide range of applications but challenging due to difficulties in extracting semantic features from complex scenes like urban areas. The recently developed fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have shown to perform well on urban object extraction because of the outstanding feature learning and end-to-end pixel labeling abilities. The commonly used feature fusion or skip-connection refine modules of FCNs often overlook the problem of feature selection and could reduce the learning efficiency of the networks. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end trainable gated residual refinement network (GRRNet) that fuses high-resolution aerial images and LiDAR point clouds for building extraction. The modified residual learning network is applied as the encoder part of GRRNet to learn multi-level features from the fusion data and a gated feature labeling (GFL) unit is introduced to reduce unnecessary feature transmission and refine classification results. The proposed model - GRRNet is tested in a publicly available dataset with urban and suburban scenes. Comparison results illustrated that GRRNet has competitive building extraction performance in comparison with other approaches. The source code of the developed GRRNet is made publicly available for studies.

TI  - Effective Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images With Multitask Driven Deep Neural Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images has widely been studied for its great significance in obtaining geographic information. Many methods based on deep learning have been tried for the task; however, there is still much to explore about designing layers or modules for remote sensing data and taking full use of the unique features of buildings like shape and boundary. In this letter, an end-to-end network architecture based on U-Net is proposed. The U-Net architecture is modified with Xception module for remote sensing images to extract effective features. Also, multitask learning is adopted to incorporate the structure information of buildings. Two standard data sets (Massachusetts building data set and Vaihingen Data set) of high-resolution remote sensing images are selected to test our model and it achieves state-of-the-art results.

TI  - Ground Deformation Analysis of Bolvadin (W. Turkey) by Means of Multi-Temporal InSAR Techniques and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface deformations were observed in Bolvadin, located in the province of Afyon (western Turkey) in the last decade which occurred without any destructive earthquakes. In this study, ground deformation of the Bolvadin region is analyzed by means of multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique with Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Sentinel-1 data acquired in ascending and descending orbits between October 2014 and October 2018 are processed with the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) open source software tools. Deformation velocity maps and line-of-sight (LOS) displacement time series are produced and compared with geology, groundwater level and the water surface area of Eber Lake nearby. Deformation velocity maps reveal significant subsidence in most of the town and surrounding regions, which is confirmed by field observations that show severe damage to the settlements and infrastructure of the town. The most severe subsidence is observed to be in the southern part of Bolvadin with rates up to 35 mm/year, which is characterized by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. Composed of slope debris/talus and conglomerate, the northeastern part of the deforming region experiences a relatively lower rate of subsidence. A strong correlation between LOS displacement time series and groundwater level exists both in the short and long term. Moreover, short term variations in LOS displacement time series also show high similarity with seasonal variations in the water surface area of Eber Lake located a few km southeast of the town. We conclude that the primary cause of subsidence is most probably the overexploitation of groundwater and hydrological changes because of (1) the strong correlation of subsidence with lithological units, (2) the similarity between deformation rate and groundwater level changes, (3) the correspondence of seasonal variations in water surface area and short-term deformation rate oscillations, and (4) the absence of InSAR velocity contrast across the active faults.

TI  - Early Melanoma Nodal Positivity and Biopsy Rates Before and After Implementation of the 7th Edition of the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i>
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE There has been a continued increase in the incidence of newly diagnosed melanomas, most of which are T1 melanomas. The associations between changes in tumor staging, implemented with the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (AJCC 7), and sentinel lymph node biopsy rates and nodal positivity rates remain to be seen.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the change that the implementation of the AJCC 7 had on staging criteria and the distribution of thin melanomas requiring nodal surgery and nodal positivity rates.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cross-sectional study from 2004 through 2013 of all adults (>= 18 years) diagnosed with a T1 (Breslow depth <= 1.0 mm) melanoma using The National Cancer Database that captures 70% of all newly diagnosed cancers from accredited Commission on Cancer organizations, including both academic and community settings. Data were analyzed in May 2017.EXPOSURES Patients were grouped together based on year of diagnosis, before and after 2009.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES To determine the sentinel lymph node biopsy rate before and after the implementation of the AJCC 7.RESULTS A total of 141 280 patients met inclusion criteria. Of 86 846 patients diagnosed from 2004 through 2009, 53.7%(49 644) were male and had a mean (SD) age of 57.7 (16.4) years. Of 54 434 patients diagnosed from 2010 through 2013, 54.3%(31 086) were male and had a mean (SD) age of 59.5 (15.9) years. After 2010, there was a 3.8% decrease in the number of nodal surgeries performed (32 485 of 86 846 patients [37.6%] vs 18 379 of 54 434 patients [33.8%]; P<.001). The nodal positivity rate decreased 1.0% from (9.8%[3166 of 86 846] to 8.8% [1618 of 54 434]) (P<.001). An increase in the proportion of T1b melanomas being evaluated, from 48.8% to 62.2%, was seen (P<.001). Of T1b melanomas that underwent nodal evaluation from 2004 through 2009, 74.0% had Clark level IV (invasion of the reticular dermis) or Clark level V (invasion of the deep, subcutaneous tissue) and 9.5% were ulcerated. From 2010 through 2013, of the T1b melanomas undergoing nodal evaluation, 82.6% had an elevated mitotic rate only, 3.7% were ulcerated, and 13.7% had both ulceration and an elevated mitotic rate.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE It appears that after the institution of AJCC 7, there was an overall decrease in the number of T1 melanomas undergoing nodal biopsy without a clinically relevant change in sentinel lymph node positivity, with an increase in the number of T1b melanomas undergoing nodal evaluation.

TI  - Modeling and Mapping Forest Fire Occurrence from Aboveground Carbon Density in Mexico
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns of fire occurrence is key for improved forest fires management, particularly under global change scenarios. Very few studies have attempted to relate satellite-based aboveground biomass maps of moderate spatial resolution to spatial fire occurrence under a variety of climatic and vegetation conditions. This study focuses on modeling and mapping fire occurrence based on fire suppression data from 2005-2015 from aboveground biomass-expressed as aboveground carbon density (AGCD)-for the main ecoregions in Mexico. Our results showed that at each ecoregion, unimodal or humped relationships were found between AGCD and fire occurrence, which might be explained by varying constraints of fuel and climate limitation to fire activity. Weibull equations successfully fitted the fire occurrence distributions from AGCD, with the lowest fit for the desert shrub-dominated north region that had the lowest number of observed fires. The models for predicting fire occurrence from AGCD were significantly different by region, with the exception of the temperate forest in the northwest and northeast regions that could be modeled with a single Weibull model. Our results suggest that AGCD could be used to estimate spatial fire occurrence maps; those estimates could be integrated into operational GIS tools for assistance in fire danger mapping and fire and fuel management decision-making. Further investigation of anthropogenic drivers of fire occurrence and fuel characteristics should be considered for improving the operational spatial planning of fire management. The modeling strategy presented here could be replicated in other countries or regions, based on remote-sensed measurements of aboveground biomass and fire activity or fire suppression records.

TI  - Environmental Surveillance for Poliovirus and Other Enteroviruses: Long-Term Experience in Moscow, Russian Federation, 2004-2017
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Polio and enterovirus surveillance may include a number of approaches, including incidence-based observation, a sentinel physician system, environmental monitoring and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. The relative value of these methods is widely debated. Here we summarized the results of 14 years of environmental surveillance at four sewage treatment plants of various capacities in Moscow, Russia. A total of 5450 samples were screened, yielding 1089 (20.0%) positive samples. There were 1168 viruses isolated including types 1-3 polioviruses (43%) and 29 different types of non-polio enteroviruses (51%). Despite using the same methodology, a significant variation in detection rates was observed between the treatment plants and within the same facility over time. The number of poliovirus isolates obtained from sewage was roughly 60 times higher than from AFP surveillance over the same time frame. All except one poliovirus isolate were Sabin-like polioviruses. The one isolate was vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 with 17.6% difference from the corresponding Sabin strain, suggesting long-term circulation outside the scope of the surveillance. For some non-polio enterovirus types (e.g., Echovirus 6) there was a good correlation between detection in sewage and incidence of clinical cases in a given year, while other types (e.g., Echovirus 30) could cause large outbreaks and be almost absent in sewage samples. Therefore, sewage monitoring can be an important part of enterovirus surveillance, but cannot substitute other approaches.

TI  - Estimation of active-passive microwave covariation using SMAP and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Active and passive microwave signals over land co-vary depending on their shared scattering and emission characteristics by soil and vegetation media. Estimates of this covariation can be used beneficially to downscale coarse-resolution brightness temperatures with high-resolution backscatter for enhanced-resolution Earth observations. In this study, a forward model of covariation for vegetated soil is derived by combining two well-established models of active and passive microwave interactions. The covariation model is inverted to obtain a single-pass observation-driven estimation of active-passive microwave covariation (beta) based on multi-channel radiometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes. A key feature of the estimation approach is that it is applicable to co-located spatial data scenes and does not rely on temporal information. We present applications of the estimation with combinations of SMAP (L-band) radiometry and both SMAP (L-band) and multi-angular Sentinel-1 (C-band) backscatter data. We first show that for the period of available SMAP L-band radiometer and radar data, the estimation approach for beta, introduced in this study, yields similar results as the statistical time-series approach originally designed for SMAP. The new single-pass approach also allows estimation of active-passive covariation where the statistical approach cannot be applied because dynamic range of brightness temperature and backscatter are too limited to allow regression. We then apply the developed estimation method to SMAP L-band radiometer and multi-angular Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data. Here, the study quantifies the effects of microwave frequency and look-angles on the covariation by applying the estimation globally and analyzing the results as a function of vegetation cover - a key determinant of the strength of the covariation.

TI  - Evaluation of Evapotranspiration over a Semiarid Region Using Multiresolution Data Sources
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is important for water management decision tools. In this study, different ET data with varying resolution, accuracy, and functionality were reviewed over a semiarid, data-sparse region in southern Iran. Study results showed that the widely used reanalysis and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets have relatively high uncertainty and underestimated ET over the sparse heterogeneous landscape. On the other hand, fine-resolution ET datasets using Landsat imagery with Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) and Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) algorithms, yielded high accuracy. Evaluation of METRIC and SEBS models in estimating seasonal crop water use showed a mean absolute error of 5% and 13%, respectively. The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CMSAF) data were used as radiation input to the models and were found to be a representative data source with daily average RMSE of 70 W m(-2). An average crop coefficient K-c was estimated for the region and was obtained as 0.77. The study proposes and applies a hybrid framework that uses reference ET from simple diagnostic models (such as the REF-ET tool) and calculates actual ET by using the satellite-derived regionally and locally representative K-c values. The ET estimates generated with the framework were regionally representative and required low computational resources. The study findings have the potential to provide practical guidance to local farmers and water managers to generate useful and usable decision-making tools, especially for ET assessments in the study region and other data-sparse areas.

TI  - Epidemiological survey of tick-borne encephalitis virus infection in wild animals on Hokkaido and Honshu islands, Japan
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first human case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Japan was recorded in southern Hokkaido in 1993 and was followed by four further cases in southern, central, and northern Hokkaido during 20162018. However, the distribution of TBE virus (TBEV) foci in Japan is unclear. Therefore, here, we serologically examined raccoons (Procyon lotor), sika deer (Cervus nippon), and wild boars (Sus scrofa) as sentinels of TBEV infection in Hokkaido and in Fukushima and Tochigi Prefectures in Honshu. A total of 1,649 serum samples collected between 2003 and 2018 were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using subviral particles and confirmed using the virus neutralization test. In raccoons, the seroprevalence of TBEV was 5.9% (39/662 samples) in central Hokkaido in 2003-2005 and 0.8% (3/368 samples) in eastern Hokkaido in 2010-2018, revealing the presence of TBEV foci in these areas. In addition, 0.5% (2/414) of deer sampled in eastern Hokkaido in 2010-2017 and 2.4% (1/42) of deer sampled in Tochigi Prefecture in 2016-2018 were seropositive. On Honshu, seropositive rodents have previously been detected only in Shimane Prefecture. Therefore, the detection of seropositive animals in Tochigi Prefecture may indicate the widespread distribution of TBEV foci throughout Japan. TBEV and viral genes were not detected in 507 ticks collected in the same area of eastern Hokkaido where seropositive animals were found, reemphasizing the value of using serological examination of wild animals as a tool for revealing unknown TBE risk areas. Our findings also indicate that raccoons may be particularly useful sentinels.

TI  - An adaptive ensemble Kalman filter for assimilation of multi-sensor, multi-modal water temperature observations into hydrodynamic model of shallow rivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is lack of knowledge in assimilation of multi-sensor, multi-modal water temperature observations into hydrodynamic models of shallow rivers, specifically, (a) how does accuracy of shallow river model improve after assimilation of in-situ and remotely sensed temperature observations, and (b) how can data from disparate sensors and sources be assimilated into the prediction model without significant increase in computational burden. Multi-sensor, multi-modal observations used in this study are obtained from in-situ monitoring devices in the river with limited spatial coverage but dense temporal resolution, and from Landsat-7 satellite that has better spatial coverage but limited temporal coverage. Use of remotely-sensed observations from satellites poses the challenge that the physical region represented by satellite data does not directly correspond with the physical domain of the river simulated in hydrodynamic models. Satellites detects the skin water temperature, whereas numerical models estimate the bulk temperature in the surface layer that may be multiple meters in thickness. Furthermore, for rivers narrower than the resolution of satellite data, the temperature of each cell represents the weighted average temperature of land and water. These factors introduce biases into the updated numerical model, thereby impeding appropriate management of temperature, water quality, and aquatic ecology. We implemented an efficient ensemble Kalman filter method using Latin-hypercube sampling to assimilate multisensor water temperature observations into the hydrodynamic model of the Lower Klamath River located in northern California. Assimilation of remote sensing data from Landsat-7 improved the model prediction for the entire river. The average spatial error was reduced from 2.59 degrees C to 0.66 degrees C (i.e., 75% improvement). In-situ data assimilation reduced the error at the observation location, however, error in the water temperature predicted by the updated model reverted in less than two days to the same level as that of an un-updated model. On the other hand, it is not computationally efficient to assimilate all of the available data into the model as they become available. In order to overcome these challenges, in-situ data were adaptively assimilated into the model whenever the error exceeded a maximum allowable error. Adaptive assimilation of in-situ data for the Lower Klamath river application occurred one to three times per day, and reduced the average daily error up to 58% compared to assimilation of in-situ data only once each day.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in clinically node-negative Merkel cell carcinoma: the Westmead Hospital experience
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive cutaneous malignancy with a propensity to metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinically node-negative MCC has been utilized to identify patients with subclinical nodal metastases. This study aims to review the accuracy of SLNB in MCC and to evaluate the impact of SLNB on management.MethodsPatients with clinically node-negative MCC who underwent SLNB were identified from a prospective database of patients treated at the Westmead Hospital, Sydney, between 1998 and 2017. Data from these patients were reviewed and analysed.ResultsForty-one patients were identified: 28 men and 13 women, median age 70years. Median duration of follow-up was 27months. Sixteen (39%) patients had a positive SLNB and all underwent nodal treatment which consisted of radiotherapy (n=13), completion lymphadenectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy (n=2), and completion lymphadenectomy alone (n=1). Following negative SLNB, 24 of 25 patients did not undergo further nodal treatment. The false-negative rate was 16% as three patients developed in-field nodal recurrence subsequent to a negative SLNB. At last follow-up, 29 patients had no evidence of disease, six were alive with disease and three had died from other causes. Three SLN-positive patients have died of MCC.ConclusionSLNB has a high rate of positivity and can improve the accuracy of staging and prognostication in MCC, and guide management. The relatively low risk of a false-negative SLNB justifies close observation in SLNB-negative patients.This study of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in 41 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) demonstrates that SLNB has a high rate of positivity and can improve the accuracy of staging and prognostication in MCC, and guide management.

TI  - Quantitative Remote Sensing Analysis of the Geomorphological Development of the Lijiang River Basin, Southern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lijiang River Basin is associated with a classic karst terrain characterized by conical hills that are referred to as karst towers. To date, few quantitative studies have been conducted on the geomorphological development of the river basin, in part, because it covers a large area of about 5800km(2), making it difficult to carry out a comprehensive quantitative analysis using traditional methods. This study using Landsat-8 OLI images and a digital elevation model firstly assesses the longitudinal profile of the Lijiang River, calculates the average bifurcation (bifurcation) ratio of the basin's drainage network, and conducts a hypsometric (elevation) analysis of the Lijiang Basin. The stage of geomorphological development is quantitatively constrained. It is concluded that the Lijiang River is currently in the old stage of geomorphological development, the stream systems in the Lijiang River Basin are in a relatively balanced developmental stage and the geomorphological development is dominated by the old-stage (monadnock) landforms.

TI  - Himawari-8/AHI and MODIS Aerosol Optical Depths in China: Evaluation and Comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geostationary earth orbit satelliteHimawari-8 loaded with the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) has greatly enhanced our capacity of dynamic monitoring in Asia-Pacific area. The Himawari-8/AHI hourly aerosol product is a promising complementary source to the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily aerosol product for near real-time air pollution observations. However, a comprehensive evaluation of AHI aerosol optical depth (AOD) is still limited, and the difference in performances of AHI and MODIS remains uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the Himawari-8/AHI Level 3 Version 3.0 and MODIS Collection 6.1 Deep Blue AOD products over China against AOD measurements from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites in a spatiotemporal comparison of the products from February 2018 to January 2019. Results showed that AHI AOD achieved a moderate agreement with AERONET with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 and a root-mean-square-error of 0.26, which was slightly inferior to MODIS. The retrieval accuracy was spatially and temporally varied in AHI AOD, with higher accuracies for XiangHe and Lulin sites as well as in the morning and during the summer. The dependency analysis further revealed that the bias in AHI AOD was strongly dependent on aerosol loading and influenced by the angstrom ngstrom Exponent and NDVI while those for MODIS appeared to be independent of all variables. Fortunately, the biases in AHI AOD could be rectified using a random forest model that contained the appropriate variables to produce sufficiently accurate results with cross-validation R of 0.92 and RMSE of 0.15. With these adjustments, AHI AOD will continue to have great potential in characterizing precise dynamic aerosol variations and air quality at a fine temporal resolution.

TI  - Geometric Processing and Accuracy Verification of Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The second batch of Zhuhai-1 microsatellites was successfully launched on 26 April 2018. The batch included four Orbita hyperspectral satellites (referred to as OHS-A, OHS-B, OHS-C, and OHS-D) and one video satellite (OVS-2A), which have excellent hyperspectral data acquisition abilities. For the first time in China, a number of hyperspectral satellite networks have been realized. To ensure the application of hyperspectral remote sensing data, a series of on-orbit geometry processing and accuracy verification studies has been carried out on the Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral camera since the satellite was launched. This paper presents the geometric processing methods involved in the production of Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral satellite basic products, including geometric calibration and basic product production algorithms. The OHS images were used to perform on-orbit geometric calibration, and the calibration accuracy was better than 0.5 pixels. The registration accuracy of the image spectrum of the basic product after calibration, the single orientation accuracy, and the accuracy of the regional network adjustment were evaluated. The spectral registration accuracy of the OHS basic products is 0.3-0.5 pixels, which is equivalent to the spectral band calibration accuracy. The single orientation accuracy is better than 1.5 pixels and the regional network adjustment accuracy is better than 1.2 pixels. The generated area orthoimages meet the seamless edge requirements, which verifies that the OHS basic product image has good regional mapping capabilities and can meet the application requirements.

TI  - Selection of Informative Spectral Bands for PLS Models to Estimate Foliar Chlorophyll Content Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Partial least-squares (PLS) regression is a popular method for modeling chemical constituents from spectroscopic data and has been widely applied to retrieve leaf chemical components via hyperspectral remote sensing. However, one persistent challenge for applying the PLS regression is the selection of informative spectral bands among the vast array of acquired spectra. No consensus has been reached yet on how to select informative bands regardless of many techniques being proposed. In this paper, we have composited four individual data sets containing a total of 598 leaf samples from various species to evaluate four different band elimination/selection methods. Results revealed that the stepwise-PLS approach was optimal to estimate leaf chlorophyll content even under different spectral resolutions, from which informative bands were identified. Informative bands, in general, include bands inside the near-infrared (NIR), and in addition, one within the blue range and one within the red range. With such combinations, the PLS regression models meet the requirement for accurate leaf chlorophyll estimation. For most PLS regression models, their accuracies decreased with the reduction of spectral resolution, but the stepwise-PLS approach could consistently estimate the chlorophyll content at different spectral resolutions (with R-2 >= 0.77 for resolutions < 20 nm). The findings, hence, provide valuable insights for selecting informative spectral bands for PLS analysis and lay a strong foundation for retrieving foliar biochemical content using hyperspectral remote sensing data.

TI  - Retrospectively validating the results of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial in a large Asian Z0011-eligible cohort
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The Z0011 trial demonstrated that axillary dissection (ALND) could be omitted during breast-conserving therapy for cT1-2N0 breast cancers with 1-2 metastatic SLNs. However, that result has not been validated in a larger cohort and the significance of the small number of SLNs remains unclear. This study aimed to validate the Z0011 results within an Asian Z0011-eligible cohort and determine whether the number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) influenced the Z0011-based outcomes.Methods Data from Asian patients who fulfilled the Z0011 criteria were collected from five hospitals. Disease recurrence (DR) was compared between patients who underwent ALND or SLN dissection (SLND) alone. Propensity-score matching was performed to reduce the effects of potential selection biases.Results During 2010-2016, 1750 Asian patients had 1-2 SLN metastases and fulfilled the Z0011 criteria. These patients included 707 cases treated using SLND alone (40%) and 967 patients with <= 2 SLNs (55%). Ninety-five patients (5.4%) experienced DR at a median interval of 50 months, although the rates of DR were similar in the ALND and SLND groups. The adjusted hazard ratios for DR after ALND omission were 0.95 (95% CI 0.55-1.64) among the entire cohort and 0.83 (95% CI 0.34-2.03) among patients with <= 2 SLNs.Conclusions In this Asian Z0011-eligible cohort, ALND omission did not increase risk of DR, even among patients with <= 2 SLNs. Therefore, the Z0011 strategy might be safely applied in Asia, and a small number of SLNs did not significantly influence this strategy.

TI  - Algorithms Merging for the Determination of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration in the Black Sea
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two regional bio-optical algorithms are combined to retrieve the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in the Black Sea. The first is a band-ratio algorithm that computes Chl-a as a function of the slope of Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-RS) values at two wavelengths using a polynomial regression that captures the overall data trend, enhancing extrapolation results. The second algorithm is a Multilayer Perceptron neural net based on Rgs values at three individual wavelengths that features interpolation capabilities helpful to fit data non-linearities. A new merging scheme is then designed to benefit from the complementarity of the two approaches. Remote sensing data employed to demonstrate the merging of regional results for the Black Sea are those acquired by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument on board Sentinel-3A to acknowledge the need for data products of higher accuracy within the long-term Copernicus program.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Consistency among Different Remote-Sensing Land Cover Datasets: A Case Study in Northern Laos
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparisons of the accuracy and consistency of different remote-sensing land cover datasets are important for the rational application of multi-source land cover datasets to regional development, or to studies of global or local environmental change. Existing comparisons of accuracy or spatial consistency among land cover datasets primarily use confusion or transfer matrices and focus on the type and area consistency of land cover. However, less attention has been paid to the consistency of spatial patterns, and quantitative analyses of spatial pattern consistency are rare. However, when proportions of land cover types are similar, spatial patterns are essential for studies of the ecological functions of a landscape system. In this study, we used classical landscape indices that quantifies spatial patterns to analyze the spatial pattern consistency among different land cover datasets, and chose three datasets (GlobeLand30-2010, FROM-GLC2010, and SERVIR MEKONG2010) in northern Laos as a case study. We also analyzed spatial pattern consistency at different scales after comparing the landscape indices method with the confusion matrix method. We found that the degree of consistency between GlobeLand30-2010 and SERVIR MEKONG2010 was higher than that of GlobeLand30-2010 and FROM-GLC2010, FROM-GLC2010, and SERVIR MEKONG2010 based on the confusion matrix, mainly because of the best forest consistency and then water. However, the spatial consistency results of the landscape indices analysis show that the three datasets have large differences in the number of patches (NP), patch density (PD), and landscape shape index (LSI) at the original scale of 30 m, and decrease with the increase of the scale. Meanwhile, the aggregation index (AI) shows different changes, such as the changing trend of the forest aggregation index increasing with the scale. Our results suggested that, when using or producing land cover datasets, it is necessary not only to ensure the consistency of landscape types and areas, but also to ensure that differences among spatial patterns are minimized, especially those exacerbated by scale. Attention to these factors will avoid larger deviations and even erroneous conclusions from these data products.

TI  - Effect of preoperative injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles on rates of sentinel lymph node dissection in women undergoing surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (SentiNot study)
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: One-fifth of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have invasive breast cancer (IBC) on definitive histology. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is performed in almost half of women having surgery for DCIS in Sweden. The aim of the present study was to try to minimize unnecessary SLND by injecting superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles at the time of primary breast surgery, enabling SLND to be performed later, if IBC is found in the primary specimen.Methods: Women with DCIS at high risk for the presence of invasion undergoing breast conservation, and patients with DCIS undergoing mastectomy were included. The primary outcome was whether this technique could reduce SLND. Secondary outcomes were number of SLNDs avoided, detection rate and procedure-related costs.Results: This was a preplanned interim analysis of 189 procedures. IBC was found in 47 and a secondary SLND was performed in 41 women. Thus, 78.3 per cent of patients avoided SLND (P<0.001). At reoperation, SPIO plus blue dye outperformed isotope and blue dye in detection of the sentinel node (40 of 40 versus 26 of 40 women; P<0.001). Costs were reduced by a mean of 24.5 per cent in women without IBC (3990 versus 5286; P<0.001).Conclusion: Marking the sentinel node with SPIO in women having surgery for DCIS was effective at avoiding unnecessary SLND in this study.

TI  - Relationships between Satellite-Based Spectral Burned Ratios and Terrestrial Laser Scanning
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional point data acquired by Terrestrial Lidar Scanning (TLS) is used as ground observation in comparisons with fire severity indices computed from Landsat satellite multi-temporal images through Google Earth Engine (GEE). Forest fires are measured by the extent and severity of fire. Current methods of assessing fire severity are limited to on-site visual inspection or the use of satellite and aerial images to quantify severity over larger areas. On the ground, assessment of fire severity is influenced by the observers' knowledge of the local ecosystem and ability to accurately assess several forest structure measurements. The objective of this study is to introduce TLS to validate spectral burned ratios obtained from Landsat images. The spectral change was obtained by an image compositing technique through GEE. The 32 plots were collected using TLS in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. TLS-generated 3D points were converted to voxels and the counted voxels were compared in four height strata. There was a negative linear relationship between spectral indices and counted voxels in the height strata between 1 to 5 m to produce R-2 value of 0.45 and 0.47 for unburned plots and a non-linear relationship in the height strata between 0 to 0.5m for burned plots to produce R-2 value of 0.56 and 0.59. Shrub or stand development was related with the spectral indices at unburned plots, and vegetation recovery in the ground surface was related at burned plots. As TLS systems become more cost efficient and portable, techniques used in this study will be useful to produce objective assessments of structure measurements for fire refugia and ecological response after a fire. TLS is especially useful for the quick ground assessments which are needed for forest fire applications.

TI  - Assessment of foliar dust using Hyperion and Landsat satellite imagery for mine environmental monitoring in an open cast iron ore mining areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The scope of this paper is to estimate foliar dust concentration using Hyperion (Narrow-bands data) and Landsat (Broad-bands data) images, with the aid of eight different vegetation indices (VIs) and fieldbased laboratory spectra. A PCE Instrument for measurement of dust accumulation on leaves and Spectroradiometer for spectral signatures, was also used to estimate foliar dust concentration. The result depicted a negative relationship between VIs (Hyperion and Landsat satellite imagery), and field based dust measurements. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) shows an excellent negative correlation (R-2 = 0.89 for Hyperion and R-2 = 0.81 for Landsat) as it is not much affected by the variation in vegetation types and patterns. Amongst the eight VIs, NDVI was selected as an optimal VI (RMSE = 0.06 g/m(2) for Hyperion and 0.11 g/m(2) for Landsat) based on both, the field measurement and satellite data for estimation of foliar dust concentration. Furthermore, a positive relationship between the field-based measured dust concentration (g/m(2)) and satellite image (by VIs) based dust concentration (g/m(2)) was observed. Field-based measured foliar dust concentration taken for 20 samples was plotted against their estimated dust values using the NDVI (R = 0.90 for Hyperion and R = 0.81 for Landsat). Hyperion data is considered as the reliable one as it gave better results than the Landsat data. Finally, the Hyperion data based foliar dust map was analyzed by a High-resolution Google Earth image (Geo Eye) for different locations viz., mines, transport sites as well as forests and matched with the field-based measured dust concentration. The result shows that maximum foliar dust was concentrated near the ore transportation network, surrounding mining locations, tailing ponds, and mining dumps areas. For making the environmental management effective (in the mining and allied areas), Hyperspectral remote sensing aided by field-based methods, for estimating foliar dust concentration would be very helpful.

TI  - Prospective validation of the prognostic 31-gene expression profiling test in primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Gene expression profiling (GEP) has been integrated into cancer treatment decision-making in multiple neoplasms. We prospectively evaluated the prognostic utility of the 31-GEP test (DecisionDx-Melanoma, Castle Biosciences, Inc) in cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy (SNB). Methods One hundred fifty-nine patients (age 26-88) diagnosed with melanoma between 01/2013 and 8/2015 underwent SNB and concurrent GEP testing. GEP results were reported as low-risk Class 1 (subclasses 1A and 1B) or high-risk Class 2 (subclasses 2A and 2B). Statistical analyses were performed with chi-square analysis, t tests, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard models. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Results Median follow-up was 44.9 months for event-free cases. Median Breslow thickness was 1.4 mm (0.2-15.0 mm). There were 117 Class 1 and 42 Class 2 patients. Gender, age, Breslow thickness, ulceration, SNB positivity, and AJCC stage were significantly associated with GEP classification (P 0.05 for all). Recurrence and distant metastasis rates were 5% and 1% for Class 1 patients compared with 55% and 36% for Class 2 patients. Sensitivities of Class 2 and SNB for recurrence were 79% and 34%, respectively. Of 10 SNB-positive/Class 2 patients, 9 recurred. By multivariate analysis, only SNB result and GEP class were statistically associated with both RFS (P = 0.008 and 0.0001) and DMFS (P = 0.019 and 0.001). Conclusions Gene expression profiling Class 2 result and SNB positivity were independently associated with recurrence and distant metastasis in primary CM patients. GEP testing may have additive prognostic utility in initial staging work-up of these patients.

T2  - POLICY FUTURES IN EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers the Sami understanding of time and place in pedagogical settings. The study is based on research material gathered at Sami schools and from teaching conducted in the Sami language. These data were combined to develop a theoretical review of teacher education from a metatheoretical perspective. The research challenges schools' pedagogical arrangements. Local contents of the study are an important part of the school syllabus, and this article suggests that they are closely tied to school educational arrangements. This study also suggests that, in Northern schools, the Sami worldview and traditional knowledge should be closely connected to school practices. This means that the Sami understanding of time and place should receive sufficient emphasis in school curricula. Schools could benefit from the open learning concept, such as modern curricula grounded in teaching that is phenomenon based. This could increase pupils' motivation and sense of connection to the local area. With mediating structures - connected to multicultural educational contexts - such educational systems could be developed.

TI  - Risk Information Seeking and Processing About Particulate Air Pollution in South Korea: The Roles of Cultural Worldview
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study integrates cultural theory of risk into the risk information seeking and processing model in the context of particulate air pollution in South Korea. Specifically, it examines how cultural worldviews (hierarchy, individualism, egalitarianism, and fatalism) influence the way people interpret risk about an environmental risk, which may in turn promote or deter their information seeking and processing about the risk. An online survey (N = 645) showed that egalitarianism was positively associated with perceptions of societal and personal risks, affective responses toward the risk, and informational subjective norms. Perceived societal risk, in particular, mediated the effect of egalitarianism on information insufficiency. Moreover, cultural worldview was a significant moderator of the relationships between information insufficiency and risk information seeking and processing. The positive relationship between information insufficiency and information seeking grew stronger with increasing egalitarianism. In contrast, the negative relationship between information insufficiency and heuristic processing was strengthened with increasing hierarchy. This study extends prior theories and models in risk communication by addressing the roles of cultural worldview, an important individual difference factor in interpreting environmental risks.

TI  - A Comparison Between Major Artificial Intelligence Models for Crop Yield Prediction: Case Study of the Midwestern United States, 2006-2015
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper compares different artificial intelligence (AI) models in order to develop the best crop yield prediction model for the Midwestern United States (US). Through experiments to examine the effects of phenology using three different periods, we selected the July-August (JA) database as the best months to predict corn and soybean yields. Six different AI models for crop yield prediction are tested in this research. Then, a comprehensive and objective comparison is conducted between the AI models. Particularly for the deep neural network (DNN) model, we performed an optimization process to ensure the best configurations for the layer structure, cost function, optimizer, activation function, and drop-out ratio. In terms of mean absolute error (MAE), our DNN model with the JA database was approximately 21-33% and 17-22% more accurate for corn and soybean yields, respectively, than the other five AI models. This indicates that corn and soybean yields for a given year can be forecasted in advance, at the beginning of September, approximately a month or more ahead of harvesting time. A combination of the optimized DNN model and spatial statistical methods should be investigated in future work, to mitigate partly clustered errors in some regions.

TI  - InSAR and seismic analyses of the 2014-15 earthquake sequence near Bushkan, Iran: shallow faulting in the core of an anticline fold
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - From 2014 December 30 to 2015 January 10, a moderate earthquake sequence shook the region 25 km southeast of the village of Bushkan within the central Zagros Mountains, Iran. The Bushkan earthquakes produced only light damage and had teleseismic magnitudes in the range of m(b) 3.9-to-5.3 (United States Geologic Survey, USGS). The first and largest event produced a clear interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) signal and several other events excited seismic signals that were well observed at regional and teleseismic distances. Sentinel-1 InSAR observations sampled the region several times during the sequence and indicate that a majority of the deformation was caused by the MW 5.1 (Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalogue, GCMT) event that occurred on 2014 December 30. We resolve an oblique-slip reverse fault plane dipping steeply to the northeast that is consistent with GCMT and Iranian Seismological Centre (IRSC) moment tensor solutions. Although the depth extent of the slip is difficult to resolve from InSAR data alone, weak but clear teleseismic P waveforms suggest a shallow centroid depth that helps bound the InSAR constraints. Combined, the observations suggest that the Bushkan earthquakes result from high-angle reverse faulting with a small right-lateral strike-slip component within the sedimentary section of the central Zagros. The shallow depth of roughly 5 km and steep fault reveal seismogenic deformation near the northwest tip of a large, well-developed anticline, possibly indicating a response to deformation within the core of this feature. More generally, the observations illuminate the opportunities provided by the joint analysis of satellite and seismic observations from even modest-magnitude, shallow (less than 10 km depth) earthquakes. Future, routine modelling of such events could help integrate geophysical analyses with smaller-scale tectonic investigations, which are important to understanding the development and evolution of significant geologic structures.

TI  - Range-wide spatial mapping reveals convergent character displacement of bird song
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-held view in evolutionary biology is that character displacement generates divergent phenotypes in closely related coexisting species to avoid the costs of hybridization or ecological competition, whereas an alternative possibility is that signals of dominance or aggression may instead converge to facilitate coexistence among ecological competitors. Although this counterintuitive process-termed convergent agonistic character displacement-is supported by recent theoretical and empirical studies, the extent to which it drives spatial patterns of trait evolution at continental scales remains unclear. By modelling the variation in song structure of two ecologically similar species of Hypocnemis antbird across western Amazonia, we show that their territorial signals converge such that trait similarity peaks in the sympatric zone, where intense interspecific territoriality between these taxa has previously been demonstrated. We also use remote sensing data to show that signal convergence is not explained by environmental gradients and is thus unlikely to evolve by sensory drive (i.e. acoustic adaptation to the sound transmission properties of habitats). Our results suggest that agonistic character displacement driven by interspecific competition can generate spatial patterns opposite to those predicted by classic character displacement theory, and highlight the potential role of social selection in shaping geographical variation in signal phenotypes of ecological competitors.

T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by single or recurrent episodes of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and widespread microvascular thrombosis, which causes significant morbidity and mortality unless promptly recognized and treated. The underlying pathogenesis is a defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF) cleaving protease, called "A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Type 1 Repeats 13 (ADAMTS-13)". There are 2 forms: congenital TTP (ADAMTS-13 gene mutations) and acquired TTP (autoantibodies and ADAMTS-13 deficiency). We presented two patients who initially presented with thrombotic microangiopathy and were later diagnosed with TTP upon demonstration of the deficiency in ADAMTS-13 activity.

TI  - Update Breast Cancer 2019 Part 3-Current Developments in Early Breast Cancer: Review and Critical Assessment by an International Expert Panel
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment of breast cancer patients in a curative situation is special in many ways. The local therapy with surgery and radiation therapy is a central aspect of the treatment. The complete elimination of tumour cells at the site of the primary disease must be ensured while simultaneously striving to keep the long-term effects as minor as possible. There is still focus on the continued reduction of the invasiveness of local therapy. With regard to systemic therapy, chemotherapies with taxanes, anthracyclines and, in some cases, platinum-based chemotherapies have become established in the past couple of decades. The context for use is being continually further defined. Likewise, there are questions in the case of antihormonal therapy which also still need to be further defined following the introduction of aromatase inhibitors, such as the length of therapy or ovarian suppression in premenopausal patients. Finally, personalisation of the treatment of early breast cancer patients is also being increasingly used. Prognostic tests could potentially support therapeutic decisions. It must also be considered how the possible use of new therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors could look in practice once study results in this regard are available. This overview addresses the backgrounds on the current votes taken by the international St. Gallen panel of experts in Vienna in 2019 for current questions in the treatment of breast cancer patients in a curative situation.

TI  - The reception of Haeckel in pre-revolutionary Russia and his impact on evolutionary theory
T2  - THEORY IN BIOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The German Darwin Ernst Haeckel was influential not only in Germany, but in non-German-speaking countries as well. Due to the widespread use of German as a language of science in the Russian Empire along with growing Russian-German links in various scientific fields, Haeckel directly and indirectly influenced Russian intellectual landscape. The objective of the present paper is to investigate Haeckel's impact on Russian biology before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. We outline the transfer of Haeckelian ideas to Russia and its adaptation to a national research tradition. Haeckel's ideas influenced the most crucial Russian evolutionists such as brothers Alexander and Vladimir Kovalevsky, Ilya (Elias) Metschnikoff, Mikhail Menzbier (Menzbir), Karl Kessler, Andrei Famintzyn, and Konstantin Mereschkowsky. At the same time, Haeckel's speculative hypotheses and his attempts to convert Darwinism into a universal worldview by promoting monism found little support in biological circles of Russia. Russian biology grew as an empirical science having weak connections to romantic philosophy as German biology did. This, among others, explains the acceptance of Haeckel as a biologist and the rejection of Haeckel as a philosopher by crucial Russian evolutionists.

TI  - Quantitative Aerosol Optical Depth Detection during Dust Outbreaks from Meteosat Imagery Using an Artificial Neural Network Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the development of an artificial neural network (ANN) model to quantitatively estimate the atmospheric aerosol load (in terms of aerosol optical depth, AOD), with an emphasis on dust, over the Mediterranean basin using images from Meteosat satellites as initial information. More specifically, a back-propagation ANN model scheme was developed to estimate visible (at 550 nm) aerosol optical depth (AOD(550 nm)) values at equal temporal (15 min) and spatial (4 km) resolutions with Meteosat imagery. Accuracy of the ANN model was thoroughly tested by comparing model estimations with ground-based AOD(550 nm) measurements from 14 AERONET (Aerosol Robotic NETwork) stations over the Mediterranean for 34 selected days in which significant dust loads were recorded over the Mediterranean basin. Using a testbed of 3076 pairs of modeled and measured AOD(550 nm) values, a Pearson correlation coefficient (r(P)) equal to 0.91 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.031 were found, proving the satisfactory accuracy of the developed model for estimating AOD(550 nm) values.

TI  - The incidence, aetiology, and adverse clinical consequences of less severe diarrhoeal episodes among infants and children residing in low-income and middle-income countries: a 12-month case-control study as a follow-on to the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS)
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of illness and death among children younger than 5 years in low-income and middle-income countries. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) has described the incidence, aetiology, and sequelae of medically attended moderate-to-severe diarrhoea (MSD) among children aged 0-59 months residing in censused populations in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where most child deaths occur. To further characterise this disease burden and guide interventions, we extended this study to include children with episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD) seeking care at health centres serving six GEMS sites.Methods We report a 1-year, multisite, age-stratified, matched case-control study following on to the GEMS study. Six sites (Bamako, Mali; Manhica, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan) participated in this study. Children aged 0-59 months at each site who sought care at a sentinel hospital or health centre during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhoea. New (onset after 0 diarrhoeafree days) and acute (onset within the previous 7 days) episodes of diarrhoea in children who had sunken eyes, whose skin lost turgor, who received intravenous hydration, who had dysentery, or who were hospitalised were eligible for inclusion as MSD. The remaining new and acute diarrhoea episodes among children who sought care at the same health centres were considered LSD. We aimed to enrol the first eight or nine eligible children with MSD and LSD at each site during each fortnight in three age strata: infants (aged 0-11 months), toddlers (aged 12-23 months), and young children (aged 24-59 months). For each included case of MSD or LSD, we enrolled one to three community control children without diarrhoea during the previous 7 days. From patients and controls we collected clinical and epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, and faecal samples to identify enteropathogens at enrolment, and we performed a follow-up home visit about 60 days later to ascertain vital status, clinical outcome, and interval growth. Primary outcomes were to characterise, for MSD and LSD, the pathogen-specific attributable risk and population-based incidence values, and to assess the frequency of adverse clinical consequences associated with these two diarrhoeal syndromes.Findings From Oct 31, 2011, to Nov 14, 2012, we recruited 2368 children with MSD, 3174 with LSD, and one to three randomly selected community control children without diarrhoea matched to cases with MSD (n=3597) or LSD (n=4236). Weighted adjusted population attributable fractions showed that most attributable cases of MSD and LSD were due to rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, enterotoxigenic Escherichia colt encoding heat-stable toxin (with or without genes encoding heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella spp. The attributable incidence per 100 child-years for LSD versus MSD, by age stratum, for rotavirus was 22.3 versus 5.5 (0-11 months), 9.8 versus 2.9 (12-23 months), and 0.5 versus 0.2 (24-59 months); for Cryptosporidium spp was 3.6 versus 2.3 (0-11 months), 4.3 versus 0.6 (12-23 months), and 0.3 versus 0.1 (24-59 months); for enterotoxigenic E coli encoding heat-stable toxin was 4. 2 versus 0.1 (0-11 months), 5.2 versus 0.0 (12-23 months), and 1.1 versus 0.2 (24-59 months); and for Shigella spp was 1.0 versus 1.3 (0-11 months), 3.1 versus 2.4 (12-23 months), and 0.8 versus 0.7 (24-59 months). Participants with both MSD and LSD had significantly more linear growth faltering than controls at follow-up.Interpretation Inclusion of participants with LSD markedly expands the population of children who experience adverse clinical and nutritional outcomes from acute diarrhoeal diseases. Since MSD and LSD have similar aetiologies, interventions targeting rotavirus, Shigella spp, enterotoxigenic E coli producing heat-stable toxin, and Cryptosporidium spp might substantially reduce the diarrhoeal disease burden and its associated nutritional faltering.

TI  - Impact of Sentinel Node Approach in Gynecologic Cancer on Training Needs
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: We sought to estimate the impact of sentinel nodes in gynecologic oncology on fellowship training and discuss potential solutions.Design: Retrospective multi-institution cohort (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting: Three tertiary cancer referral cancer centers.Patients: Patients with endometrial and vulvar cancer undergoing lymph node evaluation.Interventions: Patient history and fellow case volumes were evaluated retrospectively for type of lymph node assessment.Measurements and Main Results: Minimally invasive endometrial cancer and vulvar cancer fellow case volumes in 3 large institutions were reviewed and average annual volumes calculated for each clinical gynecologic oncology fellow. For vulvar cancer, probabilities of sentinel lymph node mapping and laterality of lesions were estimated from the literature. For endometrial cancer, estimates of lymphadenectomy rates were determined using probabilities calculated from our historic database and from review of the literature. Modeling the approaches to lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer (full, selective, and sentinel), 100% versus 68% versus 24%, respectively, of patients would require complete pelvic lymphadenectomy and 100% versus 34% versus 12% would require para-aortic lymphadenectomy. In vulvar cancer, rates of inguinal femoral lymphadenectomy are expected to drop from 81% of unilateral groins to only 12% of groins.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial and vulvar cancer will play an increasing role in practice, and coincident with this will be a dramatic decrease in pelvic, para-aortic, and inguinal femoral lymphadenectomies. The declining numbers will require new strategies to maintain competency in our specialty. New approaches to surgical training and continued medical education will be necessary to ensure adequate training for fellows and young faculty across gynecologic surgery. (C) 2018 AAGL.

TI  - Morphological and Chronological Mapping of Manilius Crater Region Using Chandrayaan-1 Data Sets
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-resolution morphological mapping aided by ortho-images and digital elevation model from Chandrayaan-1 Terrain Mapping Camera and 3D GIS visualization has revealed scientifically diverse characteristics of lunar surface features, due to unique topographical significance of morphological features, i.e., highlands, basaltic plains and craters, which are very well manifested in 3D GIS environment. The distribution of various morphological features provides insights into the sequential evolution and surface process of the study area. The highland region represented by the Fra Mauro formation in the study area exhibits high albedo with distinct topography. The northern part of the study area falls in the southern part of major basin Serenitatis, and exhibits the dark mantling material with low albedo. The morphological features, i.e., wrinkle ridges and rilles, indicate volcanic flow events consequence to the loading of basaltic materials in the interior of the Serenitatis and Imbrium Basins and related extensional failure. The Manilius crater, which occupies the central part of the study area, is a complex crater with a central peak and asymmetric ejecta deposit. The ages of the major surficial features were determined based on size, frequency and distribution pattern of craters using crater size-frequency distribution model. Age of the Fra Mauro highland, Manilius crater, Mare Serenitatis and Mare Vaporum is, respectively, 3.9, 3.5, 2.8 and 1.7Gayears, indicating that the lunar surface of this region evolved in Imbrian to Eratosthenian age of lunar selenological timescale.

TI  - Impact of HER2 receptor status on axillary nodal burden in patients with non-luminal A invasive ductal breast carcinoma
T2  - REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women. Aim: To assess the impact of HER2 status on axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST) both at diagnosis and during the 4-year postoperative period. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively included 375 women with an early clinical stage of non-luminal IDC-NST who between 2007 and 2013 underwent breast surgery at a clinical hospital. They were divided into phenotype-based groups: HR+HER2-, HR+HER2+, HR-HER2+ and HR-HER2-. Only patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) macrometastases underwent ALN dissection. If > 3 ALNs were positive, radiotherapy was delivered. All patients were treated with chemotherapy, HER2+ BC patients received trastuzumab, and hormone receptor (HR)-positive BC patients received hormonal therapy. Results: Larger tumor size, higher grade, HR+, HER2+ status, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were predictive for ALN metastases at diagnosis. The poorest overall, disease-free, and distant recurrence-free survival (OS, DFS, DRFS) were found in the HR-HER2- group, while the poorest locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was observed in HR-HER2+ and HR-HER2- groups. HER2 status was not predictor of survival. Conclusions: HER2+ status was predictive for ALN involvement at diagnosis but had no effect on 4-year LRFS in these patients.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL LABORATORY ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Bone marrow (BM) study plays an important role as initial investigation specimen of lymphoma as well as staging lymphoma. This study aimed to investigate the utility of BM studies for classification of lymphoma and evaluate features of BM involvement by lymphoma over a period of 11 years. Methods A total of 1162 cases of BM studies for lymphoma evaluation were reviewed for the incidence of lymphoma subtypes, the percentage of marrow involvement, the pattern of involvement and discordance with histopathologic diagnoses of lymph nodes and other tissues. Results A total of 255 of 1162 cases underwent BM study without pathologic information, and 108 cases show lymphoma involvement. Lymph node biopsy underwent in 66 cases, and 10 cases show discordant result between BM and lymph node biopsy. Seven discordant cases were due to insufficient further studies. Lymphoma was diagnosed only by BM study in 38 cases. Abnormal lymphocytes were found in BM aspiration in 34 cases. Also, abnormal clonal lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry in 26 cases. Four cases showed disease-related chromosomal abnormalities. FISH analysis detected abnormal findings in two cases, however, discordant with other additional studies. Conclusions Discrepancies between the BM study and lymph node biopsy were due to insufficient further study and discordance of immunohistochemical stain result. BM study can be utilized as initial diagnosis of lymphoma by the combination of morphological feature, involvement pattern, and additional tests such as flow cytometry, chromosomal analysis, and FISH analysis. Thus, BM study with further analysis is an essential choice when lymph node biopsies are unavailable.

TI  - Self-Entrainment Motion of a Slow-Moving Landslide Inferred From Landsat-8 Time Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountainous environments, slow-moving landslides (velocities <100m/year) are a major concern for local populations. Rainfall is often the dominant forcing, and often result in major changes in kinematics which can mask smaller signals related to internal forcings. We focus here on a major (>40Mm(3)) slow-moving landslide in the desert of southern Peru and take advantage of this arid environment to study the internal processes affecting landslide kinematics. We first estimate the ground displacement from time series analysis of Landsat-8 images, spanning a 5.7-year period. Systematic artifacts in the optical time series are shown to correlate with topography, as well as vary seasonally. We apply a novel procedure for correcting these artifacts, which significantly reduces noise in the resulting time series, thereby allowing us to precisely resolve landslide displacements. We find landslide velocities of up to 35m/year, with complex nonlinear interannual pattern, including a period of rapid acceleration. We validate our optically derived time series using Global Navigation Satellite System field measurements and find uncertainties (root-mean-square error) on the moving mass of 1.12 to 1.55m. Sudden acceleration of the landslide body after March 2016 may originate from a mass collapse due to retrogression of the headscarp. By coupling sparse 3-D Global Navigation Satellite System measurements with dense 2-D optical time series data, we show that the headscarp retrogression acts like a wedge, resulting in domino-like tilting of the downward blocks, and accelerates basal sliding over 2years. These observations reveal that the dynamics of this retrogressive landslide are predominantly controlled by sediment supply and that succession of retrogressive and advancing motions is a self-entrainment process.

TI  - Feeding home ranges of pacific coast feeding group gray whales
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a lack of detailed information about the range and habitat use of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) during their seasonal occupation off the Pacific Northwest (PNW) coast from northern California to southeast Alaska, USA. These data are important for management because of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., indigenous harvesting, fishing gear entanglements, ship strikes, naval exercises, siting of marine renewable energy facilities). We applied satellite tags to 35 gray whales in the eastern north Pacific (ENP) off the coasts of Oregon and northern California from September to December 2009, 2012, and 2013. These whales are members of the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a subset of gray whales in the ENP that feed off the PNW, during summer and fall. Tracking periods for the satellite-tagged whales in this study ranged from 3 days to 383 days. We applied a Bayesian switching state-space model (SSSM) to locations for each whale track to provide a regularized track with 2 estimated locations per day and associated movement behavior (either transiting or area-restricted searching [ARS]). We isolated the portion of the SSSM track in the feeding area for each whale by removing all southward and northward migration locations. We calculated home ranges (90% isopleths) and core areas (50% isopleths) for these non-migrating, feeding-area tracks with >50 SSSM locations using local convex hull utilization distributions. Feeding-area home ranges for the resulting 23 whales covered most of the near-shore waters from northern California to Icy Bay, Alaska, and ranged in size from 81 km(2) to 13,634 km(2). Core areas varied widely in size (11-3,976 km(2)) and location between individuals, with the highest-use areas off Point St. George in northern California, the central coast of Oregon, and the southern coast of Washington, USA. Nearshore waters off Point St. George were a hot spot for whales in the PCFG in late fall, close to where most of the whales were tagged; 19 whales had overlapping home ranges and 15 whales had overlapping core areas there. One whale, a male tracked for 383 days, did not migrate, spending the entire winter off Point St. George and the California-Oregon border. Residence times (portions of the track with a minimum of 3 successive locations in ARS behavioral mode) ranged from 1 day to 142.5 days; 19 whales had residencies >30 days in some areas. Because most of the whales in this study were tagged in the fall in the southern portion of the feeding area, off northern California, results are weighted toward fall and winter movements. Although some whales were tracked into the spring and summer, additional tagging earlier in the year and in more northerly locations would provide an even clearer picture of gray whale use of feeding areas in the PNW. Nevertheless, these results constitute valuable information about high-use areas for gray whales in this region, providing baseline home range data for future comparisons with regard to year-to-year variability, potential responses to climate change, and exposure to anthropogenic activities in the marine environment.

T2  - OPTOELECTRONICS INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A nonparametric algorithm of automatic classification of large arrays of statistical data is considered. Its synthesis is based on decomposition of initial data. The results of decomposition form a set of centers of multidimensional intervals and the corresponding frequencies of occurrence of values of random variables. Based on information obtained, classes corresponding to single-mode fragments of the probability density of features of examined objects are detected. The spatial interpretation of automatic classification results is analyzed. The nonparametric algorithms developed in the study are important tools of processing of data obtained by remote sensing of natural resources.

TI  - Advances in phenology are conserved across scale in present and future climates
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Warming temperatures are advancing the timing of seasonal vegetation development in the extratropics, altering plant-animal interactions and increasing the risk of trophic asynchrony. Forest understories are critical yet under-observed ecosystems in which phenological patterns are both altered and obscured by overstory trees. We address the challenge of observing phenological dynamics in the understory by exploiting the physiological relationship between plant phenology and temperature accumulation, a horticultural principle we show to be preserved across spatial scales through a combination of field and growth-chamber observations. These observations provide the foundation for a spaceborne thermal-observation framework, which can trace the discrete phenophases of forest understory plants in near-real time. The thermal basis of this framework also enables the prediction of understory phenology for future climates, which we demonstrate here using Shepherdia canadensis, a widespread fruiting shrub of western North America that has important trophic connections to frugivores. Our approach enables researchers to assess the regional-scale impacts of climate change on bottom-up forest ecosystems and to monitor emerging trophic mismatches.

TI  - Estimating summer sea surface <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> on a river-dominated continental shelf using a satellite-based semi-mechanistic model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A satellite-based semi-mechanistic model was developed to estimate the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) on the river-dominated Louisiana Continental Shelf (LCS) in summer months using satellite-derived products including chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a(_sat)), sea surface salinity (SSS_sat), and sea surface temperature (SST_sat). The model analytically expresses pCO(2) as the sum of physical (pCO(2),(mix)) and biological (Delta pCO(2,bio)) contributions which are the primary controlling factors associated with the pCO(2 )variability on the LCS. The SSS_sat, derived from a locally calibrated retrieval algorithm, was used in a two-end member river-ocean mixing model to estimate the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) resulting from physical mixing. The mixing-induced DIC and TA were used together with SST_sat to calculate the pCO(2mix), resulting from the mixing processes at the in situ temperature. The biological uptake of pCO(2) through net community production (Delta pCO(2),(bio)) was derived from a previously validated local Chl-a(_sat) product along with the difference between the pCO(2mix), and the extensive in situ underway pCO(2) data. The satellite-derived pCO(2) agreed with in situ measurements with a median absolute difference of 37 mu atm, mean difference of -5 mu atm, and a root mean square difference of 58 mu atm for five summer cruises spanning 2006-2009. The semi-mechanistic remote sensing model differentiates physical and biological influences on the pCO(2) variability, which will help to better investigate the variability and the underlying controlling mechanisms of pCO(2) and CO2 flux on the LCS. This study demonstrates that the use of locally calibrated satellite products (Chl-a,(_sat), SSS_sat) should be promoted to improve the satellite estimation of pCO(2 )in coastal waters. This method can potentially be applied in other river-dominated continental shelves with local tuning.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Radical hysterectomy and complete pelvic lymphadenectomies are the most commonly performed procedures for women with early-stage cervical cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping could be an alternative to routine pelvic lymphadenectomy, aiming to diagnose accurately nodal extension and decrease lymphatic morbidity.Primary Objective To compare 3-year disease-free survival and health-related quality of life after SLN biopsy or SLN biopsy + pelvic lymphadenectomy in early cervical cancer.Study Hypothesis We hypothesize that disease-free survival is non-inferior and health-related quality of life superior after SLN biopsy compared with SLN biopsy + pelvic lymphadenectomy.Trial Design International, randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial. The study will be run by teams trained to carry out SLN biopsy, belonging to clinical research cooperative groups or recognized as experts in this field. Patients with an optimal mapping (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] criteria) and a negative frozen section will be randomized 1:1 to SLN biopsy only or SLN biopsy + pelvic lymphadenectomy.Inclusion, Exclusion Criteria Patients with early stages (Ia1 with lymphovascular invasion to IIa1) of disease. Histological types are limited to squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma.Primary Endpoint Main endpoint will be co-primary endpoint, associating 3-year disease-free survival and quality of life (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CX24).Sample Size 950 patients need to be randomized. Estimated dates for completing accrual and presenting results: study started on Q2 2018, last accrual is scheduled for Q2 2021, and last follow-up in Q2 2026.

TI  - Adenomyoepithelioma With Myoepithelial Carcinoma of the Breast With Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis: Two Case Reports and Review of the Literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Adenomyoepithelioma (AME) of the breast exhibits characteristic proliferation of the epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Most AMEs are benign, but the 2 inherent cell types can become malignant. The present study reports 2 cases of AME with myoepithelial carcinoma of the breast, one with axillary lymph node metastasis.Methods: A modified radical mastectomy was performed in a 67-year-old woman, because a sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed one metastatic lymph node composed of a myoepithelial carcinoma component. Despite receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the patient died from lung and brain metastases 21 months later. In the second case, breast-conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in a 55-year-old woman. Following additional treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there were no signs of recurrence or metastasis.Results: The tumors of the 2 patients were diagnosed as malignant, based on their high mitotic rate and severe nuclear atypia.Conclusions: Based on previously reported cases with distant metastases, the prognosis of myoepithelial carcinoma is poor. Myoepithelial carcinoma should be followed up with careful screening and treated aggressively.

TI  - The Impact of Obesity on Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of ReviewObesity is a recognized risk factor for the development of breast cancer and recurrence even when patients are treated appropriately. We reviewed the literature that addresses the impact of obesity on diagnosis and the individual therapeutic interventions, and present a summary of the findings.Recent FindingsCompared to non-obese women with breast cancer, obese women with breast cancer have a worse disease-free and overall survival despite appropriate local and systemic therapies. In brief, obese breast cancer patients experience more complications related to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Further, obese patients are at increased risk for local recurrence compared to normal-weight women. Similarly, systemic chemotherapy is less effective, even when dosed appropriately on the basis of actual weight. Overall, endocrine therapy is less effective in obese women, and there is a suggestion that aromatase inhibitors may be selectively less effective than tamoxifen. Obese women are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction than normal-weight women, and those who do have surgery experience more surgical complications.SummaryThe efficacy of cancer treatments is significantly lower in obese breast cancer survivors, posing greater challenges in patient care and disease management in this patient population. Further investigations are warranted to assess the effects on treatment outcomes and optimize therapeutic mechanisms in order to successfully target breast cancer associated with obesity.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Error in Rainfall Data: Consequences for Epidemiologic Analysis of Waterborne Diseases
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between rainfall, especially extreme rainfall, and increases in waterborne infectious diseases is widely reported in the literature. Most of this research, however, has not formally considered the impact of exposure measurement error contributed by the limited spatiotemporal fidelity of precipitation data. Here, we evaluate bias in effect estimates associated with exposure misclassification due to precipitation data fidelity, using extreme rainfall as an example. We accomplished this via a simulation study, followed by analysis of extreme rainfall and incident diarrheal disease in an epidemiologic study in Ecuador. We found that the limited fidelity typical of spatiotemporal rainfall data sets biases effect estimates towards the null. Use of spatial interpolations of rain-gauge data or satellite data biased estimated health effects due to extreme rainfall (occurrence) and wet conditions (accumulated totals) downwards by 35%-45%. Similar biases were evident in the Ecuadorian case study analysis, where spatial incompatibility between exposed populations and rain gauges resulted in the association between extreme rainfall and diarrheal disease incidence being approximately halved. These findings suggest that investigators should pay greater attention to limitations in using spatially heterogeneous environmental data sets to assign exposures in epidemiologic research.

TI  - The Impact of Summer Arctic Cyclones on Chlorophyll-a Concentration and Sea Surface Temperature in the Kara Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the intensity of Arctic cyclones has remarkably increased and the impact on the Arctic ecosystem has become more prominent. The Kara Sea is a Russian marginal sea with wide shelf, high productivity of phytoplankton, and abundant resources, and has a very important strategic position and research significance. We have used multiple datasets, including satellite remote sensing data and model reanalysis, to obtain the spatial-temporal distribution of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) before and after the passage of the Arctic cyclone over the Kara Sea in summer, to explore basic processes and the ecosystem response to the cyclone. The results indicated that after the passage of the Arctic cyclone, the Chl-a concentration in different regions of the Kara Sea increased at different levels, and the SST decreased briefly. The increase of Chl-a concentration (0.49 mg/m(3)) caused by the Arctic cyclone happened in Kara Sea in July 2012. The nearshore Chl-a concentration increased more than that on the continental shelf, the continental shelf increases in turn being greater than the deep sea; however, the nearshore response time was shorter than that on the shelf and the deep sea. Compared with nearshore SST, which decreased more than 2 degrees C, the SST on the continental shelf and in the deep-sea area decreased slightly less. Besides, the left side of the cyclone cooled faster than the right side.

TI  - Evaluation of Atmospheric Correction Methods for the ASTER Temperature and Emissivity Separation Algorithm Using Ground Observation Networks in the HiWATER Experiment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) are key variables for a wide variety of surface-atmosphere studies, and it is very important to validate the accuracy of different LST&E retrieval algorithms. In this paper, the accuracy of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm with the water vapor scaling (WVS) method and the ASTER standard LSE&E products (without WVS) was validated using 12 ASTER scenes from May 2012 to September 2012 with concurrent ground LST and emissivity measurements collected in an arid area in northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research experiment. Both the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and MOD07 atmospheric profile products were employed to perform the atmospheric correction. The results showed that the WVSTES LSTs retrieved from the two profiles both demonstrate good accuracies, with average biases of 0.34 and 0.24 K and average root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 1.52 and 1.46 K for the NCEP and MOD07 profiles, respectively. When the WVS was not applied, we obtained an average bias of 1.26 K and an average RMSE of 2.05 K for the AST08 product. The emissivities from the WVSTES algorithm with the two profiles both showed good agreements with the ground CE312 measurements, with mean differences of the five ASTER bands that were less than 0.01. AST05 showed anomalous emissivity spectra and underestimated the emissivity values of graybody surfaces when compared with the ground data, with mean differences of greater than 0.015, which were more obvious for cases with high water vapor. This paper demonstrated that the WVS method is critical for retrieving ASTER TES LST with accuracies within 1.5 K and emissivity within 0.015 for a wide range of atmospheric conditions and land surface types.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal mining activities are likely to cause changes in surface structure, resulting in damage to buildings, which seriously threaten the safety of life and property of the residents within the mining area. In this paper, the synthetic aperture radar time-series analysis method is combined with the building damage level empirical model to conduct a health assessment of the residential buildings in the Panji mining area of Huainan. Through the processing of 50 Sentinel-1A satellite radar images from April 2015 to May 2018, it is indicated that the residential areas in Huainan Panji Mining Area continued to be affected by underground coal mining during this period, and severe settlement occurred. Large areas of buildings in residential areas were damaged. Until May 2018, 202,000 m(2) of buildings in the residential area of Panji mining have reached the Class II damage and 41,575m(2) have reached the Class III damage. After field investigation, the actual damage situation of the building is in good agreement with the results of this paper. Therefore, synthetic aperture radar time-series analysis combined with building damage level empirical model can be used as an effective tool for rapid and efficient deformation monitoring and health assessment of buildings. It is of great significance for the identification, early warning and disaster prevention decision making of such disasters.

AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization in China, monitoring urban changes is of great significance to city management, urban planning, and cadastral map updating. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can capture a large area of radar images quickly with fine spatiotemporal resolution and are not affected by weather conditions, making multi-temporal SAR images suitable for change detection. In this paper, a new urban building change detection method based on an improved difference image and residual U-Net network is proposed. In order to overcome the intensity compression problem of the traditional log-ratio method, the spatial distance and intensity similarity are combined to generate a weighting function to obtain a weighted difference image. By fusing the weighted difference image and the bitemporal original images, the three-channel color difference image is generated for building change detection. Due to the complexity of urban environments and the small scale of building changes, the residual U-Net network is used instead of fixed statistical models and the construction and classifier of the network are modified to distinguish between different building changes. Three scenes of Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath data are used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results and comparative analysis show that our proposed method is effective for urban building change detection and is superior to the original U-Net and SVM method.

TI  - A numerical simulation of the generation and evolution of nonlinear internal waves across the Kara Strait
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonlinear internal waves (NIWs) are ubiquitous around the Kara Sea, a part of the Arctic Ocean that is north of Siberia. Three hot spot sources for internal waves, one of which is the Kara Strait, have been identified based on Envisat ASAR. The generation and evolution of the NIWs through the interactions of the tide and topography across the strait is studied based on a nonhydrostatic numerical model. The model captures most wave characteristics shown by satellite data. A typical inter-packets distance on the Barents Sea side is about 25 km in summer, with a phase speed about 0.65 m/s. A northward background current may intensify the accumulation of energy during generation, but it has little influence on the other properties of the generated waves. The single internal solitary wave (ISW) structure is a special phenomenon that follows major wave trains, with a distance about 5-8 km. This wave is generated with the leading wave packets during the same tidal period. When a steady current toward the Kara Sea is included, the basic generation process is similar, but the waves toward the Kara Sea weaken and display an internal bore-like structure with smaller amplitude than in the control experiment. In winter, due to the growth of sea ice, stratification across the Kara Strait is mainly determined by the salinity, with an almost uniform temperature close to freezing. A pycnocline deepens near the middle of the water depth (Barents Sea side), and the NIWs process is not as important as the NIWs process in summer. There is no fission process during the simulation.

TI  - Monitoring grassland reclamation in the Mu Us Desert using remote sensing from 2010 to 2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - New conversion from grassland to cropland was effectively curbed with the implementation of the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) in northern China from 1999 to 2010. However, the phenomenon of grassland reclamation has significantly increased since 2010. Here, the latest trend of conversion from grassland to cropland was evaluated using a Landsat dataset from 2010 and 2015 in the Mu Us Desert (MUD) of northern China. An object-based approach was chosen to classify grassland and farmland information, and the classification accuracy was 98.33% based on 120 cropland verification points, which were obtained through available Google Earth and field survey data. The area of grassland reclamation increased by 411.29km(2) from 2010 to 2015 and was mainly distributed in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the MUD, accounting for 9.78% of the total cropland area in 2015. There were two ways to reclaim grassland, including herdsmen cultivating grasslands on their own pastures and grassland reclamation projects implemented by enterprises under the direction of local governments. Exposed cultivated land is more susceptible to wind erosion and eventually leads to decreasing agricultural productivity and desertification. Therefore, strategies to reduce wind erosion on reclaimed grassland in the study area should be implemented as soon as possible, including several alternative cultivation systems and ridge tillage. If conditions permit, conservation tillage should be changed in the MUD.

TI  - Optimizing urban greenspace spatial pattern to mitigate urban heat island effects: Extending understanding from local to the city scale
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimizing urban greenspace spatial pattern has been widely recommended to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effect, mainly based on the statistically significant relationships between temperature and measurements of urban greenspace spatial pattern at local scale within a city. However, the scientific evidence at the city level is scarce, even though the importance of urban greenspace spatial pattern in mitigating UHI effect at the city level has been recognized. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between the city level surface UHI intensity (SUHII) and a series of explanatory variables belonging to urban greenspace spatial pattern, urban morphology, and urban-rural difference of surface characteristics, using the region of Illinios-Indiana-Ohio in the USA as a case study. Results showed that urban greenspace spatial pattern variables were significantly correlated with SUHII, even after controlling for the impacts of urban-rural difference of surface characteristics (e.g., urban-rural difference of vegetation index) and urban morphology (e.g., urban size). SUHII was negatively correlated with patch density and mean patch shape of urban greenspace, and positively correlated with edge density of urban greenspace. Variance partitioning showed significant overlaps of the explanatory ability of these three groups of variables, which jointly explained 38% of the SUHII variation. Urban greenspace spatial pattern had a slightly larger independent role in explaining the SUHII variation than urban morphology (5% vs 2%), even though the urban-rural difference of surface characteristics was the major determinant (19%). Findings of this study extended our understanding of the impact of urban greenspace spatial pattern on SUHII from the local scale to the city scale and can help design effective urban planning and management strategies at the city scale to improve urban thermal environment.

TI  - Combining Water Fraction and DEM-Based Methods to Create a Coastal Flood Map: A Case Study of Hurricane Harvey
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones are incredibly destructive and deadly, inflicting immense losses to coastal properties and infrastructure. Hurricane-induced coastal floods are often the biggest threat to life and the coastal environment. A quick and accurate estimation of coastal flood extent is urgently required for disaster rescue and emergency response. In this study, a combined Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based water fraction (DWF) method was implemented to simulate coastal floods during Hurricane Harvey on the South Texas coast. Water fraction values were calculated to create a 15 km flood map from multiple channels of the Advanced Technology Microwave Sound dataset. Based on hydrological inundation mechanism and topographic information, the coarse-resolution flood map derived from water fraction values was then downscaled to a high spatial resolution of 10 m. To evaluate the DWF result, Storm Surge Hindcast product and flood-reported high-water-mark observations were used. The results indicated a high overlapping area between the DWF map and buffered flood-reported high-water-marks (HWMs), with a percentage of more than 85%. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the DWF map and CERA SSH product was 0.91, which demonstrates a strong linear relationship between these two maps. The DWF model has a promising capacity to create high-resolution flood maps over large areas that can aid in emergency response. The result generated here can also be useful for flood risk management, especially through risk communication.

TI  - Remote Estimation of Mangrove Aboveground Carbon Stock at the Species Level Using a Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is ongoing interest in developing remote sensing technology to map and monitor the spatial distribution and carbon stock of mangrove forests. Previous research has demonstrated that the relationship between remote sensing derived parameters and aboveground carbon (AGC) stock varies for different species types. However, the coarse spatial resolution of satellite images has restricted the estimated AGC accuracy, especially at the individual species level. Recently, the availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has provided an operationally efficient approach to map the distribution of species and accurately estimate AGC stock at a fine scale in mangrove areas. In this study, we estimated mangrove AGC in the core area of northern Shenzhen Bay, South China, using four kinds of variables, including species type, canopy height metrics, vegetation indices, and texture features, derived from a low-cost UAV system. Three machine-learning algorithm models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were compared in this study, where a 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate each model's effectiveness. The results showed that a model that used all four type of variables, which were based on the RF algorithm, provided better AGC estimates (R-2 = 0.81, relative RMSE (rRMSE) = 0.20, relative MAE (rMAE) = 0.14). The average predicted AGC from this model was 93.0 +/- 24.3 Mg C ha(-1), and the total estimated AGC was 7903.2 Mg for the mangrove forests. The species-based model had better performance than the considered canopy-height-based model for AGC estimation, and mangrove species was the most important variable among all the considered input variables; the mean height (Hmean) the second most important variable. Additionally, the RF algorithms showed better performance in terms of mangrove AGC estimation than the SVR and ANN algorithms. Overall, a low-cost UAV system with a digital camera has the potential to enable satisfactory predictions of AGC in areas of homogenous mangrove forests.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL DIAGNOSIS OF THE IMPACTS OF ANTROPIZATION IN THE URBANIZED HYDROGRAPHIC WATERSHED OF GURUPI-TO
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - From the point of view of biological diversity, the Brazilian Cerrado is recognized as the richest savannah in the world, considered as an important recharge area of several hydric bodies in the Brazilian territory. Located in Brazil, the Brazilian Cerrado is also the predominant biome of the state of Tocantins, however the disordered urban occupation and the development of agriculture and livestock farming, have been affecting this environment, being of fundamental importance the execution of studies that can guide mitigating policies aiming at maintaining the equilibrium of this ecosystem. The present work aimed to diagnose the environmental impacts of the anthropization in the Urbanized Hydrographic Watershed (UHW) of Gurupi - TO by treating images of the Alos Palsar and Sentinel 2 satellites to limit the watershed, mapping the use and occupation of the soil, and verifying the level of conservation of the permanent preservation areas, besides the use of data from the phytosociological survey to determine the Shannom-Wiener Diversity Index and Import Value Index of the tree families present in the cilliary forests, as well as the analysis of the physical parameters pH, Turbidity, Chlorophyll, Dissolved Oxygen and Dissolved Total Solids of the water by multiparameter probe in the main springs inserted in the context of the Watershed Urbanization in accordance to CONAMA 357/2005 resolution. In this study it was identified that 45.33% of the watershed are anthropized presenting an urbanized area, exposed soil and pasture. The phytosociological survey indicated the Shannon-Wiener index 3.73 nats / ind. and among the existing families, Moraceae presented higher IVI with 37.33. Regarding to water quality parameters, some samples indicated that pH, OD and Chlorophyll are in disagreement with CONAMA 357/2005 resolution.

TI  - Squeeze and Excitation Rank Faster R-CNN for Ship Detection in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection is an important part of marine monitoring. With the development in computer vision, deep learning has been used for ship detection in SAR images such as the faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), single-shot multibox detector, and densely connected network. In SAR ship detection field, deep learning has much better detection performance than traditional methods on nearshore areas. This is because traditional methods need sea-land segmentation before detection, and inaccurate sea-land mask decreases its detection performance. Though current deep learning SAR ship detection methods still have many false detections in land areas, and some ships are missed in sea areas. In this letter, a new network architecture based on the faster R-CNN is proposed to further improve the detection performance by using squeeze and excitation mechanism. In order to improve performance, first, the feature maps are extracted and concatenated to obtain multiscale feature maps with ImageNet pretrained VGG network. After region of interest pooling, an encoding scale vector which has values between 0 and 1 is generated from subfeature maps. The scale vector is ranked, and only top K values will be preserved. Other values will be set to 0. Then, the subfeature maps are recalibrated by this scale vector. The redundant subfeature maps will be suppressed by this operation, and the detection performance of detector can be improved. The experimental results based on Sentinel-1 images show that the detection performance of the proposed method achieves 0.836 which is 9.7% better than the state-of-the-art method when using Fl as matric and executes 14% faster.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping of the canine anal sac using lymphoscintigraphy: A pilot study
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy are important parts of oncologic staging in human medicine. Sentinel lymph node mapping enables identification of the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage while avoiding unnecessary lymph node dissection. Anal sac adenocarcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm of the canine perineal area. For dogs with anal sac adenocarcinoma, lympadenectomy and metastasis to the iliosacral lymphocentrum are negative prognostics indicators. The objectives of this prospective, two by two, crossover pilot study were to establish the feasibility of lymphoscintigraphy using Technetium-99 sulfur colloid of the canine anal sac of healthy dogs, compare two injection techniques, and the time for identification of sentinel lymph nodes using each technique. We hypothesized that both intramural and perimural injections of the canine anal sac would identify similar sentinel lymph node drainage. The sentinel lymph node was identified in all dogs using either technique. Intramural injection of the canine anal sac showed radiopharmaceutical uptake faster than perimural injection technique (P = 0.040). There was concordance between intramual and perimural techniques for the sentinel lymph node identified in 50% of cases. A sacral lymph node was identified as sentinel in three of eight dogs (37.5%). Lymphoscintigraphy of the canine anal sac is safe and feasible in normal dogs; however, the method of injection technique seems to have a significant effect on the sentinel lymph node identified.

TI  - Detecting Land Degradation in Eastern China Grasslands with Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) and GIMMS NDVI<sub>3g</sub> Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland ecosystems in China have experienced degradation caused by natural processes and human activities. Time series segmentation and residual trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) was applied to grasslands in eastern China. TSS-RESTREND is an extended version of the residual trend (RESTREND) methodology. It considers breakpoint detection to identify pixels with abrupt ecosystem changes which violate the assumptions of RESTREND. With TSS-RESTREND, in Xilingol (111 degrees 59-120 degrees 00E and 42 degrees 32-46 degrees 41E) and Hulunbuir (115 degrees 30-122 degrees E and 47 degrees 10-51 degrees 23N) grassland, 6% and 3% of the area experienced a decrease in greenness between 1984 and 2009, 80% and 73% had no significant change, 5% and 3% increased in greenness, and 9% and 21% were undetermined, respectively. RESTREND may underestimate the greening trend in Xilingol, but both TSS-RESTREND and RESTREND revealed no significant differences in Hulunbuir. The proposed TSS-RESTREND methodology captured both the time and magnitude of vegetation changes.

TI  - Measuring Vegetation Phenology with Near-Surface Remote Sensing in a Temperate Deciduous Forest: Effects of Sensor Type and Deployment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface remote sensing is an effective tool for in situ monitoring of canopy phenology, but the uncertainties involved in sensor-types and their deployments are rarely explored. We comprehensively compared three types of sensor (i.e., digital camera, spectroradiometer, and routine radiometer) at different inclination- and azimuth-angles in monitoring canopy phenology of a temperate deciduous forest in Northeast China for three years. The results showed that the greater contribution of understory advanced the middle of spring (MOS) for large inclination-angle of camera and spectroradiometer. The length of growing season estimated by camera from the east direction extended 11 d than that from the north direction in 2015 due to the spatial heterogeneity, but there was no significant difference in 2016 and 2018.The difference infield of view of sensors caused the MOS and the middle of fall, estimated by camera, to lag a week behind those by spectroradiometer and routine radiometer. Overall, the effect of azimuth-angle was greater than that of inclination-angle or sensor-type. Our assessments of the sensor types and their deployments are critical for the long-term accurate monitoring of phenology at the site scale and the regional/global-integration of canopy phenology data.

TI  - Seasonal Variation of the Spatially Non-Stationary Association Between Land Surface Temperature and Urban Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been a growing concern for the urbanization induced local warming, and the underlying mechanism between urban thermal environment and the driving landscape factors. However, relatively little research has simultaneously considered issues of spatial non-stationarity and seasonal variability, which are both intrinsic properties of the environmental system. In this study, the newly proposed multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) is employed to investigate the seasonal variations of the spatial non-stationary associations between land surface temperature (LST) and urban landscape indicators under different operating scales. Specifically, by taking Wuhan as a case study, Landsat-8 images were used to achieve the LSTs in summer, winter and the transitional season, respectively. Landscape composition indicators including fractional vegetation cover (FVC), albedo and water percentage (WP) and urban morphology indicators covering building density (BD), building height (BH) and building volume density (BVD) were employed as potential landscape drivers of LST. For reference, the conventional geographically weighted regression (GWR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression were also employed. Results revealed that MGWR outperformed GWR and OLS in terms of goodness-of-fit for all seasons. For the specific associations with LST, all six indicators exhibited evident seasonal variations, especially from the transition season to winter. FVC, albedo and BD were observed to possess great spatial non-stationarity for all seasons, while WP, BH and BD tended to influence LST globally. Overall, FVC exhibited certain positive effect in winter. The negative effect of WP was the greatest among all indicators, although it became the weakest in winter. Albedo tended to influence LST more complicatedly than simple cooling. BD, with a consistent heating effect, was testified to have a greater influence on LST than BH for all seasons. The BH-LST association tended to transfer into positive in winter, while the BVD-LST association remained negative for all seasons. The results could support the establishment of season- and site-specific mitigation strategies. Generally, this study facilitates our understanding of human-environment interaction and narrows the gap between climate research and city management.

TI  - Global White-Sky and Black-Sky FAPAR Retrieval Using the Energy Balance Residual Method: Algorithm and Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by vegetation (FAPAR) is a key variable in describing the light absorption ability of the vegetation canopy. Most global FAPAR products, such as MCD15A2H and GEOV1, correspond to FAPAR under black-sky conditions at the satellite overpass time only. In this paper, we aim to produce both the global white-sky and black-sky FAPAR products based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) visible (VIS) albedo, leaf area index (LAI), and clumping index (CI) products. Firstly, a non-linear spectral mixture model (NSM) was designed to retrieve the soil visible (VIS) albedo. The global soil VIS albedo and its dynamics were successfully mapped at a resolution of 500 m using the MCD43A3 VIS albedo product and the MCD15A2H LAI product. Secondly, a method based on the energy balance residual (EBR) principle was presented to retrieve the white-sky and black-sky FAPAR using the MODIS broadband VIS albedo (white-sky and black-sky) product (MCD43A3), the LAI product (MCD15A2H) and CI products. Finally, the two EBR FAPAR products were compared with the MCD15A2H and Geoland2/BioPar version 1 (GEOV1) black-sky FAPAR products. A comparison of the results indicates that these FAPAR products show similar spatial and seasonal patterns. Direct validation using FAPAR observations from the Validation of Land European Remote sensing Instrument (VALERI) project demonstrates that the EBR black-sky FAPAR product was more accurate and had a lower bias (R-2 = 0.917, RMSE = 0.088, and bias = -2.8 %) than MCD15A2H (R-2 = 0.901, RMSE = 0.096, and bias = 7.6 % ) and GEOV1 (R-2 = 0.868, RMSE = 0.105, and bias = 6.1%).

TI  - Delimitating the Natural City with Points of Interests Based on Service Area and Maximum Entropy Method
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural city, which is essential to understand urban physical scale and identify urban sprawling in urban studies, represents the urban functional boundaries of the city defined by human activities rather than the administrative boundaries. Most studies tend to utilize physical environment data such as street networks and remote sensing data to delimitate the natural city, however, such data may not match the real distribution of human activity density in the new cities or even ghost cities in China. This paper suggests aggregating the natural city boundary from the service area polygons of points of interest based on Reilly's Law of Retail Gravitation and the maximum entropy method, since most points of interests provide services for surrounding communities, reflecting the vitality in a bottom-up way.

TI  - Response of Wetland Evapotranspiration to Land Use/Cover Change and Climate Change in Liaohe River Delta, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of land use/cover change (LUCC) and climate change on wetland evapotranspiration (ET), and to identify the importance of the main effect factors in the spatiotemporal dynamics of ET. In the wetland of Liaohe River Delta, China, the ET of eight growing seasons during 1985-2017 was estimated using the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) model with Landsat and meteorological data. Results show that the average relative error of regional ET estimated by the SEBAL model is 9.01%, and the correlation coefficient between measured and estimated values is 0.61, which indicates that the estimated values are reliable. This study observed significant spatial and temporal variations in ET across the region of interest. The distribution of the average and relative change rate of daily ET in the study area showed bimodal characteristics, that is, the lowest trough occurred in 2005, whereas crests occurred in 1989 and 2014. Simultaneously, the daily ET varied with the land use/cover area. Regional daily ET displays highly heterogeneous spatial distribution, that is, the ET of different land uses/cover types in descending order is as follows: water body, wetland vegetation, non-wetland vegetation, and non-vegetation (except water area). Therefore, the spatial pattern of ET is relevant to the land use/cover types to some extent. In addition, the temporal variation of wetland ET is closely related to landscape transformation and meteorological factor change. A strong correlation was found between ET and the weighted values of meteorological factors, with a correlation coefficient of 0.69. Meanwhile, the annual fluctuations of daily ET and the weighted values were relatively similar. Therefore, the findings highlight the importance of using cheap and readily available remote sensing data for estimating and mapping the variations in ET in coastal wetland.

TI  - Brightness Temperature of Lunar Surface for Calibration of Multichannel Millimeter-Wave Radiometer of Geosynchronous FY-4M
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of Chinese meteorological satellites, Feng Yun-4M (FY-4M), as one the of new generation of geosynchronous series satellites, is planning to upload multichannel millimeter-wave radiometers, e.g., from 50 to 430 GHz. Due to long-period stability and no atmospheric interference, brightness temperature (TB) of the lunar surface can be seen as a good candidate for thermal calibration of FY-4M radiometers. In this paper, the physical temperature profile of lunar regolith media is first derived by resolving 1-D heat transfer equation with validation of the measurements of the Diviner lunar radiometer experiment onboard the lunar reconnaissance orbiter. Then, the loss tangent is fit and validated using the TiO2 abundances, which is derived from Clementine five-band multispectral data and Chinese Chang'e-2 37-GHz TB data. Multichannel TB of a lunar surface region along the moon equator at certain lunar time (noon and midnight) is numerically derived for all FY-4M channels. TB of lunar equator center area (0 degrees N, 0 degrees E) is presented with variation of the lunar local time. These results can be well applied to calibration of FY-4M, with a sustainable error in the range of 1.8 (425 GHz) to 3.8 K (89 GHz).

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamic simulation on aboveground carbon storage of bamboo forest and its influence factors in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forests have an efficient carbon sequestration capacity and play an important role in responding to global climate change. However, the current estimation of bamboo carbon storage has some errors , leading to uncertainty in the spatiotemporal pattern of bamboo forest carbon storage. This study simulated aboveground carbon storage of Zhejiang Province, China, during 1984 - 2014 based on the combination of an improved BIOME-BGC ( biogeochemical cycles ) model and remote sensing data, with the accuracy being verified with forest resource inventory data. The spatiotemporal distribution and environmental factors of aboveground carbon storage were analyzed. The results showed that the simulated carbon storage was accurate, with average correlation coefficient ( r ) , root mean square error ( RMSE) and relative bias ( rBIAS ) being 0.75, 7.24 Mg C . hm(-2) and -2.57 Mg C . hm(-2), respectively. Generally, the aboveground carbon storage of bamboo forests in the whole province tended to increase from 1984 to 2014, the range of aboveground carbon density was 13.10- 17.14 Mg C . hm(-2) , and that of the total aboveground carbon storage was between 9.94-17.19 Tg C. The high aboveground carbon storage of bamboo was mainly distributed in (level- oped bamboo industry areas, such as Anji , Lin ' an, and Longyou. The change of aboveground carbon storage in bamboo forest was significantly correlated with temperature, precipitation, radiation, CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition, with higher partial correlation coefficients between precipitation and temperature and carbon storage.

TI  - Variation of leaf area index estimation in forests based on remote sensing images of different spatial scales
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - There are several important issues in quantitative remote sensing and product authenticity testing, including how well do the ground measurement points represent the remote sensing pixels, how to obtain the relative truth value of pixels, and how much spatial resolution can truly reflect forest leaf area index (LAI). In this study, the measured space scope of two plant canopy analyzers [LAI-2200 and tracing radiation and architecture of canopies (TRAC)] were calculated, which were combined with remote sensing images with three different spatial resolutions ; GF-2 with 4.1 m spatial resolution, the Sentinel-2 with 10 m spatial resolution, and Landsat-8 OLI with 30 m spatial resolution, to get the relative true value of pixel at each scale. Under the condition of keeping the real observed area consistent with that obtained by remote sensing, the effects of different spatial resolution images for estimating forest LAI were compared and analyzed based on the unary exponential and multiple regression statistical models. Moreover, the optimal statistical models of the three images were tested on 30 m and 100 m scales and the spatial representation of dataset were evaluated, to find the most suitable scale for the description of forest LAI in the study area. The results showed that high resolution did not necessarily fully reflect LAI of forests. The statistical model based on three kinds of resolution images could well estimate forest LAI. Among the three models, the model based on the Sentinel-2 image had the highest accuracy, and the one based on the GF-2 images had the lowest. The test results at 30 and 100 m scales indicated that the forest LAI was overestimated by the GF-2 inversion model, and underestimated by the Landsat-8 inversion model. The statistical model based on Sentinel-2 could well estimated forest LAI in the study area.

TI  - Polarimetric Convolutional Network for PolSAR Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The approaches for analyzing the polarimetric scattering matrix of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data have always been the focus of PolSAR image classification. Generally, the polarization coherent matrix and the covariance matrix obtained by the polarimetric scattering matrix are used as the main research object to extract features. In this paper, we focus on the original polarimetric scattering matrix and propose a polarimetric scattering coding way to deal with polarimetric scattering matrix and obtain a close complete feature. This encoding mode can also maintain polarimetric information of scattering matrix completely. At the same time, in view of this encoding way, we design a corresponding classification algorithm based on the convolution network to combine this feature. Based on the polarimetric scattering coding and convolution neural network, the polarimetric convolutional network is proposed to classify PolSAR images by making full use of polarimetric information. We perform the experiments on the PolSAR images acquired by AIRSAR and RADARSAT-2 to verify the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method get better results and has huge potential for PolSAR data classification. Source code for polarimetric scattering coding is available at https://github.com/liuxuvip/Polarimetric-Scattering-Coding.

TI  - Estimation of the forest stand mean height and aboveground biomass in Northeast China using SAR Sentinel-1B, multispectral Sentinel-2A, and DEM imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping the forest stand mean height (FSMH) and aboveground biomass (AGB) with a high spatial resolution are important for monitoring carbon stocks on Earth and the variability and trends of terrestrial carbon fluxes. The recently launched Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) missions offers a new opportunity to map FSMH and AGB. Here we present a methodological framework to map the FSMH and AGB at a resolution of 10 m in Yichun, Northeast China, by integrating field plots, Sentinel imagery, topographic data, and national geographical conditions monitoring data. First, a spatial continuous FSMH product was retrieved using an empirical model, which adopts the backscattering of SAR Sentinel-1B and the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) variable from multispectral Sentinel-2A imagery. Subsequently, three AGB estimation models were developed for different forest types to link the field measurements to the FSMH, biophysical variables, spectral vegetation index, and topographic variables using the random forest algorithm. The mapping results show that the FSMH estimated using SAR backscatter values from VH polarization is more robust and accurate than that based on VV polarization. Furthermore, the three AGB estimation models based on three different forest types perform better than the model built by grouping all forest types together. The determination coefficient (R-2) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) range from 0.69 to 0.74 and 23.38 Mg/ha to 24.21 Mg/ha, respectively. Overall, our study demonstrates that the proposed methodological framework can be used to map the FSMH and AGB products at a high spatial resolution utilizing freely accessible Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disease OverviewDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma originating from the germinal center, and it represents a heterogeneous group of diseases with variable outcomes that are differentially characterized by clinical features, cell of origin (COO), molecular features, and most recently, frequently recurring mutations.DiagnosisDLBCL is ideally diagnosed from an excisional biopsy of a suspicious lymph node, which shows sheets of large cells that disrupt the underlying structural integrity of the follicle center and stain positive for pan-B-cell antigens, such as CD20 and CD79a. COO is determined by immunohistochemical stains, while molecular features such as double-hit or triple-hit disease are determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Commercial tests for frequently recurring mutations are currently not routinely used to inform treatment.Risk StratificationClinical prognostic systems for DLBCL, including the rituximab International Prognostic Index, age-adjusted IPI, and NCCN-IPI, use clinical factors for the risk stratification of patients, although this does not affect the treatment approach. Furthermore, DLBCL patients with non-germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like DLBCL (activated B-cell like and unclassifiable) have a poorer response to up-front chemoimmunotherapy (CI) compared to patients with GCB-like DLBCL. Those with c-MYC-altered disease alone and in combination with translocations in BCL2 and/or BCL6 (particularly when the MYC translocation partner is immunoglobulin) respond poorly to up-front CI and salvage autologous stem cell transplant at relapse.Risk-Adapted TherapyThis review will focus on differential treatment of DLBCL up-front and at the time of relapse by COO and molecular features.

TI  - Scene Classification Using Hierarchical Wasserstein CNN
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In multiclass classification, convolutional neural network (CNN) is generally coupled with the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which only penalizes the predicted probability corresponding to a ground truth class and ignores the interclass relationship. We argue that CNN can be improved by using a better loss function. On the other hand, the Wasserstein distance (WD) is a well-known metric used to measure the distance between two distributions. Directly solving the WD problem requires a prohibitively large amount of computation time, whereas the cheaper iterative algorithms have a variety of shortcomings such as computational instability and difficulty in selecting parameters. In this paper, we address these issues by giving an analytical solution to the WD problem-for the first time, we find that for two distributions in hierarchically organized data space, WD has a closed-form solution, which we call "hierarchical WD (HWD)." We use this theory to construct novel loss functions that overcome the shortcomings of CE loss. To this end, multi-CNN information fusion that provides the basis for building category hierarchies is carried out first. Then, the semantic relationship among classes is modeled as a binary tree. Then, CNN coupled with an HWD-based loss, i.e., hierarchical Wasserstein CNN (HW-CNN), is trained to learn deep features. In this way, prior knowledge about the interclass relationship is embedded into HW-CNN, and information from several CNNs provides guidance in the process of training individual HW-CNNs. We conducted extensive experiments over two publicly available remote sensing data sets and achieved a state-of-the-art performance in scene classification tasks.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation is an important indicator for the ecological functions and carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Based on MODIS MOD17A3 NPP and meteorological data over the past 16 years (from 2000 to 2015), the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation NPP in Shandong Province, as well as its responses to climate change, were estimated using the methods of correlation, regression, and spatial analysis. The results showed that vegetation NPP increased with fluctuations from 2000 to 2015, with mean annual value between 501.29 and 583.55 g C . m(-2) . a(-1). Vegetation NPP increased at a rate of 2.05 g C . m(-2) . a(-1) during the study period. There were substantial spatial variations in vegetation NPP, with high values in the south and east and low values in the north and west of the province. The vegetation NPP values in most areas of Shandong Province ranged from 200 to 400 g C . m(-2) . a(-1), especially in the central and west parts. In areas with 44.5% of provincial total area, the mean vegetation NPP showed a slight increase for the period of 2000-2015, mainly occurring in the central, west and southwest regions. There were significantly positive correlations between vegetation NPP and temperature and precipitation. The latter was the dominant climatic factor driving the changes of vegetation NPP.

TI  - Balancing prediction accuracy and generalization ability: A hybrid framework for modelling the annual dynamics of satellite-derived land surface temperatures
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual temperature cycle (ATC) models enable the multi-timescale analysis of land surface temperature (LST) dynamics and are therefore valuable for various applications. However, the currently available ATC models focus either on prediction accuracy or on generalization ability and a flexible ATC modelling framework for different numbers of thermal observations is lacking. Here, we propose a hybrid ATC model (ATCH) that considers both prediction accuracy and generalization ability; our approach combines multiple harmonics with a linear function of LST-related factors, including surface air temperature (SAT), NDVI, albedo, soil moisture, and relative humidity. Based on the proposed ATCH, various parameter-reduction approaches (PRAs) are designed to provide model derivatives which can be adapted to different scenarios. Using Terra/MODIS daily LST products as evaluation data, the ATCH is compared with the original sinusoidal ATC model (termed the ATCO) and its variants, and with two frequently-used gap-filling methods (Regression Kriging Interpolation (RKI) and the Remotely Sensed DAily land Surface Temperature reconstruction (RSDAST)), under clear-sky conditions. In addition, under overcast conditions, the LSTs generated by ATCH are directly compared with in-situ LST measurements. The comparisons demonstrate that the ATCH increases the prediction accuracy and the overall RMSE is reduced by 1.8 and 0.7 K when compared with the ATCO during daytime and nighttime, respectively. Moreover, the ATCH shows better generalization ability than the RKI and behaves better than the RSDAST when the LST gap size is spatially large and/or temporally long. By employing LST-related controls (e.g., the SAT and relative humidity) under overcast conditions, the ATCH can better predict the LSTs under clouds than approaches that only adopt clear-sky information as model inputs. Further attribution analysis implies that incorporating a sinusoidal function (ASF), the SAT, NDVI, and other LST-related factors, provides respective contributions of around 16%, 40%, 15%, and 30% to the improved accuracy. Our analysis is potentially useful for designing PRAs for various practical needs, by reducing the smallest contribution factor each time. We conclude that the ATCH is valuable for further improving the quality of LST products and can potentially enhance the time series analysis of land surfaces and other applications.

TI  - Validation of Preliminary Results of Thermal Tropopause Derived from FY-3C GNOS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The state-of-art global navigation satellite system (GNSS) occultation sounder (GNOS) onboard the FengYun 3 series C satellite (FY-3C) has been in operation for more than five years. The accumulation of FY-3C GNOS atmospheric data makes it ready to be used in atmosphere and climate research fields. This work first introduces FY-3C GNOS into tropopause research and gives the error evaluation results of long-term FY-3C atmosphere profiles. We compare FY-3C results with Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) and radiosonde results and also present the FY-3C global seasonal tropopause patterns. The mean temperature deviation between FY-3C GNOS temperature profiles and COSMIC temperature profiles from January 2014 to December 2017 is globally less than 0.2 K, and the bias of tropopause height (TPH) and tropopause temperature (TPT) annual cycle derived from both collocated pairs are about 80-100 m and 1-2 K, respectively. Also, the correlation coefficients between FY-3C GNOS tropopause parameters and each radiosonde counterpart are generally larger than 0.9 and the corresponding regression coefficients are close to 1. Multiple climate phenomena shown in seasonal patterns coincide with results of other relevant studies. Our results demonstrate the long-term stability of FY-3C GNOS atmosphere profiles and utility of FY-3C GNOS data in the climate research field.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the current situation of the large error in civil satellite positioning data resulting in the calculation of smaller mileage by the polyline method than the actual mileage, a new method of mileage statistics has been proposed in this article. First, the original trajectory data are preprocessed to eliminate data errors. Second, based on the principle of shape approximation, it is preferred to implement the quadratic B-spline curve to accurately fit the mileage trajectory curve, comparing various curve fitting methods. Then, based on the trajectory curve control point data, the mileage statistics formula is derived, and the accurate mileage statistics method for non-precision satellite positioning signals is realized. Finally, the road test is carried out by using the photoelectric non-contact five-wheel instrument and GPS equipment. The polyline method and curve fitting method are used to generate contrastive curve and calculate the mileage, respectively. Taking photoelectric five-wheel data as the accurate mileage, the error analysis is carried out. The results show that the deviation between calculated and actual mileage values is less than 1%. Therefore, this method can meet the user's requirements for fleet management.

TI  - Hyper-Sharpening Based on Spectral Modulation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral (HS) image sharpening (namely hyper sharpening) with an auxiliary sensor, such as multispectral (MS) or panchromatic sensor, has attracted a great deal of attention for the past decade. A number of hyper-sharpening techniques, aiming at enhancing the spatial resolution of HS images, have been developed and demonstrated their effectiveness especially on synthetic or simulated data. Nevertheless, since the differences between different remote sensing systems or imaging conditions are complicate, it results in a serious spectral distortion when applying on real remote sensing data acquired by different sensors under different acquisition times or conditions. Unfortunately, very few works have considered this issue. In this paper, a new hyper-sharpening framework based on spectral modulation is proposed to better preserve spectral information when fusing with MS data acquired by a different sensor. The goal of this paper is to generate an adjusted MS image that would have been observed under the same imaging conditions with the corresponding HS sensor. Two approaches, originating in MS pan-sharpening field, are introduced as examples under this framework, namely high-pass details injection model and band-dependent spatial-detail model. Experiments on three HS and MS datasets acquired by different platforms demonstrate that the proposed framework is beneficial to the spectral fidelity of the fused image compared with some state-of-the-art hyper-sharpening techniques. Meanwhile, it is also easy to implement and has a certain advantage in enhancing the spatial details.

TI  - Reduction of lymphocele rate in patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy for melanoma by intraoperative placement of plant-based hemostatic powder: Results of a prospective trial
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphocele is a complication of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for melanoma. Plant-based hemostatic powder (PBHP) may have a lymphostatic benefit. We studied whether PBHP placed intra-operatively could reduce lymphocele rates.Methods: We performed an open label, prospective, IRB -approved, before- and-after, matched control trial of PBHP placed into the wound in patients undergoing SNB of groin or axillary nodes for melanoma staging. Patient/tumor features and lymphocele rates were compared by standard statistical tests.Results: 66 control and 66 treatment (49 axillary and 17 groin in each arm) SNBs were performed in 61 and 55 patients, respectively, for a total 132 SNBs in 116 patients. Patient and tumor features were similar between groups. Nineteen lymphoceles occurred (14.4%); lymphocele rates were 22.2% (14/66) in the control group and 7.6% (5/66) in the treatment group (p = 0.026). The reduction in lymphocele rates between arms was greater for axillary than for groin sites (87.5% vs. 33%); the axillary reduction was statistically significant (p = 0.030).Conclusions: Intra-operative placement of PBHP reduced the rate of lymphoceles in patients undergoing SNB for melanoma.

TI  - Extending ALS-Based Mapping of Forest Attributes with Medium Resolution Satellite and Environmental Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne laser scanner (ALS) data are used to map a range of forest inventory attributes at operational scales. However, when wall-to-wall ALS coverage is cost prohibitive or logistically challenging, alternative approaches are needed for forest mapping. We evaluated an indirect approach for extending ALS-based maps of forest attributes using medium resolution satellite and environmental data. First, we developed ALS-based models and predicted a suite of forest attributes for a 950 km(2) study area covered by wall-to-wall ALS data. Then, we used samples extracted from the ALS-based predictions to model and map these attributes with satellite and environmental data for an extended 5600 km(2) area with similar forest and ecological conditions. All attributes were predicted well with the ALS data (R-2 0.83; RMSD% < 26). The satellite and environmental models developed using the ALS-based predictions resulted in increased correspondence between observed and predicted values by 13-49% and decreased prediction errors by 8-28% compared with models developed directly with the ground plots. Improvements were observed for both multiple regression and random forest models, and for the suite of forest attributes assessed. We concluded that the use of ALS-based predictions in this study improved the estimation of forest attributes beyond an approach linking ground plots directly to the satellite and environmental data.

TI  - Diagnostic value of intraoperative rapid cytokeratin immunostain in the cytological evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the standard of practice in clinically node-negative patients with breast carcinoma. Intraoperative imprint cytology (IC) is often used in this setting. In cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), interpretation of IC slides may be challenging. Rapid cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (R-CK) has been used in this scenario. This study evaluated if the combination of IC and R-CK improves the sensitivity of intraoperative SLN evaluation of ILC in our setting.MethodsSLN of all cases of ILC in which IC and R-CK were performed in a 4 year period were included. Final tissue diagnosis was used as the gold standard.ResultsFour hundred and twenty-seven of the 802 IC performed during the study period corresponded to paired IC and R-CK for ILC. Independently, IC and R-CK correctly classified the SLN as negative or positive in 355 cases (83%) and 324 (76%) cases, respectively. In combination, IC and R-CK correctly classified 304 (71%) of cases. R-CK failed in 56 cases. R-CK aided in rendering an accurate diagnosis in 59% of atypical cases (19/32). Patients with atypical IC and positive R-CK did not undergo axillary dissection. The addition of R-CK increased the turnaround time (TAT) by 24minutes.ConclusionsIn this study, the addition of R-CK did not improve the diagnostic accuracy in cases classified as negative or positive by IC, but resulted in a considerable increase in TAT. Although R-CK proved to be of diagnostic value in atypical IC cases, it did not appear to influence clinical management.

TI  - Long-term variations of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration identified by MODIS in the tropical rain forest, Southeast Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol and particulate matter are playing significant roles in the regional climate and environment in the tropical rain forest of Southeast Asia. Both satellite and ground observations showed significant seasonal variations in the PM2.5 concentration and the aerosol optical properties during 2012-2014 in the Xishuangbanna tropical rain forest. The annual mean values of the PM2.5, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and the Angstrom exponent (alpha) were 34.3 +/- 19.7 mu g.m(-3), 0.54 +/- 0.37, and 1.36 +/- 0.20 in the dry season and 16.90 +/- 5.08 mu g.m(-3), 0.37 +/- 0.10, and 1.07 +/- 0.25 in the wet season, respectively. The results showed that 46.9% and 56.5% of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) C6 AOD data met the NASA accuracy requirements in the dry and wet season respectively and 17.1% and 17.7% of the seasonal mean systematically underestimated the ground-based data. There was a high correlation between PM2.5 and AOD. The range of the correlation coefficient (R-2) was 0.69-0.85 in the dry season and 0.33-0.39 in the wet season. Linear regression functions of PM2.5 and MODIS AOD were developed and used to retrieve the spatial and temporal distributions of the PM2.5 in the tropical rain forest over the last decade (2006-2015). The annual mean PM2.5 increased slightly in the region. The range of the PM2.5 was 20-40 mu g.m(-3) in the wet season and 25-80 mu g.m(-3) in the dry season. In northern Thailand, northern Vietnam and the central district of Laos, PM2.5 was up to the range of 50-80 mu g.m(-3), which was mainly attributed to biomass burning in these areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evaluation of the GPM satellite precipitation products over the United Arab Emirates
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate measurement of rainfall intensity is always challenging due to high spatial and temporal variation of the precipitation, particularly on arid and semiarid regions. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) lies in an arid region with a high shortage of rainfall events. Thus, accurate and continuous monitoring for efficient management of water resources is of particular importance. There are many techniques and instruments that were developed for collecting and/or estimating precipitation. Recently, multi-satellite sensors were globally utilized over the past three decades to measure the precipitation. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite has a capability to detect and measure all types of precipitation using advanced instruments. This article validates the accuracy of the GPM IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals from Global Precipitation Measurement) early, late and final rainfall products over the UAE using multiple spatial and temporal assessments over the period from Jan 2015 to Dec 2017. The IMERG early-run-product showed a good detection accuracy and low estimation error over the UAE except for the eastern part, while the late-run-product showed a slight improvement. The final-run-product showed the highest detection and low estimation error compared to other products. The correlation between rain-gauge and satellite data demonstrated a contradiction, which reveals that the early-run-product had the highest correlation. Nevertheless, the correlation with the final-run-product was quite lower than the early-run-product. Based on these results, the GPM IMERG final-run-product provides not only a better understanding of the rainfall variability and pattern over the UAE, but also could serve as a reliable product to complementing and/or substituting ground precipitation measurements for ungauged or poorly gauged regions. This paper presents results of one of the earliest assessments of the GPM IMERG products in the Middle East. The outcomes could pave the road for further improvement of the IMERG algorithms in the future.

TI  - 1990-2016 surface solar radiation variability and trend over the Piedmont region (northwest Italy)
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new surface solar radiation database of 74 daily series is set up for the Piedmont region (northwest Italy) for the 1990-2016 period. All the series are subjected to a detailed quality control, homogenization and gap-filling procedure and are transformed into relative annual/seasonal anomaly series. Finally, a gridded version (0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees) of the database is generated. The resulting series show an increasing tendency of about +2.5% per decade at annual scale, with strongest trend in autumn (+4% per decade). The only exception is winter, showing a negative but not significant trend. Considering the plain and mountain mean series, the trends are more intense for low than for high elevations with a negative vertical gradient of about -0.03% per decade per 100m at annual scale and values up to -0.07% per decade per 100m in spring. Focusing on clear days only (selected by CM SAF ClOud fractional cover dataset from METeosat first and second generationEdition 1 satellite data over the 1991-2015 period), trend significance strongly increases and both low and high elevation records exhibit a positive trend in all seasons. However, the trends result slightly lower than for all-sky days (with the only exception of winter). The differences observed under clear-sky conditions between low and high elevations are more pronounced in winter, where the trend shows a negative vertical gradient of about -0.1% per decade every 100m. Overall, this paper shows how a high station density allows performing a more detailed quality control thanks to the higher performances in detecting the inhomogeneities with higher data availability and capturing regional peculiarities otherwise impossible to observe.

TI  - Predicting high-magnitude, low-frequency crop losses using machine learning: an application to cereal crops in Ethiopia
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate agricultural impact assessments for droughts are critical for designing appropriate interventions and policy. These assessments are often ad hoc, late, or spatially imprecise, with reporting at the zonal or regional level. This is problematic as we find substantial variability in losses at the village-level, which is missing when reporting at the zonal level. In this paper, we propose a new data fusion methodcombining remotely sensed data with agricultural survey datathat might address these limitations. We apply the method to Ethiopia, which is regularly hit by droughts and is a substantial recipient of ad hoc imported food aid. We then utilize remotely sensed data obtained near mid-season to predict substantial crop losses of greater than or equal to 25% due to drought at the village level for five primary cereal crops. We train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of losses and explore the most influential variables. On independent samples, the models identify substantial drought loss cases with up to 81% accuracy by mid- to late-September. We believe the proposed models could be used to help monitor and predict yields for disaster response teams and policy makers, particularly with further development of the models and integration of soon-to-be available high-resolution, remotely sensed data such as the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) data set.

TI  - Towards Sub-Pixel Automatic Geometric Corrections of Very-High Resolution Panchromatic Satellite Data of Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an automatic procedure for the geometric corrections of very-high resolution (VHR) optical panchromatic satellite images. The procedure is composed of three steps: an automatic ground control point (GCP) extraction algorithm that matches the linear features that were extracted from the satellite image and reference data; a geometric model that applies a rational function model; and, the orthorectification procedure. Accurate geometric corrections can only be achieved if GCPs are employed to precisely correct the geometric biases of images. Due to the high resolution and the varied acquisition geometry of images, we propose a fast, segmentation based method for feature extraction. The research focuses on densely populated urban areas, which are very challenging in terms of feature extraction and matching. The proposed algorithm is capable of achieving results with a root mean square error of approximately one pixel or better, on a test set of 14 panchromatic Pleiades images. The procedure is robust and it performs well in urban areas, even for images with high off-nadir angles.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF SOIL LOSS POTENTIAL THROUGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) FOR THE PRIORIZATION OF RURAL ROADS IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF OURO VERDE / SP
T2  - REVISTA FORMACAO ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to identify all the variables of soil loss potential risk condition in the municipality of Ouro Verde / SP. Therefore, along with identifying unsafe road sections to make the necessary adjustments, taking into account the nature of soil classification, geology, relief rainfall, land use and occupation, conservationists influence and cross-referencing to different information about current approach for unpaved road condition. The visual interpretation of the study area was performed on the basis of an assessment of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Municipal areas mappings has been carried out with cross-checks of information through application of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and the InVEST (R) program which has estimated the losses from soil erosion. In order to recognize and prioritize high-risk road stretches, it was inferred parameters of structures and situations, adapted from the Sustainable Rural Development Project - Hydrographic Microbasins II, obtaining full framework of Classes prioritization criteria. The result of prioritizing unpaved roads identified those that, in their total extent or stretches, which need immediate, medium-term and long-term action, enabling public administrators in the City Hall and FEHIDRO to use this guide as source of analysis and decision-making The InVEST (R) program made possible to explore scenarios with probable future results, and thus various erosion potentiality maps were generated.

TI  - Analysis of Water Quality Conditions of Lake Hachiroko Using Fuzzy C-Means
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Hachiroko, Japan, has many water quality issues, evident from phenomena such as green algae blooms. Understanding the details of the surface water quality of the lake, and the effect of seasons on the quality, is important. In our previous studies, we conducted fuzzy regression analysis of remote sensing data and direct measurements of water quality. The results showed that estimation maps of water quality were well created, using only five data points of the water quality parameters. To obtain maps that are in good agreement with the experimental data, remote sensing data and water quality values should be acquired simultaneously. However, performing such simultaneous observations can affect the preparation of the water quality estimation maps. We overcame this obstacle by using fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), and considered the effect of specific disturbances and uncertainties on the remote sensing data. Furthermore, FCM using only remote sensing data creates estimation maps in which relative water surface conditions are classified. Therefore, determining the relationship between FCM results and water quality facilitates the creation of low-cost, high-frequency water quality estimation maps. Our results indicated that FCM was particularly effective in determining the presence of suspended solids (SS) during water quality analysis. However, the relationship between FCM results and water quality has not been determined in detail. In this study, we analyzed the water quality conditions of Lake Hachiroko with FCM using the data collected by the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer on Terra and, the Operational Land Imager on Landsat-8. In addition, FCM results were compared with the maps created by fuzzy regression analysis and the actual conditions of water pollution. The results indicated that (i) the maps created using FCM are effective in determining the water surface conditions, (ii) the FCM maps using data obtained during August and September have a strong relationship with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and SS, and (iii) the FCM maps using data obtained during May and June have a strong relationship with chemical oxygen demand (COD), SS, and total nitrogen (T-N).

TI  - Current concepts in nanostructured contrast media development for <i>in vivo</i> photoacoustic imaging
T2  - BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is indeed one of the most promising bioimaging techniques for theranostics applications in humans, allowing for the visualization of blood vessels and melanomas with high spatial resolution. However, in order to overcome the endogenous contrast arising from interfering endogenous species such as haemoglobin and melanin, specific contrast agents need to be developed, allowing PAI to successfully identify targeted contrast in the range of wavelengths in which interference from the biomatrix is minimized. This has been first performed by small molecule dyes, which, however, suffer from some important limitations such as low hydrophilicity and short circulation times. For this reason, scientific research has recently directed its efforts towards the development of nanostructured contrast agents capable of providing efficient PA contrast at low concentrations with low toxicity and high biocompatibility. The principal nanostructures are based on (1) metal and semiconducting nanoparticles, amongst which variously shaped nano-gold plays the main role, (2) carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, and (3) conjugated polymer nanoparticles. In this review, the principal characteristics of this class of materials are reported and greater focus is directed towards in vivo studies. A detailed analysis is performed on various physical-chemical parameters that define the PA response of reported contrast agents, like absorption coefficients and photoacoustic efficiencies. By comparing the experimental data, this review provides a comprehensive tool for the evaluation of new nanostructured contrast agents for PA imaging.

TI  - Gas-phase reactivity tuned through the interaction with alkaline-earth derivatives
T2  - THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The cooperativity between MX2:XH alkaline-earth bonds and XH:NH3 hydrogen bonds (M=Mg, Ca; X=F, Cl) was investigated at the G4 level of theory. The cooperativity between these two non-covalent linkages is extremely large, to the point that the increase in their bond dissociation enthalpies may be as large as 240%. More importantly, the weaker the interaction, the larger the increase, so in some cases the linkage that stabilizes the most is the alkaline-earth bond, whereas in others is the hydrogen bond. In all cases, the formation of the MX2:XH:NH3 ternary complex is followed by a spontaneous proton transfer, very much as previously found for the Be-containing analogues. Similarly, MX2:FCl:NH3 complexes evolve from a chlorine-shared ternary complex (MX2FClNH3) or from an ion pair (MX2F-NH3Cl+) if M=Ca. Although F is the only halogen without sigma-hole, MgCl2 derivatives induce the appearance of a sigma-hole on it, though less deep than those induced by BeCl2. We have also studied whether Mg and Ca bond-containing complexes MR2:FY (R=H, F, Cl; Y=NH2, OH, F, Cl) may react to form radicals, as it has been found for the Be-containing analogues. These interactions provoke a drastic decrease in the F-Y bond dissociation enthalpy, very much as the one reported for the corresponding Be-analogues, to the point that in some cases the formation of the corresponding MR2F center dot+Y radicals becomes exothermic. Hence, the general conclusion of this study is that Mg or Ca derivatives give place to similar or even larger perturbations on the electron density than those induced by Be, a result not easily predictable.

AB  - This study was aimed at collecting and examining a sediment core from Lake Rangkul (Eastern Pamir, Tajikistan) to better understand the lake's development and to assess past variations in climatic conditions in this particular area in comparison with data available from other lakes from the neighboring locations. For the purposes of this study, we performed detailed geochemical and palynological analyses on the sediment core taken from Lake Rangkul in 2014. Moreover, we obtained historical satellite and meteorological data and performed field tests for ground ice presence to identify trends in recent lake development. We distinguished 5 distinct stages over the past 2000 years of the lake's history that differ in geochemical and palynological characteristics. Despite the fact that Lake Rangkul is shallow and sensitive to various disturbances in sedimentation, the recorded stages are in accordance with general climatic trends observed for the Northern Hemisphere in the Late Holocene. Satellite data from the past 45 years shows a noticeable increase in the lake's area, which coincides with rising air temperatures. As the lake is located in the permafrost region with ground ice present immediately below the soil surface, its functioning is influenced by permafrost thawing, which will lead to future changes in the lake area and the distribution of surrounding wet meadows, used as pastures by local inhabitants.

TI  - Exploration of hydrothermal alteration and monitoring of thermal activity using multi-source satellite images: A case study of the recently active Kirishima volcano complex on Kyushu Island, Japan
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three major successive plinian or subplinian eruptions, following a long dormant period, occurred in January 2011, September 2017, and March 2018 within the Kirishima volcano complex on Kyushu Island, Japan. Herein, we applied a Landsat 8 image to explore the most active hydrothermal altered area of the Kirishima volcano complex, and nine sets of nighttime ASTER thermal infrared data to explore changes of heat loss to the thermally active area of the Shinmoedake and Ohnamiike craters within this volcanic complex from 2009 to 2018. Color composite, band ratio, principal component analysis, and Crosta techniques were used to map hydrothermal alteration. Meanwhile, the normalized difference vegetation index threshold method for emissivity retrieval, the split-window algorithm for land surface temperature (LST), and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation were used to derive the radiative heat flux (RHF) for the study area. Total radiative heat loss (RHL) in megawatts was calculated by adding pixels positive RHF (W/m(2)) values after multiplying with the pixel area. Using these data, the spatial distribution of altered mineral zones was mapped for the Kirishima volcano complex. We estimated that the maximum LSTs above ambient values were about 24 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and 12 degrees C, immediately following the 2011, 2017 and 2018 eruptions. Highest pixel RHFs of 136 W/m(2), 75 W/m(2), and 61 W/m(2) were also measured just after these eruptions, on 15 November 2011, 30 October 2017, and 8 April 2018, producing peaks in the total RHL of 233 MW, 198 MW and 101 MW, respectively. The Shinmoedake crater had more intense thermal activity than the Ohnamiike crater after both the 2011 and 2018 eruptions but had less intense activity after the 2017 eruption. The intensity of thermal unrest decreased during the study period from both craters. This study illustrates how Landsat TIRS/OLI data can be used for hydrothermal alteration as well as nighttime ASTER thermal infrared data to monitor effectively the thermal activity of active areas of the Kirishima volcano complex.

TI  - A New Mathematical Approach to Explore the Post-exercise Recovery Process and Its Applicability in a Cold Water Immersion Protocol
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to propose a mathematical model to analyze the post-training recovery of perceptive, functional, metabolic, and autonomic parameters from the use of cold water immersion (CWI) through isolated and combined analysis. Following simulated training, 64 male soccer players were randomized into an experimental group (EG: CWI, 13 +/- 1 degrees C; 15 minutes) and a control group (CG: passive recovery; 15 minutes). Perceptive (soreness and perception of recovery), autonomic (heart rate variability [HRV]), metabolic (lactate concentration), and functional parameters (squat jump, T agility test, sprint test, 40-second test, and maximal voluntary isometric contraction) were analyzed before and at specific moments after training (without exceeding 2 hours after training). The variables were analyzed using the raw data, dichotomization of each variable (isolated analysis), and through a mathematical model using the combination of all parameters analyzed (combined analysis). The combined analysis did not demonstrate better efficacy of the EG compared with the CG(69.17 and 63.4%, p = 0.09). In the isolated analysis, a chance of the technique being better was observed in the metabolic parameter at 1 and 2 hours after training (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 3.75 [1.01-13.88] and 11.11 [1.25-98.49]), respectively, and in the autonomic parameter at 40-45 minutes after training (4.4 [1.09-17.67]). For the raw data, all parameters analyzed presented recovery by 2 hours after training for both groups. Based on the proposed mathematical model, it is concluded that CWI is not better than the control condition. However, considering the analysis of variables in isolation, the technique presents a better chance of recovery for blood lactate concentration and HRV.

TI  - Application of a Small Baseline Subset Time Series Method with Atmospheric Correction in Monitoring Results of Mining Activity on Ground Surface and in Detecting Induced Seismic Events
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of applying a Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method to the monitoring of the influence of underground mining exploitation on terrain surface. Calculations were performed on the basis of two large SAR data sets. Calculations of time series additionally employed the Tymofyeyeva and Fialko empirical method for estimating atmospheric delay. A series of test calculations allowed verifying the potential of the method. The SBAS calculations were based on theoretical data prepared with the use of the Mogi model. This approach allowed simulating both underground mining exploitation and induced tremors. The results indicate that the model is useful in detecting sudden ground surface deformations. In such a situation, the image of a tremor can be observed in the atmospheric component. The actual data used in the analysis covered a region of underground copper ore extraction in southwest Poland. The calculations were based on SAR data obtained from the Sentinel 1A/B satellites, for the period between the end of 2014 and May 2018, from paths 22 and 73. In both cases, the total number of images exceeded 120. They served to calculate over 420 interferograms for each set. The results of ground surface displacements allowed precise identification of areas affected by underground mining activity. Over the acquisition period of six days, sufficient amount of SAR data was obtained to precisely monitor surface changes in the analyzed area. The employed empirical atmospheric delay reduction method was demonstrated to enable the detection of sudden ground surface changes due to mining tremors. This feature makes the method useful in detecting induced seismic events in areas characterized by intensive mining activity. It allows determining tremor locations in cases when acquisition dates are greater than the optimal value of 6-12 days (in the case of Sentinel 1A/B).

TI  - Land subsidence in Houston correlated with flooding from Hurricane Harvey
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricane Harvey caused unprecedented flooding and socioeconomic devastation in Eastern Texas with high winds, elevated storm tide, and record rainfall. The flooded area is mapped using the radar backscattering difference between Sentinel-1A/B satellite acquisitions spanning the event, which provides a snapshot of standing water at the time of image acquisition. We find vast areas outside of designated flood hazard zones are overwhelmed. Furthermore, we map pre-cyclone land subsidence using multitemporal interferometric processing of large SAR datasets acquired by Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel-1A/B satellites. We find that subsidence of up to 49 mm/yr and 34 mm/yr during the ALOS (Jul-2007-Jan-2011) and Sentinel-1A/B (Dec-2015 to Aug-2017) acquisition periods affect various parts of Houston-Galveston area. We conclude that 85% of the flooded area subsided at a rate > 5 mm/yr. We suggest that subsidence affected flood severity by modifying base flood elevations and topographic gradients, supported by the Chi-square test of independence. This work highlights the importance of incorporating InSAR measurements of land subsidence in flood resilience strategies.

TI  - Deforestation Increases the Risk of Scrub Typhus in Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Scrub typhus is an important public health issue in Korea. Risk factors for scrub typhus include both individual-level factors and environmental drivers, and some are related to the increased density of vector mites and rodents, the natural hosts of the mites. In this regard, deforestation is a potential risk factor, because the deforestation-induced secondary growth of scrub vegetation may increase the densities of mites and rodents. To examine this hypothesis, this study investigated the association between scrub typhus and deforestation. Methods: We acquired district-level data for 2006-2017, including the number of cases of scrub typhus reported annually, deforestation level, and other covariates. Deforestation was assessed using preprocessed remote-sensing satellite data. Bayesian regression models, including Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial models, were examined, and spatial autocorrelation was considered in hierarchical models. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using different accumulation periods for the deforestation level to examine the robustness of the association. Results: The final models showed a significant association between deforestation and the incidence of scrub typhus (relative risk = 1.20, 95% credible interval = 1.15-1.24). The sensitivity analysis gave consistent results, and a potential long-term effect of deforestation for up to 5 years was shown. Conclusion: The results support the potential public health benefits of forest conservation by suppressing the risk of scrub typhus, implying the need for strong engagement of public health sectors in conservation issues from a One Health perspective.

TI  - Monitoring and Mapping of Rice Cropping Pattern in Flooding Area in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta Using Sentinel-1A Data: A Case of An Giang Province
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropping intensity is one of the most important decisions made independently by farmers in Vietnam. It is a crucial variable of various economic and process-based models. Rice is grown under irrigated triple- and double-rice cropping systems and a rainfed single-rice cropping system in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). These rice cropping systems are adopted according to the geographical location and water infrastructure. However, little work has been done to map triple-cropping of rice using Sentinel-1 along with the effects of water infrastructure on the rice cropping intensity decision. This study is focused on monitoring rice cropping patterns in the An Giang province of the VMD from March 2017 to March 2018. The fieldwork was carried out on the dates close to the Sentinel-1A acquisition. The results of dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1A data show a strong correlation with the spatial patterns of various rice growth stages and their association with the water infrastructure. The VH backscatter (sigma degrees) is strongly correlated with the three rice growth stages, especially the reproductive stage when the backscatter is less affected by soil moisture and water in the rice fields. In all three cropping patterns, sigma degrees VV and sigma degrees VH show the highest value in the maturity stage, often appearing 10 to 12 days before the harvesting of the rice. A rice cropping pattern map was generated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of Sentinel-1A data. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80.7% with a 0.78 Kappa coefficient. Therefore, Sentinel-1A can be used to understand rice phenological changes as well as rice cropping systems using radar backscattering.

TI  - Derivation of Magnitude of Crop Diversity Through NDVI Composite Index Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the application of NDVI technique for extracting net sown cropped area of major crops cultivated during the winter season (October-March) and calculation of crop diversity index at Nyaya Panchayat level in Bara Tehsil of Allahabad district. Time series NDVI imagery is generated from the processing of Sentinel-2A MSI L1C product. NDVI composite index that contains intersection of time series NDVI threshold based on crop ground truth data is used to extract pure cropped area. Further, the formula given by Gibbs and Martin (Am Sociol Rev 27, 1962) is used to calculate crop diversity index, which uses only net sown area of crops for measuring diversification of crops at the regional level. Derived net sown area from Sentinel-L2A imagery is simulated with reported data of net sown area compiled by the government at the block level. Further, the net sown area is mapped at village level and result analyzes at Nyaya Panchayat level. The result shows that proportion of cultivated area under each crop is changed at Nyaya Panchayat level with change in topography, soil types, irrigation facilities, and distance from major crop market and smooth road infrastructure under the same geo-climatic and socio-economic conditions.

TI  - Fusion Analysis of Optical Satellite Images and Digital Elevation Model for Quantifying Volume in Debris Flow Disaster
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid identification of affected areas and volumes in a large-scale debris flow disaster is important for early-stage recovery and debris management planning. This study introduces a methodology for fusion analysis of optical satellite images and digital elevation model (DEM) for simplified quantification of volumes in a debris flow event. The LiDAR data, the pre- and post-event Sentinel-2 images and the pre-event DEM in Hiroshima, Japan affected by the debris flow disaster on July 2018 are analyzed in this study. Erosion depth by the debris flows is empirically modeled from the pre- and post-event LiDAR-derived DEMs. Erosion areas are detected from the change detection of the satellite images and the DEM-based debris flow propagation analysis by providing predefined sources. The volumes and their pattern are estimated from the detected erosion areas by multiplying the empirical erosion depth. The result of the volume estimations show good agreement with the LiDAR-derived volumes.

TI  - Molecular prevalence and ecoregion distribution of select tick-borne pathogens in Texas dogs
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne diseases (TBD), caused by borrelial, rickettsial and babesial pathogens, are common across the United States and can cause severe clinical disease in susceptible hosts, such as domestic dogs. However, there are limited TBD molecular epidemiological reports for dogs in Texas, and none for the non-Lyme borrelial pathogen responsible for causing tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). Therefore, data to support the prevalence of TBRF in the canine population is inadequate. This study aimed to characterize the molecular prevalence of 11 causative agents responsible for three TBD groups within domestic dogs with an emphasis on pathogen distribution within Texas ecoregions. A total representative number of 1,171 whole-blood samples were collected opportunistically from two Texas veterinary diagnostic laboratories. A layerplex real-time PCR assay was utilized to screen the dog samples for all 11 pathogens simultaneously. The overall molecular infection prevalence of disease was 0.68% borrelial, 1.8% rickettsial and 0.43% babesial pathogens, for a TBD total of 2.73% across Texas. Higher molecular prevalence was observed when analysed by ecoregion distinction, including 5.78% rickettsial infections by Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys in the Rolling Plains ecoregion, and an average of 1.1% Borrelia turicatae and 1.0% Babesia gibsoni across detected ecoregions. To our knowledge, our findings indicate the first molecular detection of A. platys in Texas, and the first report of coinfections with E. canis and A. platys in dogs of Texas. The zoonotic concerns associated with TBDs, in conjunction with dogs' implication as an effective sentinel for human disease, highlight the importance of characterizing and monitoring regions associated with active infections in dogs. Surveillance data obtained from this study may aid public health agencies in updating maps depicting high-risk areas of disease and developing preventative measures for the affected areas.

TI  - Evaluating the Effects of Human Activity over the Last Decades on the Soil Organic Carbon Pool Using Satellite Imagery and GIS Techniques in the Nile Delta Area, Egypt
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to clarify the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) and human activity under arid conditions, in the east area of the Nile Delta, Egypt. SOC is one of the critical factors in food production and plays an important role in the climate change because it affects the physio-chemical soil characteristics, plant growth, and contributes to sustainable development on global levels. For the purpose of our investigations, 120 soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected throughout different land uses and soil types of the study area. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship of SOC, soil characteristics, and environmental factors. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat 5 TM in July 1995 and operational land imager (OLI) in July 2018 were used to model SOC pool. The results revealed significant variations of soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) among different soil textures and land-uses. Soil with high clay content revealed an increase in the percentage of soil organic carbon, and had mean SOCP of 6.08 +/- 1.91 Mg C ha(-1), followed by clay loams and loamy soils. The higher values of SOCP were observed in the northern regions of the study area. The phenomenon is associated with the expansion of the human activity of initiating fish ponds that reflected higher values of SOC that were related to the organic additions used as nutrients for fish. Nevertheless, the SOC values decreased in southeast of the study area with the decrease of soil moisture contents and the increase in the heavy texture profiles. As a whole, our findings pointed out that the human factor has had a significant impact on the variation of soil organic carbon values in the Eastern Nile Delta from 1995 to 2018. As land use changes from agricultural activity to fish ponds, the SOCP significantly increased. The agriculture land-use revealed higher SOCP with 60.77 Mg C ha(-1) in clay soils followed by fish ponds with 53.43 Mg C ha(-1). The results also showed a decrease in SOCP values due to an increasing in land surface temperature (LST) thus highlighting that influence of temperature and ambient soil conditions linked to land-use changes have a marked impact on surface SOCP and C sequestration.

TI  - A new fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation of polarimetric SAR imagery in complex land cover ecosystem
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the application of state-of-the-art fully Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation of very high-resolution optical imagery, their capacity has not yet been thoroughly examined for the classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The presence of speckle noise, the absence of efficient feature expression, and the limited availability of labelled SAR samples have hindered the application of the state-of-the-art CNNs for the classification of SAR imagery. This is of great concern for mapping complex land cover ecosystems, such as wetlands, where backscattering/spectrally similar signatures of land cover units further complicate the matter. Accordingly, we propose a new Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture that can be trained in an end-to-end scheme and is specifically designed for the classification of wetland complexes using polarimetric SAR (PoISAR) imagery. The proposed architecture follows an encoder-decoder paradigm, wherein the input data are fed into a stack of convolutional filters (encoder) to extract high-level abstract features and a stack of transposed convolutional filters (decoder) to gradually up-sample the low resolution output to the spatial resolution of the original input image. The proposed network also benefits from recent advances in CNN designs, namely the addition of inception modules and skip connections with residual units. The former component improves multi-scale inference and enriches contextual information, while the latter contributes to the recovery of more detailed information and simplifies optimization. Moreover, an in-depth investigation of the learned features via opening the black box demonstrates that convolutional filters extract discriminative polarimetric features, thus mitigating the limitation of the feature engineering design in PoISAR image processing. Experimental results from full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 imagery illustrate that the proposed network outperforms the conventional random forest classifier and the state-of-the-art FCNs, such as FCN-32s, FCN-16s, FCN-8s, and SegNet, both visually and numerically for wetland mapping.

TI  - Sugarcane Productivity Mapping through C-Band and L-Band SAR and Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based remote sensing imagery can provide a valuable and cost-effective set of observations for mapping crop-productivity differences. The effectiveness of such signals is dependent on several conditions that are related to crop and sensor characteristics. In this paper, we present the dynamic behavior of signals from five Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors and optical sensors with growing sugarcane, focusing on saturation effects and the influence of precipitation events. In addition, we analyzed the level of agreement within and between these spaceborne datasets over space and time. As a result, we produced a list of conditions during which the acquisition of satellite imagery is most effective for sugarcane productivity monitoring. For this, we analyzed remote sensing data from two C-band SAR (Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2), one L-band SAR (ALOS-2), and two optical sensors (Landsat-8 and WorldView-2), in conjunction with detailed ground-reference data acquired over several sugarcane fields in the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil. We conclude that satellite imagery from L-band SAR and optical sensors is preferred for monitoring sugarcane biomass growth in time and space. Additionally, C-band SAR imagery offers the potential for mapping spatial variations during specific time windows and may be further exploited for its precipitation sensitivity.

TI  - Surface wind characteristics over Baja California Peninsula during summer
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of high resolution three-dimensional numerical modeling, reanalysis and satellite data were used to describe the physical characteristics that influence the distribution (intensity and direction) of the surface winds over the Baja California Peninsula (BCP) during summer. These winds, when channeled through a valley located at 30 degrees N on the W side of the Gulf of California (GC), trigger a jet (with velocities > 7 m s(-1)) in the BCP, which forms a cyclonic eddy of approximately 12 x 10(-7) Nm(-3) when entering the GC, which redirects and distributes the monsoon winds towards the (northwest and west. Calculated wind stress curl allowed the identification of three cyclonic structures > 7 x 10(-7) Nm(- 3)) at 30 degrees, 27 degrees and 23 degrees N in addition to air mass inputs to the BCP from the Pacific. It is suggested that positive values of wind stress curl between 26 degrees and 28 degrees N, are due to the interaction of the air masses that come from the north with the topography of Cedros Island and the BCP. This study confirmed that the surface wind distribution over the BCP is associated with: 1) the thermal contrast of at least 7 degrees C between the surrounding water bodies and the continental margins; 2) the difference between the surface atmospheric pressures on the BCP margins (similar to 1.5 hPa); 3) two low atmospheric pressure systems at 32 degrees and 27 degrees N, and 4) the complex topography of the region.

TI  - A Comparison of Burned Area Time Series in the Alaskan Boreal Forests from Different Remote Sensing Products
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alaska's boreal region stores large amounts of carbon both in its woodlands and in the grounds that sustain them. Any alteration to the fire system that has naturally regulated the region's ecology for centuries poses a concern regarding global climate change. Satellite-based remote sensors are key to analyzing those spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence. This paper compiles four burned area (BA) time series based on remote sensing imagery for the Alaska region between 1982-2015: Burned Areas Boundaries Dataset-Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (BABD-MTBS) derived from Landsat sensors, Fire Climate Change Initiative (Fire_CCI) (2001-2015) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Direct Broadcast Monthly Burned Area Product (MCD64A1) (2000-2015) with MODIS data, and Burned Area-Long-Term Data Record (BA-LTDR) using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer LTDR (AVHRR-LTDR) dataset. All products were analyzed and compared against one another, and their accuracy was assessed through reference data obtained by the Alaskan Fire Service (AFS). The BABD-MTBS product, with the highest spatial resolution (30 m), shows the best overall estimation of BA (81%), however, for the years before 2000 (pre-MODIS era), the BA sensed by this product was only 44.3%, against the 55.5% obtained by the BA-LTDR product with a lower spatial resolution (5 km). In contrast, for the MODIS era (after 2000), BABD-MTBS virtually matches the reference data (98.5%), while the other three time series showed similar results of around 60%. Based on the theoretical limits of their corresponding Pareto boundaries, the lower resolution BA products could be improved, although those based on MODIS data are currently limited by the algorithm's reliance on the active fire MODIS product, with a 1 km nominal spatial resolution. The large inter-annual variation found in the commission and omission errors in this study suggests that for a fair assessment of the accuracy of any BA product, all available reference data for space and time should be considered and should not be carried out by selective sampling.

TI  - Burned area and surface albedo products: Assessment of change consistency at global scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a framework for assessing the physical consistency between time-series of several satellite-based surface albedo and burned area products at global scale. The methodology evaluates the level of agreement of temporal change between these two Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) taking into account their uncertainties. Several configurations of surface albedo and burned area products, including the ones from MODIS Collection 6, Copernicus Global Land Service (C-GLS), Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and the GlobAlbedo, were analysed over the 2005-2011 period at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees spatial resolution. The study evaluates the temporal and spatial coherence level in the ECV changes, and explores the product dependency impact on the fire-driven radiative forcings. The main findings indicate that the level of agreement between these two ECVs depends on the product combination but also on the albedo broadband. Whereas both GlobAlbedo and MODIS albedo changes are consistent both temporally and spatially when combined with any burned area product, the C-GLS albedo changes are characterised by lower levels of agreement. The results also indicate that surface albedo and burned area product changes are physically coherent for all biomes except grasslands and croplands, when using the MODIS burned area product. Using different combinations of burned area and surface albedo products, fire-induced radiative forcing estimates at the surface can differ, according to the biome, by 26% to 46%. The proposed framework identifies lack of coherency and consistency between the two ECVs. This novel approach allows us to address cross-ECV compatibility, and as such offers a valuable toolset to users.

TI  - Insights on the historical and emerging global land cover changes: The case of ESA-CCI-LC datasets
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land cover (LC) mapping has been the main source of monitoring our global landscapes for a wide range of applications e.g., food production estimation, urbanization, deforestation, climate change studies, air/soil/water pollution, and CO2 emission. Several initiatives and organizations have attempted to generate global LC maps using remote sensing data and in-situ data. Noteworthy examples include IGBP-DISCover, GlobeCover 2009, FAO, GLC 2000, MODIS, GlobeLand30. While researchers including climate change scientists require fine LC maps in terms of spatial resolution and temporal coverage for continuous monitoring of the planet, these datasets lack of fulfilling this goal. Understanding the trend of LC changes as well as the direction of future changes at global level is of vital importance to a broad spectrum of stakeholders, and essential for addressing the sustainable development goals worldwide. European Space Agency has recently released its climate change initiatives LC dataset called CCI-LC, which aims at achieving this ambition with 300 m spatial resolution and 24-year continuous temporal coverage within 1992-2015. The main objective of this study is to quantify the global land changes within this timeframe and also to predict the future land change by 2050 in order to gain a global picture of our future planet. This is a timely objective since more than ever scientists, environmentalist, and governors require to know how our future will look like and how they can achieve the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) i.e., the Paris Agreement. The achieved results reveal massive land changes of different kinds e.g., deforestation, urbanization, desertification, forestry, water and ice shrinkage across different continents. The employed predictive modelling for year 2030 and 2050 messages dramatic changes among different LC types. Our discussions and conclusive comments can guide policy-makers, environmental planners, ecosystem services providers and climate change researchers to gain finer insights about our planet by 2050. Future research direction draws attention for investigating the underlying causes and consequences on our ecosystems and human population.

TI  - Human modified landscape structure and its implication on ecosystem services at Guder watershed in Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the impacts of landscape structure changes on ecosystem services for Guder watershed. We first analyzed remotely sensed data of four decades (1973-2015). The raster data sets of land uses were used as an input in FRAGSTAT to analyze the magnitude of fragmentation. Furthermore, the locally modified ecosystem service values to estimate the ESVs for the watershed were used. Results indicated that grasslands, shrub land, and forest lands reduced by 83.5%, 48.5%, and 37.5%, whereas the corresponding increase was recorded for settlement and cultivated land by 572.2% and 7.1%. Fragmentation analysis showed an increase in class area (CA) for cultivated land and settlement, whereas number of patches (NP) rose for forest land, shrub land, grassland, settlement, and cultivated land signifying the extent of fragmentation. The overall ESVs of the watershed decreased due to the changes in landscape structure. We recommend the need to take in to account landscape-level watershed conservation to enhance ecosystem services.

TI  - Descriptive analysis of ovine mortality in sentinel sheep flocks in Ireland
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Studies of sheep mortality or cause-specific mortality, in Ireland or internationally, are relatively scarce but are important in presenting baseline levels and changing trends of endemic disease. This study assessed sheep mortality and cause-specific mortality in 33 sentinel sheep flocks in Ireland.Methods Sentinel flocks were requested to submit carcases of all sheep that died to the regional veterinary laboratories (RVLs) of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine during a calendar year (2016). Postmortem examinations were performed on 1247 submissions to Athlone, Kilkenny and Sligo RVLs.Results The median overall submission rate was 13.8 per cent (range 2.5 per cent-35.8 per cent) per adult female sheep in the flock in January 2016. The median fetal, perinatal, lamb and adult submissions per adult female sheep in the flock in January 2016 were 2.1 per cent (0.0 per cent-15.2 per cent), 3.5 per cent (0.0 per cent-20.0 per cent), 3.0 per cent (0.0 per cent-12.4 per cent) and 2.8 per cent (0.8 per cent-7.1 per cent), respectively. The frequency of detection of categories of postmortem diagnoses in fetuses, perinates, lambs and adults are presented.Conclusions Comparisons with existing passive surveillance findings reflect some differences in the relative frequency of detection of certain categories of disease suggesting that sentinel flock surveillance could usefully supplement existing passive animal disease surveillance activities for ovine disease.

TI  - Assessing PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Tehran, Iran, from space using MAIAC, deep blue, and dark target AOD and machine learning algorithms
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to explore the spatial estimation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using 10-km merged dark target and deep blue (DB_DT) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and 1-km Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD over Tehran. The ability of four Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) to predict PM2.5 concentrations is also investigated. Results show that the association of satellite AOD with surface PM significantly increases after considering the contribution of relative humidity in PM mass concentration and normalization of AOD to Planetary boundary layer height (PBLH). The examination of derived aerosol layer height (ALH) from 159 Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) profiles shows that PBLH could successfully represent the top of aerosol-laden layers. Surprisingly, the highest correlation was found between normalized 10-km DB_DT AOD and corrected PM2.5 measurements. Consequently, random forest (RF) fed by this AOD product has yielded the best performance (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 17.52 and MRE = 27.46%). Importance analysis of variables reveals that DB_DT and meteorological fields are of highest and least importance among selected variables, respectively. The RF performance is less satisfactory during summer which is assumed to be caused by the omission of unknown features representing the formation of secondary aerosols. The inferior accuracy of estimation in the north and east of Tehran is also linked to lacking features which could feed the transportation of PM(2.5 )from west to the east of the study area into MLAs.

TI  - Measuring quality outcomes across hospital systems: Using a claims data model for risk adjustment of mortality rates
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthcare delivery systems around the world are designing care through value-based models where value is defined as a function of quality of care outcomes and cost. Mortality is a sentinel outcome measure of quality of care, of fundamental importance to patients and providers. Discovery Health (DH), an administrative funder of healthcare in South Africa (SA), uses service claims data of client medical schemes to examine standardised mortality rates (SMRs) at condition level across hospital systems for the purpose of healthcare system improvement. To accurately examine and contrast variation in condition-level SMRs across acute hospital systems, this outcome metric needs to be risk-adjusted for patient characteristics that make mortality more, or less, likely to occur. This article describes and evaluates the validity of risk-adjustment methods applied to service claims data to accurately determine SMRs across hospital systems. While service claims data may have limitations regarding case risk adjustment, it is important that we do not lose the important opportunity to use claims data as a reliable proxy to comment on the quality of care within healthcare systems. This methodology is robust in its demonstration of variation of performance on mortality outcomes across hospital systems. For the measurement period January 2014 - December 2016, the average risk-adjusted SMRs across hospital systems where DH members were hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia and coronary artery bypass graft procedures were 9.7%, 8.0%, 5.3% and 3.2%, respectively. This exercise of transparently examining variation in SMRs at hospital system level is the first of its kind in SA's private sector. Our methodological exercise is used to establish a local pattern of variation of SMRs in the private sector as the base off which to scrutinise reasons for variation and off which to build quality of care improvement strategies. High-performing healthcare systems must seek out opportunities for learning and continuous improvement such as those offered by examining important quality of care outcome measures across hospitals.

TI  - Optical and radar remote sensing data for forest cover mapping in Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to map forest cover in Peninsular Malaysia using satellite images as deforestation is of concern in the recent decades, and is an important environmental issue for the future too. The Carnegie Landsat Analysis System-Lite (CLASlite) program was used in this study to detect forest cover in Peninsular Malaysia using Landsat satellite data. The results of the study show that CLASlite algorithm misclassified some oil palm, rubber and urban areas as forest vegetation. A reliable forest cover map was produced by first combining Landsat and ALOS PALSAR images to identify oil palm, rubber and urban areas, and then subsequently removing them. The HH and HV polarization data of ALOS PALSAR (threshold method) could detect oil palm plantations with 85.26 per cent of overall accuracy. For urban area detection, Enhance Build up Index (EBBI) using spectral bands from Landsat provided higher overall accuracy of 94 per cent. These methods produced a forest cover reading of 5 914 421 ha with an overall classification accuracy of 94.5 per cent. The forest cover (including rubber areas) detected in this study is 0.38 per cent higher than the percentage of 2010 forest cover detected by the Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia. The technique described in this paper presents an alternative and viable approach for updating forest cover maps in Malaysia.

Methods Retrospective review of all patients who were treated for primary clinical stage I or II CMHN between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015. Results Twenty percent (33/168) of the patients developed a recurrence. Sixty-six percent (4/6) of patients who developed local recurrence first and 50% (3/6) of patients who developed regional recurrence first were alive without evidence (NED) of disease at last follow-up, while 0% (0/21) of patients who developed distant or simultaneous recurrences first were NED at last follow-up. Among the 7 patients who were NED, the mean time from recurrence to last follow-up was 735 days. Conclusions Of patients with isolated local or regional recurrences, 58% (7/12) obtained durable curative treatment for recurrent melanoma.

TI  - NDVI anomaly for drought monitoring and its correlation with climate factors over Mongolia from 2000 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a frequent phenomenon of Mongolia in the last 17 years. The imbalance between the potential evaporation and precipitation amount during the growing season usually causes drought condition which may pose a threat to the environment and human activities. Therefore, gathering a frequent information about the drought severity and its spatial and temporal distribution is required for drought effects mitigation. In this study, the drought severity and its spatial distribution over Mongolia have been mapped, based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) anomaly during the growing season for 2000 to 2016. The results indicated that Mongolia experienced mild to severe drought during the 17 years and the extremely affected years were 2001, 2007, 2002, 2005, 2004, 2009 and 2006 respectively when 41%-57% of the country was under mild to severe drought conditions. The temporal correlation analysis indicated that growing season NDVI anomaly variation was correlated with both climatic variables, but slightly more significantly correlated with precipitation anomaly (r = 0.46, p < 0.005) than temperature anomaly (r = - 0.40, p < 0.005). Meanwhile, the analysis of the spatial correlation between NDVI anomaly and two climatic variables varied according to the land cover type and plants growth environments.

TI  - Dominant scales of subtidal variability in coastal hydrography of the Northern Chilean Patagonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chilean Patagonia, on the southeastern Pacific Ocean, is one of the largest fjord systems in the world. Its complex topography harbors an aquaculture industry that is among the top exporters of salmon and mussels worldwide. However, little is known about the scales of environmental variability of this region and how climate-related changes can alter the current conditions. This study provides a baseline understanding of the dominant scales of subtidal variability in meteorological forcing and water properties along and across the region that encompasses northern Patagonia and specifically the Inner Sea of Chiloe (ISC). We examined multiple datasets spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. Reanalysis wind time series were combined with satellite-derived data (MODIS-Aqua) and in situ hydrographic records from the mussel farming industry as well as from instruments moored at various locations in the ISC. We assessed the influence of large-scale forcing on the variability of local conditions and used the assembled datasets to find modes of variability at interannual, seasonal and intraseasonal scales. The patterns of atmospheric and oceanographic variability along northern Patagonia are heterogeneous both in time and space. Long-term sea surface temperature (SST) averages revealed two areas with colder temperatures and attenuated seasonal variability that can be associated with stronger vertical mixing. These areas have been previously related to hotspots for whale sightings and might be important as bottom-up controls of Patagonian food webs. Northern Patagonia is strongly affected by large-scale processes at the South Pacific basin scale. Long-term wind data show a poleward displacement of the transition between upwelling and downwelling favorable conditions during spring-summer months for the last decade. The intraseasonal time scale was dominated by a band centered at 30 days that can be attributed to atmospheric variability driven by the Baroclinic Annular Mode (BAM), which induces the periodic mixing of the water column, but with substantial interannual variability. Variability in local conditions was found to closely track the large-scale variability, even in the small channels and bays. These findings highlight the strong connection between large-scale processes and the conditions faced by aquaculture in the ISC, and the need to consider such scales of variability - as well as climate trends - in planning and management decisions.

TI  - Scene Classification from Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Using Generalized Compact Channel-Boosted High-Order Orderless Pooling Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success in the field of scene classification. Nevertheless, strong spatial information in CNN and irregular repetitive patterns in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images make the feature descriptors less discriminative for scene classification. Aiming at providing more discriminative feature representations for SAR scene classification, a generalized compact channel-boosted high-order orderless pooling network (GCCH) is proposed. The GCCH network includes four parts, namely the standard convolution layer, second-order generalized layer, squeeze and excitation block, and the compact high-order generalized orderless pooling layer. Here, all of the layers are trained by back-propagation, and the parameters enable end-to-end optimization. First of all, the second-order orderless feature representation is acquired by the parameterized locality constrained affine subspace coding (LASC) in the second-order generalized layer, which cascades the first and second-order orderless feature descriptors of the output of the standard convolution layer. Subsequently, the squeeze and excitation block is employed to learn the channel information of parameterized LASC statistic representation by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. Lastly, the compact high-order orderless feature descriptors can be learned by the kernelled outer product automatically, which enables low-dimensional but highly discriminative feature descriptors. For validation and comparison, we conducted extensive experiments into the SAR scene classification dataset from TerraSAR-X images. Experimental results illustrate that the GCCH network achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-art network in the SAR image scene classification task.

TI  - Comparative analysis of CEACAM1 expression in thin melanomas with and without regression
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a key molecule in several intracellular and intercellular signaling pathways, with multiple functional and structural roles. CEACAM1 expression in melanoma is often described in the invading part of the tumor and has been associated with increased melanoma cells invasion and migration. We studied CEACAM1 expression in regressing versus non-regressing thin melanomas, knowing that phenomenon of regression represents a valuable model for understanding tumor immunity. In melanoma, through homophilic interactions, CEACAM1 inhibits natural killer cell activity, inhibits effector functions of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, such as cytotoxicity and interferon- release. We present a retrospective study including 53 consecutive cases of thin melanoma, 21 with regression and 32 without regression. Comparative analysis of CEACAM1 expression in regressed and non-regressed areas from melanomas with regression and in non-regressed melanomas was performed. We used three different clones of CEACAM1: AA 1-428, extracellular domain, rabbit; AA 1-428, mouse, clone 8B6E2F4; and AA 1-468, full length, mouse, clone 2F6. All three clones had similar reactivity. We identified membrane positivity of tumor cells in non-regressed melanomas and in non-regressed areas in melanomas with regression. Remaining tumor cells in regressed areas were mostly negative for CEACAM1. In non-regressed lesions, there was a stronger positivity of CEACAM1 in the deep invasive front. In thin melanomas, CEACAM1 overexpression is related with invasiveness, suggesting that CEACAM1-positive melanomas are more aggressive. Also, in areas of regression tumor cells lose CEACAM1 expression, probably correlated with the presence of natural killer cells.

TI  - Evaluation of TSEB turbulent fluxes using different methods for the retrieval of soil and canopy component temperatures from UAV thermal and multispectral imagery
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal-based Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model partitions the evapotranspiration (ET) and energy fluxes from vegetation and soil components providing the capability for estimating soil evaporation (E) and canopy transpiration (T). However, it is crucial for ET partitioning to retrieve reliable estimates of canopy and soil temperatures and net radiation, as the latter determines the available energy for water and heat exchange from soil and canopy sources. These two factors become especially relevant in row crops with wide spacing and strongly clumped vegetation such as vineyards and orchards. To better understand these effects, very high spatial resolution remote-sensing data from an unmanned aerial vehicle were collected over vineyards in California, as part of the Grape Remote sensing and Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment and used in four different TSEB approaches to estimate the component soil and canopy temperatures, and ET partitioning between soil and canopy. Two approaches rely on the use of composite Trad, and assume initially that the canopy transpires at the Priestley-Taylor potential rate. The other two algorithms are based on the contextual relationship between optical and thermal imagery partition Trad into soil and canopy component temperatures, which are then used to drive the TSEB without requiring a priori assumptions regarding initial canopy transpiration rate. The results showed that a simple contextual algorithm based on the inverse relationship of a vegetation index and Trad to derive soil and canopy temperatures yielded the closest agreement with flux tower measurements. The utility in very high-resolution remote-sensing data for estimating ET and E and T partitioning at the canopy level is also discussed.

TI  - Thermal infrared multispectral remote sensing of lithology and mineralogy based on spectral properties of materials
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The major minerals forming the Earth's crust exhibit characteristic spectral properties in the thermal infrared (TIR; 7-14 mu rn) region of the spectrum, although most of them have few features in the visible and near infrared (0.4-2.5 jim) region. As there exists a good atmospheric window in the TIR spectral region, a number of multispectral TIR remote sensors have been developed by various agencies the world over for geological applications. This paper reviews such type of remote sensing systems, and especially focuses attention on the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The spectroscopic basis in analyzing and interpreting the multispectral TIR remote sensing data is discussed. It includes a review of the historical studies, methodology of spectral measurements and comparison of spectra measured in laboratory/field with that derived from the remotely sensed data. Subsequently, the studies of lithology and mineralogy using TIR multispectral remote sensing data by various workers are reviewed. The various spectral indices proposed by the authors for extracting information on the mineralogy or chemistry of the target geological materials are summarized.

TI  - Long-Term Prognosis After Segmentectomy for cT1 N0 M0 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Prognosis beyond 5 years after segmen-tectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been well studied.Methods. This study is a retrospective analysis of a previous prospective cohort study of patients with peripheral cT1 N0 M0 NSCLC who underwent segmen-tectomy between 2005 and 2009. Exclusion criteria were right middle lobe tumors, multiple tumors in same lobe, patients having considerable risk for segmentectomy, and patients requesting lobectomy rather than segmentectomy. The median follow-up period was 108 months. Study outcomes included overall survival, recurrence-free probability, and local recurrence.Results. Of 179 patients with cT1 N0 M0 who were treated by segmentectomy, clinical T stages were Tis in 57 patients, T1mi or T1a in 34, T1b in 57, and Tic in 31. All tumors were pathologic NO tumors. The 10-year recurrencefree probability rates in each clinical stage were 100% in Tis, 97% in T1mi or T1a, 90% in T1b, and 69% in Tic, which were significantly lower in advanced T stages (p < 0.001). Fourteen patients (8%) experienced recurrences after segmentectomy; these were local in 8 patients (five recurrences at the surgical margin and three in the preserved lobe) and nonlocal in 6 patients. Six of the eight local recurrences developed more than 5 years after segmentectomy. All eight local recurrences were treated by local therapy, resulting in 6 patients surviving without disease at 55 months of median follow-up after the additional treatments.Conclusions. Although segmentectomy may be a viable curative option for treating T1 N0 M0 NSCLC, monitoring for local recurrence should be continued beyond 5 years after segmentectomy to avoid missing opportunities to effect a cure.

TI  - Assimilation of Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index Data into a Physically-Based Crop Growth Model for Yield Estimation
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data, crop growth models, and optimization routines constitute a toolset that can be used together to map crop yield over large areas when access to field data is limited. In this study, Leaf Area Index (LAI) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite were combined with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to estimate crop yield using a re-calibration data assimilation approach. The experiment was implemented for a winter wheat crop during two growing seasons (2016 and 2017) under four different fertilization management strategies. A number of field measurements were conducted spanning from LAI to biomass and crop yields. LAI showed a good correlation between the Sentinel-2 estimates and the ground measurements using non-destructive method. A correlating fit between satellite LAI curves and EPIC modelled LAI curves was also observed. The assimilation of LAI in EPIC provided an improvement in yield estimation in both years even though in 2017 strong underestimations were observed. The diverging results obtained in the two years indicated that the assimilation framework has to be tested under different environmental conditions before being applied on a larger scale with limited field data.

TI  - Dietary and Sentinel Factors Leading to Hemochromatosis
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Although hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with the mutation of genes involved in iron transport and metabolism, secondary hemochromatosis is due to external factors, such as intended or unintended iron overload, hemolysis-linked iron exposure or other stress-impaired iron metabolism. The present review addresses diet-linked etiologies of hemochromatosis and their pathogenesis in the network of genes and nutrients. Although the mechanistic association to diet-linked etiologies can be complicated, the stress sentinels are pivotally involved in the pathological processes of secondary hemochromatosis in response to iron excess and other external stresses. Moreover, the mutations in these sentineling pathway-linked genes increase susceptibility to secondary hemochromatosis. Thus, the crosstalk between nutrients and genes would verify the complex procedures in the clinical outcomes of secondary hemochromatosis and chronic complications, such as malignancy. All of this evidence provides crucial insights into comprehensive clinical or nutritional interventions for hemochromatosis.

TI  - A Forecasting Approach to Online Change Detection in Land Cover Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method for online detection of land cover change based on remotely sensed time series. Change is detected by monitoring deviations between observations and forecasts made using the time series historical data and similar time series in the geographical region. This method and several others were applied to MODIS 8-day surface reflectance data for problems of detecting settlement expansion in Limpopo Province, South Africa, and detecting deforestation in New South Wales, Australia. The proposed method had significantly shorter median detection delay (DD) for equivalent rates of false alarms compared with the other evaluated methods. We obtained a median DD of seven samples for settlement detection and 14 samples for deforestation detection corresponding to 56 days and 112 days, respectively. This is compared with a median DD of 224 and 544 days for the best other methods evaluated. We suggest that the proposed method is an excellent candidate for land cover change detection where rapid detection is essential.

TI  - Conservation Unit and Deforestation in the Amazon: Analyses of the State Park in Guajara Mirim in Rondonia/Brazil
T2  - REVISTA ACTA GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Creating and consolidating a Conservation Unity is a contribuition to maintain the biodeversity, especially in the Amazon. The management of these terrirories requires facilitating and helpful tools, like the geotechnologies, with gives the comprehension to the analised terriroty with low costs and precise information generated. With this perspective, the present article has its main analyses in the deforestation of the conservation unity in the fully protected of State Park in Guajard Mirim, which covers the counties of Guajard Mirim and Nova Mamore situated in the state of Rondonia. A time scale took into account the 4 years between 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as these were years of intense humidity interference. The interpretation was done through images from the LANDSAT 8 sattelite within the respective years, to geospatial analyses. It was verified that the total deforestation accumulated in the Park up to 2018 was 10.370,7 hectares, which represents a total of 5,1% of its area, that is an expressive amount for a unit that has full protection. In view of this fact, it is possible to claim that the preservation process in the unity is contrary to its the preservation, bearing in mind the existing terrirorial conflicts inside and around the Park. It was possible to confirm serious interference during these four analised years, even though the Park has fixed control bases and monitoring, there has been intense dispute for the national land in question, not to mention invasions and commercialization of the land and wood with commercial value, as well as high levels of burning which contribute to elevate the deforestation.

T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the data of tropical storms, CFSR gridded wind during 1949-2014, and Pearl River discharge were used to analyze wind forcing and runoff forcing on the Pearl River estuary (PRE) under tropical storm. The results show that the wind and runoff forcing varied with location and strength of the storm, and can be classified into four types: storm I with medium wind and runoff forcing on PRE, storm II with medium wind and high runoff forcing, storm III with strong wind and medium wind, and storm IV with strong wind and high runoff forcing. According to the selected moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imaging with fine and no cloudy during tropical storms in South China, existing empirical formula between the water reflectance of MODIS band 1 and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was used to retrieve the surface SSC in the PRE during storms, and the corresponding spatial diffusion of SSC was studied. We find that under four types of storms with different wind and runoff forcing, the responses of SSC in the PRE were different. The SSC was low under storm I, and suspended sediment diffusion was mostly controlled by tidal current. Under storm II, the higher SSC was shown in the Modaomen Estuary shoal and Lingdingyang west shoal than the other areas, which was mostly transported southwesterly. Under storm III, the distribution and diffusion of suspended sediment were influenced by the dominant storm wind, so that under strong NE wind, Lingdingyang west shoal sediment was resuspended by relatively larger waves for the largest wind fetch in the Lingdingyang estuary, higher SSC was presented and transported to the southwest under longshore current. The response of the PRE to storm IV was that the water body was muddy and the SSC was high in the whole PRE than under normal condition; and under southerly storm wind, the high SSC was diffused to the east

TI  - GIS-based spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility using frequency ratio model of Lachung River basin, North Sikkim, India
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide causes damage to property and life in the Himalayan region as well as Sikkim Himalaya. Landslide susceptibility assessment is very important to mark out the landslide susceptibility area, and researchers take some plans for the future. Landslide susceptibility map has become essential to identify the landslide-prone zones and to find out the probable causes of a landslide in an area. The main objectives of this study are to produce landslide susceptibility mapping by frequency ratio method and to find out the dominant parameters which are responsible for the occurrences of frequent landslide in Lachung River basin, the main tributary of Teesta River in Sikkim Himalaya. The study utilized different types of data which include geological data, advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer-based digital elevation model, Sentinel-2A sensor data, published thematic map and precipitation data, and all data have been processed with the help of remote sensing and GIS tools. Ten influential causative factors of landslide occurrence are used for the susceptibility assessment, and they are slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, profile curvature, land use/land cover, normalized differences vegetation index, drainage density, road density, geology and rainfall. The GIS-based landslide susceptibility analysis has been discussed with ten dominant factors by using frequency ratio model. Finally, the landslide susceptibility map was classified into very high (0.591%), high (1.867%), moderately high (5.172%), moderate (19.682%), moderately low (25.685%), low (29.816%) and very low (17.187%). The map was compared with the validation of landslide location, and the model was verified by the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results revealed 88.9% prediction rate and 92.3% success rate, which means this model is validated with landslide susceptibility analysis in the study area.

TI  - Analysis of Floodplain Dynamics in the Atrato River Colombia Using SAR Interferometry
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain water flows have large volumetric flowrates and high complexity in space and time that are difficult to understand using water level gauges. We here analyze the spatial and temporal fluctuations of surface water flows in the floodplain of the Atrato River, Colombia, in order to evaluate their hydrological connectivity. The basin is one of the rainiest areas of the world with wetland ecosystems threatened by the expansion of agriculture and mining activities. We used 16 Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radars (DInSAR) phase observations from the ALOS-PALSAR L-band instrument acquired between 2008-2010 to characterize the flow of surface water. We were able to observe water level change in vegetated wetland areas and identify flooding patterns. In the lower basin, flow patterns are conditioned by fluctuations in the levels of the main river channel, whereas in the middle basin, topography and superficial channels strongly influence the flow and connectivity. We found that the variations in water level in a station on the main channel 87 km upstream explained more than 56% of the variations in water level in the floodplain. This result shows that, despite current expansion of agriculture and mining activities, there remain significant hydrological connectivity between wetlands and the Atrato River. This study demonstrates the use of DInSAR for a spatially comprehensive monitoring of the Atrato River basin hydrology. For the first time, we identified the spatiotemporal patterns of surface water flow of the region. We recommend these observations serve as a baseline to monitor the potential impact of ongoing human activities on surface water flows across the Atrato River basin.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important variable for the terrestrial surface system, as its changes greatly affect the global water and energy cycle. The description and understanding of spatiotemporal changes in global soil moisture require long time-series observation. Taking advantage of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) combined SM dataset, this study aims at identifying the non-linear trends of global SM dynamics and their variations at multiple time scales. The distribution of global surface SM changes in 1979-2016 was identified by a non-linear methodology based on a stepwise regression at the annual and seasonal scales. On the annual scale, significant changes have taken place in about one third of the lands, in which nonlinear trends account for 48.13%. At the seasonal scale, the phenomenon that wet season get wetter, and dry season get dryer is found this study via hemispherical SM trend analysis at seasonal scale. And, the changes in seasonal SM are more pronounced (change rate at seasonal scales is about 5 times higher than that at annual scale) and the areas seeing significant changes cover a larger surface. Seasonal SM fluctuations distributed in southwestern China, central North America and southern Africa, are concealed at the annual scale. Overall, non-linear trend analysis at multiple time scale has revealed more complex dynamics for these long time series of SM.

TI  - Soil erosion modelling: The new challenges as the result of policy developments in Europe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - New challenges and policy developments after 2015 (among others, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)) are opportunities for soil scientists and soil erosion modellers to respond with more accurate assessments and solutions as to how to reduce soil erosion and furthermore, how to reach Zero Net Land Degradation targets by 2030. This special issue includes papers concerning the use of fallout for estimating soil erosion, new wind erosion modelling techniques, the importance of extreme events (forest fires, intense rainfall) in accelerating soil erosion, management practices to reduce soil erosion in vineyards, the impact of wildfires in erosion, updated methods for estimating soil erodibility, comparisons between sediment distribution models, the application of the WaTEM/SEDEM model in Europe, a review of the G2 model and a proposal for a land degradation modelling approach. New data produced from field surveys such as LUCAS topsoil and the increasing availability of remote sensing data may facilitate the work of erosion modellers. Finally, better integration with other soil related disciplines (soil carbon, biodiversity, compaction and contamination) and Earth Systems modelling is the way forward for a new generation of erosion process models.

TI  - Image Processing Techniques Applied to Satellite Data for Extracting Lineaments Using PCI Geomatica and Their Morphotectonic Interpretation in the Parts of Northwestern Himalayan Frontal Thrust
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineament extraction technique is a very considerate method for the study of regional structural geology and tectonics. Lineaments are geomorphological features associated with fractures at a scale ranging from meters to tens of kilometer. In this work, an attempt of automatic extraction of lineaments and their morphotectonic interpretation has been made by satellite image processing in the NW part of HFT. Lineaments are auto-extracted from Landsat-8 OLI using PCI Geomatica software to achieve this objective edge enhancement, and filtering techniques were used. The methodology of this work enumerates the following steps: (1) pansharpening, (2) principal component analysis, (3) directional filtering, (4) lineament extraction, (5) density map generation, and (6) trend analysis. Extracted lineaments were draped over Cartosat DEM-derived ancillary products to understand the morphotectonic condition of the area. The orientation analysis of the extracted lineaments indicates that the major trend of linear features in the study area is NW-SE and parallel to the major structural trend (NNW-SSE). The trend of lineaments is in concordance with the direction of major faults, fractures, and associated geomorphological features. The lineament density value is relatively higher in the high relief area owing to the presence of fractured rocks to the structurally active terrain along the Siwalik range. The overlapping of lineament over geological map, slope aspect map, and drainage map confirms that some of the lineaments identified in the area are morphological features associated with fractures and faults. The study reveals that analysis of extracted lineament with the geological map and DEM gives a good interpretation of active morphotectonics in the parts of northwestern HFT.

TI  - Novel satellite based analytical model developed to predict microalgae yields in open pond raceway systems and applied to Canadian sites
T2  - ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in microalgae cultivation continues to increase based on its potential commercial value. Algae converts CO2, nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T biomass would require 17-20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45-56 ha at Medicine Hat, AB, 57-68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71-80 ha at Great Slave Lake, NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass. Modeled land area information provides the basis for life cycle assessments (LCAs), techno-economic analyses (TEAs), and photobioreactor (PBR) versus OPR performance studies, yields simulations based on various parameters, and can assist with algae production platform optimization.

TI  - Initial constraints on triggering mechanisms of the eruption of Fuego volcano (Guatemala) from 3 June 2018 using IASI satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 3 June 2018 Volcan de Fuego (Guatemala) erupted explosively with unusual intensity, producing wide-spread ash dispersal and pyroclastic flows of >11 km length, which destroyed a community on Fuego's flanks, causing hundreds of fatalities. Here, we analyze satellite measurements of the SO2 plume emitted during the most intense eruptive phase. Key eruption parameters including the injection height and SO2 flux time-series indicate a degassing intensity at least three orders of magnitude above baseline levels. Our results suggest a steady similar to 2.5 hour climactic paroxysmal phase of the eruption with a mass eruption rate of similar to 1.4kg s(-1) based on the combination of plume height estimates and an eruption column model, producing 0.03 +/- 0.004 km(3) of tephra. We detect at least 130 kt of emitted SO2 from satellite images, producing a minimum dissolved magmatic sulfur concentration of 500 ppm. Possible source mechanisms are discussed, which may be useful in assessing the risks posed by future large-magnitude eruptions to the large populations that live on Fuego's flanks. This study shows that even under challenging conditions of a tropical atmosphere during the rainy season, vital eruption parameters to constrain source mechanisms of eruptions can be retrieved from satellite remote sensing data.

TI  - Dynamics of shallow lake cover types in relation to Parana River flood pulses: assessment with multitemporal Landsat data
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of shallow lakes (SL) is typical of large floodplains with wetland landscapes. By taking into account the dynamic behavior of SL, multitemporal remote sensing data can be used to delineate and monitor water extent and SL cover types. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of SL coverages related to flood pulses in the Lower Parana River floodplain. SL were delineated with a frequency analysis over a 1987-2015 time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from Landsat 5-TM and 8-OLI data. A total of 303 SL were identified (22% of the study area). Most of the SL were small, only eight were larger than 1.5km(2) (66% of the total SL area). Five dominant SL cover types were identified by using multitemporal Landsat data. The dynamics of these cover types were analyzed along seven flood pulses and we described six typical temporal patterns that repeated and characterized most of the SL areas. Vegetation quickly recovered after floods, except for extreme floods related to the occurrence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. The historical Landsat data turn out to be valuable tools for the reconstructions of historical processes in floodplains of large rivers.

TI  - Impact of Locally Administered Carboxydextran-Coated Super-Paramagnetic Iron Nanoparticles on Cellular Immune Function
T2  - SMALL
M3  - Article
AB  - Interstitially administered iron oxide particles are currently used for interoperative localization of sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) in cancer staging. Several studies have described concerns regarding the cellular accumulation of iron oxide nanoparticles relating them to phenotype and function deregulation of macrophages, impairing their ability to mount an appropriate immune response once an insult is present. This study aims to address what phenotypic and functional changes occur during lymphatic transit and accumulation of these particles. Data show that 60 nm carboxydextran-coated iron nanoparticles use a noncellular mechanism to reach the draining LNs and that their accumulation in macrophages induces transient phenotypic and functional changes. Nevertheless, macrophages recover their baseline levels of response within 7 days, and are still able to mount an appropriate response to bacterially induced inflammation.

TI  - Large-Scale Automatic Vessel Monitoring Based on Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 and AIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research addresses the use of dual-polarimetric descriptors for automatic large-scale ship detection and characterization from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Ship detection is usually performed independently on each polarization channel and the detection results are merged subsequently. In this study, we propose to make use of the complex coherence between the two polarization channels of Sentinel-1 and to perform vessel detection in this domain. Therefore, an automatic algorithm, based on the dual-polarization coherence, and applicable to entire large scale SAR scenes in a timely manner, is developed. Automatic identification system (AIS) data are used for an extensive and also large scale cross-comparison with the SAR-based detections. The comparative assessment allows us to evaluate the added-value of the dual-polarization complex coherence, with respect to SAR intensity images in ship detection, as well as the SAR detection performances depending on a vessel's size. The proposed methodology is justified statistically and tested on Sentinel-1 data acquired over two different and contrasting, in terms of traffic conditions, areas: the English Channel the and Pacific coastline of Mexico. The results indicate a very high SAR detection rate, i.e., >80%, for vessels larger than 60 m and a decrease of detection rate up to <mml:semantics>40%</mml:semantics> for smaller size vessels. In addition, the analysis highlights many SAR detections without corresponding AIS positions, indicating the complementarity of SAR with respect to cooperative sources for detecting dark vessels.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging is a noninvasive imaging technique having the advantages of high-optical contrast and good acoustic resolution at improved imaging depths. Light transport in biological tissues is mainly characterized by strong optical scattering and absorption. Photoacoustic microscopy is capable of achieving high-resolution images at greater depth compared to conventional optical microscopy methods. In this work, we have developed a high-resolution, acoustic resolution photoacoustic microscopy (AR-PAM) system in the near infra-red (NIR) window II (NIR-II, eg, 1064 nm) for deep tissue imaging. Higher imaging depth is achieved as the tissue scattering at 1064 nm is lesser compared to visible or near infrared window-I (NIR-I). Our developed system can provide a lateral resolution of 130 mu m, axial resolution of 57 mu m, and image up to 11 mm deep in biological tissues. This 1064-AR-PAM system was used for imaging sentinel lymph node and the lymph vessel in rat. Urinary bladder of rat filled with black ink was also imaged to validate the feasibility of the developed system to study deeply seated organs.

TI  - The Devil's in the details: Reports on reproducibility in pharmacoepidemiologic studies
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative "modular programs" have been shown to replicate findings from conventional protocol-driven, custom-programmed studies. One such parallel assessment-dabigatran and warfarin and selected outcomes-produced concordant findings for three of four study outcomes. The effect estimates and confidence intervals for the fourth-acute myocardial infarction-had more variability as compared with other outcomes. This paper evaluates the potential sources of that variability that led to unexpected divergence in findings.Methods: We systematically compared the two studies and evaluated programming differences and their potential impact using a different dataset that allowed more granular data access for investigation. We reviewed the output at each of five main processing steps common in both study programs: cohort identification, propensity score estimation, propensity score matching, patient follow-up, and risk estimation.Results: Our findings point to several design features that warrant greater investigator attention when performing observational database studies: (a) treatment of recorded events (eg, diagnoses, procedures, and dispensings) co-occurring on the index date of study drug dispensing in cohort eligibility criteria and propensity score estimation and (b) construction of treatment episodes for study drugs of interest that have more complex dispensing patterns.Conclusions: More precise and unambiguous operational definitions of all study parameters will increase transparency and reproducibility in observational database studies.

TI  - The role of oxytocin in terror management processes
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on terror management theory found evidence for the idea that attachment and interpersonal touch attenuate existential concerns and worldview defense reactions after mortality salience. Oxytocin, on the other hand, is known for stimulating the attachment system. Therefore, we hypothesized that worldview defense reactions after mortality salience would be attenuated under oxytocin. In the present study, participants administered oxytocin or placebo and performed a typical terror management paradigm: After visualizing death or a control topic, worldview defense reactions were assessed by evaluating the authors of a pro- and an anti-German essay. Overall, the results did not provide strong support for the hypothesis. There was no effect of mortality salience on the overall worldview defense measure and, importantly, no moderation by oxytocin. However, with regard to the sympathy dimension, the expected pattern was revealed: The pro- and anti-German authors were evaluated as more balanced under oxytocin after mortality salience, whereas this was not the case under placebo. This was due to more positive evaluations of the anti-German author in the oxytocin group. Although this specific result was not expected a priori, sympathy was the only trait among all worldview defense variables that referred to a social level. Therefore, it seems possible that oxytocin is able to buffer existential concerns, but only if they are socially relevant.

TI  - Can sentinel node biopsy be safely omitted in thin melanoma? Risk factor analysis of 1272 multicenter prospective cases
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The indication to sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for thin melanomas (Breslow <1 mm) is still subject to controversies. The aim of this paper is to review all SNB performed for thin melanoma and to analyze factors related to lymphatic metastasis. Moreover, the diagnostic performance of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th AJCC classifications for cutaneous melanoma were investigated.Methods: All sentinel node biopsies performed for thin melanomas were selected from a multicentre prospectively-collected database. For each patient the following was collected: age, sex, date of treatment, site of primary melanoma, histopathologic features (Breslow, Clark, number of mitoses/mm(2), presence of ulceration) and the results of the sentinel node biopsy.Results: From 1998 to 2017 were performed a total of 1272 SNB for thin melanoma. Mean age was 51years with 48.7% of male patients. Overall, 5.6% positive SNB were found. At univariate and multivariate analyses, Breslow thickness and ulceration were related to the presence of lymphatic metastasis. We compared the four versions of the AJCC classification: among pTla patients there were respectively 5.32%, 5.63%, 3.72% and 3.49% of positive SNB.Conclusions: in thin melanoma Breslow thickness and ulceration were the only factors related to a positive SNB. Although convincing improvements resulted from the implementation of AJCC classifications with a reduction of positive biopsies among pTla, a 10.71% rate among all positive nodes remains in the low-risk group. No recommendations can be drawn from this research and adjunctive evidences are needed to better identify patients at risk of nodal metastasis.

TI  - Scalable pixel-based crop classification combining Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data time series: Case study of the Duero river basin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery is the foremost source of information to analyze and monitor land covers in several time ranges, especially over large areas. However, it is not always either freely available or easily compatible for the final users due to the different resolutions offered by sensors onboard the satellite platforms. Crop classification is an important task to control and make decisions related to the agricultural practice and its regulation. However, it is not trivial, especially for extensive areas. Thus, this paper proposes a new approach for crop classification in large areas by a combined use of multi-temporal open-source remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) satellite platforms. Having to deal with different spatial and temporal resolutions, special spatial regions (called Tuplekeys) were created within a local nested grid to allow a proper integration between the data of both sensors. Temporal variation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was the chosen input to classify crops. Moreover, due to the massive quantity of data collected, filters considering some agronomic and edaphic criteria were applied with the dual goal of decreasing redundancies and increasing the process efficiency. Out of three different machine learning classifiers analyzed, a plot-based approach was considered for the algorithms calibration while a pixel-based approach was used for the final classification process. The methodology was both tested and validated in the Duero river basin (Spain), 78,859 km(2), for the 2017 spring and summer seasons. Finally, classification outputs were analyzed throughout their overall accuracy (OA), not only for the whole basin but also for each of the Tuplekeys so that the OA spatial distribution was evaluated as well. The Ensemble Bagged Trees (EBT) algorithm showed the maximum OA, 87% and 92%, when classifying crops individually (15 classes) and grouped (7 classes), respectively, proving both the accuracy and efficiency of the developed approach.

TI  - Catholic Perspectives on Human Biotechnological Enhancement
T2  - STUDIES IN CHRISTIAN ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although there is some consonance in the language of transcendence between proponents of the Catholic faith and of human biotechnological enhancement (HBE), their goals are incommensurate. Nevertheless, consistent with the valuation of the body as integral to the human person, Catholic culture has in fact proven to be a fruitful context for developing external therapeutic HBEs. Catholic perspectives on internal HBEs, especially in the context of 'transhumanism', are, by contrast, neither clear-cut nor easy to establish. A prerequisite for progress is to understand what is meant by flourishing in a Catholic worldview, the root metaphor of which is second-person relatedness to God, culminating in divine friendship. Hence important measures of success of internal HBEs will include sustaining, or at least not impeding, thoughtful attention and the capacity to receive experiences that can sanctify the mind.

TI  - Initial Therapeutic Choices for Type 2 Diabetes in the Portuguese Sentinel Practice Network
T2  - ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Type 2 diabetes is a major driver of pharmaceutical spending. We aimed to determine the proportion of new patients who begin treatment with each antidiabetic medicine class, if therapy was initiated by their family physician, if family physicians alter prescriptions initiated by other physicians, and to compare prescribing patterns of family physicians and other specialists.Material and Methods: Cohort-nested cross-sectional study within the Portuguese Sentinel Practice Network. Between 2014 and 2015, incident cases of type 2 diabetes were notified, thus reporting treatment, who made the initial prescription and if treatments initiated by other physicians were changed.Results: A total of 415 incident cases were notified. The initial prescription was made by Sentinel Practice Network physicians in 89.4% of cases (95% CI 86.0% - 92.0%). Metformin was most often chosen as the first treatment, prescribed to 85.5% of patients (95% CI 81.8% - 88.6%). Family physicians used less dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (4.2% vs 30.3%, p < 0.001) and insulin (0.3% vs 12.1%, p < 0.001) compared to other specialists. Prescriptions initiated by others were changed in 4.5% of cases (95% CI 0.4% - 16.0%).Discussion: Prospective data collection is a major study strength, but few cases of treatment initiated by non-family physicians were notified. Data for disease severity was unavailable and could partly explain differences between family physicians and other specialists.Conclusion: Metformin was most often chosen as initial therapy, in line with Portuguese guideline recommendations. Sentinel Practice Network physicians diagnosed most cases, seldom changed prescriptions initiated by others, and had a different pattern of antidiabetic medicines use compared to other specialists.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness assessment of three components of the bovine tuberculosis surveillance system by intradermal tuberculin testing in French cattle farms by a scenario tree approach
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In most officially bovine tuberculosis (bTB)-free countries, bTB has not been fully eradicated. Costly and time-consuming surveillance and control measures are therefore still in place to control this infection. An officially bTB-free status, both at the national and at the herd level, influences whether and when animals can be sold. Thus, this infection is still an economic issue, justifying measures towards its eradication. An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of such measures would be highly useful, especially to optimise the costs of control measures and their adaptation to a local epidemiological context. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three mandatory surveillance protocols currently used in France by herd type (type of production, size, and turnover of the herd) under French field conditions. The first protocol ("strict") implies the direct slaughter and post-mortem analyses of any intradermal cervical tuberculin test (ICT) reactor, and negative results to a second intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin test (ICCT) to regain bTB-free status of the herd. In the second protocol ("compliant quick-path") bTB-free status can be regain if post-mortem analyses of reactors to the first ICT are negative. In the third protocol ("compliant slow-path"), ICCT-reactive animals are tested using the interferon gamma assay; the results of this test influence the path of further investigation. We built scenario trees for each of these protocols at the animal level. They allowed us to estimate herd sensitivity and the total cost of each protocol by herd type. The protocols could be ordered by decreasing herd sensitivity and cost, regardless of the herd type, as follows: strict protocol, compliant quick-path protocol, and compliant slow-path protocol. We calculated a cost-effectiveness index to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each protocol. The strict protocol was never the most cost-effective, regardless of herd type, due to higher costs relative to the other protocols, despite better herd sensitivity. We found the compliant quick-path to be the most cost-effective protocol for big beef, big dairy, and mixed herds. The compliant slow-path was the most cost-effective for small-scale beef and dairy herds. All differences were significant. This comparison of the cost-effectiveness of the protocols by herd type could help authorities to choose the most suitable protocol in the investigation of suspected cases, depending on the herd type, but could be improved by accounting for important sociological data, such as the acceptability of the protocols.

TI  - Modern science, tortured planet. A critical reflection on the Eurocentric way of to know nature and to intervene in the environment
T2  - IZQUIERDAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this theoric-reflexiv text, we will investigate critically some of the components that shaped the epistemic paradigm of European modernity, considering that quantification, mathematization and measurable objectivity are not only theoretical principles found in modern science, since they constituted something more: They were the elements through which a new worldview arose. With this, a new way of understanding and imagining nature was established; and also a new way of intervening and violating it. Some critical theories will be exposed, like the Amerindian perspectivism and the decoloniality, that have responded to this supposedly universal and homogeneous vision, concluding that despite the existence of world patterns of power and knowledge, alternatives for the wise and acting on the environment pass through decolonizing the Method of extracting resources; for which not only certain economic practices and some models of accumulation must be reversed, but in turn must neutralize the epistemic violence that justifies and protects such practices and models.

TI  - Component intensities to relate difference by category with difference overall
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article gives methods to analyze the difference between two datasets that describe a mutual set of categories. The methods can analyze classification error between mapped and reference categories, or change between two time points. Previous work showed how to compute difference size as the sum of three components: Quantity, Exchange and Shift. These components exist for difference by category and for difference overall. These components can be challenging to compare when the categories' differences vary by size. To address this challenge, this article introduces equations to compute a component's intensity, which is the size of the component divided by the size of the difference. Component intensities facilitate comparison of each category with other categories and with difference overall. The case study illustrates how to use component intensities to characterize temporal change using remotely sensed data. Results show how an intensive Exchange component can signal possible confusion of two categories with each other. The literature shows that authors could benefit from interpretation of component intensities. Readers can perform the calculations for free by using the diffeR package in R or the PontiusMatrix spreadsheet available at www.clarku.edu/similar to rpontius.

TI  - PSML: parallel system modeling and simulation language for electronic system level
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - System-level description languages in electronic system level are domain-specific sequential simulation languages using the shared-everything model in discrete-event modeling and simulation terminology. They implement sequential process-interaction worldview to take advantage of event partitioning for ease of programming and modularity. Therefore, their reference simulators can only be executed on a single physical core. Fast and accurate simulation is highly desirable for efficient and effective system design due to the ever-increasing complexity of embedded and cyber physical systems. Parallel discrete-event simulation (PDES) is the main technique to solve this problem for large-scale system-level models. PDES works based on state space partitioning by using the so-called logical process worldview. This paper proposes parallel system modeling and simulation language (PSML), along with its formalized distributed parallel simulation kernel, that provides execution of hardware models in order to improve simulation speed significantly. It will be shown that the proposed framework results in linear, super-linear speedups ranging from 11x to 32x for large-scale, complex PSML models in comparison with the SystemC reference simulator on a 12-core host.

TI  - Lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies using Landsat-8 and ASTER satellite data: North-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica remains a remote and logistically difficult region to conduct geological field mapping and mineral exploration. Remote sensing satellite imagery has high potential to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties and limitations associated with geological field mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions. In this study, the applications of Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were investigated to extract geological information for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions. The north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected in this study to conduct a satellite-based remote sensing mapping approach. A two-stage methodology was adopted to distinguish pixel and sub-pixel targets in the satellite images. In the first stage, Continuum Removal (CR) spectral mapping tool and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) technique were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral bands to map the pixels related to poorly exposed lithological units. The second step was established based on the application of target detection algorithms to shortwave infrared bands of ASTER for detecting spectral features attributed to alteration mineral assemblages at the sub-pixel level. Pixels composed of distinctive absorption features of alteration mineral assemblages and Si-O bond emission minima features were detected by applying CR mapping tool to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. Anomaly pixels related to spectral features of Al-O-H, Fe, Mg-O-H and CO3 groups as well as lithological attributions from felsic to mafic rocks were detected by the implementation of ICA technique to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units (mafic to felsic trend) for poorly mapped and/or unmapped regions. Fractional abundance of alteration minerals such as muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite were detected in poorly exposed lithologies using target detection algorithms. Several prospecting areas for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag mineralization related to propyllitically and argillically altered units of Andean Intrusive Suite (AIS) were identified in the southern sector of the study region. The results of this investigation demonstrated the applicability of Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral data for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions, particularly using the image processing algorithms that are capable of detecting anomaly pixels and sub-pixel targets in the remotely sensed images, where no prior information is available. In conclusion, a simple and robust satellite-based remote sensing approach for mapping poorly exposed lithologies in inaccessible regions was established, which is comprehensively applicable for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in the Antarctic environments and hydrothermal ore minerals prospecting in other inaccessible regions around the world.

TI  - Toward More Representative Gridded Satellite Products
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The most widely used satellite products are averages of data onto a regular spatiotemporal grid, known as Level 3 data. Some atmospheric variables can vary rapidly in response to changing conditions. Over the scales of Level 3 averaging, the combination of observations across different conditions may result in data that is not normally distributed, such that a simple mean is not representative. The problem is illustrated by the distribution of aerosol optical depth from different sensors and algorithms. A simple statistical technique is proposed to better convey the diversity of satellite observations to users whereby a multimodal log-normal distribution is fit to the distribution of data observed within each grid cell. Allowing multiple modes within each cell is shown to improve the agreement between satellite products by highlighting regions of significant variability and isolating systematic differences between instruments.

TI  - A New Parameter to Assess Impact of Rain Gauge Density on Uncertainty in the Estimate of Monthly Rainfall over India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain gauges are considered the most accurate method to estimate rainfall and are used as the "ground truth" for a wide variety of applications. The spatial density of rain gauges varies substantially and hence influences the accuracy of gridded gauge-based rainfall products. The temporal changes in rain gauge density over a region introduce considerable biases in the historical trends in mean rainfall and its extremes. An estimate of uncertainty in gauge-based rainfall estimates associated with the nonuniform layout and placement pattern of the rain gauge network is vital for national decisions and policy planning in India, which considers a rather tight threshold of rainfall anomaly. This study examines uncertainty in the estimation of monthly mean monsoon rainfall due to variations in gauge density across India. Since not all rain gauges provide measurements perpetually, we consider the ensemble uncertainty in spatial average estimation owing to randomly leaving out rain gauges from the estimate. A recently developed theoretical model shows that the uncertainty in the spatially averaged rainfall is directly proportional to the spatial standard deviation and inversely proportional to the square root of the total number of available gauges. On this basis, a new parameter called the "averaging error factor" has been proposed that identifies the regions with large ensemble uncertainties. Comparison of the theoretical model with Monte Carlo simulations at a monthly time scale using rain gauge observations shows good agreement with each other at all-India and subregional scales. The uncertainty in monthly mean rainfall estimates due to omission of rain gauges is largest for northeast India (similar to 4% uncertainty for omission of 10% gauges) and smallest for central India. Estimates of spatial average rainfall should always be accompanied by a measure of uncertainty, and this paper provides such a measure for gauge-based monthly rainfall estimates. This study can be further extended to determine the minimum number of rain gauges necessary for any given region to estimate rainfall at a certain level of uncertainty.

TI  - Effect of Sentinel Node Biopsy in Clinically N0, BRAF V600E-Mutated, Small Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma A Pilot Study
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose BRAF V600E mutation papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is more aggressive with a higher risk of lymph node involvement and a poorer prognosis. Prior studies failed to demonstrate the superiority of prophylactic lymphadenectomy. We investigated the utility of additional radio-guided sentinel node biopsy (SNB). Methods We analyzed 15 patients with N0 PTC by ultrasound and BRAF mutation on preoperative biopsy treated with total thyroidectomy (TT) or TT + prophylactic central neck dissection (PCND) alone or with SNB. Conventional surgery was performed before SNB. We recorded primary tumor diameter, multifocality, extrathyroid infiltration, neoplastic emboli, and tall cell variant. At follow-up, we evaluated basal and stimulated thyroglobulin and ultrasound or radioiodine scintigraphy. Results Of 15 consecutive patients, 5 received conventional surgery alone, and 10 had SNB. For the first group, 4 underwent TT, and 1 had TT + PCND. Among the SNB group, 1 had no sentinel node detected and underwent a simple TT, 2 had TT + PCND+ SNB in the lateral compartment, and 7 had TT + SNB in 1 to 3 neck compartments. Micrometastases were found in 1 of 3 PCND specimens. Sentinel node biopsy revealed metastasis in 3 of 6 central compartment biopsies, in 2 of 6 biopsies in the ipsilateral lateral compartment, and in none of 2 biopsies in the contralateral compartment. Sentinel node biopsy allowed the removal of micrometastases in 4 of 10 patients. At 53 months' (mean) follow-up, no relapse was documented. Conclusions Radio-guided SNB correctly and efficiently stages cN0 BRAF-mutated PTC patients. Sentinel node biopsy could limit time-consuming, risk-exposing compartmental prophylactic dissections.

TI  - Developing an Automatic Phenology-Based Algorithm for Rice Detection Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology-based classification methods have been developed with the goal of removing the need for ground sampling. In contrast, machine-learning-based classification methods are costly since they need extensive ground truth data to be collected, a process which is time-consuming and must be repeated on a seasonal or annual basis. Hence, in this research, we present a new automatic rule-based method, based on crop phenology, to detect rice using the time series of Sentinel-2 imagery. To do the research, the 10-m spatial resolution Sentinel-2 data acquired during the rice growing season in the red and near-infrared spectral bands for three regions in Iran were used. To develop the rules, the near-infrared band reflectance at the rice cultivation time, the red band reflectance close to the rice harvest time, and the temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data were used to detect rice and discriminate it from other crops. Furthermore, the dates of data associated with the phenological stages used to develop the rice classification rules were extracted from the rice crop calendar. Although the rice fields had extensive intra-class temporal phenology variability, the algorithm performed with excellence in detecting them. The kappa coefficients obtained were 0.73, 0.94, and 0.70 for Marvdasht, Dargaz, and Qazvin, respectively.

TI  - Ecotoxicological biomarkers as investigating tools to evaluate the impact of acrylamide on Theba pisana snails
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Acrylamide (ACR) is a widespread industrial chemical with recognized adverse effects not only to humans but to other organisms in the environment as well. In the present study, the ecotoxicological effects of dietary exposure to sublethal concentration (1/20 LC50) of ACR on the land snail, Theba pisana after 2weeks of exposure and 1-week recovery with respect to oxidative stress parameters; lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), cytogenetic parameter; deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content, as well as immunological parameters; cell death, phagocytosis, lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), lectins, superoxide anion (O-2(-)) generation, phenoloxidase (PO), peroxidase (POD), and hemocyanin (Hc) were examined. The results showed that ACR significantly increased LPO level and the activity of CAT and GST, cell death, and Hc level, whereas a significant decline in DNA and GSH contents, phagocytic activity, LMS, lectins, O-2(-) generation, POD, and PO activities compared to the controls after 2-week exposure was observed. After 1-week recovery, most of the tested parameters in exposed snails were permanent and not reversible to the control levels. This study suggests that the tested multiple parameters of T. pisana species may be used as biomarkers of ACR exposure. Besides, T. pisana snails could be used as a good sentinel organism for ACR exposure in pollution monitoring studies.

TI  - Daily and Seasonal Pistachio Evapotranspiration in Saline Condition: Comparison of Satellite-Based and Ground-Based Results
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in 2015 to estimate pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) water use in Marvast region, central Iran. Daily and seasonal pistachio actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was first estimated by running the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) model, using 12 Landsat 8 satellite images and other ancillary data. Finally, SEBAL estimates of daily and seasonal water use over three experimental sites of pistachio orchards were compared against ones based on performing water balance analysis for the top 150cm of the soil layer. For this purpose, a simple funnel-shaped device was made and used to collect the beneath rootzone drainage water and determine the leaching fraction (LF) as well as deep percolation at three scattered points across the sub-sections of each experimental site. The results reveal that the LF varies from 0.16 to 0.34, leading to deep percolation from 95.0 to 334.0mm of the irrigation water. Eventually, the differences between ground-based and SEBAL-based pistachio ETa were 11% (ranged from 5.7 to 14.0%) and 10% (ranged from 7.1 to 16.4%) for daily and seasonal time scales, respectively. Based on the obtained results, more than 60% of Marvast pistachio orchards have seasonal water use of 410.0 to 680.0mm (with the average of 594.3mm), while the cumulative ETo and cumulative pistachio ETc of the same period were 1558.0mm and 920.0mm, respectively. In other words, Marvast pistachio trees extract less water from the soil compared with their potential water demands. This is due to the effect of salinity on reducing evapotranspiration rate as well as deficit irrigation of pistachio trees in the water scarce area of Marvast region. In any case, the difference between pistachio ETc and ETa is reflected in declination of the pistachio yield.

M3  - Article
AB  - The UN has adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030; SFDRR) in March 2015 and the member countries agreed to shift from disaster management to disaster risk management. The SFDRR is in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs; September 2015). In 2016, the UNISDR together with partner organizations has prepared roadmap for mainstreaming Science and Technology in SFDRR. Out of four priority areas, this paper focuses on the appraisal of challenges in SFDRR priority 1 "understanding disaster risk" through the lens of science, technology and innovations. The analysis revealed that various dimensions of multi-hazards, spatial extent of exposure and risk knowledge calls for application of remotely sensed data, real-time digital data, evidence-based digital cumsocial data and the application of Geo-information tools and techniques be infused in understanding disaster risk. Analysis further revealed that there is need of high-resolution spatial data and advanced computer based packages to make available it free of cost for researchers, include Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) experts in policy making, integrate knowledge management for DRR, increase investment in R&D and capacity building to reduce the disaster risk. In short, policies and practices for disaster risk management should be based on an understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, coping capacity, exposure, nature of hazard and environmental settings.

TI  - Estuarine shoreline change analysis along The Ennore river mouth, south east coast of India, using digital shoreline analysis system
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ennore river mouth is the largest estuary and it's located in Thiruvallur, Tamil Nadu, southeastern part of India. The creek covers an area of 2.25 km(2) where located 20 km north of the city centre and 2.6 km south of the Ennore port. The studies are carried out using remote sensing and Geospatial technologies. The Landsat images acquired from 2013 to 2016 were used to demarcate the rate of shoreline dynamics using GIS - based digital shoreline analysis system. The succeeding short term river mouth dynamics, coastal erosion, and accretion rates have been considered for the years 2013-2016. The statistical analysis such as linear regression and end point rate were determined from the shoreline layers. The physical parameters are played the main role in the dynamic activities of erosion and accretion. The study area shows during last four years (2013-2016) erosion are more than the accretion of the shoreline occurred over the years.

TI  - Mineral exploration by decision tree classification using multi temporal cluster images in Jharkhand region
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - India, being an abundant source of minerals, Mineral exploration, on a large scale, is promising to provide good impact for the future of the country. India has a rich source of coal, bauxite, limestone etc. With the advent of remote sensing technologies capturing broader area, exploration of minerals has now become an appreciable problem. Satellite Cluster Images spanning over wider areas can effectively serve as a tool for mapping minerals, qualitatively and quantitatively. In this paper, an algorithm, based on decision tree classification, is developed to map minerals, specifically, coal and limestone for a specific region. Multi-temporal cluster images are employed to map dynamic change detection resulting in greater accuracy. In this paper, multi-temporal cluster images (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS) are analyzed to map coal, limestone and 'no-mineral' regions with the help of the algorithm developed using decision tree classification. Classification results are compared with ground truth data for assessing its accuracy.

TI  - Groundwater recharge estimation using water budget method for Bauru Aquifer system in a Cerrado environmental protection area
T2  - APPLIED RESEARCH & AGROTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agrometeorological water budget can be an efficient tool on water resources management and water use plans elaboration. However, different sources of precipitation data and how they are included in the water budget equations can significantly alter the results. In this study were estimated groundwater recharges at Bauru Aquifer System in a Cerrado protection area at Aguas de Santa Barbara/SP-Brazil from different sources of precipitation data obtained by remote sensing satellites, meteorological radar and ground surface climate stations. These data were integrated with systematic hydrological monitoring data from 2014/2015 and land use cover classification data in a model in a geographical information system environment. The spatial analysis of water budget data demonstrate a significant local recharge in the study area, with the percentual volume from precipitation varying from 20.43% using ground surface climate station; 23.67% using precipitation data estimated by Z-R Calheiros radar equation; and 35.54% using TRMM satellite data.

TI  - The limits of internal perception and the idolatry of self-knowledge in Scheler
T2  - REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA AURORA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article intends to discuss the possibility of internal perception, delimiting it from the understanding of the person, which can be both the understanding of the neighbor and self-understanding. In the same way, the inner perception can be the perception of oneself as a perception of the other. It follows, therefore, from a recurrent indication in Scheler's phenomenology, according to which the internal perception cannot be reduced to self-perception, understood, above all, in the sense of self-consciousness. In this direction, a phenomenological definition of the act in question is first attempted, aiming, above all, to free it from idealistic determinations as self-consciousness and subjectivist understandings, such as self-observation and a means of self-knowledge. For this, it is demonstrated that the inner perception is a direction of a single perceptive act and that its object is not a pure and empty logical form, but the apprehension of the material, concrete and singular self. The immediate and direct intuition of this self, then, will appear as the basis on which it breaks with the two interpretations mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the internal elements that contribute to these limits, especially the physiology of the internal sense and the interests of the body-own (lived-body, Leib), which allows us to positively understand the limits and describe their first meanings. From this phenomenological gain, research focuses on external factors, responsible for transforming internal perception into a mere instrument of self-knowledge and subjugating it to the goals and interpretations of the natural worldview, briefly analyzing the sources of the idolatry of self-knowledge. It is concluded that, in the delimitation of its essential possibility, the disregard of the psychophysiological role of the inner sense, the translation of the laws and space-time relations proper of the physical sphere to the psychic and, consequently, the superposition of external perception consonance with the sensualist interpretation of the latter are the main sources of the illusion called idolatry of self-knowledge.

TI  - Sea surface wind retrieval in coastal areas by means of Sentinel-1 and numerical weather prediction model data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper applies Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based on Local Gradient-Modified (LG-Mod) algorithm to retrieve wind directions from Sentinel-1 data in the Camargue and the Wadden Sea protected coastal areas. Wind speeds are estimated through the inversion of the C-band MODel 5.N (CMOD5.N) backscattering model. Both Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Extra Wide Swath (EW) Level 1 products were evaluated for wind fields retrieval at high (5 km) and medium (12.5 km) output spatial resolutions. SSW fields from Sentinel-1 were compared with Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and in situ data. Exploitation of the LG-Mod provided wind direction with a related marginal error parameter (i.e., ME alpha ROI) which proved useful for selecting the optimal input pixel size of SAR data processing. When compared to in situ data, the selection of the optimal pixel size reduced the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of LG-Mod wind directions up to 7 degrees and about 45 degrees for Wadden Sea and the Camargue site, respectively. In turn, such reduction provided a decrease of the wind speed RMSE values up to 0.7 m/s and 2.1 m/s, for Wadden Sea and the Camargue site, respectively. In addition, the LG-Mod gave better performance than the global NWP model European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in estimation of wind direction, at 12.5 km output spatial resolution, for both sites. The ME alpha ROI exploitation in the directional analysis of IW and EW products evidenced that at high resolution (5 km) the percentage of reliable wind directions from IW images (84.5%) resulted much larger than that obtained from EW images (30.1%). At medium resolution (12.5 km) instead, the percentage values resulted quite close to each other (99.2% and 86.3%, respectively). IW images proved optimal for high resolution SSW retrieval, whereas EW images suitable for medium resolution. With respect to NWP models, the spectral analysis confirmed the suitability of Sentinel-1 to represent the local wind fields spatial variability in coastal areas, at both high and medium output resolution. Our findings suggest that the combination of the LG-Mod algorithm with NWP models could better resolve spatially wind patterns in complex coastal areas.

TI  - Heat Waves and Human Well-Being in Madrid (Spain)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat waves pose additional risks to urban spaces because of the additional heat provided by urban heat islands (UHIs) as well as poorer air quality. Our study focuses on the analysis of UHIs, human thermal comfort, and air quality for the city of Madrid, Spain during heat waves. Heat wave periods are defined using the long-term records from the urban station Madrid-Retiro. Two types of UHI were studied: the canopy layer UHI (CLUHI) was evaluated using air temperature time-series from five meteorological stations; the surface UHI (SUHI) was derived from land surface temperature (LST) images from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products. To assess human thermal comfort, the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) index was applied. Air quality was analyzed from the records of two air quality networks. More frequent and longer heat waves have been observed since 1980; the nocturnal CLUHI and both the diurnal and nocturnal SUHI experience an intensification, which have led to an increasing number of tropical nights. Conversely, thermal stress is extreme by day in the city due to the lack of cooling by winds. Finally, air quality during heat waves deteriorates because of the higher than normal amount of particles arriving from Northern Africa.

TI  - A low complexity hardware architecture of K-means algorithm for real-time satellite image segmentation
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Real time monitoring of forest area, coastal regions, sea, river basins, nation borders etc. helps in quick determination of devastations caused by natural or man-made catastrophes, which can lead to emergency situations. Real-time Segmentation of satellite images is essential to detect fire, floods, volcanoes, earthquakes etc. of a specific geographical zone. Effective determination of such calamities and taking proactive measures can save a lot of lives and natural resources. In this paper, an efficient FSM based architecture is proposed for performing segmentation of satellite Images procured from NASA's Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 and Landsat 5. The K-means clustering algorithm even after five decades of it's existence is quite effective and mostly used for big data applications, owing to its lower complexity. However, it's effective implementation has started only in the last couple of years. Here a FSM-based reconfigurable architecture is proposed for K-means algorithm taking into consideration the real-time segmentation of satellite Images. Compared to other architectures in the literature, the proposed one has reduced hardware usage, lower area, power consumption with a satisfactory clock frequency, most importantly it is reconfigurable and can be used with the on-board circuitry within satellites. The testing is carried out on eight latest satellite images of natural and human devastations, taken from NASA's OLI. The number of possible clusters within the geographical image is studied with the help of histogram analysis based on Otsu's thresholding method. The performance analysis is carried out by computing the Peak Signal to Noise (PSNR) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (M-SSIM) of the resultant clusters. It is observed that by increasing the number of clusters, the detailed classes were effectively segmented and the quality of clustering is ensured by the improvement in PSNR and M-SSIM values. Comparison of the obtained clusters with their true land features also yielded satisfactory results.

TI  - Empirical Absolute Calibration Model for Multiple Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work extends an empirical absolute calibration model initially developed for the Libya 4 Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Site (PICS) to five additional Saharan Desert PICS (Egypt 1, Libya 1, Niger 1, Niger 2, and Sudan 1), and demonstrates the efficacy of the resulting models at predicting sensor top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. It attempts to generate absolute calibration models for these PICS that have an accuracy and precision comparable to or better than the current Libya 4 model, with the intent of providing additional opportunities for sensor calibration. In addition, this work attempts to validate the general applicability of the model to other sites. The method uses Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as the reference radiometer and Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion image data to provide a representative hyperspectral reflectance profile of the PICS. Data from a region of interest (ROI) in an optimal region of 3% temporal, spatial, and spectral stability within the PICS are used for developing the model. The developed models were used to simulate observations of the Landsat 7 (L7) Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel 2A (S2A) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel 2B (S2B) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) from their respective launch date through 2018. The models developed for the Egypt 1, Libya 1 and Sudan 1 PICS have an estimated accuracy of approximately 3% and precision of approximately 2% for the sensors used in the study, comparable to the current Libya 4 model. The models developed for the Niger 1 and Niger 2 sites are significantly less accurate with similar precision.

TI  - The AVTOD (ASTER Volcanic Thermal Output Database) Latin America archive
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal spaceborne remote sensing has been used to study, monitor, and forecast volcanic activity for decades. But these data have not been used systematically at high spatial resolution to study changes in volcano temperatures across an entire region spanning multiple decades to understand background thermal activity and its relation to unrest and eruption. We have developed a first-of-a-kind database that uses manual analysis to identify and collect data for volcanic thermal output with 90 m/pixel spatial resolution for 330 potentially active volcanoes found in Latin America between the years 2000-2017. This database is reliant on the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor due to its high spatial resolution data, capability of detecting low-level thermal features, its accessibility and reliability compared to similar data types, and the long time series available at multiple volcanoes.A total of 88 Latin American volcanoes were found to have some type of volcanic thermal feature detected by ASTER, and here we document thermal features at 16 of these volcanoes detected from space for the first time. We have recorded these thermal features, including the temperature above background, area above background, and the timing and location of detection in the ASTER Volcanic Thermal Output Database (AVTOD). By comprehensively analyzing such a large dataset, we are able to quantitatively analyze some of the issues with these data, including 24% of all volcanoes in this study failing to meet the acquisition rates proposed by the current acquisition plan and 44.5% of all acquisitions being unusable due to interference from clouds. We provide recommendations of how to update future acquisition plans that would focus on night-time and cloud-free acquisitions. In order to confirm the validity of AVTOD it was tested against the existing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based MIROVA database. In some cases, we found a high degree of correlation between the two datasets (r(2) = 0.87). In other cases, however, correlation was limited due to the difference in spatial resolution of these two data types. By examining the maximum temperature detected by every volcano in the database we found 46 that never reach a temperature high enough to be detected by MODIS-class thermal sensors. The information in this database provides new insights about volcanic activity both on its own, and in combination with other data types, as well as a data-driven approach to improve key features in future sensors.

TI  - Intraseason decline in influenza vaccine effectiveness during the 2016 southern hemisphere influenza season: A test-negative design study and phylogenetic assessment
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We estimated the effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine and the potential influence of timing of immunization on vaccine effectiveness (VE) using data from the 2016 southern hemisphere influenza season.Methods: Data were pooled from three routine syndromic sentinel surveillance systems in general practices in Australia. Each system routinely collected specimens for influenza testing from patients presenting with influenza-like illness. Next generation sequencing was used to characterize viruses. Using a test negative design, VE was estimated based on the odds of vaccination among influenza-positive cases as compared to influenza-negative controls. Subgroup analyses were used to estimate VE by type, subtype and lineage, as well as age group and time between vaccination and symptom onset.Results: A total of 1085 patients tested for influenza in 2016 were included in the analysis, of whom 447 (41%) tested positive for influenza. The majority of detections were influenza A/H3N2 (74%). One-third (31%) of patients received the 2016 southern hemisphere formulation influenza vaccine. Overall, VE was estimated at 40% (95% CI: 18-56%). VE estimates were highest for patients immunized within two months prior to symptom onset (VE: 60%; 95% CI: 26-78%) and lowest for patients immunized >4 months prior to symptom onset (VE: 19%; 95% CI: -73-62%).Discussion: Overall, the 2016 influenza vaccine showed good protection against laboratory-confirmed infection among general practice patients. Results by duration of vaccination suggest a significant decline in effectiveness during the 2016 influenza season, indicating immunization close to influenza season offered optimal protection.

T2  - MEDICINA BALEAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The epidemiological and virological characteristics of the 2017-2018 flu season in its aspects of mortality and age groups are analyzed.Patients and method: Respiratory samples from both the Sentinel Influenza Surveillance Network and patients treated in the emergency room and hospitalized in our center were subjected to the detection of respiratory viruses using a commercial genomic amplification technique, type RT-PCR (Allplex Respiratory Panel, Seegen, North Korea), which identifies 16 different respiratory viruses simultaneously and differentially. Among them influenza viruses A (H1N1) pdm09 and A (H3N2) and influenza virus type B, although no difference between their two lineages.Results: During the flu season, 6,465 respiratory samples were analyzed, of which 3,228 (49.9%) were considered positive (detection of a respiratory virus). Of these, in 1232 a flu virus was detected, representing 19% of all processed samples and 38.2% of all positive samples. Of all the influenza viruses detected, 661 (53.6%) were identified as influenza A and 571 (46.4%) influenza B. The RCVG contributed 127 (10.3%) positive samples, 58 (8.7%) group A and 69 (12%) Influenza B. The rest of the positive samples, 1,105 (89.7%), came from the hospital setting, that is, 603 (91.3%) were influenza A and 502 (88%) were influenza B. Regarding the subtypes of influenza A, They detected 415 (62.7%) cases of the subtype A (H1N1) pdm09, 38 (9.1%) of the RCVG and 377 (90.9%) of the hospital setting. Subtype A (H3N2) detected 246 (37.3%) cases, of which 20 (8.1%) belonged to the RCVG and 226 (91.9%) to the hospital setting. When analyzing the subtypes on the total samples of each provenance, it is verified that of the 58 cases of influenza A belonging to the RCVG 38 (65.5%) were A (H1N1) pdm09 and 20 (34.5%) A (H3N2). In the hospital setting, of the 603 cases of influenza A, 377 (62.5%) were A (H1N1) pdm09 and 226 (37.5%) were A (H3N2), no significant differences were observed.Conclusions: The 2017-2018 flu season should be considered as an atypical season in which the co-circulation of the four flu types / subtypes determined the highest epidemiological rate and the highest number of cases registered in the Balearic Islands.

TI  - Evaluating the Cooling Potential of Urban Green Spaces to Tackle Urban Climate Change in Lisbon
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase and optimization of urban vegetation has been considered an effective mitigation measure of an urban heat island (UHI), with positive effects on human thermal comfort. In this study, the cooling potential of all green spaces in Lisbon was estimated. For that, several mobile measurements of air temperature data were made in a single park (Gulbenkian's Garden). These measurements were used for the interpolation of air temperature. Furthermore, urban biomass was estimated using remote sensing products, namely Landsat satellite images. Ultimately, a linear regression model was built from the relation between vegetation density and air temperature. Results regarding the estimation of biomass (AGB) in the city of Lisbon were higher in winter than in summer. The urban green spaces cooling potential model showed that for every decrease of 1 degrees C in air temperature between a measuring point and a reference station we need to increase the area covered by vegetation by 50 m(2) (planar measure). This methodology can be applied in other urban areas for the quantification of the cooling effect provided by vegetation in order to improve urban climate thermal conditions and human well-being and, consequently, to mitigate some consequences of future climate change.

TI  - Human Monkeypox in Sierra Leone after 44-Year Absence of Reported Cases
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Letter
AB  - We note the reemergence of human monkeypox in Sierra Leone following a 44-year absence of reported disease. The persons affected were an 11-month-old boy and, several years later, a 35-year-old man. The reappearance of monkeypox in this country suggests a need for renewed vigilance and awareness of the disease and its manifestations.

TI  - Stability of symptom clusters and sentinel symptoms during the first two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeAscertaining the stability of symptom clusters and identifying sentinel symptoms have been top priorities in symptom cluster research. Identifying sentinel symptoms would help to determine the underlying mechanisms of symptom clusters and facilitate effective symptom management. This study aimed to evaluate the stability of symptom clusters during the 1st and 2nd cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (CTx) and to identify sentinel symptoms.MethodsThis is a secondary data analysis of data from the Paradigm Shift in Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (PS-CINV) study. Data utilized were from cancer patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and completed symptom evaluation in the 1st and 2nd cycles (N=209). The severity of 20 symptoms was evaluated on a 0-to-10 numeric rating scale. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses identified symptom clusters, and principal variable analysis identified sentinel symptoms.ResultsAmong 20 symptoms, 13 symptoms formed 4 symptom clusters in the 1st cycle: a physical-psychological (pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression), a gastrointestinal (nausea, loss of appetite, taste change), a fatigue-cognitive (fatigue, difficulty concentrating, drowsiness), and a urosexual (urinary problem, sexual problem) symptom cluster. During the 2nd cycle, stable symptom clusters were identified, with merging of the physical-psychological and fatigue-cognitive symptom clusters, resulting in three clusters. Sentinel symptoms were identified in the following order: anxiety, loss of appetite and fatigue (1st cycle) and loss of appetite, depression, and fatigue (2nd cycle).ConclusionSymptom clusters demonstrated phase-specific stability. The current study identified a core set of symptoms that form stable symptom clusters during the 1st and 2nd cycles of CTx. Principal variable analysis identified sentinel symptoms which could facilitate efficient symptom management.

TI  - Forest biomass retrieval approaches from earth observation in different biomes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount and spatial distribution of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) were estimated using a range of regionally developed methods using Earth Observation data for Poland, Sweden and regions in Indonesia (Kalimantan), Mexico (Central Mexico and Yucatan peninsula), and South Africa (Eastern provinces) for the year 2010. These regions are representative of numerous forest biomes and biomass levels globally, from South African woodlands and savannas to the humid tropical forest of Kalimantan. AGB retrieval in each region relied on different sources of reference data, including forest inventory plot data and airborne LiDAR observations, and used a range of retrieval algorithms. This is the widest inter-comparison of regional-to-national AGB maps to date in terms of area, forest types, input datasets, and retrieval methods. The accuracy assessment of all regional maps using independent field data or LiDAR AGB maps resulted in an overall root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 10 t ha(-1) to 55 t ha(-1) (37% to 67% relative RMSE), and an overall bias ranging from -1 t ha(-1) to +5 t ha(-1) at pixel level. The regional maps showed better agreement with field data than previously developed and widely used pan-tropical or northern hemisphere datasets. The comparison of accuracy assessments showed commonalities in error structures despite the variety of methods, input data, and forest biomes. All regional retrievals resulted in overestimation (up to 63 t ha(-1)) in the lower AGB classes, and underestimation (up to 85 t ha(-1)) in the higher AGB classes. Parametric model-based algorithms present advantages due to their low demand on in situ data compared to non-parametric algorithms, but there is a need for datasets and retrieval methods that can overcome the biases at both ends of the AGB range. The outcomes of this study should be considered when developing algorithms to estimate forest biomass at continental to global scale level.

TI  - CROP DATA RETRIEVAL USING EARTH OBSERVATION DATA TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop data are essential for reliable irrigation water requirements (IWR) calculations, which can be acquired during the crop growth season for a given region using earth observation (EO) satellite time series. In addition, a relationship between crop coefficients and the NDVI can be established to allow for crop evapotranspiration estimation. The main objective of the present work was to develop a methodology, and its implementation in an application software, to extract crop parameters from EO image time series for a set of parcels of different types of crops, to be used as input data for a soil water balance model to compute IWR. The methodology was tested at two distinct test sites, the Vila Franca de Xira (site I) and Vila Velha de Rodao (site II) municipalities, Portugal. Landsat-7 and -8 images acquired from April to October 2013 were used for site I, while SPOT-5 Take-5 images from April to September 2015 were considered for site II. EO data were used to estimate the basal crop coefficients, planting dates, and crops growth stage lengths. Based on crop, soil and meteorological data, the IWR for the main crops of both test regions were estimated using the IrrigRotation model. The crop coefficient curves obtained from the EO data proved to be reliable for IWR estimation.

TI  - Efficacy of mass drug administration with ivermectin for control of scabies and impetigo, with coadministration of azithromycin: a single-arm community intervention trial
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In small community-based trials, mass drug administration of ivermectin has been shown to substantially decrease the prevalence of both scabies and secondary impetigo; however, their effect at large scale is untested. Additionally, combined mass administration of drugs for two or more neglected diseases has potential practical advantages, but efficacy of potential combinations should be confirmed.Methods The azithromycin ivermectin mass drug administration (AIM) trial was a prospective, single-arm, before-and-after, community intervention study to assess the efficacy of mass drug administration of ivermectin for scabies and impetigo, with coadministration of azithromycin for trachoma. Mass drug administration was offered to the entire population of Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands, and of this population we randomly selected two sets of ten sentinel villages for monitoring, one at baseline and the other at 12 months. Participants were offered a single dose of 20 mg/kg azithromycin, using weight-based bands. Children weighing less than 12.5 kg received azithromycin oral suspension (20 mg/kg), and infants younger than 6 months received topical 1% tetracycline ointment. For ivermectin, participants were offered two doses of oral ivermectin 200 mu g/kg 7-14 days apart using weight-based bands, or 5% permethrin cream 7-14 days apart if ivermectin was contraindicated. Our study had the primary outcomes of safety and feasibility of large-scale mass coadministration of oral ivermectin and azithromycin, which have been previously reported. We report here the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in residents of the ten baseline villages compared with those in the ten 12-month villages, as measured by examination of the skin, which was a secondary outcome of the trial. Further outcomes were comparison of the number of all-cause outpatient attendances at government clinics in Choiseul Province at various timepoints before and after mass drug administration. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Trials Registry (ACTRN12615001199505).Findings During September, 2015, over 4 weeks, 26 188 people (99.3% of the estimated population of Choiseul [n=26 372] as determined at the 2009 census) were treated. At baseline, 1399 (84.2%) of 1662 people living in the first ten villages had their skin examined, of whom 261 (18.7%) had scabies and 347 (24.8%) had impetigo. At 12 months after mass drug administration, 1261 (77.6%) of 1625 people in the second set of ten villages had their skin examined, of whom 29 (2.3%) had scabies (relative reduction 88%, 95% CI 76.5-99.3) and 81 (6.4%) had impetigo (relative reduction 74%, 63.4-84.7). In the 3 months after mass drug administration, 10 614 attended outpatient clinics for any reason compared with 16 602 in the 3 months before administration (decrease of 36.1%, 95% CI 34.7-37.6), and during this period attendance for skin sores, boils, and abscesses decreased by 50.9% (95% CI 48.6-53.1).Interpretation Ivermectin-based mass drug administration can be scaled to a population of over 25 000 with high efficacy and this level of efficacy can be achieved when mass drug administration for scabies is integrated with mass drug administration of azithromycin for trachoma. These findings will contribute to development of population-level control strategies. Further research is needed to assess durability and scalability of mass drug administration in larger, non-island populations, and to assess its effect on the severe bacterial complications of scabies.

TI  - Haitian Children's Disaster Trauma: Validation of Pictorial Assessment of Resilience and Vulnerability
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test has been culturally adapted for Haitian children and objectively scored for resilience and vulnerability (Roysircar, Colvin, Afolayan, Thompson, & Robertson, 2017). The HTP was used to assess 88 Haitian children's adjustment to the 2010 earthquake and the continuous trauma of societal inequalities. The study examined the validity of the adapted HTP test and its dimensionality. The study included participant interviews with child self-report measures of self-esteem, as perceived by self, peers, and family; posttraumatic symptoms; and self-concept. All measures were translated and administered in Creole. Analyses included standardized sample scores; descriptive statistics; internal consistency reliability; interscale correlations; a generalizability study showing that there were no differences in HTP scores due to novice or expert raters; and an exploratory factor analysis of HTP scores indicating three factors and accounting for just under 50% of the variance. The three dimensions, HTP Resilience-Vulnerability Integrated, House Feeling Safe, and Person Feeling Unloved, are discussed within the international literature on child disaster trauma assessed pictorially, and within Haitians' spiritual worldview of suffering and endurance.

TI  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in two different populations of northern cardinals
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) is a good indicator species for environmental contaminants because it does not migrate and its range covers a diversity of habitats, including metropolitan Atlanta, GA and the geographically isolated Hawaiian Islands. In addition, the cardinal is often found near people's homes, making it likely to be exposed to the same outdoor elements, including soil, groundwater, and air, that surrounding humans experience. In this study, blood serum concentrations of 12 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were measured in 40 cardinals from Atlanta and 17 cardinals from the Big Island (Hawaii), HI. We observed significantly higher median concentrations of four PFASs and significantly higher detection frequencies of seven PFASs in the cardinals from Atlanta, relative to the PFAS median concentrations and detection frequencies observed in the cardinals from Hawaii (alpha = 0.05). Among the PFASs measured, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was observed in the highest concentrations. A linear regression model controlling for sex, age, and airport distance did not explain PFOS variation within the Atlanta samples, but a similar model explained 90% of PFOS variation within the Hawaii samples. To our knowledge, these are the first measurements of PFASs in northern cardinals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-Term Benefits of Short-Term Research-Integrated Study Abroad
T2  - JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Study abroad and research experiences are proven high-impact pedagogical tools, but are rarely combined at scale. We integrated highly structured research experiences into short-term study abroad programs across multiple countries, then tested for longer term student perceived impacts. Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of postgraduation data provided by 118 former participants, we identified positive self-reported impacts across a range of domains relevant to longer term academic and career success (e.g., professional connections, specific skills, worldview, and personal growth). Themes and subthemes were consistently similar by minority status, gender, and program locations. Inclusion of highly structured research experiences in short-term study abroad can provide additional value to students. The benefits would accrue most especially to women and minority students who have less on-campus access to traditional science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)-field research mentoring and are accordingly underrepresented in the research-career pipeline.

AB  - Despite new horizons opened by recent advances in molecular pathology, histological evaluation still remains the diagnostic gold standard regarding cutaneous melanocytic neoplasms. Several histological variants of melanoma have been described, and their knowledge is crucial for accurate diagnosis and classification of cases with unusual clinico-pathological features. Uncommon histological variants of melanoma have been described based on a broad constellation of features, including architectural pattern, stromal alterations, cytological attributes, and other morphological properties. This review is aimed at providing an extensive discussion of unusual but distinctive histopathological variants of melanoma.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 64th Annual Meeting of the American-Rhinologic-Society (ARS) at the Annual Meeting of the Academy-of-Otolaryngology-Head-and-Neck-Society
CL  - Atlanta, GA
AB  - Background Frontal sinusotomy can be challenging when significant scarring or distorted anatomy is present. Identifying a reliable anatomic structure, when traditional landmarks or navigation are absent, may assist the surgeon in revision and complicated frontal sinusotomies via a midline approach. We aimed to characterize the anatomic relationship of the nasal branch of the anterior ethmoid artery (NBAEA) to the frontal infundibulum, specifically the first olfactory fili, posterior frontal infundibulum, and anterior cribriform plate. Methods Dissection of the NBAEA was carried out in 11 cadaveric heads, resulting in a total of 21 dissections (1 aplastic frontal). Mean with standard deviation and a range were established for 7 relative measurements. Results The total length of NBAEA cleft when present (mean 2.43 mm), the anterior edge of NBAEA cleft to anterior infundibulum coronal plane (mean 1.71 mm), the posterior edge of NBAEA cleft to posterior infundibulum coronal plane (mean 3.33 mm), the posterior edge of NBAEA cleft to 1st olfactory fili (mean 2.86 mm), and the first olfactory fili to posterior infundibulum coronal plane (mean 0.48 mm) were consistent measurements supporting the use of the NBAEA as a consistent anatomical landmark for the correct surgical coronal trajectory into the midline frontal sinus. Conclusion The NBAEA is a consistent anatomic landmark with minimal intercadaveric and intracadaveric variation. It can be used reliably as a "sentinel artery" notifying the surgeon when one is approaching the first olfactory fili, to determine the correct trajectory into the midline frontal sinus.

TI  - Clustering Tools for Integration of Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery and Proximal Soil Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) and proximal soil sensing (PSS) technologies offer an advanced array of methods for obtaining soil property information and determining soil variability for precision agriculture. A large amount of data collected by these sensors may provide essential information for precision or site-specific management in a production field. Data clustering techniques are crucial for data mining, and high-density data analysis is important for field management. A new clustering technique was introduced and compared with existing clustering tools to determine the relatively homogeneous parts of agricultural fields. A DUALEM-21S sensor, along with high-accuracy topography data, was used to characterize soil variability in three agricultural fields situated in Ontario, Canada. Sentinel-2 data assisted in quantifying bare soil and vegetation indices (VIs). The custom Neighborhood Search Analyst (NSA) data clustering tool was implemented using Python scripts. In this algorithm, part of the variance of each data layer is accounted for by subdividing the field into smaller, relatively homogeneous, areas. The algorithm's attributes were illustrated using field elevation, shallow and deep apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), and several VIs. The unique feature of this proposed protocol was the successful development of user-friendly and open source options for defining the spatial continuity of each group and for use in the zone delineation process.

TI  - Simulating land use for protecting food crop areas in northeast Thailand using GIS and Dyna-CLUE
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use in the northeast region of Thailand has changed dramatically in the past two decades. These changes are mainly due to the government policies, which launched a scheme to promote rubber plantation during 2003-2013 targeting to solve the problem of poverty in the region. At least 50,000 ha of paddy fields were found to be converted to other land use types between 2002 and 2012. This study was conducted in Nong Khai and Bueng Kan province of northeast Thailand, where massive rubber plantation is going on prompting significant amount of land-use change, with the objective of investigating how land-use changes will affect on food availability in future. We analyzed land-use changes of the past and simulated future land uses using GIS and Landsat Thematic Mapper Data. The most obvious change was the decrease in paddy field and an increase in rubber plantation. This eventually leads to decreased paddy production affecting food supply of farm households. The land use projections for 2032 were done for three scenarios using Dyna-CLUE model. Unlike business as usual scenario, which will further decrease the paddy area, other scenarios with different land use policies if implemented will help protect paddy areas and thus achieving higher food production locally. The lack of implementation of proper spatial policies will lead to a further loss of paddy areas at macro level. The smallholder farmers may be highly vulnerable to land use-change and experience significant food crop losses, food insecurity and income loss when they change the land to rubber and there is market failure.

TI  - A Simple Red Tide Monitoring Method using Sentinel-2 Data for Sustainable Management of Brackish Lake Koyama-ike, Japan
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We proposed and validated a method for monitoring red tides in the brackish Lake Koyama-ike, Japan, using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data with a 10 m spatial resolution. To achieve this objective, we acquired 36 spectral reflectance/Chla data points in the field from 2012 to 2018. We obtained a high correlation of Chla (R-2 = 0.83) using the proposed red tide model (RIKY = [MSI Band 5 - MSI Band 4]/[MSI Band 5 + MSI Band 4]) and field data. Based on our results, the proposed model was also validated using five Sentinel-2/Chla datasets from April to August 2017. Chla and red tide distribution characteristics estimated from Sentinel-2 data hardly appeared from April to July, and then spread rapidly throughout the lake (more than 70%) in August. Thus, Sentinel-2 data proved to be a very powerful tool in monitoring red tides in Lake Koyama-ike.

TI  - Potential role of dogs as sentinels and reservoirs for piroplasms infecting equine and cattle in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Canine tick-borne diseases have been considered emerging and re-emerging threats, given their increasing global prevalence. In this molecular survey, we aimed to detect and identify common tick-borne pathogens in dogs from Riyadh city in Saudi Arabia. Initially, the study included 36 dogs visiting private veterinary clinics. PCRs targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) of haemoparasites (Babesia, Theileria and Hepatozoon) and the 16S rDNA of Anaplasmataceae were performed. The results showed that 26 (72.2%) dogs were infected by some of the haemoparasites under investigation. The sequencing analysis of the amplicons confirmed the infections due to two parasite species Theileria equi and Theileria velifera. Further examination of guard dogs kept in the horse stables of the Riyadh Municipality revealed that the majority of the tested dogs (65.2%: 30 out of 46) were infected with either of the parasites. In addition, the genotypes of all the parasites in these dogs were identical to those of the parasites in the dogs from the veterinary clinics. Thus, it can be concluded that dogs are infected with these haemoparasites and serve as a reservoir for both T. equi and T. velifera in the study area; however, the clinical implication of this finding is to be studied.

TI  - Modern Trends and Problems of Soil Mapping
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main trends in the development of soil mapping methods are discussed, and the major problems are identified. By the present time, the transition from the paper-based soil maps to digital soil-geographical databases has already been completed. The digital mapping of soils and their properties is now accepted as the main method at all the levels of generalization. The approaches of digital soil mapping, as well as of the traditional one, are based on the ideas of V.V. Dokuchaev about the dependence of soils on soil-forming factors. However, in digital soil mapping, new achievements of mathematical statistics and mathematical modeling are being widely applied. This provides for a greater objectivity and reproducibility of the digital soil maps in comparison with the traditional soil maps. At the same time, all unsolved problems of soil cartography related to the lack of field observation data, scale, soil taxonomy, spatial microheterogeneity, and mapping of individual soil properties are preserved. Partially, these problems can be solved by using remote sensing data. When the soil geographical information is used to assess the quality of soil resources, the interpretation of remote sensing data for mapping purposes seems to be more preferable in comparison with the methods of digital soil mapping.

TI  - How to slow the global spread of small hive beetles, Aethina tumida
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Small hive beetles (SHBs) are parasites of social bee colonies endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and have become a widespread invasive species. In the new ranges, SHBs can cause damage to apiculture and wild bees. Although the further spread seems inevitable, eradication of new introductions and containment of established ones are nevertheless urgently required to slow down the invasion speed until better mitigation options are available. However, at present there is no adequate action plan at hand. Here, we propose to take advantage of SHB invasion history and biology to enrol a feasible plan involving all stakeholders. Raising awareness, education and motivation of stakeholders (incl. adequate and timely compensation of beekeepers) is essential for success. Moreover, sentinel apiaries are recommended in areas at risk, because early detection is crucial for the success of eradication efforts. Given that introductions are detected early, SHB eradication is recommended, incl. destruction of all infested apiaries, installation of sentinel colonies to lure escaped SHBs and a ban on migratory beekeeping. If wild perennial social bee colonies are infested, eradication programs are condemned to fail and a strategic switch to a containment strategy is recommended. Containment includes adequate integrated pest management and a strict ban on migratory beekeeping. Despite considerable gaps in our knowledge of SHBs, the proposed action plan will help stakeholders to slow down the global spread of SHBs.

TI  - Evaluation of Land Cover Change and Agricultural Protection Sites: A GIS and Remote Sensing Approach for Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), economic center and most populous city of Vietnam faces a strong structural change since its market liberalization in the late 1980s. Big challenges occur in the form of uncontrolled urban sprawl due to rapid population growth with encroachment of agricultural land, which leads to environmental and climatic issues like urban heat island effects, air pollution and flooding events. Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide new computer-based technologies for urban planners which can greatly ease the monitoring of agricultural loss as well as improve decision making for future land management. In the first part of this study, land cover change dynamics are thoroughly assessed using moderate and high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat and SPOT) over the period 2010-2017 in 22 districts of HCMC. In the second part, the land cover classification results of 2017 provide the initial map for a GIS-based Multi-Criteria-Decision-Analysis (MCDA) of potential agricultural protection sites. Therefore, criteria of climate adaptation and ecological service are established and embedded in the GIS-compatible Compromise Programming Model (CP). With the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) by Thomas L. Saaty and additional expert knowledge, appropriate weighting factors have been affiliated. The results show that agricultural land decreased by more than two thirds in the period considered. However, particularly the western rural districts Binh Chanh and Hoc Mon still offer a great amount of valuable agricultural land suitable for protection. The proposed method can serve as a scientific framework for planning departments of fast growing cities to zone agricultural land for protection on an early planning stage in order to ensure sustainable land use development in the future.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Consistent Time-Variable Water Surfaces of Lakes and Reservoirs Based on Landsat and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a new approach for the automated extraction of high-resolution time-variable water surfaces is presented. For that purpose, optical images from Landsat and Sentinel-2 are used between January 1984 and June 2018. The first part of this new approach is the extraction of land-water masks by combining five water indexes and using an automated threshold computation. In the second part of this approach, all data gaps caused by voids, clouds, cloud shadows, or snow are filled by using a long-term water probability mask. This mask is finally used in an iterative approach for filling remaining data gaps in all monthly masks which leads to a gap-less surface area time series for lakes and reservoirs. The results of this new approach are validated by comparing the surface area changes with water level time series from gauging stations. For inland waters in remote areas without in situ data water level time series from satellite altimetry are used. Overall, 32 globally distributed lakes and reservoirs of different extents up to 2482.27 km2 are investigated. The average correlation coefficients between surface area time series and water levels from in situ and satellite altimetry have increased from 0.611 to 0.862 after filling the data gaps which is an improvement of about 41%. This new approach clearly demonstrates the quality improvement for the estimated land-water masks but also the strong impact of a reliable data gap-filling approach. All presented surface area time series are freely available on the Database of Hydrological Time Series of Inland (DAHITI).

T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EVIDENZ FORTBILDUNG UND QUALITAET IM GESUNDHEITSWESEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Critical Incident Reporting Systems (CIRS) support the analysis of critical incidents and foster quality improvement in healthcare. The analysis of CIRS reports by designated CIRS teams enable organizational learning. To maintain a constructive work flow CIRS teams should be able to self-assess their work. We adapted the checklist used by the Dutch Healthcare Inspectorate to judge the quality of sentinel event analysis reports provided by hospitals.Method: The 26 items of the Dutch checklist were translated into German and culturally adapted to be used in a Swiss university hospital. Relevance and comprehensibility were rated by experts applying the Content Validity Index on item level (I-CVI) and on the checklist level (S-CVI). Five CIRS team members tested the usefulness of the revised checklist and provided feedback which we used to further revise the checklist.Results: Comprehensibility of the 19 items ranged from 58.3 % to 100 %, and the I-CVI ranged between 0.17 and 1.0. The S-CVI achieved a good 0.80. For reasons of clarity we modified, deleted and added items. CIRS team members regarded this further adapted 15-item checklist to be of limited utility.Discussion: The adapted checklist for self-assessment of the CIRS teams' work flow received good ratings for content validity but its usefulness for CIRS teams was found to be limited. The checklist may benefit from further development.

TI  - Rate of peri-procedural stroke observed with cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a patient-level propensity-matched analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims The role of cerebral embolic protection (CEP) in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains controversial. Randomized trials have not been powered to demonstrate a reduction in stroke rates. The aim of this patient level pooled analysis was to validate the impact of the dual-filter CEP device (Claret Medical Inc., CA, USA) on peri-procedural stroke in a large number of TAVR patients.Methods and results Patients from the SENTINEL US IDE trial were combined with the CLEAN-TAVI and SENTINEL-Ulm study in a patient level pooled analysis (N = 1306). Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for possible confounders. The primary endpoint was procedural stroke within 72 h post-TAVR according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The secondary endpoint was the combination of all-cause mortality or all-stroke within 72 h after TAVR. In the propensity-matched population, 533 patients underwent TAVR without CEP and 533 patients underwent TAVR with CEP. TAVR patients without vs. with CEP were similar with respect to baseline characteristics, procedural approach, or valve type. In patients undergoing TAVR with dual-filter CEP, procedural all-stroke was significantly lower compared with unprotected procedures [1.88% vs. 5.44%, odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.72, relative risk reduction 65%, P = 0.0028]. In addition, all-cause mortality and all-stroke were significantly lower (2.06% vs. 6.00%, odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.17-0.68, relative risk reduction 66%, P = 0.0013).Conclusion Our findings suggest that TAVR with the dual-filter CEP device is associated with a significant lower rate of peri-procedural stroke compared with unprotected procedures. However, randomized trials are still needed to clarify this issue.

TI  - Beyond refuges: Identifying temporally dynamic havens to support ecological resistance and resilience to climatic disturbances
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Little can be done by natural resource managers to abate climatic extremes such as drought, so assisting ecological communities to withstand and to recover from extreme events is likely to be an effective strategy for reducing the impacts of changing climate conditions on biodiversity. We present a framework for identifying locations that are likely to increase the capacity of biota to withstand disturbances ('resistance') and to recover when adverse conditions abate ('resilience'). Our study ecosystem was the river red-gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) floodplain forests of the Murray River, southeastern Australia. We tracked forest-stand condition of river red-gum forests during and after a prolonged drought (the Big Dry) using models based on remotely sensed data and ground-truthed vegetation measurements of forest-stand condition. Native birds and small mammals respond positively to stand condition. We used spatial optimization to rank the region based on forest-stand condition at multiple time-points during a 13 yr drought and 2 yr after the drought ceased. We identified areas that ranked in the top portion of the landscape in either period to identify `resistance havens' and 'resilience havens' respectively and assessed the extent to which these overlapped. Although there was overlap in the top ranked areas, there were differences in the areas identified as havens (top 25% ranking) in both periods, with a 55.5% overlap between areas identified as havens in either period. This overlap was lower (40.1%) when considering the most highly ranked (top 10%) areas. Concentrating only on locations that provide protection from adverse conditions (i.e. refugia) is likely to be ineffective for conservation management in increasingly changeable environmental conditions because areas that facilitate resistance will not necessarily be the same as areas that support recovery. Acknowledging and incorporating the concepts of ecological resistance and resilience into landscape management is vital if managers are to lessen the ecological effects of intensified disturbance regimes associated with climate change.

TI  - An in-situ data based model to downscale radiometric satellite soil moisture products in the Upper Hunter Region of NSW, Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution soil moisture information is important for hydrological, climatic and agricultural applications. The lack of high resolution soil moisture data over large areas at the required accuracy is a major impediment for such applications. This study investigates the feasibility of downscaling satellite soil moisture products to 1 km resolution. This study was undertaken in the semi-arid Goulbum River Catchment, located in south-eastern Australia. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-Enhanced 9 km (L3SMP-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) 25 km gridded (SMOS CATDS L3 SM 3-DAY) radiometric products were compared with in-situ soil moisture observations and a regression tree model was developed for downscaling based on thermal inertia theory. Observations from a long-term soil moisture monitoring network were employed to develop a regression tree model between the diurnal temperature difference and the daily mean soil moisture for soils with different clay content and vegetation greenness. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures were used to estimate the soil moisture at high spatial resolution by disaggregating the satellite soil moisture products through the regression model. The downscaled SMAP-Enhanced 9 km and SMOS 25 km gridded soil moisture products showed unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSE) of 0.07 and 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, against the in-situ data. These ubRMSEs include errors caused by measuring instrument and the scale mismatch between downscaled products and in-situ data. An RMSE of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) was observed when comparing the downscaled soil moisture against the passive airborne L-band retrievals. The findings here auger well for the use of satellite remote sensing for the assessment of high resolution soil moisture.

TI  - Real-time processing of social media with SENTINEL: A syndromic surveillance system incorporating deep learning for health classification
T2  - INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in real-time syndromic surveillance based on social media data has greatly increased in recent years. The ability to detect disease outbreaks earlier than traditional methods would be highly useful for public health officials. This paper describes a software system which is built upon recent developments in machine learning and data processing to achieve this goal. The system is built from reusable modules integrated into data processing pipelines that are easily deployable and configurable. It applies deep learning to the problem of classifying health-related tweets and is able to do so with high accuracy. It has the capability to detect illness outbreaks from Twitter data and then to build up and display information about these outbreaks, including relevant news articles, to provide situational awareness. It also provides nowcasting functionality of current disease levels from previous clinical data combined with Twitter data.The preliminary results are promising, with the system being able to detect outbreaks of influenza-like illness symptoms which could then be confirmed by existing official sources. The Nowcasting module shows that using social media data can improve prediction for multiple diseases over simply using traditional data sources.

TI  - Landscape Design as a Tool to Reduce Soil Salinization: The Study Case of Keriya Oasis (NW China)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrational use and management of water and land are associated with poor hydro-geological conditions causing water logging and salinization problems, possibly leading to farmland abandonment and economic loss. This poses a great challenge to the sustainability of oasis' and requires desalinization through reasonable landscape design by multiple crossing studies so we collected traditional knowledge by field interviews and literature schemes, except for the modern desalinization approaches by literature, and we found that the salinization problem has been solved by traditional land reclamation, traditional drainage, natural drainage and flood irrigation, locally. It is worth mentioning that the traditional reclamation in salinized areas requires flood water, sand dunes and a salinized pit area; the sand dunes are used to elevate the pit surface, and water is used to leach salt from the soil. Natural drainage (the depth and width are 4-10 m and 50-100 m, respectively) caused by flash flooding has significant benefits to some salinized villages in the range of 3000-5000 m and ancient groundwater drainage systems, such as Karez are supporting the oasis with drainage water for centuries. In addition landscape characteristics, salinization and hydro-geological conditions of the oasis were studied from Landsat image, DEM, literature and field photos. Then based on the gathered information above, a desalinization model was developed to decrease the groundwater table and salt leaching in the water logging landscape. Then according to landscape characteristics, different desalinization approaches were recommended for different landscapes. To address environmental uncertainties, an adaptive landscape management and refinement approach was developed, and acceptance of the model was validated by stakeholder opinion. The results provide guidelines for sustainable desalinization design and highlight the importance of combining traditional knowledge and modern ecological principles in sustainable landscape design.

TI  - Progressive scheme for blending empirical ocean color retrievals of absorption coefficient and chlorophyll concentration from open oceans to highly turbid waters
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve a smooth transition between algorithms for "clear" water and "turbid" water, we propose a single formula to calculate the input parameter (ip) used for empirical retrieval of absorption coefficients (a) or chlorophyll concentration ([Chl]) from remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). This formula for ip takes the ratio of the maximum R-rs in the blue-green bands to the sum of R-rs(green) and the scaled R-rs in the red and infrared bands (termed as ip(Max-Sum)). We found that, compared to the widely used OC4-type formula for ip, ip(Max-Sum) can improve the coefficient of determination from similar to 0.88 to 0.99 for absorption coefficient at 440 nm [a(440)] in similar to 0.01-20.0 m(-1) ([Chl] similar to 0.01-500 mg m(-3)). Especially, the sensitivity of ip(Max-Sum) to the change in a(440) is about five times greater than that of OC4-type for a(440) > similar to 1.0 m(-1) ([Chl] > similar to 10 mg m(-3)). These results indicate an advantage of ip(Max-Sum) for generating robust and seamless a(440) or [Chl] from clear to highly turbid waters. The inclusion of such a scheme in a quasi-analytical algorithm is also presented. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America

TI  - A Spectral Unmixing Method by Maximum Margin Criterion and Derivative Weights to Address Spectral Variability in Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited to the low spatial resolution of the hyperspectral imaging sensor, mixed pixels are inevitable in hyperspectral images. Therefore, to obtain the endmembers and corresponding fractions in mixed pixels, hyperspectral unmixing becomes a hot spot in the field of remote sensing. Endmember spectral variability (ESV), which is common in hyperspectral images, affects spectral unmixing accuracy. This paper proposes a spectral unmixing method based on maximum margin criterion and derivative weights (MDWSU) to reduce the effect of ESV on spectral unmixing. Firstly, in the MDWSU model, an effective and fast algorithm is employed for establishing the endmember spectral library. Then a spectral weighting matrix based on the maximum margin criterion is constructed based on the endmember spectral library. Besides, derivative analysis and local neighborhood weights are merged into local neighborhood derivative weights, which act as a regularization term to penalize different abundance vectors. Local neighborhood derivative weights and spectral weighting matrix are proved to reduce the effect of ESV. Real hyperspectral data experiments show that the MDWSU model can obtain more accurate endmembers and abundance estimation. In addition, the experimental results, including the spectral angle distance and the root mean square error, prove the superiority of the MDWSU model over the previous methods.

T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mnogovershinnoe epithermal gold-silver deposit is located on the northern part of the East Sikhote-Alin magmatic belt of Northeast Russia. This deposit is related to the intrusion of a large multiphase Paleogene Bekchiul granitoid pluton. The research area underwent several episodes of intrusion magmatism, volcanism and isostatic uplifting because of its location at the junction point of large tectonic structures of Asia. The integration of in situ observations, geological mapping data, analysis of the Landsat 8 images and digital elevation data provides insights into the Meso-Cenozoic evolution of the Bekchiul magmatic center. Events in the Neogene-Quaternary were sufficiently restored by detecting areas with anomalous differences from the base level surfaces for the second- and third-order streams and numerical modeling. The anomalous values of the base levels difference far exceed the amplitude of sea level regression during the Neo-Pleistocene. The proposed methodological approach considered isostatic uplifting and sustaining activity as guiding factors in the development of the Bekchiul volcano-plutonic center.

TI  - Biomass burning aerosol characteristics for different vegetation types in different aging periods
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Eighteen years of sun/sky photometer measurements at seven worldwide AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites in typical biomass burning regions were used in this research. The AERONET measurements were analyzed with the help of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products and the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The variation in the physicochemical and optical properties of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs), as well as their shortwave radiative forcing, was revealed for different vegetation types in different aging periods. The result indicated that, with aerosol aging, the BBA characteristics have a non-negligible evolution trend with obvious clustering features for different burning vegetation types. During the aging process, the volume fraction of black carbon (BC) declined (with a maximum drop of 38%) accompanied by particle size growth (with a maximum increment of 0.017 mu m). Driven by the change in physicochemical properties, the Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) and the asymmetry factor increased as the aerosol aged (with maximum increments of 0.026 and 0.018 for the SSA and asymmetry factor respectively). The grass and shrub type had a higher volume fraction of BC (2.5 times higher than that in the forest and peat type) and a smaller fine mode volume median radius (with a difference of 0.037 mu m from that of the forest and peat type). Such a phenomenon results in a lower SSA (with a difference of 0.103) and asymmetry factor (with a difference of 0.035) in the grass and shrub type when compared to the forest and peat type. Negative (-74 to -30 W/m(2)) clear-sky top of atmosphere (TOA) shortwave radiative forcing, strengthened during the aging process, was generally found for BBA. The BBA in the forest and peat region usually had stronger negative radiative forcing efficiency.

TI  - Nonlocal Compressive Sensing-Based SAR Tomography
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR) inversion of urban areas is an inherently sparse reconstruction problem and, hence, can be solved using compressive sensing (CS) algorithms. This paper proposes solutions for two notorious problems in this field. First, TomoSAR requires a high number of data sets, which makes the technique expensive. However, it can be shown that the number of acquisitions and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be traded off against each other, because it is asymptotically only the product of the number of acquisitions and SNR that determines the reconstruction quality. We propose to increase SNR by integrating nonlocal (NL) estimation into the inversion and show that a reasonable reconstruction of buildings from only seven interferograms is feasible. Second, CS-based inversion is computationally expensive and therefore, barely suitable for large-scale applications. We introduce a new fast and accurate algorithm for solving the NL L1-L2-minimization problem, central to CS-based reconstruction algorithms. The applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated using simulated data and TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight images over an area in Munich, Germany.

TI  - Two rare cases of endosalpingiosis in the axillary sentinel lymph nodes: evaluation of immunohistochemical staining and one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay in patients with breast cancer
T2  - VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Benign inclusions, such as endosalpingiosis, in an axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) can be misdiagnosed as metastatic breast carcinoma. However, endosalpingiosis is rare in lymph nodes above the diaphragm. Among 792 patients with breast carcinoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at our center, 2 patients have experienced benign glandular inclusions in 3 SLNs, and all of these glandular inclusions were lined with columnar and ciliated epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the epithelial cells were positive for Mullerian markers (e.g., PAX8 and WT-1) and negative for mammary markers (e.g., mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, and GATA3), which confirm the diagnosis of endosalpingiosis. The epithelial cells were positive for CK19 but the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay revealed negative results for the axillary SLNs. Although endosalpingiosis is rare in axillary SLNs, care is needed to identify these rare cases and avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection, overstaging, and overtreatment.

TI  - Satellite-based analysis of the spatial patterns of fire- and storm-related forest disturbances in the Ural region, Russia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale wildfires and windstorms are the most important disturbance agents for the Russian boreal forests. The paper presents an assessment of fire-related and wind-induced forest losses in the Ural region of Russia for 2000-2014. The assessment is based on the use of Landsat images, Global Forest Change dataset (Hansen et al. in Science 342:850-853, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1244693) and other space imagery data. The total area of stand-replacement fires and windthrows in the Ural's forests was estimated at 1.637 million ha, which is 1.56% of the total forest-covered area. The contribution of wildfires and windthrows is 96.4% and 3.6%, respectively. The highest frequency of large-scale wildfires was observed behind the Northern Ural ridge, where the fire scars of 20002014 covered 10-14% of the forested area. The storm-related forest damage is significant only on the western part of the Ural. A few catastrophic wildfires and windthrows (with an area>5000ha) make up 35% of the entire damaged area. The number of wildfires, windthrows and their damaged area vary significantly from year to year. For 2000-2014, it is impossible to find a statistically significant trend of the fire- and storm-damaged area. The seasonal maximum of large-scale wildfires and windthrows was observed in July. Also, we identified the statistically significant relationships of fire- and wind-related forest damage with environmental variables. The occurrence of large-scale wildfires is related mainly to the species composition of forests, and also to the altitude, the mean annual precipitation and the population density. The spatial distribution of massive windthrows has a strong correlation with the species composition of forests, the mean annual precipitation and partially with the wind effect parameter.

TI  - Enhancing global change experiments through integration of remote-sensing techniques
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Global change experiments are often spatially and temporally limited because they are time- and labor-intensive, and expensive to carry out. We describe how the incorporation of remote-sensing techniques into global change experiments can complement traditional methods and provide additional information about system processes. We describe five emerging near-surface remote-sensing techniques: spectroscopy, thermal and fluorescence imaging, terrestrial laser scanning, digital repeat photography, and unmanned aerial systems. The addition of such techniques can reduce cost and effort, provide novel information, and expand existing observations by improving their context, accuracy, and completeness. In addition, we contend that use of airborne and satellite remote-sensing data during site selection can improve the ecological representativeness of future experiments. We conclude by recommending a high level of communication and collaboration between remote-sensing scientists and ecologists at all stages of global change experimentation.

TI  - Land cover classification in the tropics, solving the problem of cloud covered areas using topographic parameters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing data has been extensively used since early seventies for mapping and monitoring land cover. But, cloud cover has always been hindering the optimal use of the data, especially in the tropical and temperate regions. Because of cloud cover, researchers are forced to use only cloud free images or generate a composite using data from different dates to fill in the cloud and cloud-shadow areas. It is not a problem if the filling image is from the same season and from the same year. If there is large time gap between the acquisition date of image with the clouds and that of the filling image it will have an effect on classification accuracy. In this paper, we describe an approach in land cover classification of areas covered by cloud and cloud shadows. We use the synergy of optical image classification, processing of SAR data taking advantage of its ability of penetrating clouds, and decision rules using terrain parameters. We hypothesize that surface roughness of different land cover types derived from processing of SAR data and in combination with other topographic parameters (slope and elevation) can be applied to classify areas covered by clouds and cloud-shadows. The method was applied in a case study in Mts. Wayang-Windu and Patuha areas, near Bandung in West Java, Indonesia. Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS, Sentinel-1 A C band and SRTM DEM data of the study area were obtained. Initial classification of the optical data was carried out using training samples and fuzzy classification. Class labelling was done by applying fuzzy c-means algorithm. The Sentinel-1 A C band data was processed to get surface roughness. Decision boundaries for surface roughness, terrain slope and elevation were generated for each land cover type, which were implemented in the classification of the areas covered by cloud and cloud shadows. The result shows that it is possible to solve the problem of cloud cover using terrain parameters.

AB  - Palaeochannels can be good possible reservoirs of groundwater andare good rechargeable aquifers. Bakulahi is a plain-fed tributary of the Sai River flowing from north-west to south-east direction with about 177-km length and about 841-km(2) catchment area. It emanates from interconnected series of tals (large- to medium-sized shallow depressions) situated in the Raebareli district, Uttar Pradesh, India.Course of the Bakulahi River is shifted laterallyand left many fluvial landformspalaeochannels, oxbow lakes, meander cutoff, etc. The present study is based on the on-screen digitization of the Bakulahi River basin boundary, drainage network, palaeocourses, andother surface water bodies from high-resolution remote-sensing data (1 m x 1 m) available at Google Earth. The digitized details from remote sensing data are validated with some field observations.Different thematic maps are prepared by converting Google Earth feature files (.kmz/.kml) into GIS feature files (.shp) and importing layers into the GIS environment. There are about 115 palaeochannels covering about 137-km(2) area (16.29%); about 6000 surface water bodies in forms of ponds/tanks having 23.36-km(2) area (2.74%) and 40 oxbow lakes are mapped within the basin. This is the first scientific attempt to trace palaeocourses of the Bakulahi River. The present paper also answersthe question about the origin of the Bakulahi River. Demarcation of precise basin boundary through manual method by using high-resolution remotesensing data is another contribution of this exercise which is otherwise a difficult task without the availability of high resolution DEM.

TI  - Assessment of post-fire vegetation recovery in Southern Siberia using remote sensing observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is one of the main disturbances affecting forest dynamics, succession, and the carbon cycle in Siberian forests. The Zabaikal region in southern Siberia is characterized by one of the highest levels of fire activity in Russia. Time series of Landsat data and field measurements of the reforestation state were analyzed in order to estimate post-fire vegetation recovery. The results showed that the normalized burn ratio time series can be used to estimate forest recovery in the pine- and larch-dominated forests of the Zabaikal region. Multiple factors determine a forest's recovery rate after a wildfire, including fire severity, tree species characteristics, topography, hydrology, soil properties, and climate. Assessing these factors is important if we are to understand the effects of fire on forest succession and to implement sustainable forest management strategies. In this work we used the field data and Landsat data to estimate post-fire vegetation dynamics as a function of several environmental factors. These factors include fire severity, pre-fire forest state, topography, and positive surface temperature anomalies. A regression model showed that fire frequency, fire severity, and surface temperature anomalies are the primary factors, explaining about 58% of the variance in post-fire recovery. High frequency of fire and positive surface temperature anomalies hamper the post-fire reforestation process, while more severe burns are followed by higher recovery rates. Further studies are necessary to consider other important factors such as soil properties, moisture, and precipitation, for better explanation of post-fire vegetation recovery.

TI  - Object-based image analysis to map local climate zones: The case of Bandung, Indonesia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Local climate zones (LCZs) are seen as a useful concept to investigate the relationship between land use types and urban heat island effects, which has been substantially researched for cities of the Global North. However, in the Global South, the usefulness of the concept may be questioned, as spatial patterns of urban structure types are typically highly heterogeneous (e.g., a mix of commercial, formal residential and slum/informal areas). With the increased and reasonable availability of (very) high-resolution imagery, however, the concept of LCZ may also prove meaningful to investigate land use dependent thermal patterns in Global South cities, which is the main research question investigated in this paper. We compared LCZs based on very-high-resolution imagery (using Pleiades and SPOT-6) with the standard method using Landsat imagery, and we analyzed their relationship with land surface temperature (Landsat TIR) in Bandung, Indonesia. Two different methods of image classification are employed to extract the LCZs, i.e., the random forest algorithm on Landsat imagery and the object-based image analysis (OBIA) on very-high-resolution images. The result shows that the OBIA provides higher accuracy, reaching 89% for the object-based analysis on Pleiades imagery compared to 69% for the pixel-based analysis of Landsat imagery. In addition, the results of our analysis show that not only the type of LCZs but also composition and configuration patterns (i.e., density and aggregation of LCZs) significantly affect land surface temperature. To conclude, VHR imagery and OBIA allow mapping the complex patterns of LCZs in cities of the Global South, in support of developing mitigation strategies for the urban heat island effect via urban and landscape planning.

Christian ethics oppose this worldview because it rejects the idea that economic prosperity is objectively good. Instead, Christian ethics are theocentric, assuming that God and the relationship with the divine is objectively good. Material prosperity is seen to interfere with this relationship. Still, there are at least two views of the human-divine relationship that have implications for environmental ethics. The first and most popular view argues that the human-divine relationship is mediated by the human-in-community relationship. Alternatively, individualistic theism posits that the human-divine relationship is individually available without community-centeredness. This individualistic view has been criticized as leading to an insufficient ethic of environmental care, however, here we argue that a radical dualism consistent with the Christian Gospels can lead to an ethos of environmental benevolence.

TI  - Natural color representation of Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The true color composite is a widely used Earth observation product for displaying satellite imagery. As it is often used in communication with non-expert audiences in various media, it is desirable that such a product approximates the color perceived by the human eye. Additionally, as the Sentinel-2 mission with its high resolution multispectral imagery and short revisit times is delivering unprecedented amounts of data, any algorithm for computing the composite should be efficient. In this paper we define the natural color product, propose two efficient approaches for computing it, analyze the results, and implement the products on a satellite imagery service for interactive use. Our algorithms work on a per-pixel basis and hence parallelize naturally. The presented approaches are general and not limited to Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Cloud Detection with Historical Geostationary Satellite Sensors for Climate Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Can we build stable Climate Data Records (CDRs) spanning several satellite generations? This study outlines how the ClOud Fractional Cover dataset from METeosat First and Second Generation (COMET) of the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) was created for the 25-year period 1991-2015. Modern multi-spectral cloud detection algorithms cannot be used for historical Geostationary (GEO) sensors due to their limited spectral resolution. We document the innovation needed to create a retrieval algorithm from scratch to provide the required accuracy and stability over several decades. It builds on inter-calibrated radiances now available for historical GEO sensors. It uses spatio-temporal information and a robust clear-sky retrieval. The real strength of GEO observationsthe diurnal cycle of reflectance and brightness temperatureis fully exploited instead of just accounting for single imagery. The commonly-used naive Bayesian classifier is extended with covariance information of cloud state and variability. The resulting cloud fractional cover CDR has a bias of 1% Mean Bias Error (MBE), a precision of 7% bias-corrected Root-Mean-Squared-Error (bcRMSE) for monthly means, and a decadal stability of 1%. Our experience can serve as motivation for CDR developers to explore novel concepts to exploit historical sensor data.

TI  - The Arctic-Boreal vulnerability experiment model benchmarking system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) integrates field and airborne data into modeling and synthesis activities for understanding Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics. The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. Weshow here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.

TI  - Associations of green space metrics with health and behavior outcomes at different buffer sizes and remote sensing sensor resolutions
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data is increasingly used to characterize green space for health outcome studies. Literature suggests that green space within 500 m of home is often used to represent neighborhood suitable for walking, air pollution and noise reduction, and natural healing. In this paper, we used satellite data of different spatial resolutions to derive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator of surface greenness, at buffer distances of 50, 100, 250 and 500 m. Data included those of 2 m spatial resolution from WorldView2, 5 m resolution from RapidEye and 30 m resolution from Landsat. We found that, after radiometric calibrations, the RapidEye and WorldView2 sensors had similar NDVI values, while Landsat imagery tended to have greater NDVI; however, these sensors showed similar vegetation distribution: locations high in vegetation cover being high in NDVI, and vice versa. We linked the green space estimates to a health survey, and identified that higher NDVI values were significantly associated with better health outcomes. We further investigated the impacts of buffer size and sensor spatial resolution on identified associations between NDVI and health outcomes. Overall, the identified health outcomes were similar across sensors of different spatial resolutions, but a mean trend was identified in bigger buffer size being associated with greater health outcome.

TI  - Inversion and Effect Research on Dust Distribution of Urban Forests in Beijing
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests affect the filtration and absorption of airborne particulate matter, which can minimize the harmful effects to human health caused by airborne particulate pollution. Evergreen plants in urban forests play a major role in absorbing dust and purifying the air, especially in winter. Studying the spatial distribution of leaf dust and exploring the dust retention effect of evergreen shrubs are important for scientifically guiding urban forest construction and improving the living environment of cities in winter. The purpose of this study was to establish a dust inversion model by correlation analysis of spectral reflectance and the amount of dust absorption (ADA) of vegetation, using Sentinel-2 satellite remote-sensing images to obtain the dust distribution of the evergreen vegetation (mainly Euonymus japonicus Thunb.) in the Beijing urban area, and to determine the effect of the spatial pattern of E. japonicus woodland on ADA intensity. The result showed that the red band and near-infrared band are most sensitive to dust. The normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) is more suitable for building an inversion model, where the determination coefficient (R-2) of the inversion model constructed by the ratio of the NDPI (R-NDPI) was 0.879. The inversion results show that the mean ADA in the enclosed area is smaller than that in semi-enclosed and open areas, and the regional distribution of high ADA in the urban area of Beijing was higher in the south with a tendency of the ADA to decrease from city center to the surrounding area. The size, shape, and percentage of landscape (PLAND) of E. japonicus woodland have a significant effect on ADA intensity. We found that, in the study area, when the PLAND of E. japonicus woodland is higher than 40%, its ADA intensity remains basically unchanged. When the vegetation coverage is fixed, the landscape shape index is negatively correlated with ADA intensity, and reduction of the overall shape complexity of forestland can enhance its dust retention effect and improve the air environment of the surrounding areas. The results of this study can be used as a reference for urban planners and landscape architects when building urban forests, providing a scientific basis for controlling and reducing air particulate pollution in Beijing's winter and improving the living environment.

TI  - Estimating the Corn Canopy Chlorophyll Content Using the Sentinel-2A Image
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The chlorophyll within crop leaves and crop canopy produces energy and participates in photosynthesis process by absorbing sunlight. Therefore, it is important to estimate the crop canopy chlorophyll content timely and accurately for crop growth monitoring, nutrient content monitoring and crop quality evaluation. Sentinel-2 has a wide-swath sensor with 5-days revisit period, so the Sentinel-2 image is produced with high spatial resolution (10 m) and 13 spectral bands. Specially, there are three red edge bands in Sentinel-2 image, which are sensitive to crop canopy chlorophyll content and its change. So the Sentinel-2 image is an ideal remote sensing data source for chlorophyll content estimation. Vegetation indexes depict the difference for the crop between different growth conditions and different chlorophyll contents, through the band combinations based on the reflection characteristics of crops at different spectral bands. So the vegetation indexes from Sentinel-2 image can be used to estimate the corn canopy chlorophyll content timely and accurately in a regional area. Therefore, this study is focusing on estimating the corn canopy chlorophyll content using 10 kinds of vegetation indexes computing from Sentinel-2A remote sensing images. And the study area is located in three counties of Baoding City, Hebei Province, ranging from 115 degrees 29'E to 116 degrees 14'E, 39 degrees 5'N to 39 degrees 35'N. We measured the corn plant chlorophyll content in 24 sampling areas distributed randomly in the whole study area from 6 August to 11 August, 2016. And each sampling area was located using Huace i80 real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS receiver (Huace Ltd., Shanghai, China). The Sentinel-2A image was preprocessed including geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction, and Sen2Cor model and SNAP were used to do atmospheric correction. 10 vegetation indexes were computed including CIgreen (Green Chlorophyll Index), CIred-edge (Red-edge Chlorophyll Index), DVI(Difference Vegetation Index), LCI(Leaf Chlorophyll Index), MTCI(MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index), NAVI(Normalized Area Vegetation Index), NDRE(Normalized Difference Red-Edge), NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), RVI(Ratio Vegetation Index), SIPI(Structure Insensitive Pigment Index). Secondly, the statistical correlativity was analyzed between these 10 vegetation indexes and measured chlorophyll content value for every sampling area. So the corn canopy chlorophyll content estimating was developed using this correlation analysis results. Lastly, the optimal chlorophyll content estimation model was selected to estimate the chlorophyll content in the whole study area. This study was focusing on (1) developing the estimation model for corn canopy chlorophyll content in the study area, and the accuracy was assessed using R-2, RMSE and RE; (2) deciding the optimal band combination; (3)deciding the optimal amount of red edge band participating in vegetation indexes calculation.The accuracy assessment results indicated that (1) there was polynomial correlation between measured chlorophyll content and the selected 10 vegetation indexes in this study, and the accuracy of estimated chlorophyll content using the vegetation indexes considering the red edge bands is better than the ones without red edge bands. The CIgreen(560, 705) and DVI which were all considering red edge bands improved the chlorophyll content estimation accuracy, and the R-2 improved 0. 516 for CIgreen(560, 705). The statistical relationship between the measured chlorophyll content and the vegetation index in the field work was established, and the relationship was extended to the whole study area. This study was about the estimation of corn canopy LAI and chlorophyll content using these ten vegetation indexes, which was focusing on the following four parts. Firstly, we compared if the vegetation with or without red-edge band could get accurate LAI and chlorophyll content estimated result. Secondly, we added two red-edge bands to the vegetation indexes without red-edge band originally. Thirdly, we added two red-edge bands to the vegetation indexes with one red-edge band originally only. Fourthly, we set up the vegetation index with two red-edge bands. The results showed that there are polynomial regression between the selection of multi-VI and the field survey of canopy chlorophyll content. Because the introductions of the red edge band, the fitting accuracy improved more than 0.3 between the vegetation index and corn canopy chlorophyll content, and the CIgreen(560, 705) (Green Chlorophyll Index) improved 0. 516 that is the highest. The index calculating between the visible light band and the first red edge band (705 nm), the near infrared band with the second red edge band (740 nm), both of which established the regression model with the field survey of corn canopy chlorophyll content, and promoted the best fitting precision. The MTCI (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) has the highest fitting precision in which the R-2 is 0. 803, RMSE is 3. 185, RE is 4. 819%. It is shown that adding the red edge band will improve the fitting precision and it is suitable for crop growth monitoring.

TI  - Automatic Post-Disaster Damage Mapping Using Deep-Learning Techniques for Change Detection: Case Study of the Tohoku Tsunami
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-disaster damage mapping is an essential task following tragic events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. It is also a time-consuming and risky task that still often requires the sending of experts on the ground to meticulously map and assess the damages. Presently, the increasing number of remote-sensing satellites taking pictures of Earth on a regular basis with programs such as Sentinel, ASTER, or Landsat makes it easy to acquire almost in real time images from areas struck by a disaster before and after it hits. While the manual study of such images is also a tedious task, progress in artificial intelligence and in particular deep-learning techniques makes it possible to analyze such images to quickly detect areas that have been flooded or destroyed. From there, it is possible to evaluate both the extent and the severity of the damages. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art deep-learning approach for change detection applied to satellite images taken before and after the Tohoku tsunami of 2011. We compare our approach with other machine-learning methods and show that our approach is superior to existing techniques due to its unsupervised nature, good performance, and relative speed of analysis.

TI  - Niche partitioning on Sumatran Elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) and human in space and resources in Riau, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on elephant and human niches at Balai Raja and Tesso Nilo have been done for 6 years (2012-2017). The study was conducted by recording the distribution of elephants and communities. The distribution of elephants was identified through an installed GPS Collar in 3 groups of elephants (Butet, Angelina and Desma) since 2012. In 2016, data collection of resources was done through OLI 8+ Landsat imagery and records from the field. From the results of the study, elephants (Desma, Angelina and Butet groups) and humans have significantly different niches in space, but in terms of resources, all three elephant groups are almost the same to use them. In the context of niche partitioning of resources, Desma group used more the natural forest, swamp and wasteland areas than the communities. In Tesso Nilo, elephants groups used more open land than the communities. The overlapping between elephant and human creates human-elephant conflicts. For this reason, strengthening the niche partitioning strategy in space and resources can be a solution to conflict reduction. In addition, if elephants with humans are forced to live in the same space and resources, they develop strategies of neutralism or coexistence. For the community, converting plant commodities in the direction of an elephant's dislike (still of economic value) can reduce losses for the community and create a non-disturbing relationship between elephant and human. Examples of what the community has done are cassava cultivation and timber industry concession strategy in planting Acacia which is relatively not detrimental to the company even though the plant is damaged by an elephant.

TI  - Variation in MERRA-2 aerosol optical depth and absorption aerosol optical depth over China from 1980 to 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - 4258 instantaneous 550 run Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values were compared between the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in four seasons at 12 AERONET sites across China. The correlation coefficients (R) in spring, summer, autumn and winter were 0.88, 0.92, 0.91 and 0.87, respectively. The MERRA-2 AOD was compared with the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Aqua) AOD over China from 2003 to 2017, and good agreement was obtained. 4501 daily AOD values were compared between MERRA-2 and MODIS at 16 sites over China. Spatial distribution and temporal variation of MERRA-2 AOD over China were analyzed from 1980 to 2017. Mean values of MERRA-2 AOD indicated that high AOD mainly appeared in the eastern, southeastern and central China, while low AOD mostly occurred in the western and northeastern China. Mean AOD values over China during this study period in each month was also discussed, and similar spatial distribution (high AOD in developed areas, low AOD in rural and less developed areas) was found in each month. Slight AOD increase could be observed in the 1980s and 1990s, and a rapid increase happened from 2001 to 2010, followed by an AOD decrease between 2011 and 2017. Annual variation of mean AOD of the whole China (the Yangtze River Delta) showed a slight increase of 0.0010 (0.0045) per year from 1980 to 1999, a rapid increase of 0.0096 (0.0271) per year between 2000 and 2009, and a decrease of-0.0089 (- 0.0206) per year from 2010 to 2017. Annual AOD Variation in Jing-jin-ji and Pearl River Delta is similar to that in the Yangtze River Delta. In four seasons, AOD change was similar to the annual AOD variation except winter with a slight decrease of -0.0012 per year between 1980 and 1999. AOD variation over China before and after the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in the Philippines in June 1991 was analyzed to get a better understanding of the transport and the impact on the environment from volcanic pollutants. AOD variation trend over China was studied in two periods. The increasing trend appeared in most part of China from 1980 to 2009, while a decreasing trend could be found in almost the entire China between 2010 and 2017. Spatial and temporal variation of MERRA-2 Absorption Aerosol Optical Depth (AAOD), Black Carbon Absorption Aerosol Optical Depth (BCAAOD) and Dust Absorption Aerosol Optical Depth (DUAAOD) were analyzed during the period between 1980 and 2017. BCAAOD (66.30%) and DUAAOD (30.56%) offered the major contribution to total AAOD in China. 38 years of variation of AAOD over China is mainly due to the variation of BCAAOD. BCAAOD experienced an increase (1980-2007) and a decrease (2008-2017) during the 38 years in China.

TI  - Crosstalk Effect and Its Mitigation in Aqua MODIS Middle-Wave Infrared Bands
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has 36 bands, among which 6, bands 20-25, are middle-wave infrared (MWIR) bands, covering a wavelength range from approximately 3.750 to 4.515 mu m. Significant crosstalk effect in Aqua MODIS MWIR bands was found prelaunch and confirmed on-orbit early in the mission. In this paper, the crosstalk effect in these bands is carefully investigated and quantitatively characterized using the instrument's scheduled lunar observations. The crosstalk correction algorithm that we have developed in our previous work is applied to all levels including black body calibration and L1B EV retrievals to mitigate the crosstalk effect in the bands. We show significant crosstalk contaminations among all MWIR bands and also show that these bands have significant crosstalk contaminations from the shortwave infrared bands. We demonstrate that the crosstalk effect has significant impact on onboard black body calibration as well as on EV retrievals. For L1B EV retrievals, these crosstalk effects induce significant radiometric bias as well as strong striping. The radiometric bias is larger than 1.8 K for all detectors of the 4.47-mu m band (band 24) for typical scene. Aqua MODIS band 24 detector 1 is most strongly impacted by crosstalk and has a bias that may be as large as 10 K. The crosstalk correction successfully mitigates the striping in the EV images and improves the accuracy of the EV retrievals in the MWIR bands.

TI  - The Challenges of Interpreting Oil-Water Spatial and Spectral Contrasts for the Estimation of Oil Thickness: Examples From Satellite and Airborne Measurements of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing is one of the most commonly used techniques to detect oil in the surface ocean. This is because oil has optical properties that are different from water to modulate oil-water spatial and spectral contrasts. However, understanding these contrasts is challenging because of variable results from laboratory and field experiments as well as from different observing conditions and spatial/spectral resolutions of remote sensing imagery. Here, through reviewing published oil-water spectral contrasts and analyzing remotely sensed spectra collected by several satellite and airborne sensors (MERIS, MODIS, MISR, Landsat, and AVIRIS) from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we provide the interpretation of the spatial/spectral contrasts of various oil slicks and discuss the challenges in such interpretations. In addition to oil thickness, several other factors also affect oil-water spatial/spectral contrasts, including sun glint strength, oil emulsification state, optical properties of oil covered water, and spatial/spectral resolutions of remote sensing imagery. In the absence of high spatial-and spectral-resolution imagery, a multistep scheme may be used to classify oil type (emulsion and non-emulsion) and to estimate relative oil thickness for each type based on the known optical properties of oil, yet such a scheme requires further research to improve and validate.

TI  - Pathological process has a crucial role in sentinel node biopsy for vulvar cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To report the interim findings of an audit of the outcomes of sentinel node (SN) biopsy performed as a replacement for groin node dissection in women with early stage vulvar cancer in routine clinical practice in Australia and New Zealand.Methods. A prospective multi-center study in 8 participating centers. Eligible patients had squamous cell carcinomas clinically restricted to the vulva <4 cm in diameter. SN procedures and pathological assessment were to be performed in accordance with the methods published by the GROINSS-V collaboration [1].Results. 130 women with apparent early stage vulvar cancer were enrolled. Seventeen women subsequently did not meet the eligibility criteria and were excluded. SNs were identified in 111/113 of the remaining women. Twenty-two women had positive nodes. Sixteen of these women had at least 12 months follow up and 7 (44%) had recurrent disease. Eighty-nine women had only negative nodes. Seventy-four of these women had at least 12 months follow up and 6 (8%) had recurrent disease (including 2 [2.7%] with recurrence in the groin). On subsequent review of the two women with negative SNs who had groin recurrences, it was found that the recommended pathology protocol had not been followed. In both cases, SN metastases were identified following serial sectioning of the nodes.Conclusions. SN biopsy is feasible in routine clinical practice. However, undetected metastases in a removed SN may be associated with groin recurrence. To ensure patient safety, strict adherence to the pathology protocol is an essential component in the utilization of the sentinel lymph node technique in vulvar cancer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) usefulness in breast carcinoma N+ converted to NO after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC).Material and methods: Descriptive study including 16 females with infiltrating carcinoma with lymphatic metastasis confirmed by biopsy, leaving a metallic marker (MM) in pathological lymph nodes (LN). All patients underwent NC reaching a complete radiological response in LN. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed after Tc-99m nanocoloid injection, obtaining planar images and SPECT/CT. Lymphatic drainage and concordance of sentinel node (SN) with MM was analyzed.Results: SN was visualized in lymphoscintigraphy in 93.7% of cases. The SN coincided with the MM in 12/15 cases on SPECT/CT. The SLNB technique was completed on 14/16 patients, intraoperatively locating the GC in all of them. The SN was negative in 10 cases, 3 cases presented macrometastases and 1 micrometastases. Axillary lymphadenectomy (AL) was performed in a case of macrometastasis with > 15,000 cp/mu ARNm CK-19, absence of drainage and in one case that showed no coincidence with the MM due different Berg's level location. These last two cases presented lymph node metastasis. In the other two cases with not coincidence between the SN and the MM, a total of 4 lymph nodes were removed, showing no evidence of metastasis. Patients without AL were followed up for an average of 10 months (range 6-17), with no evidence of lymph node involvement.Conclusion: SLNB in breast cancer with conversion into NO after neoadjuvant treatment is a technique with good results and a low false negative rate.

TI  - Mapping inundation dynamics in a heterogeneous floodplain: Insights from integrating observations and modeling approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water in a heterogeneous floodplain is difficult, especially for its surrounding isolated lakes. Seasonal inundation patterns of these isolated lakes can be misestimated in a hydrodynamic model due to their short and erratic appearances. A surface water time series of Poyang Lake having an 8-day revisit frequency with a 30 m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2016 was conducted for the first time. This study was produced with a modified hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (HSTAFM) by integrating both Landsat and MODIS data. Discrepancies between model-based surface water and remotely-sensed surface water were evaluated, and possible causes were discussed. Results show that the modified HSTAFM can better detect the water features of a floodplain, thereby providing more detailed information in an seasonal isolated lake system than the MODIS MOD13Q1 product. With the fusion product, we found that Poyang Lake evidently shrank after experiencing a longer low-water period after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. A large proportion of these discrepancies (averaging 36%) between model-based and remotely-sensed surface water distributed in seasonal isolated lakes, mainly occurred during high-water level periods. Uncertainties in the hydrodynamic model might attribute to smaller defined lake boundaries, bathymetric variations, human disturbance, and unconsidered groundwater recharge/discharge. These results provide a new insight into the temporally continuous and spatially dynamic assessment of simulated surface water, which is essential for the future improvement in the hydrodynamic model.

TI  - Identification and Management of Lymphedema in Patients With Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a potentially debilitating and often irreversible complication of breast cancer treatment. Risk of BCRL is proportional to the extent of axillary surgery and radiation. Other risk factors include obesity and infections. Given the 5-year survival rate of 90% and its potential impact on the quality of life of survivors of breast cancer, BCRL has become a significant financial burden on the health care system. Minimizing axillary surgery and radiation has been proven to reduce the risk of BCRL. Comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment at the time of initial diagnosis; early referral to physical therapy after surgery; and patient education regarding weight loss, skin, and nail care are cornerstones of the management of early-stage lymphedema. End-stage lymphedema may benefit from referral to a plastic surgeon specializing in lymphedema surgery. In this review, we attempt to review the incidence, risk factors, staging, prevention, and management of this complication of breast cancer treatment. We also describe our multidisciplinary approach for the prevention of this complication at the time of initial diagnosis. (C) 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Assessment of Optimal Transport for Operational Land-Cover Mapping Using High-Resolution Satellite Images Time Series without Reference Data of the Mapping Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover map production using remote-sensing imagery is governed by data availability. In our case, data sources are two-fold: on one hand, optical data provided regularly by satellites such as Sentinel-2, and on the other hand, reference data which allow calibrating mapping methods or validating the results. The lengthy delays due to reference data collection and cleansing are one of the main issues for applications. In this work, the use of Optimal Transport (OT) is proposed. OT is a Domain Adaptation method that uses past data, both images and reference data, to produce the land-cover map of the current period without updated reference data. Seven years of Formosat-2 image time series and the corresponding reference data are used to evaluate two OT algorithms: conventional EMD transport and regularized transport based on the Sinkhorn distance. The contribution of OT to a classification fusion strategy is also evaluated. The results show that with a 17-class nomenclature the problem is too complex for the Sinkhorn algorithm, which provides maps with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 30%. In contrast, with the EMD algorithm, an OA close to 70% is obtained. One limitation of OT is the number of classes that can be considered at the same time. Simplification schemes are proposed to reduce the number of classes to be transported. Cases of improvement are shown when the problem is simplified, with an improvement in OA varying from 5% and 20%, producing maps with an OA near 79%. As several years are available, the OT approaches are compared to standard fusion schemes, like majority voting. The gain in voting strategies with OT use is lower than the gain obtained with standard majority voting (around 5%).

TI  - Urban Ecosystem Services Quantification through Remote Sensing Approach: A Systematic Review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Urban ecosystem services (UES) is an essential approach to the development of sustainable cities and must be incorporated into urban planning to be able to improve humans' life quality. This paper aimed to identify remote sensing (RS) data/techniques used in the literature in five years (2013-2017) for UES investigation and to analyze the similarity between them. For this purpose, we used the Scopus database of scientific journals, and a set of appropriate filters were applied. A total of 44 studies were selected, being 93.18% of them located in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in Europe. The most common dataset used was the secondary data, followed by the Landsat family products. Land use and land cover (LULC) was the most common approach utilized, succeeded by radiometric indexes and band related. All four main classes (provision, regulation, supporting, and cultural) of ecosystem services (ES) were identified in the reviewed papers, wherein regulating services were the most popular modality mentioned. Seven different groups were established as having 100% of similarity between methods and ES results. Therefore, RS is identified in the literature as an important technique to reach this goal. However, we highlight the lack of studies in the southern hemisphere.

TI  - COMPARATIVE EFFECTS OF TWO INTERVAL SHUTTLE-RUN TRAINING MODES ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PERFORMANCE ADAPTATIONS IN FEMALE PROFESSIONAL FUTSAL PLAYERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of 2 shuttle-run interval training (SRIT) models with 1 and 3 directional changes per running bout on the aerobic and anaerobic performances of elite female futsal players. Sixteen players competing in the Brazilian National Division League took part in the study. The training protocols consisted of shuttle-run intervals organized in 4 sets of 4-minute bouts with 3 minutes of rest intervals between the sets. The SRIT models were composed of 1 (7.5 seconds running and 7.5 seconds pause [SRIT7.5x7.5]; n = 7) or 3 (15 seconds running and 15 seconds pause [SRIT15x15]; n = 9) directional changes. The athletes performed the following tests before and after a 5-week training period: incremental treadmill test (ITT), futsal intermittent endurance test (FIET) (with respective peak speeds [PSs]), and a repeated sprint ability (RSA) test. After the training period, PSFIET and speed at the second lactate turnpoint were very likely and almost certainly increased in both training regimens, respectively. SRIT15x15 induced possibly greater improvements in PSITT (+3.28%, 90% CL -0.16 to 6.82) and RSA(mean) (+1.17%, 90% CL -0.68 to 3.05) than SRIT7.5x7.5. In addition, SRIT15x15 resulted in a likely greater improvement in running economy (+4.33%, 90% CL -d0.35 to 9.23) compared with SRIT7.5x7.5. In elite female futsal players, SRIT15x15 is a promising strategy to enhance performance-related physical fitness attributes in a short-term period (5 weeks) during the preseason, Because of its superior effects on these important aerobic and anaerobic qualities than a protocol with fewer directional changes.

TI  - Detection of disturbed forest ecosystems in the forest-steppe zone using reflectance values
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents results of the assessment of discriminant analysis potentialities for detecting disturbed forest ecosystems in the forest-steppe zone using their reflectance spectrum properties. A new method is proposed for the automated detection of disturbed forest stands among forest-covered lands, based on the discriminant analysis of the magnitude of changes in the reflectance in various spectral ranges. Using experimental data from 1836 forest areas typical of the forest-steppe zone of the Central Chernozem region, we propose equations that allow a specific forest area to be classified as disturbed or undisturbed forests in an automated mode. The accuracy of disturbed forest detection is about 90%. It is found that variations in the short-wave infrared reflectance are most informative for disturbed forest land detection when compared with the reflectance variations detected by the Landsat sensors in the other spectral ranges.

T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate sedimentological and tectonic processes at the central High Atlas, in order to understand their functioning and to build a geodynamic model that placed the area in its current geological frame. The analysis used here is based on the numerical enhancement of a Landsat image where the main goal is to map surface sedimentary deposits throughout the central High Atlas in order to delimit the large geological structures. The sediment distribution throughout central High Atlas indicates that this one is a large tectonic subsiding basin, where the ongoing tectonic events and the geodynamical evolution remain to be explained by other prospecting techniques.3-D structure velocities obtained by local seismic tomography and enhancement techniques of gravimetric anomalies are used to explore and define deep structure beneath the central High Atlas. The goal is to establish the evolution of the deep structure related to the geodynamical processes. Modest crustal thickness variation beneath the central High Atlas (similar to 20-similar to 40 km) define by local tomography and gravimetric anomalies, confirms that, a major part of the lower crust is detached into the lithosphere by delamination. Gravimetric anomaly, local seismic tomography and vertical cross sections throughout the central High Atlas, suggest that the lower crust detached is related to the broken slab of remain northward subduction beneath High and Middle Atlas. Meanwhile, extrusions of heated Asthenosphere materials induce the rifting stage concomitant to tectonic subsidence of the basin.

To be used as forecasting tools over large areas, such models could benefit from integrating remote sensing data that describe the meteorological and environmental conditions driving mosquito population dynamics. The main objective of this study is to assess a process-based modeling framework for mosquito population dynamics using satellite-derived meteorological estimates as input variables. A generic weather-driven model of mosquito population dynamics was applied to Rift Valley fever vector species in northern Senegal, with rainfall, temperature, and humidity as inputs. The model outputs using meteorological data from ground weather station vs satellite-based estimates are compared, using longitudinal mosquito trapping data for validation at local scale in three different ecosystems. Model predictions were consistent with field entomological data on adult abundance, with a better fit between predicted and observed abundances for the Sahelian Ferlo ecosystem, and for the models using in-situ weather data as input. Based on satellite-derived rainfall and temperature data, dynamic maps of three potential Rift Valley fever vector species were then produced at regional scale on a weekly basis. When direct weather measurements are sparse, these resulting maps should be used to support policy-makers in optimizing surveillance and control interventions of Rift Valley fever in Senegal.

TI  - Regional Mass Media: From Self-Censorship to Mythmaking
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to solve the following scientific problem: to study the ways of interaction between mass media, audience and authorities used in regional practice. The relevance and scientific significance of solving the above-mentioned problem lies in the fact that modern mass media exist in a dynamically changing social space. The main objective is to determine how fully events of the political and public life of a country or region are reflected in the daily practice of regional mass media. Based on the analysis of print media, the authors of the article consider the authenticity, completeness and objectivity of the information worldview created by journalists of the Arkhangelsk Region. The contractual mechanism of information services used by authorities forces journalists to resort to self-censorship and non-disclosure of socially important information, which leads to the creation of media myths and the loss of professionalism, as well as changes essential characteristics of journalism. It is indicated that it is much more dangerous for this profession to consciously distort the reflected reality by emphasizing some events or certain aspects of the displayed phenomena and concealing others, i.e. manipulating mass consciousness through non-disclosure. Non-disclosure not only erases, destroys and eliminates facts, but also creates a mythical, distorted and unreliable information worldview.

TI  - Monitoring forest cover change within different reserve types in southern Ghana
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population and economic growth quickly degrade and deplete forest resources in many developing countries, even within protected areas. Monitoring forest cover change is critical for assessing ecosystem changes and targeting conservation efforts. Yet the most biodiverse forests on the planet are also the most difficult to monitor remotely due to their frequent cloud cover. To begin to reconcile this problem, we develop and implement an effective and efficient approach to mapping forest loss in the extremely cloud-prevalent southern Ghana region using dense time series Landsat 7 and 8 images from 1999 to 2018, based on median value temporal compositing of a novel vegetation index called the spectral variability vegetation index (SVVI). Resultant land-cover and land-use maps yielded 90 to 94% mapping accuracies. Our results indicate 625 km(2) of forest loss within the 9800-km(2) total mapping area, including within forest reserves and their environs between circa 2003 and 2018. Within the reserves, reduced forest cover is found near the reserve boundaries compared with their interiors, suggesting a more degraded environment near the edge of the protected areas. A fully protected reserve, Kakum National Park, showed little forest cover change compared with many other less protected reserves (such as a production reserveSubri River). Anthropogenic activities, such as mining, agriculture, and built area expansion, were the main land-use transitions from forest. The reserves and census districts that are located near large-scale open pit mining indicated the most drastic forest loss. No significant correlation was found between the magnitudes of forest cover change and population density change for reserves and within a 1.5-km buffer surrounding the reserves. While other anthropogenic factors should be explored in relation to deforestation, our qualitative analysis revealed that reserve protection status (management policies) appears to be an important factor. The mapping approach described in this study provided a highly accurate and effective means to monitor land-use changes in forested and cloud-prone regions with great promise for application to improved monitoring of moist tropical and other forests characterized by high cloud cover.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to clarify the learning outcomes from practical training in regional alliance rooms. The research subjects were students enrolled in the Department of Nursing at University A, who completed practical training in the regional alliance room at the hospital in FY 2016 and who gave consent to cooperate in this research. Semi-structured interviewmethods using an interviewguide were used to collect data for eight students. To analyze the data, descriptions on "learning outcomes from practical training in regional alliance rooms"were identified and data was categorized based on the similarities of meanings and contents. The results of this analysis showed the following learning outcomes:"Building a trusting relationship to drawout the feelings of patients and their families in a short period of time","providing support for the desired lifestyles of patients and their families after discharge from the hospital", and "providing multi-disciplined, effectively cooperative support for discharge". In other words, learning outcomes from practical training in regional alliance rooms included the ability to practice nursing in viewof a highly individual lifestyle after discharge from the early stages of hospitalization and to develop a support system for patients and their families after returning home.

TI  - Vegetation Change on an Alaska Estuary After the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake
T2  - NORTHWEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chickaloon Flats, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, is a 10,000 ha tidal mudflat complex on the Kenai Peninsula in south-central Alaska. It is a protected coastal estuary stopover area along the Pacific Flyway, covering 7% of the total estuarine intertidal area from Cook Inlet to Prince William Sound. Because Chickaloon Flats is historically an important avian migratory stopover and has relative regional importance in terms of estuarine intertidal area, there was a need to evaluate the current vegetation and determine any changes since the last around study in 1972. We collected land cover data at a sample of ground-truthed points on Chickaloon Flats during 2009-2010 to evaluate existing vegetation communities as compared to historic 1970-71 values. A maximum likelihood supervised classification was performed on 2005 Landsat TM imagery to create an updated land cover classification of Chickaloon Flats. We used two different analytical approaches to show that the most notable changes in land cover types from 1975-2005 were the increase in early successional communities and a decline in unvegetated mud. Additionally, inland land cover types, which represent the more stable marsh-like communities, decreased in area as a whole. The documented changes in vegetation composition and structure over the four decade study period are attributable to elevation changes from sediment accretion and post-1964 Earthquake subsidence. As a result, evidence points to reduced shorebird use of the Flats.

TI  - A Novel Method for Segmentation and Change Detection of Satellite Images Using Proximal Splitting Algorithm and Multiclass SVM
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel method for segmentation and change detection of multispectral images using proximal splitting-based clustering and multiclass support vector machine (MSVM). Initially, the multitemporal satellite images are preprocessed and then textures are extracted using Difference of Offset Gaussian filter. In general, the traditional clustering method uses Euclidean distance as a prime factor for segmentation process. For multitextured images such as remotely sensed images, this metric provides inconsistent output. To achieve better segmented results, proximal splitting algorithm has been proposed. This method has been considered as a solution for iterative minimization problem, which is required to find exact changes between the multitemporal images. The MSVM is chosen to group the segmented clusters into a fixed number of classes, since the clusters obtained from the proximal splitting algorithm are not independent with each other. Then, the classified images are subjected to image differencing method to detect the changes. Experimentation is performed with two real data sets of Landsat7 images, which illustrates that the mean of difference in area obtained by the proposed method is reduced by an average of 35.24% compared to the conventional system. The validity index obtained for data set 1 using proposed algorithm is lower than the existing methods.

TI  - Roles of past, present, and future land use and anthropogenic heat release changes on urban heat island effects in Hanoi, Vietnam: Numerical experiments with a regional climate model
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the roles of land-use cover (LUC) and anthropogenic heat (AH) on the past, present, and future urban heat island (UHI) effect over the megapolitan area of Hanoi, Vietnam. We use a dynamical downscaling method with a regional climate model coupled with an urban canopy scheme to run sensitivity simulations with LUC and AH data from 1990, 2010, and 2030. The LUC data in 1990 and 2010 are derived from remote sensing data, whereas the LUC data for 2030 come from the city's master plan. The AH data are estimated from past and projected energy-use conditions. The results show that the LUC-AH coupled changes during 2010-2030 will have much greater impact on the local UHI effect than those during 1990-2010. In the urban-core area, the monthly mean surface air temperature in July is predicted to increase by 0.7 degrees C by 2030, double the increase of 0.35 degrees C during 1990-2010. We show that the temperature increase during 1990-2010 is mostly due to the change in LUC conditions, but the increase in the future AH will contribute 30-50% to the total temperature increase in the urban areas.

TI  - The public uptake of information about antibiotic resistance in the Netherlands
T2  - PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we test to what extent an educational video on the intricacies of antibiotic resistance affects public attitudes towards antibiotic resistance and how such information is absorbed by the most likely targets of public health campaigns. We use a representative sample of 2037 individuals (from 2016) to test how people respond to a video educating them about antibiotic resistance. Our results show that receiving information does increase the general awareness of antibiotic resistance among our respondents. Yet, these effects are most profound for those who are the most likely targets of such information: the least knowledgeable group and those who have a more apathetic worldview. Our results are in line with suggestions made by the knowledge deficit model and show that the influence of cultural predispositions on the uptake of information about antibiotic resistance should not be ignored in future campaigns.

TI  - Discovery and dating of Pre-LGM deposits in a high catchment of the Dolomites (Italy): New insights on climate-related geomorphological processes during the Late Pleistocene
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The results from the analysis of a relatively deep stratigraphic sequence from a formerly glaciated plateau in the Upper Badia valley (Dolomites, Italy) are discussed, and the first insight on Late Pleistocene sedimentary records and geomorphological evolution of the area are provided. The investigated sequence comprises: i) cohesive sediments interpreted as colluvial-eluvial in origin or as stagnant water deposits; ii) sandy diamicton and dolostone monolithic sediments interpreted as gravity-induced deposits, possibly owing to debris flows or wash out/reworking of rock avalanche deposits from the surrounding dolomite ridges; iii) silty diamicton interpreted as lodgement till, possibly attributed to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Radiocarbon dating results and interpretation of stratigraphic data, supported by geomorphological field surveys, remote sensing data analyses and palaeo-climatic and palaeo-environmental data from literature, enabled us to conclude that the investigated plateau (Pralongia, ca. 2000 m a.s.l.) was likely ice-free for most of Marine Isotope Stage 3. In particular, between 38 ka BP and the inset of full-glacial conditions (LGM similar to 27 ka BP) clastic gravity-induced sediments were deposited within the study site. Supraglacial transport is supposed to have played a role in the emplacement of gravity-induced deposits from the surrounding dolomite cliffs to the plateau. This study resulted in the first Pre-LGM record of sedimentation and palaeo-environmental conditions inside the Eastern Dolomites in the 46 to 38 ka BP period. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Adaptation of the dark spectrum fitting atmospheric correction for aquatic applications of the Landsat and Sentinel-2 archives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dark spectrum fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction method for aquatic application of metre-scale resolution optical satellite imagery is adapted to Landsat and Sentinel-2 (L/S2), including an automated tiled processing of full scene imagery and an optional image based glint correction. The DSF uses multiple dark targets in the subscene to construct a "dark spectrum" which is used to estimate the atmospheric path reflectance (rho(pa)(th)) according to the best fitting aerosol model. This method is fully automated and can be used for full mission archive processing, as demonstrated here for a study region in the North Sea. The new approach overcomes common issues with the SWIR based exponential extrapolation approach (EXP). An evaluation of both methods is presented using L-w measurements from 19 sites in the AERONET-OC network over a 15 year period and 5 satellite sensors. Overall, the DSF performs better than the EXP, with a notable improvement in the blue spectral region. The tiled processing allows for a smooth rho(pa)(th) estimation for full and merged L/S2 scenes, over clear and turbid coastal waters, inland waters, and land. The DSF selects the most appropriate band automatically, i.e. the one giving the lowest atmospheric path reflectance, and hence largely avoids amplification of glint and adjacency effects in the atmospheric correction. After application of the DSF, sun glint reflectance can be estimated from the SWIR bands, and the application of a sun glint correction significantly improves data availability for these nadir viewing sensors. A consistent processing across sensors allows for the exploitation of the > 30 year L/S2 archive, including Landsat 5 imagery dating back to 1984. A practical application of the DSF and the L/S2 archive is presented, where the remotely sensed water turbidity from 5 satellites is compared with in situ measurements from a long-term (2000-present) monitoring station in the southern North Sea.

TI  - Phenotyping of Plant Biomass and Performance Traits Using Remote Sensing Techniques in Pea (Pisum sativum, L.)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Field pea cultivars are constantly improved through breeding programs to enhance biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and increase seed yield potential. In pea breeding, the Above Ground Biomass (AGBM) is assessed due to its influence on seed yield, canopy closure, and weed suppression. It is also the primary yield component for peas used as a cover crop and/or grazing. Measuring AGBM is destructive and labor-intensive process. Sensor-based phenotyping of such traits can greatly enhance crop breeding efficiency. In this research, high resolution RGB and multispectral images acquired with unmanned aerial systems were used to assess phenotypes in spring and winter pea breeding plots. The Green Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), plot volume, canopy height, and canopy coverage were extracted from RGB and multispectral information at five imaging times (between 365 to 1948 accumulated degree days/ADD after 1 May) in four winter field pea experiments and at three imaging times (between 1231 to 1648 ADD) in one spring field pea experiment. The image features were compared to ground-truth data including AGBM, lodging, leaf type, days to 50% flowering, days to physiological maturity, number of the first reproductive node, and seed yield. In two of the winter pea experiments, a strong correlation between image features and seed yield was observed at 1268 ADD (flowering). An increase in correlation between image features with the phenological traits such as days to 50% flowering and days to physiological maturity was observed at about 1725 ADD in these winter pea experiments. In the spring pea experiment, the plot volume estimated from images was highly correlated with ground truth canopy height (r = 0.83) at 1231 ADD. In two other winter pea experiments and the spring pea experiment, the GRVI and NDVI features were significantly correlated with AGBM at flowering. When selected image features were used to develop a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model for AGBM estimation, the correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted AGBM was 0.60 and 0.84 in the winter and spring pea experiments, respectively. A SPOT-6 satellite image (1.5 m resolution) was also evaluated for its applicability to assess biomass and seed yield. The image features extracted from satellite imagery showed significant correlation with seed yield in two winter field pea experiments, however, the trend was not consistent. In summary, the study supports the potential of using unmanned aerial system-based imaging techniques to estimate biomass and crop performance in pea breeding programs.

TI  - The spatial-temporal patterns of land cover changes due to mining activities in the Darling Range, Western Australia: A Visual Analytics Approach
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Darling Range in Western Australia is a major bauxite producing region. Clearing, excavation and rehabilitation activities related to bauxite mining have influenced land cover within this region since mining commenced in the 1960s. This paper presents a study that used machine learning and time series visualisation to analyse the land cover changes of the Darling Range using time-lapse multispectral images, with the aim of understanding the impact of the mining activities and land rehabilitation patterns of the region. Land cover changes were analysed using 14 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images between 1988 and 2014. The spatial distribution of land cover was classified automatically using machine learning algorithms, and their temporal changes were visualized for analysis. Supervised classification was carried out based on the six spectral features of the images using three machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB). The results showed that the RF algorithm achieved overall accuracy, (ratio of correctly classified samples divided by the total number of samples), greater than 95% for all years. The temporal changes of land cover distribution over the study period were visualized using a change map. These changes were compared with land clearing and rehabilitation records of a mining company operating in that region. A close correlation was observed between the automated analysis outputs and the company's records. This work demonstrates the potential use of machine analysis in improving the accuracy of spatial data related to land clearing; and in monitoring vegetation recovery of closed and rehabilitated mines.

TI  - Unchanged frequency of moraine-dammed glacial lake outburst floods in the Himalaya
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrinking glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya-Nyainqentanglha (HKKHN) region have formed several thousand moraine-dammed glacial lakes(1-3), some of these having grown rapidly in past decades(3,4). This growth may promote more frequent and potentially destructive glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs)(5-7). Testing this hypothesis, however, is confounded by incomplete databases of the few reliable, though selective, case studies. Here we present a consistent Himalayan GLOF inventory derived automatically from all available Landsat imagery since the late 1980s. We more than double the known GLOF count and identify the southern Himalayas as a hotspot region, compared to the more rarely affected Hindu Kush-Karakoram ranges. Nevertheless, the average annual frequency of 1.3 GLOFs has no credible posterior trend despite reported increases in glacial lake areas in most of the HKKHN3,8, so that GLOF activity per unit lake area has decreased since the late 1980s. We conclude that learning more about the frequency and magnitude of outburst triggers, rather than focusing solely on rapidly growing glacial lakes, might improve the appraisal of GLOF hazards.

TI  - Changing surveillance objectives during the different phases of an emerging vector-borne disease outbreak: The Schmallenberg virus example
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the late summer of 2011, a sudden rise in incidence of fever, drop in milk production and diarrhoea was observed in dairy cows in the eastern region of the Netherlands and in north-western Germany. In the autumn of 2011, a novel orthobunyavirus was identified by metagenomic analyses in samples from acutely diseased cows on a farm near the German city of Schmallenberg, and was thereafter named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Due to the novelty of the virus, there was an immediate need for knowledge regarding the epidemiological characteristics of SBV-infections to inform surveillance and control strategies. A rapid assessment of the spread and impact of an emerging disease supports decision-makers on allocation of resources. This paper reviews the disease mitigation activities during and after the SBV epidemic in the Netherlands, to illustrate the phases in surveillance when a new (vector-borne) pathogen emerges in a country or region. Immediate and short-term disease mitigation activities that were initiated after SBV was identified are discussed in detail, as well as ways to enhance future surveillance (e.g. by syndromic surveillance) and preparedness for similar disease outbreaks. By doing so, lessons learnt from the SBV epidemic will also improve surveillance for other emerging diseases in cattle.

TI  - The Effect of Axillary Lymph Node Sampling during Mastectomy on Immediate Alloplastic Breast Reconstruction Complications
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tissue expander-based immediate breast reconstruction is currently the most common technique used for postmastectomy breast reconstruction. During mastectomy, axillary lymph nodes are biopsied to stage patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate postoperative complications with respect to extent of lymph node dissection.Methods: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing tissue expander-based immediate breast reconstruction at our institution from 2010 to 2012 was conducted. Charts were analyzed to determine the association between the absolute number of axillary lymph nodes removed and postreconstructive incidence of skin necrosis, cellulitis, seroma, and expander removal. Independent sample t test and linear regression were used to analyze data.Results: In total, 282 patients with 467 reconstructions were included. Overall incidence of all postoperative complications per breast was 23.8%, Breasts in which a complication occurred had a mean of 6 nodes removed versus 4 nodes in uncomplicated breasts (P= 0.018). Complications were noted at a significantly higher rate in patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy (P= 0.008). Expander removal and seroma occurred more frequently in breasts that had a greater number of nodes removed (P= 0.006 and P= 0.015, respectively). Preoperative radiation resulted in higher incidence of cellulitis and skin necrosis. Postoperative radiation and chemotherapy did not adversely affect reconstruction.Conclusions: Axillary lymph node removal of >4 nodes confers a greater risk of postreconstructive seroma formation and tissue expander loss in patients undergoing immediate reconstruction following mastectomy. Axillary lymph node dissection has a higher incidence of breast reconstruction complications compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Therefore, we encourage plastic surgeons to consider degree of lymphadenectomy when discussing reconstructive options with patients, as this may significantly impact their reconstructive outcome.

TI  - Long-Term Satellite Image Time-Series for Land Use/Land Cover Change Detection Using Refined Open Source Data in a Rural Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability and volume of remote sensing data, such as Landsat satellite images, have allowed the multidimensional analysis of land use/land cover (LULC) changes. However, the performance of image classification is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the training set and its temporal continuity, which may affect the accuracy of the classification and bias the analysis of the LULC changes. In this study, we intended to apply a long-term LULC analysis in a rural region based on a Landsat time series of 21 years (1995 to 2015). Here, we investigated the use of open LULC source data to provide training samples and the application of the K-means clustering technique to refine the broad range of spectral signatures for each LULC class. Experiments were conducted on a predominantly rural region characterized by a mixed agro-silvo-pastoral environment. The open source data of the official Portuguese LULC map (Carta de Uso e OcupacAo do Solo, COS) from 1995, 2007, 2010, and 2015 were integrated to generate the training samples for the entire period of analysis. The time series was computed from Landsat data based on the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index, using 221 Landsat images. The Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) classifier was used, since it accounts for LULC-type seasonality and has already achieved promising overall accuracy values for classifications based on time series. The results revealed that the proposed method was efficient in classifying a long-term satellite time-series with an overall accuracy of 76%, providing insights into the main LULC changes that occurred over 21 years.

TI  - MODIS-Based Investigation of Flood Areas in Southern Cambodia from 2002-2013
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Cambodia and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, floods commonly occur during the rainy season, and a better understanding of their spatio-temporal distribution is important for both disaster prevention and the improvement of agricultural production. This study investigated spatio-temporal flood inundation and land cover change from 2002 to 2013 in the southern part of Cambodia using Terra satellite on-board Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The algorithm for flood inundation detection, WFFI (Wavelet-based Filter for detecting spatio-temporal changes in Flood Inundation) was used, and the parameters were modified to fit the present study. The estimated inundation areas were validated using eight Landsat images. In a comparison between the original and modified WFFIs, the modified WFFI (70-96%) exhibited better accuracy than the original WFFI (30-70%). Overall, the temporal change in the flood inundation area presented a decreasing trend, and a link to the in-situ observed water level showed a decreasing trend during the rainy season. Furthermore, the estimated flood inundation exhibited a significant delay since 2008. Based on the yearly land cover MODIS product, the permanent water body and wetland areas decreased, whereas the cropland areas increased. This was as a result of increased agricultural productivity. However, water shortage was the major obstacle to increasing agricultural productivity, and it also had a negative impact on aquatic ecology, such as fish spawning grounds.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this review is to provide an updated perspective on different fields of radioguided surgery. With reference to the sentinel lymph node biopsy in oral squamous cell carcinoma, we present the results of the interactive debate held at the recent Congress of our specialty about the more relevant aspects of the London Consensus. Drainage peculiarities and indications according to the current guidelines on gynaecological tumours, endometrial and cervical cancer, are detailed and new scenarios for nuclear medicine physicians are presented; robotic surgery and hybrid tracers, for instance. Moreover, the notable growth in radioguided surgery indications for non-palpable lesions, widely used in mammary pathology, make it advisable to update two procedures which have shown satisfying results, such as the solitary pulmonary nodule and the osteoid osteoma.

TI  - Classification of aquifers in the Mina field, Nuevo Leon, using geographic information systems
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the availability of groundwater from the "Campo Mina" aquifer, located in the state of Nuevo Leon, Mexico for the agro-industrial planning of the Bravo-San Juan sub-basin. The methodology consists of compiling data derived from remote sensors and geographic information systems for the agroindustrial planning of the Rio Bravo-San Juan sub-basin under a climate change context. Remote sensing and GIS data were used to delineate potential groundwater zones. Several maps (such as: topographic map, geological, hydrogeomorphological, structural, relief dissection, slope map, groundwater) were processed using remote sensing data along with other existing maps. The availability of groundwater of the aquifer was classified qualitatively in different classes (i.e., very good, good, regular, poor and zero) depending on their hydro-geomorphological conditions. The groundwater availability map of the Mina field, Nuevo Leon, was elaborated considering maximum and minimum precipitation as well as the climatic classification of Koppen modified by Garcia (2004) and adjusted for the conditions of northeastern Mexico. The sedimentary wedges of the quaternary alluvium (free aquifer), shale limestone piedmont as well as limestone hills were successfully delineated to show groundwater potential for each formation.

TI  - Machine Learning for Modeling Water Demand
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work shows the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the modeling of water demand for the first time. Classification and regression trees (CART) and random forest (RF), a multivariate, spatially nonstationary and nonlinear ML approach, were used to build a predictive model of water demand in the city of Seville, Spain, at the census tract level. Regression trees (RT) allowed estimation of water demand with an error of 22 L/day/inhabitant and determination of the main driving variables. RF allowed estimation of water demand with error values ranging from 18.89 to 26.91 L/day/inhabitant. The RF method provided better predictions; however, the RT model facilitated better understanding of water demand. This research shows an alternative to the hitherto applied cluster and linear regression approaches for modeling water demand and paves the way for a new set of further scientific investigations based on ML methods.

TI  - The Effect of Hospitalists on Average Length of Stay
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hospitals experiencing financial pressures are seeking to gain efficiencies through innovation. One solution is to engage hospitalists to help reduce the average length of stay (ALOS). This study considers whether and to what extent hospitalists affect ALOS and whether an association exists between the number of hospitalists per occupied bed (density) and ALOS. We examined 2,858 hospitals nationwide, including 20,180 hospital-years of data from 2007 through 2015 derived from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey database. Key findings showed that hospitals using hospitalists reported a statistically significant shorter ALOS than hospitals without hospitalists. The results also indicated a statistically significant decrease in ALOS for an increase in hospitalist full-time equivalent per occupied bed. This study is important because of the generalizability of its results and suggests that hospitals may form partnerships with hospitalists to improve hospital efficiency.

TI  - Assessing Landscape Dust Emission Potential Using Combined Ground-Based Measurements and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeled estimates of eolian dust emission can vary by an order of magnitude due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of emissions. To better constrain location and magnitude of emissions, a surface erodibility factor is typically employed in models. Several landscape-scale schemes representing surface dust emission potential for use in models have recently been proposed, but validation of such schemes has only been attempted indirectly with medium-resolution remote sensing of mineral aerosol loadings and high-resolution land surface mapping. In this study, we used dust emission source points identified in Namibia with Landsat imagery together with field-based dust emission measurements using a Portable In-situ Wind Erosion Laboratory wind tunnel to assess the performance of schemes aiming to represent erodibility in global dust cycle modeling. From analyses of the surface and samples taken at the time of wind tunnel testing, a Boosted Regression Tree analysis identified the significant factors controlling erodibility based on Portable In-situ Wind Erosion Laboratory dust flux measurements and various surface characteristics, such as soil moisture, particle size, crusting degree, and mineralogy. Despite recent attention to improving the characterization of surface dust emission potential, our assessment indicates a high level of variability in the measured fluxes within similar geomorphologic classes. This variability poses challenges to dust modeling attempts based on geomorphology and/or spectral-defined classes. Our approach using high-resolution identification of dust sources to guide ground-based testing of emissivity offers a valuable means to help constrain and validate dust emission schemes. Detailed determination of the relative strength of factors controlling emission can provide further improvement to regional and global dust cycle modeling.Plain Language Summary Atmospheric mineral dust plays an important role in Earth system processes, influencing climate, providing nutrients to ecosystems, and affecting human health. The effect that atmospheric dust has on the climate and environment requires accurate modeling of emission at source, transport through the atmosphere, and deposition. To enable regional to global modeling of the dust cycle, therefore, requires realistic representation of where and when dust emission takes place. However, the highly variable nature of dust emission has resulted in modeling attempts producing disparate results. This research used Landsat remote sensing data in Namibia to identify sources of dust emission at high resolution, followed by ground-based testing using a portable wind tunnel to assess surface classification schemes intended to represent the surface in dust emission models. Despite the proposed schemes offering valuable approaches for characterization of the land surface for modeling, globally applicable representation of dust emission is still hampered by the variability of small-scale emissions. At the sublandform level of our analysis, the heterogeneous nature of dust emission results from the highly variable nature of the surfaces. Our analysis identified several factors controlling the potential for surfaces to emit dust that can be used as inputs to improve dust modeling.

TI  - Active immunisation targeting nerve growth factor attenuates chronic pain behaviour in murine osteoarthritis
T2  - ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Nerve growth factor (NGF) has emerged as a key driver of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) and antibodies to NGF are potent analgesics in human disease. Here, we validate a novel vaccine strategy to generate anti-NGF antibodies for reversal of pain behaviour in a surgical model of OA.Methods Virus-like particles were derived from the cucumber mosaic virus (CuMV) and coupled to expressed recombinant NGF to create the vaccine. 10-week-old male mice underwent partial meniscectomy to induce OA or sham-surgery. Spontaneous pain behaviour was measured by Linton incapacitance and OA severity was quantified using OARSI histological scoring. Mice (experimental and a sentinel cohort) were inoculated with CuMVtt(NGF) (Vax) or CuMVtt(ctrl) (Mock) either before surgery or once pain was established. Efficacy of anti-NGF from the plasma of sentinel vaccinated mice was measured in vitro using a neurite outgrowth assay in PC12 cells.Results Anti-NGF titres were readily detectable in the vaccinated but not mock vaccinated mice. Regular boosting with fresh vaccine was required to maintain anti-NGF titres as measured in the sentinel cohort. Both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination demonstrated a reversal of pain behaviour by incapacitance testing, and a meta-analysis of the two studies showing analgesia at peak anti-NGF titres was highly statistically significant. Serum anti-NGF was able to inhibit neurite outgrowth equivalent to around 150 ug/mL of recombinant monoclonal antibody.Conclusions This study demonstrates therapeutic efficacy of a novel NGF vaccine strategy that reversibly alleviates spontaneous pain behaviour in surgically induced murine OA.

TI  - Regional evapotranspiration estimates using the relative soil moisture ratio derived from SMAP products
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the main water loss in water balance, particularly in arid and semiarid regions. In the last decades, remote sensing technology has been providing valuable information to monitor ET at large scale. In this study, a modification of the relative evapotranspiration (F) parameter introduced by Venturini et al. (2008) is presented. The surface actual water vapor pressure (e(s)) is estimated incorporating surface texture information and the soil moisture (SM) content, as proposed by Deardorff (1978). The introduction of SM content in e(s) estimation led to a physically meaningful estimation of the traditional F formulation. As a result, the original Venturini et al.'s ET application is simpler, more flexible and robust. The results presented here were calculated from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products with two different spatial resolutions 36 and 3 km, to compute regional ET. The proposed ET model was validated using ground observations from Bowen Ratio stations and Eddy Covariance towers. The ET results with a spatial resolution of 36 km showed good agreement with ground data, with a root mean square error varying from 0.91 to 1.22 mm/d. The recently released SMAP SM product at 3 km produces ET estimates with a root mean square error of 0.63 mm/d for autumn-winter season. The new ET model results were also compared with the well-known ET MYD16A2 product, making evident that the proposed approach outreaches the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) methodology. The preliminary results presented with our simple, flexible, universal and robust ET equation using SMAP SM, are promising.

TI  - Modeling tropical montane forest biomass, productivity and canopy traits with multispectral remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical montane forests, particularly Andean rainforest, are important ecosystems for regional carbon and water cycles as well as for biological diversity and speciation. Owing to their remoteness, however, ecological key-processes are less understood as in the tropical lowlands. Remote sensing allows modeling of variables related to spatial patterns of carbon stocks and fluxes (e.g., biomass) and ecosystem functioning (e.g., functional leaf traits). However, at a landscape scale most studies conducted so far are based on airborne remote sensing data which is often available only locally and for one time-point. In contrast, multispectral satellites at moderate spectral and spatial resolutions are able to provide spatially continuous and repeated observations. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of Landsat-8 imagery in modeling tropical montane forest biomass, its productivity and selected canopy traits. Topographical, spectral and textural metrics were derived as predictors. To train and validate the models, in-situ data was sampled in 54 permanent plots in forests of southern Ecuador distributed within three study sites at 1000 m, 2000 m and 3000 m a.s.l. We used partial least squares regressions to model and map all response variables. Along the whole elevation gradient biomass and productivity models explained 31%, 43%, 69% and 63% of variance in aboveground biomass, annual wood production, fine litter production and aboveground net primary production, respectively. Regression models of canopy traits measured as community weighted means explained 62%, 78%, 65% and 65% of variance in leaf toughness, specific leaf area, foliar N concentration, and foliar P concentration, respectively. Models at single study sites hardly explained variation in aboveground biomass and the annual wood production indicating that these measures are mainly determined by the change of forest types along with elevation. In contrast, the models of fine litter production and canopy traits explained between 8%-85% in variation depending on the study site. We found spectral metrics, in particular a vegetation index using the red and the green band to provide complementary information to topographical metrics. The model performances for estimating leaf toughness, biochemical canopy traits and related fine litter production all improved when adding spectral information. Our findings therefore revealed that differences in fine litter production and canopy traits in our study area are driven by local changes in vegetation edaphically induced by topography. We conclude that Landsat-derived metrics are useful in modeling fine litter production and biochemical canopy traits, in a topographically and ecologically complex tropical montane forest.

TI  - Change of vegetation cover in the US-Mexico border region: illegal activities or climatic variability?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores both human activities and climatic factors to examine the change of vegetation cover in the US Southwest border region-a region that is almost 2000 miles long and with rich natural resources but mostly a sensitive semi-arid/arid ecosystem. It is the first study that integrates large-scale remote-sensing data with multiple layers of socio-economic data and aims to inform critical policy issues related to natural resources management and border security enforcement in the region. A fixed effects panel data regression model is deployed to control for spatial heterogeneities and macro trends in vegetation cover distribution. The results show that both illegal and legal activities have statistically significant impacts on the border region vegetation cover between 2008-2017. Within a 3 mile buffer of the border, a one-standard-deviation increase in illegal border-crossings would lead the vegetation cover index (measured between 0-100) to decline by 4.1% of its standard deviation. A one-standard-deviation increase in border patrol agent staffing would lead the vegetation cover index to decline by 19.0% of its standard deviation. Employment density (a proxy for the dominant local economic activities) in the border county economies and growing season monthly mean temperature are also statistically significant in driving the change of vegetation cover. These findings provide important implications for natural resources management and border security policy in the region, as well as for the quality of life in the local border communities.

TI  - Vegetation damage, post-disaster change degree and driving factors in the cold temperate wind disaster area of Changbai Mountain, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The typhoon outbreaks of 1986 caused many gaps in the cold temperate coniferous forest and Betula errmanii forest on the western and southern slopes in the Changbai Mountain. In 2017, research area at the 1600 -1800 m altitude in Changbai Mountain was established to explore the damage and changes of forest vegetation disturbed by the typhoon in cold temperate zone and to reveal the regulation of damage on vegetation and post-disaster change as well as the driving factors. The remote sensing data were used to classify research area based on the degree of vegetation damage and post-disaster change. A total of 40 plots were set up for vegetation survey. According to the damage degree of forest structure, three levels of severity of damage to vegetation in the cold temperate zone of Changbai Mountain were classified including gently, moderately, and severely damaged, in which moderately damaged area was largest, followed by gently damaged area and severely damaged area. Tree damage significantly differed among three level areas, with 20%, 50% and 85% reduction of the abundance of dominant trees in gently , moderately and severely damaged areas, respectively. The wind resistance ability of B. errmanii was higher than that of Picea jezoensis. The wind resistance ability of B. errmanii with larger diameter grade was higher than that of those with smaller diameter grade. The severity of damage to vegetation was strongly correlated with slope, with lower severity on the steeper slop area. From 1987 to 2017, the vegetation of wind disaster area significantly changed. The study area could be classified into three levels based on the degree of changing : fast, medium, and slow, with largest area in medium changed, followed by slowly and fast changed. The degree of vegetation changes was strongly correlated with altitude, with slower change at higher altitude area. The recovery rate of trees was slow, with P. jezoensis recovering slightly quicker than B. errmanii. The vegetation change mainly occurred in shrub and herb layers. Shrub layer recovered better than the herb layer in the fast changed area, while herb layer recovered better than the shrub layer in the medium changed area. In the slowly changed area, herb layer was generally low and dense with varying shrub layer.

TI  - From quantity to quality: enhanced understanding of the changes in urban greenspace
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextAccurately quantifying changes in urban greenspace (UG) is the prerequisite for understanding ecosystem service. In addition to quantifying the real change of UG, it's crucial to evaluate the change in quality of UG that is associated with quantitative change in area.Objectives(1) Present a new index, dynamic index of UG (UGDI) that measures changes of UG by quantifying the loss and gain on UG simultaneously in a 100mx100m grid cell. (2) Examine changes in the quality of UG measured by the NDVI.MethodsWe focused on nine Chinese major cities, and used 2.5m resolution ALOS and SPOT image data collected in 2005 and 2010, respectively, and 30m Landsat TM data.Results(1) By simultaneously quantifying the loss and gain, UGDI can identify the areas with dramatic turn over on vegetation cover that otherwise would not be able to be revealed by net change, or gain and loss alone. (2) Areas with low vegetation cover tended to increase in percent cover, and had larger magnitudes of UGDI. In contrast, the area with high vegetation cover generally experienced reduction in percent cover. (3) The NDVI value of newly-created greenspace in all nine cities was lower than that of lost greenspace, suggesting that adding the same amount of new greenspace might not compensate the loss of greenspace due to the difference in quality.ConclusionsResults can enhance our understanding on dynamics of urban greenspace, and provide insights for UG planning and management to improve urban environment and sustainability.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Pattern of Land Degradation along the China-Mongolia Railway (Mongolia)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasingly serious problem of land degradation has a direct impact on the ecosystem and sustainable development in Mongolia. The influence of land degradation on the main China-Mongolia-Russia traffic arteries is currently unclear and poses a risk to the construction of transportation infrastructure. In this study, for the first time, we obtained land cover data from 1990, 2010, and 2015, at a 30 m, resolution based on the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images along the China-Mongolia railway (Mongolia section). We then analyzed the change in the obtained land cover data using the geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis technology to obtain the land pattern and development trend of this region. Results showed that the newly-increased degraded land was distributed mainly in the center of the region and tended to expand northward. The joint effect of natural and socioeconomic factors resulted in land degradation. We speculated that the significant temperature fluctuation and the decrease in rainfall were the inducing factors. Population migration, overgrazing, infrastructure construction, unreasonable mineral exploitation, and rapid urbanization aggravate the degree of land degradation. It is thus necessary to use a broader view to observe patterns of desertification and variations in regions along the Railway facing its sustainable development.

TI  - Monitoring maize growth conditions by training a BP neural network with remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index and leaf area index
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop water stress and vegetation status are critical parameters and should be proposed as input variables of an integrated model for crop productivity and yield estimation. In this study, to improve the monitoring of the regional maize growth conditions in the North China Plain, PR China, the remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) and leaf area index (LAI) at five growth stages of maize (the seeding, jointing, heading, milk and mature stages) during 2010-2015 were generated as inputs of three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different numbers of nodes in the hidden layer to estimate the crop growth. Among these BP ANN models, an architecture with 12 nodes in the hidden layer provided the best training (RMSE = 755.7 kg/ha, MSE = 0.023) and testing (RMSE = 644.3 kg/ha, MSE = 0.037) performance and was selected to simulate values of the integrated growth monitoring index of maize (IGMIM) and to map the regional maize growth conditions pixel by pixel in the North China Plain during 2010-2018. The spatiotemporal characteristics displayed by the maize growth maps based on the IGMIM showed that the best year was 2016, the worst year was 2015, and maize growth in different parts of the plain varied accordingly with variations in the meteorological conditions. Thus, the information reflected by the IGMIM was in good agreement with the actual results. To further validate the accuracy of the integrated index, the correlations between the values of the IGMIM and several growth-related variables, including the measured yield, planting density, plant height and relative soil humidity at the 0-10 cm layer, at thirteen meteorological stations from 2010 to 2012 were analyzed, and the results were meaningful and presented a significant linear relationship. Thus, the BP ANN-based model has the ability to integrate information reflected by multiple maize growth-related factors at each growth stage and provides a better quantification of the monitoring results of regional maize growth conditions.

TI  - Improving Super-Resolution Flood Inundation Mapping for Multispectral Remote Sensing Image by Supplying More Spectral Information
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution mapping is an effective technique in mapping flood inundation for multispectral remote sensing image. However, the traditional super-resolution flood inundation mapping (SRFIM) is unable to fully utilize the spectral information from multispectral remote sensing image band. In order to resolve this problem, a novel SRFIM by supplying more spectral information (SRFIM-MSI) is proposed to improve mapping accuracy. In the proposed SRFIM-MSI, the spectral information from the multispectral band is calculated by the normalized difference water index (NDWI). A spectral term constituted by NDWI is added into the traditional SRFIM. The proposed method is evaluated by using two Landsat 8 OLI multispectral data from the study area in Cambodia. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed SRFIM-MSI produces better results than the traditional SRFIM methods.

TI  - A Partition Modeling for Anthropogenic Heat Flux Mapping in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic heat (AH) generated by human activities has a major impact on urban and regional climate. Accurately estimating anthropogenic heat is of great significance for studies on urban thermal environment and climate change. In this study, a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) estimation scheme was constructed based on socio-economic data, energy-consumption data, and multi-source remote sensing data using a partition modeling method, which takes into account the regional characteristics of AH emission caused by the differences in regional development levels. The refined AHF mapping in China was realized with a high resolution of 500 m. The results show that the spatial distribution of AHF has obvious regional characteristics in China. Compared with the AHF in provinces, the AHF in Shanghai is the highest which reaches 12.56 Wm(-2), followed by Tianjin, Beijing, and Jiangsu. The AHF values are 5.92 Wm(-2), 3.35 Wm(-2), and 3.10 Wm(-2), respectively. As can be seen from the mapping results of refined AHF, the high-value AHF aggregation areas are mainly distributed in north China, east China, and south China. The high-value AHF in urban areas is concentrated in 50-200 Wm(-2), and maximum AHF in Shenzhen urban center reaches 267 Wm(-2). Further, compared with other high resolution AHF products, it can be found that the AHF results in this study have higher spatial heterogeneity, which can better characterize the emission characteristics of AHF in the region. The spatial pattern of the AHF estimation results correspond to the distribution of building density, population, and industry zone. The high-value AHF areas are mainly distributed in airports, railway stations, industry areas, and commercial centers. It can thus be seen that the AHF estimation models constructed by the partition modeling method can well realize the estimation of large-scale AHF and the results can effectively express the detailed spatial distribution of AHF in local areas. These results can provide technical ideas and data support for studies on surface energy balance and urban climate change.

TI  - A retrospective validation study of sentinel lymph node mapping for high-risk endometrial cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the feasibility and performance of sentinel lymph-node (SLN) mapping among women with high-risk endometrial cancer (EC).Materials and methodsNinety-eight patients at high-risk EC were enrolled in this retrospective surgical trial from August 2016 to August 2018. All patients underwent intraoperative SLN biopsy, with ICG injection for laparoscopic staging; this was followed by pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (LAD). Outcomes included SLN detection rate, false-negative SLN algorithm rate, and the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SLN algorithm. The Chi-square test was used to analyze the relationship between SLN mapping and the risk factors. Then, we performed Kappa consistency check (P<0.05 with Meaning), to estimate the consistency of SLN and lymph-node metastasis.ResultsSuccessful biopsy occurred in 94 patients (170 sides) among 98 patients (196 sides). At least 1 SLN was identified in 86.7% (170/196). Overall, the false-negative rate (FNR) was 11.8% (2/17), NPV was 97.3% (72/74), and sensitivity was 88.2% (15/17). 22/98 patients (22.4%) with high-risk EC had at least one metastatic lymph node identified. When the SLN algorithm was retrospectively applied, the FNR was 9.1% (2/22) and sensitivity was 90.9% (20/22). Considering the surgeon's experience, 68 cases of EC (except for 30 patients), the detection rate was 89.7% (122/136), NPV was 98.1% (50/51), and the FNR was 5.6% (1/18). The factor significantly affecting the detection rate of SLNs was lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (P=0.016). SLN metastasis of EC was associated with depth of myometrial invasion (P=0.034). Theanalysis result of SLN and the consistency of pelvic lymph-node metastasis status. As detected by Kappa coefficient was 0.939 (P<0.001), suggests highly consistency.ConclusionsOur SLN detection rate for high-risk EC was the same as previously reported. When SLN is not detected, better after 30 patients' experience, is a reasonable alternative to complete LAD in high-risk EC. In addition, SLN shows high co-occurrence with pelvic lymph nodes. Therefore, SLN biopsy can be used to diagnose high-risk EC.

TI  - Multivariate DINEOF Reconstruction for Creating Long-Term Cloud-Free Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Data Records From SeaWiFS and MODIS: A Case Study in Bohai and Yellow Seas, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term reliable satellite chlorophyll-a (chl-a) data record is essential in understanding the state of ocean biology and quantifying its changes. Creating a long-term data record requires a combination/merger of multiple satellite products into one data record, since the lifetime of any single ocean color sensor is finite. However, because of differences in sensor design, calibration, and retrieval models, apparent cross-mission biases are usually observed between different sensor products. To attain a coherent multisensor chl-a data record, the observed cross-mission biases should be accurately addressed in the data combination/merging schemes. In this study, a multivariable data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (M-DINEOF) approach was used to create long-term chl-a records by applying the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products. Under the assumption that the single-sensor chl-a product is free from spurious temporal artifacts and can be reference time series representing the actual variability of chl-a, the discrepancies of trends derived from different chl-a series were quantitatively evaluated based on statistical t-test and Taylor diagram analyses. Compared with direct concatenation and linear regression methods, the M-DINEOF method more effectively reproduced the main trend patterns observed in reference data series during their overlapped periods. The results highlight the importance of a cross-mission bias correction when combining multisensor satellite data records and suggest that the M-DINEOF reconstruction provides a simple and effective path forward for creating reliable multisensor ocean color records suitable for long-term trend analysis.

TI  - An Improved CASA Model for Estimating Winter Wheat Yield from Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely monitoring and evaluation of the regional grain crop yield is more significant for formulating import and export plans of agricultural products, regulating grain markets and adjusting the planting structure. In this study, an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model was coupled with time-series satellite remote sensing images to estimate winter wheat yield. Firstly, in 2009 the entire growing season of winter wheat in the two districts of Tongzhou and Shunyi of Beijing was divided into 54 stages at five-day intervals. Net Primary Production (NPP) of winter wheat was estimated by the improved CASA model with HJ-1A/B satellite images from 39 transits. For the 15 stages without HJ-1A/B transit, MOD17A2H data products were interpolated to obtain the spatial distribution of winter wheat NPP at 5-day intervals over the entire growing season of winter wheat. Then, an NPP-yield conversion model was utilized to estimate winter wheat yield in the study area. Finally, the accuracy of the method to estimate winter wheat yield with remote sensing images was verified by comparing its results to the ground-measured yield. The results showed that the estimated yield of winter wheat based on remote sensing images is consistent with the ground-measured yield, with R-2 of 0.56, RMSE of 1.22 t ha(-1), and an average relative error of -6.01%. Based on time-series satellite remote sensing images, the improved CASA model can be used to estimate the NPP and thereby the yield of regional winter wheat. This approach satisfies the accuracy requirements for estimating regional winter wheat yield and thus may be used in actual applications. It also provides a technical reference for estimating large-scale crop yield.

TI  - Long-Term Outcome After Retro-Areolar Versus Peri-Tumoral Injection of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIO) for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objective. SPIO is effective in sentinel node (SN) detection. No nuclear medicine department is needed, and no allergic reactions have occurred. This study aimed to compare retro-areolar and peri-tumoral SPIO injections regarding skin staining, detection rates and number of SNs.Methods. Data on staining size, intensity and cosmetic outcome (0-5; 0=no problem) were collected by telephone interviews with 258 women undergoing breast conservation. SN detection and the number of SNs were prospectively registered in 332 women.Results. After retro-areolar and peri-tumoral injections, 67.3% and 37.8% (p < 0.001) developed skin staining, with remaining staining in 46.2 vs. 9.4% after 36 months (p < 0.001). Initial mean size was 16.3 vs. 6.8cm (p < 0.001) and after 36months, 6.6 vs. 1.8cm(2) (p < 0.001). At 75.1% of 738 interviews, staining was reported paler. After retro-areolar injections, cosmetic outcome scored worse for 2years. The mean (median) scores were 1.3(0) vs. 0.5(0) points, and 0.2(0) vs. 0.1(0) points, at 12 and 36months, respectively. Overall detection rates were 98.3% and 97.4% (p = 0.43) and the number of SNs 1.35 vs. 1.57 (p = 0.02) after retro-areolar and peri-tumoral injections. Injection, regardless of type, 1-27 days before surgery increased detection rates with SPIO, 98.0% vs. 94.2% (p = 0.06) ,and SN numbers, 1.56 vs. 1.27 (p = 0.003).Conclusion. SPIO is effective and facilitates planning for surgery. Peri-tumoral injection reduced staining with a similar detection rate. Staining was not considered a cosmetic problem among most women. Injecting SPIO 1-27 days before surgery increased the detection rate by 3.8% and increased the number of SNs by 0.3.

TI  - Assessment of atmospheric correction algorithms for the Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Imager over coastal and inland waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The relatively high spatial resolution, short revisit time and red-edge spectral band (705 nm) of the ESA Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager makes this sensor attractive for monitoring water quality of coastal and inland waters. Reliable atmospheric correction is essential to support routine retrieval of optically active substance concentration from water-leaving reflectance. In this study, six publicly available atmospheric correction algorithms (Acolite, C2RCC, ICOR, 12gen, Polymer and Sen2Cor) are evaluated against above-water optical in situ measurements, within a robust methodology, in two optically diverse coastal regions (Baltic Sea, Western Channel) and from 13 inland waterbodies from 5 European countries with a range of optical properties. The total number of match-ups identified for each algorithm ranged from 1059 to 1668 with 521 match-ups common to all algorithms. These in situ and MSI match-ups were used to generate statistics describing the performance of each algorithm for each respective region and a combined dataset. All ACs tested showed high uncertainties, in many cases > 100% in the red and > 1000% in the near-infra red bands. Polymer and C2RCC achieved the lowest root mean square differences (similar to 0.0016 sr(-1)) and mean absolute differences (similar to 40-60% in blue/green bands) across the different datasets. Retrieval of blue-green and NIR-red band ratios indicate that further work on AC algorithms is required to reproduce the spectral shape in the red and NIR bands needed to accurately retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentration in turbid waters.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of environment based on integrated remote sensing indexes in arid inland river basin in Northwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid inland river basin has been regarded as environmental vulnerable and an important protective area in northwest China. Shiyang River Basin (SRB) is one of the most typical areas in arid inland rivers basin in China. The environmental quality evaluation of different periods is significant for environmental control and management of SRB. In this paper, the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), wetness index (WI), albedo, index-based built-up index (IBI), salinization index (SI), and land surface temperature (LST) were obtained through Landsat TM and OLI images in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016. Besides, three methods including spatial principal component analysis (SPCA), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and remote-sensing spatial distance model (RSSDM) were compared to select a reasonable method for environmental evaluation. The AHP method was determined as the final method for objectively evaluating spatiotemporal changes of environment from 1995 to 2016 in SRB. The results showed that the environment deteriorated in 1995-2000 and improved in 2000-2016. The effect of environmental governance was significant in 2010-2016 because of the longtime environmental management between multiple departments. The results indicated that the environmental quality of SRB was generally improved from 1995 to 2016. We found that the improvement areas were mainly concentrated in the oasis and marginal areas, while environmental damage areas were mainly distributed in the urban regions. However, in most areas of the SRB, the environment was still below average level of China, and the roads of the environment management still had a long way to go. We found that spatiotemporal pattern analysis of the environment was of great importance for the formulation of plans for development of this basin and environmental protection measures.

TI  - A Modeling Approach to Diagnose the Impacts of Global Changes on Discharge and Suspended Sediment Concentration within the Red River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Red River basin is a typical Asian river system affected by climate and anthropogenic changes. The purpose of this study is to build a tool to separate the effect of climate variability and anthropogenic influences on hydrology and suspended sediments. A modeling method combining in situ and climatic satellite data was used to analyze the discharge (Q) and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at a daily time scale from 2000 to 2014. Scenarios of natural and actual conditions were implemented to quantify the impacts of climate variability and dams. The modeling gained satisfactory simulation results of water regime and SSC compared to the observations. Under natural conditions, the Q and SSC show decreasing tendencies, and climate variability is the main influence factor reducing the Q. Under actual conditions, SSC is mainly reduced by dams. At the outlet, annual mean Q got reduced by 13% (9% by climate and 4% by dams), and annual mean SSC got reduced to 89% (13% due to climate and 76% due to dams) of that under natural conditions. The climate tendencies are mainly explained by a decrease of 9% on precipitation and 5% on evapotranspiration, which results in a 13% decrease of available water for the whole basin.

TI  - Downscaling SMAP soil moisture estimation with gradient boosting decision tree regression over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite can no longer directly deliver high-resolution (9 km) soil moisture products with the failure of the onboard L-band radar. Thus, an appropriate replacement sensor and new algorithms are urgently needed to compensate for the lost radar and estimate soil moisture at high-resolution. This paper presents a new downscaling approach, the Downscaling basEd oN gradient boosting deciSion trEe (DENSE) method to solve this problem. We analyzed 26 soil moisture related indices, derived from MODIS and a digital elevation model, to identify proxy variables for soil moisture variability. A gradient boosting decision tree regression links the aggregated soil moisture proxies and SMAP observations at a coarse scale to express the nonlinear relationships between them. High-resolution soil moisture products were generated by applying this built regression model to the optimal soil moisture proxies at a fine scale over the entire Tibetan Plateau during the years 2015-2017. In situ measurements were collected from the Ngari, Naqu, and Maqu networks, which represent different climatic and vegetation conditions. We evaluated the downscaled soil moisture against ground observations at the daily, point, and network scales. The results indicated that the DENSE method effectively infers the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture; and at the same time, preserves SMAP soil moisture accuracy. The performance of the proposed method failed in the Maqu network as this area is covered by dense vegetation. Although further improvements are still needed to correct vegetation effects, nevertheless, the DENSE method improved the spatial resolution of SMAP soil moisture estimates, from 36 km to 1 km over the Tibetan plateau where high-resolution soil moisture products are necessary to support local and global hydrological applications.

TI  - Evaluating Potential Distribution of High-Risk Aquatic Invasive Species in the Water Garden and Aquarium Trade at a Global Scale Based on Current Established Populations
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic non-native invasive species are commonly traded in the worldwide water garden and aquarium markets, and some of these species pose major threats to the economy, the environment, and human health. Understanding the potential suitable habitat for these species at a global scale and at regional scales can inform risk assessments and predict future potential establishment. Typically, global habitat suitability models are fit for freshwater species with only climate variables, which provides little information about suitable terrestrial conditions for aquatic species. Remotely sensed data including topography and land cover data have the potential to improve our understanding of suitable habitat for aquatic species. In this study, we fit species distribution models using five different model algorithms for three non-native aquatic invasive species with bioclimatic, topographic, and remotely sensed covariates to evaluate potential suitable habitat beyond simple climate matches. The species examined included a frog (Xenopus laevis), toad (Bombina orientalis), and snail (Pomacea spp.). Using a unique modeling approach for each species including background point selection based on known established populations resulted in robust ensemble habitat suitability models. All models for all species had test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values greater than 0.70 and percent correctly classified values greater than 0.65. Importantly, we employed multivariate environmental similarity surface maps to evaluate potential extrapolation beyond observed conditions when applying models globally. These global models provide necessary forecasts of where these aquatic invasive species have the potential for establishment outside their native range, a key component in risk analyses.

TI  - Identification and genomic characterization of the first isolate of bluetongue virus serotype 5 detected in Australia
T2  - VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV), transmitted by midges (Culicoides sp), is distributed worldwide and causes disease in ruminants. In particular, BT can be a debilitating disease in sheep causing serious trade and socio-economic consequences at both local and global levels. Across Australia, a sentinel cattle herd surveillance program monitors the BTV activity. Prior to 2014, BTV-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -15, -16, -20, -21 and -23 had been isolated in Australia, but no bluetongue disease has occurred in a commercial Australian flock. We routinely use a combination of serology, virus isolation, RT-PCR and next generation and conventional nucleotide sequencing technologies to detect and phylogenetically characterize incursions of novel BTV strains into Australia. Screening of Northern Territory virus isolates in 2015 revealed BTV-5, a serotype new to Australia. We derived the complete genome of this isolate and determined its phylogenetic relationship with exotic BTV-5 isolates. Gene segments 2, 6, 7 and 10 exhibited a close relationship with the South African prototype isolate RSArrrr/5. This was the first Australian isolation of a Western topotype of segment 10. Serological surveillance data highlighted the antigenic cross-reactivity between BTV-5 and BTV-9. Phylogenetic investigation of segments 2 and 6 of these serotypes confirmed their unconventional relationships within the BTV serogroup. Our results further highlighted a need for a revision of the current serologically based system for BTV strain differentiation and importantly, implied a potential for genome segments of pathogenic Western BTV strains to rapidly enter Southeast Asia. This emphasized a need for continued high-level surveillance of vectors and viruses at strategic locations in the north of Australia The expansion of routine characterization and classification of BTV to a whole genome approach is recommended, to better monitor the presence and level of establishment of novel Western topotype segments within the Australian episystem.

TI  - Integration of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the diagnostics and treatment of vulvar and vaginal cancer
T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInguinal lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival in patients with vulvar and vaginal cancer. Over the last decade the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) has become part of the clinical routine especially for vulvar cancer.AimPresentation of the currently available literature and discussion of the guideline recommendations regarding SNB in vulvar and vaginal cancer.MethodsThe Medline (PubMed) databank was searched for articles on SNB in vulvar and vaginal cancer. Search terms were vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer AND sentinelnode biopsy.ResultsA risk estimation for the prognosis and therefore a stratification with respect to the adjuvant treatment strategy is only possible after surgical staging of the lymph nodes in clinically node-negative patients with vulvar cancer. Since publication of the GROINSS-V-I study in 2008, SNB is considered to be asafe procedure in early stage vulvar cancer when the following criteria are met: unifocal primary tumor, tumor diameter <4cm and clinically (and sonographically) inconspicuous inguinal lymph nodes. Implementation of the SNB procedure has led to asubstantial decrease of surgical morbidity with only a minimally increased risk of inguinal recurrence. In contrast to vulvar cancer the performance of SNB alone is classified as experimental in vaginal cancer. The main reason is the rarity of these tumors resulting in an inability to perform prospective studies within areasonable timeframe; however, especially in vaginal cancer where the association between tumor localization and lymphatic spread is variable and poorly understood, SNB may be the key to individualize treatment and minimize morbidity while taking reasonable oncological risks. Lymphatic drainage areas that are defined as tumor-free by the SNB procedure could be omitted from further treatment instead of bilateral inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes in each patient.ConclusionsThe SNB should be offered to all patients with primary vulvar cancer who fulfill the criteria of the GROINSS-V-I study. In vaginal cancer the procedure is still experimental but is ahelpful tool to individualize treatment.

TI  - Estimating crop primary productivity with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 using machine learning methods trained with radiative transfer simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in the last decades for agricultural applications, both for assessing vegetation condition and for subsequent yield prediction. Existing remote sensing-based methods to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP), which is an important variable to indicate crop photosynthetic function and stress, typically rely on empirical or semi-empirical approaches, which tend to over-simplify photosynthetic mechanisms. In this work, we take advantage of all parallel developments in mechanistic photosynthesis modeling and satellite data availability for an advanced monitoring of crop productivity. In particular, we combine process-based modeling with the soil-canopy energy balance radiative transfer model (SCOPE) with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical remote sensing data and machine learning methods in order to estimate crop GPP. With this approach, we by-pass the need for an intermediate step to retrieve the set of vegetation biophysical parameters needed to accurately model photosynthesis, while still accounting for the complex processes of the original physically-based model. Several implementations of the machine learning models are tested and validated using simulated and flux tower-based GPP data. Our final neural network model is able to estimate GPP at the tested flux tower sites with r(2) of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.38 gC d(-1) m(-2), which outperforms empirical models based on vegetation indices. The first test of applicability of this model to Landsat 8 data showed good results (r(2) of 0.82 and RMSE of 1.97 gC d(-1) m(-2)), which suggests that our approach can be further applied to other sensors. Modeling and testing is restricted to C3 crops in this study, but can be extended to C4 crops by producing a new training dataset with SCOPE that accounts for the different photosynthetic pathways. Our model successfully estimates GPP across a variety of C3 crop types and environmental conditions even though it does not use any local information from the corresponding sites. This highlights its potential to map crop productivity from new satellite sensors at a global scale with the help of current Earth observation cloud computing platforms.

T2  - PUBLIC RELATIONS INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu argued that the presence of critical counter-voices and powers is a fundamental element of any genuine democracy. However, in Australia, these counter-voices are increasingly marginalized and threatened by controversial laws that would limit the legal standing of conservation groups and the use of overseas donations for advocacy purposes based on the argument that 'systematic, well-funded' environmental campaigns are threatening the nation's economic prosperity. Drawing on social movement theory and Bourdieu's theory of practice, this case study details the final months of the Save Beeliar Wetlands (SBW) campaign in the lead up to the 2017 West Australian state election. The author challenges three common assumptions in the extant PR activism literature: The existence of activists in opposition to organizations and governments, the presence of a 'zone of compromise' between activists and the organizations or governments whose actions they are opposing, and the conceptualization of activists as homogeneous entity. Evolving into a colorful collective of over 35 local groups, five local councils, and thousands of individuals, Beeliar Wetland Defenders (BWD) successfully created an alternative narrative to the State and Federal Governments' neoliberal agenda. Activists thereby contributed significantly to a change in leadership and the termination of a $1.9 billion infrastructure project. This article argues that activist groups' interventions in public debate perform a valuable societal voice as critical counter-voices in challenging established hierarchies and power relationships. However, in mounting and framing their arguments within the neoliberal framework, activist groups may also inadvertently reinforce this worldview.

TI  - Current status of Landsat program, science, and applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Formal planning and development of what became the first Landsat satellite commenced over 50 years ago in 1967. Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality.Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and followup with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop-justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.

TI  - Effect of lymph node examined count on accurate staging and survival of resected esophageal cancer
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We examined the association between numbers of lymph nodes examined (LNEs) and accurate staging and survival to determine the optimal LNE count during esophagectomy using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry and the Department of Thoracic Surgery of a single institution (SI). Methods A total of 7356 EC patients met our inclusion criteria from the SEER database and 1275 patients from SI. We applied multivariate models to investigate the relationship between the LNE count and LN metastasis and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) generated by the multivariate models were fitted with Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing, and the structural breakpoints were determined by the Chow test. Results Higher numbers of LNEs were linked to a higher proportion of LN metastasis and better CSS in both cohorts. Cut-point analysis determined a threshold of LNEs of 12 for adenocarcinoma and 14 for esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) considering accurate staging, and 15 for adenocarcinoma and 14 for ESCC considering OS. The cut-points for CSS were examined in the SEER database and validated in the divided cohort from SI (all P < 0.05). Conclusion A greater number of LNEs are significantly associated with more accurate N staging and better survival in EC patients. We recommend 15 and 14 as the threshold LNE counts for adenocarcinoma and ESCC patients, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring annual dynamics of mature rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna during 1987-2018 using Landsat time series data: A multiple normalization approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring rubber plantations dynamics is essential for assessing eco-environmental effects in soil, hydrology and biodiversity especially in the northern edge of the Asian tropics (e.g. Xishuangbanna, China). In this study, a novel phenology-based multiple normalization approach was firstly proposed to annually map rubber plantations between two critical phenological phase (defoliation and foliation) in Xishuangbanna during 1987-2018. It included three key steps, namely (1) Landsat non-visible bands normalization for calculating the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), (2) normalization of NDMI and NBR for the Normalized Vegetation Index (NVI), and (3) re-normalization of NVIs for the Re-Normalized Vegetation Index (RNVI). The NVI highlighted the temporal differences of NDMI in land surface moisture content and NBR in soil moisture as well as vegetation survival of rubber plantations during the shifting period of defoliation and foliation. The RNVI fully considered the inverse patterns of the NVIs between defoliation and foliation phase. Rubber plantations were featured by negative NVI and RNVI values within the two temporal windows, while the positive NVI and RNVI values or zero stood for other non-rubber land cover types. The average overall accuracy of five-year mature rubber plantations maps (2010, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2018) was up to 94.7% with the average kappa coefficient of 0.88, showing the great potential of multiple normalization approach. The total area of rubber plantations increased about 5.9 times from 1987 to 2018, showing clear expansion trends from centralization to scattering in Xishuangbanna as well as continuous spread in Sino-Lao (near Luang Namtha) and Sino-Myanmar (near Mongphak of Shan) border regions on the Chinese side. In addition, annual average analysis showed that about 91.4% of rubber plantations were invariably distributed around Jinghong City and Mengla County in the past decades.

TI  - Reconstruction of Synthetic Aperture Radar Raw Data under Analog-To-Digital Converter Saturation Distortion for Large Dynamic Range Scenes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital storage and transmission are common processes in modern synthetic aperture radar systems; thus, analog-to-digital converters are indispensable. Such processes can lead to two types of error: quantization (or granular) error and saturation (or clipping) error, which cause sampling noise, and radiometric and harmonic distortions in final images. Traditionally, reasonable choices of the gain and the number of quantization bits by the analog-to-digital converter based on the echo distribution can effectively reduce these errors. However, establishing the gain control repository of a synthetic aperture radar mission is a long process. In addition, if the dynamic range of the backscattering coefficient is extremely large or if unexpected strong targets appear in a scene, then harmonics occur in the echo, which turns the variable gain amplifier into chaos based on statistic and, inevitably, results in saturation in the raw data. Once raw data saturation occurs, the SAR system can conventionally adjust only the analog-to-digital converter in the next observation, thus reducing timeliness. Power loss compensation based on a statistical model and saturation (clipping) factor on a large-scale could compensate for the energy loss in images; however, detail interference, such as harmonic distortion, cannot be effectively suppressed, which will lead to false targets in the focused data. To address this particular problem, a novel anti-saturation method for large dynamic range scenes is proposed in this paper. The log-normal distribution is used in this article to describe dynamic range scenes with strong isolated targets, which mainly cause receiver saturation. Using the statistical distribution of complex scenes as a priori information, a maximum a posteriori estimation algorithm is proposed to simultaneously compensate for the saturated values in the raw data and retain the non-saturated values. Thus, the details of the weak background are well preserved, and the isolated strong targets with sparsity are reconstructed perfectly. With Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed method can improve the radiometric accuracy by 5 to 10 dB and effectively suppress the energy of false targets. Based on TerraSAR-X, ALOS-2, and Radarsat-1 synthetic aperture radar data, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are also verified by simulations.

TI  - Diverse Responses of Vegetation Dynamics to Snow Cover Phenology over the Boreal Region
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover phenology plays an important role in vegetation dynamics over the boreal region, but the observed evidence of this interaction is limited. A comprehensive understanding of the changes in vegetation dynamics and snow cover phenology as well as the interactions between them is urgently needed. To investigate this, we calculated two indicators, the start of the growing season (SOS) and the annual maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVImax), as proxies of vegetation dynamics using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Snow cover duration (SCD) and snow cover end date (SCE) were also extracted from MODIS snow cover datasets. Then, we quantified the spatial-temporal changes in vegetation dynamics and snow cover phenology as well as the relationship between them over the boreal region. Our results showed that the EVImax generally demonstrated an increasing trend, but SOS varied in different regions and vegetation types from 2001 to 2014. The earlier onset of SOS was mainly concentrated in the Siberian boreal region. In the Eurasian boreal region, we observed an advance in the SCE and decrease in the SCD, while in the North American boreal region, the spatial distribution of the trends exhibited substantial heterogeneity. Our results also indicated that the snow cover phenology had significant impacts on the SOS and the EVImax, but the effects varied in different regions, vegetation types, and climate gradients. Our findings provide strong evidence of the interaction between vegetation dynamics and snow cover phenology, and snow cover should be considered when analyzing future vegetation dynamics in the boreal region.

TI  - Merging the MODIS and Landsat Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux Products Using the Multiresolution Tree Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of the terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) from satellite observations at high spatial and temporal scales plays an important role in the assessment of the water and heat exchange between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. Although a variety of data fusion methods have been proposed to merge different LE products for more reliable estimates, most of them have ignored the spatiotemporal consistency of LE products across different resolutions. In this paper, we apply the multiresolution tree (MRT) method to improve the accuracy and reduce the inconsistency between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LE (MOD16) product and the Landsat-based LE product at different resolutions. Eddy covariance (EC) ground measurements at five sites, MODIS and Landsat images from January 2005 to December 2005 in the north central USA, are used to evaluate the performance of the MRT method. The results show that the MRT method can improve the accuracy of the original LE products (MOD16 and Landsat), and it has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty and inconsistency of these products. The bias decreased by 38.3% on average, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreased by approximately 49.2% after the MRT was applied at each scale. Further studies are still required to make the MRT method more universal on a variety of land cover types for long-time periods.

TI  - Classification method of cultivated land based on UAV visible light remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate acquisition of the grain crop planting area is a necessary condition for realizing precision agriculture. UAV remote sensing has the advantages of low cost use, simple operation, real-time acquisition of remote sensor images and high ground resolution. It is difficult to separate cultivated land from other terrain by using only a single feature, making it necessary to extract cultivated land by combining various features and hierarchical classification. In this study, the UAV platform was used to collect visible light remote sensing images of farmland to monitor and extract the area information, shape information and position information of farmland. Based on the vegetation index, texture information and shape information in the visible light band, the object-oriented method was used to study the best scheme for extracting cultivated land area. After repeated experiments, it has been determined that the segmentation scale 50 and the consolidation scale 90 are the most suitable segmentation parameters. Uncultivated crops and other features are separated by using the band information and texture information. The overall accuracy of this method is 86.40% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.80. The experimental results show that the UAV visible light remote sensing data can be used to classify and extract cultivated land with high precision. However, there are some cases where the finely divided plots are misleading, so further optimization and improvement are needed.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution of water areas and croplands in the three provinces of Northeast China based on remote sensing data
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Water area and cropland are important resources for food production, the temporal and spatial changes of which maintain the sustainable development of regional agriculture. The three northeastern provinces in China are typical areas where human activities have exerted significant impacts on land cover change. It is of great significance to analyze the changes of water areas and croplands and their driving mechanisms from the perspective of human-environment coupling system. Through the land use classification data obtained from remote sensing interpretation in the three provinces in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, the spatial and temporal evolution pattern of water areas and croplands were quantitatively expressed using spatial analysis and visualization methods. The results showed that water areas had changed from "slight reduction-slight increase-sharp decrease" during the 15 years, with an average annual reduction of 213.48 km(2). The main reason was that the beaches, lakes, and other waters were converted into croplands. The water areas in the middle and upper reaches of the Songhua River and the Dongliao River watershed had been significantly reduced. The cropland areas had continued to increase due to deforestation and land reclamation, with a rate of 707.94 km(2) . a(-1). The area of reduced croplands turned into waters was less than that of water areas transferred to croplands. Our results provide scientific support for formulating agricultural resource management policies and implementing agricultural sustainable development planning programs in the three northeastern provinces of China.

TI  - Inversion of inherent optical properties in optically complex waters using sentinel-3A/OLCI images: A case study using China's three largest freshwater lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inherent optical properties (IOPs) play an important role in underwater light field, and are difficult to estimate accurately using satellite data in optically complex waters. To study water quality in appropriate temporal and spatial scales, it is necessary to develop methods to obtain IOPs form space-based observation with quantified uncertainties. Field-measured IOP data (N = 405) were collected from 17 surveys between 2011 and 2017 in the three major largest freshwater lakes of China (Lake Chaohu, Lake Taihu, and Lake Hongze) in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River (LYHR). Here we provide a case-study on how to use in-situ observation of IOPs to devise an improved algorithm for retrieval of IOPs. We then apply this algorithm to observation with Sentinel-3A OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument, corrected with our improved AC scheme), and use in-situ data to show that the algorithm performs better than the standard OLCI IOP product. We use the satellite derived products to study the spatial and seasonal distributions of IOPs and concentrations of optically active constituents in these three lakes, including chlorophyll-a (Chla) and suspended particulate matter (SPM), using all cloud-free OLCI images (115 scenes) over the lakes in the LYHR basin in 2017. Our study provides a strategy for using local and remote observations to obtain important water quality parameters necessary to manage resources such as reservoirs, lakes and coastal waters.

TI  - Secondary Metabolites and Antiradical Activity of Liquid Fermentation of Morchella sp. Isolated from Southwest China
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Morels famous for their taste and nutrition are in short supply all over the world although they were considered as one of the most highly prized edible and medicinal mushrooms. Because of the limitation of resource and cultivation technology, fermentation of edible mushroom was gradually applied to nutrient, bioactivity and breeder seed preparation. At present, there are more reports on sugar and amino acid but less on other components. Morchella sp. YDJ-ZY-1 was isolated from the wild fruiting body by the spores releasing method in Zunyi Guizhou province in Southwest China and identified based on phenotype and genotype characteristics. Chemical compositions of YDJ-ZY-1 were investigated from liquid fermentation that will lay the foundation for further development and utilization. Four pyranoids (1-4) and 2-(1-oxo-2-hydroxyethyl) furan (5), linoleic acid (6), Morelin (2-hydroxy-cinnamic acid methyl ester, (7) and 1-O--d-ribofuranose-Morelin (8) were obtained from EtOAc extraction and elucidated by spectral data. Product 4 and 8 were new compounds and 7 was isolated from nature for the first time. Antiradical activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging effect on DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical 2,2-Diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl). Compound 5 exhibited strong antiradical activity while compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate activity. Thus, incubation of Morchella sp YDJ-ZY-1 separated from the wild fruit body afforded eight compounds. Secondary metabolites with new structures were mined from fermentation of Morchella sp. and antiradical activity was evaluated.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1 Imagery for Soil Salinity Prediction Under the Condition of Coastal Restoration
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a major cause of land degradation in coastal environments and arid lands; in the first case due to sea water, and the second case due to precipitation/evaporation relationship. In coastal wetlands, soil salinity is very sensitive to plant invasion. In this context, it is necessary to obtain a better understanding of soil salinity variation to improve the management of coastal land resources. In this study, we explored the potential of Sentinel-1 data in predicting electrical conductivity (EC) at three depths. Also, we assessed the usefulness of the knowledge of the invasion process in EC prediction by comparing structural equation modeling (SEM), that included such knowledge, and linear regression model (LM), that simply modeled the relationships between EC and predictors. The case study was conducted in an invaded coastal wetland dominated by Spartina alterniflora Loisel in the east-central China coast. Before modeling, principal component analysis was used to reduce the multidimensionality of time series images. In SEM, the model explained 82% of EC variation in 0-30 cm, 99% in 30-60 cm, and 71% in 60-100 cm. The cross validation showed the SEM model provided good accuracy, with RPD (a ratio of performance to deviation) values of 1.41 in 0-30 cm, 1.51 in 30-60 cm, and 1.43 in 60-100 cm. In comparison to the poorer accuracy of LM models, we argued that modeling the relationships between the exotic plant and EC at different depths can be treated as a substantial advantage of the approach. These results provided useful indications about the strong potentials of Sentinel-1 imagery in quantitative prediction of soil salinity.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Change on Lake Fluctuations in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan (HKHT) regions are crucial indicators for the combined impacts of regional climate change and resultant glacier retreat. However, they lack long-term systematic monitoring and thus their responses to recent climatic change still remain only partially understood. This study investigated lake extent fluctuations in the HKHT regions over the past 40 years using Landsat (MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI) images obtained from the 1970s to 2014. Influenced by different regional atmospheric circulation systems, our results show that lake changing patterns are distinct from region to region, with the most intensive lake shrinking observed in northeastern HKHT (HKHT Interior, Tarim, Yellow, Yangtze), while the most extensive expansion was observed in the western and southwestern HKHT (Amu Darya, Ganges Indus and Brahmaputra), largely caused by the proliferation of small lakes in high-altitude regions during 1970s-1995. In the past 20 years, extensive lake expansions (similar to 39.6% in area and similar to 119.1% in quantity) were observed in all HKHT regions. Climate change, especially precipitation change, is the major driving force to the changing dynamics of the lake fluctuations; however, effects from the glacier melting were also significant, which contributed approximately 31.9-40.5%, 16.5-39.3%, 12.8-29.0%, and 3.3-6.1% of runoff to lakes in the headwaters of the Tarim, Amu Darya, Indus, and Ganges, respectively. We consider that the findings in this paper could have both immediate and long-term implications for dealing with water-related hazards, controlling glacial lake outburst floods, and securing water resources in the HKHT regions, which contain the headwater sources for some of the largest rivers in Asia that sustain 1.3 billion people.

TI  - A spatially structured adaptive two-stage model for retrieving ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from VIIRS AOD in China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While the aerosol optical depth (AOD) product from the Visible Infrared Imaging Suite (VIIRS) instrument has proven effective for estimating regional ground-level particle concentrations with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), its performance at larger spatial scales remains unclear. Despite the wide application of statistical models in building ground-level PM2.5 satellite remote sensing retrieval models, a limited number of studies have considered the spatiotemporal heterogeneities for model structures. Taking China as the study area, we used the VIIRS AOD, together with multi-source auxiliary variables, to develop a spatially structured adaptive two-stage model to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations at a 6-km spatial resolution. To this end, we first defined and calculated a dual distance from the ground-level PM2.5 monitoring data. We then applied the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means on dual distances and obtained 13 spatial clusters. Subsequently, we combined the time fixed effects regression (TEFR) model and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to develop the spatially structured adaptive two-stage model. For each spatial cluster, we examined all possible combinations of auxiliary variables and determined the best model structure according to multiple statistical test results. Finally, we obtained the PM2.5 estimates through regression mapping. At least seven model-fitting data records per day made a good threshold that could best overcome the model overfitting induced by the second-stage GWR model at the minimum price of losing samples. The overall model fitting and ten-fold cross validation (CV) R-2 were 0.82 and 0.60, respectively, under that threshold. Model performances among different spatial clusters differed to a certain extent. High-CV R-2 values always exceeded 0.6 while low CV R-2 values less than 0.5 also existed. Both the size of the model-fitting data records and the extent of urban industrial characteristics of spatial clusters accounted for these differences. The PM2.5 estimates agreed well with the PM2.5 observations with correlation coefficients all exceeding 0.5 at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. East of Hu's line and north of the Yangtze River were characterized by high PM2.5 concentrations. This study contributes to the understanding of how well VIIRS AOD can retrieve ground-level PM2.5 concentrations at the national scale and strategies for building ground-level PM2.5 satellite remote sensing retrieval models.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although data-driven methods including deep neural network (DNN) were introduced, there was not enough assessment about spatial characteristics when using limited ground observation as reference. This work aimed to interpret the feasibility of several machine learning approaches to assess the spatial distribution of solar radiation on Earth based on the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) geostationary satellite. Four data-driven models were selected (artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and DNN), to compare their accuracy and spatial estimating performance. Moreover, we used a physical model to probe the ability of data-driven methods, implementing hold-out and k-fold cross-validation approaches based on pyranometers located in South Korea. The results of analysis showed the RF had the highest accuracy in predicting performance, although the difference between RF and the second-best technique (DNN) was insignificant. Temporal variations in root mean square error (RMSE) were dependent on the number of data samples, while the physical model showed relatively less sensitivity. Nevertheless, DNN and RF showed less variability in RMSE than the others. To examine spatial estimation performance, we mapped solar radiation over South Korea for each model. The data-driven models accurately simulated the observed cloud pattern spatially, whereas the physical model failed to do because of cloud mask errors. These exhibited different spatial retrieval performances according to their own training approaches. Overall analysis showed that deeper layers of networks approaches (RF and DNN), could best simulate the challenging spatial pattern of thin clouds when using satellite multispectral data.

T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the water quality of the Qinghe Reservoir in a timely and accurate manner, multi-spectral remote sensing technology is used to monitor the water quality. Using the OLI data of Landsat satellite, the correlations of single-band and band combination with the chlorophyll concentration and total suspended solids concentration of OLI data are analyzed by SPSS software. The largest correlation coefficient is selected to construct the ratio linear regression model and the nonlinear least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The two models are used to study the multi-spectral remote sensing inversion of chlorophyll a and total suspended solids in Qinghe Reservoir. The results show that compared with the ratio linear regression model, the LS-SVM model increases the decision coefficient R-2 of the predicted and actual chlorophyll a from 0.635 to 0.966, and the root mean square error decreases from 4.83 to 2.67; the coefficient R-2 of the predicted and actual suspended solids concentration is increased from 0.686 to 0.88, and the average relative error is reduced from 3.52% to 3.16%. The accuracy of multispectral remote sensing inversion of the concentration of chlorophyll a and total suspended solids is significantly improved by LS-SVM model.

TI  - Region search based on hybrid convolutional neural network in optical remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, big data is a new and hot issue. Particularly, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things causes a sharp growth of data. Enormous amounts of networking sensors are continuously collecting and transmitting data to be stored and processed in the cloud, including remote sensing data, environmental data, and geographical data. And region is regarded as the very important object in remote sensing data, which is mainly researched in this article. Region search is a crucial task in remote sensing process, especially for military area and civilian fields. It is difficult to fast search region accurately and achieve generalizability of the regions' features due to the complex background information, as well as the smaller size. Especially, when processing region search in large-scale remote sensing image, detailed information as the feature can be extracted in inner region. To overcome the above difficulty region search task, we propose an accurate and fast region search in optical remote sensing images under cloud computing environment, which is based on hybrid convolutional neural network. The proposed region search method partitioned into four processes. First, fully convolutional network is adopted to produce all the candidate regions that contain the possible object regions. This process avoids exhaustive search for input images. Then, the features of all candidate regions are extracted by a fast region-based convolutional neural network structure. Third, we design a new difficult sample mining method for the training process. At the end, in order to improve the region search precision, we use an iterative bounding box regression algorithm to normalize the detected bounding boxes, in which the regions contain candidate objects. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on optical remote sensing images acquired from Google Earth. Finally, we conduct the experiments, and the obtained results show that the proposed region search method constantly achieves better results regardless of the type of images tested. Compared with traditional region search methods, such as region-based convolutional neural network and newest feature extraction frameworks, our proposed methods show better robustness with complex context semantic information and backgrounds.

T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of the primary production in coastal Large Marine Ecosystems, the complex bio-optical properties in some coastal waters make the estimation of primary productivity using satellite data quite challenging. Here we critically reviewed the accuracy of parametrization of three core variables, i.e. chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-specific photosynthetic rate, and euphotic depth, in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Sea of Japan/East Sea Large Marine Ecosystems. We also compared the annual primary productivity estimates of the three Large Marine Ecosystems by a depth-integrated model with those from two other global assessments, which used different primary productivity models: an absorption-based model, and a time and depth-resolved model. Our assessment suggests that 1) accurate parametrization of the core variables is more important than choosing a primary productivity model, and 2) the previous global Large Marine Ecosystem assessments might have overestimated the annual primary productivity in the Yellow Sea by a factor of 2 or so.

TI  - Construction of Comprehensive Drought Monitoring Model in Jing-Jin-Ji Region Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex hazard that has more adverse effects on agricultural production and economic development. Studying drought monitoring techniques and assessment methods can improve our ability to respond to natural disasters. Numerous drought indices deriving from meteorological or remote sensing data are focused mainly on monitoring single drought response factors such as soil or vegetation, and the ability to reflect comprehensive information on drought was poor. This study constructed a comprehensive drought-monitoring model considering the drought factors including precipitation, vegetation growth status, and soil moisture balance during the drought process for the Jing-Jin-Ji region, China. The comprehensive drought index of remote sensing (CDIR), a drought indicator deduced by the model, was composed of the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the precipitation condition index (PCI). The PCI was obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The VCI and TCI were obtained from a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). In this study, a heavy drought process was accurately explored using the CDIR in the Jing-Jin-Ji region in 2016. Finally, a three-month scales standardized precipitation index (SPI-3), drought affected crop area, and standardized unit yield of wheat were used as validation to evaluate the accuracy of this model. The results showed that the CDIR is closely related to the SPI-3, as well as variations in the drought-affected crop area and standardized unit yield of crop. The correlation coefficient of the CDIR with SPI-3 was between 0.45 and 0.85. The correlation coefficient between the CDIR and drought affected crop was between -0.81 and -0.86. Moreover, the CDIR was positively correlated with the standardized unit yield of crop. It showed that the CDIR index is a decent indicator that can be used for integrated drought monitoring and that it can synthetically reflect meteorological and agricultural drought information.

TI  - An agent-based model for assessing grazing strategies and institutional arrangements in Zeku, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of grassland grazing strategies and institutional arrangements is essential for ensuring the sustainable development of grassland grazing systems. By employing per-pixel grazing information derived from remote sensing data, this paper presents an agent-based model of grassland grazing (ABMGG) for Zeku, China that was designed as a framework for assessing the effects of different combinations of grazing strategies and institutional arrangements on grassland status. By calibrating the parameter values of the ABMGG to the system status values under a policy that has already been implemented, the ABMGG can help us to understand grassland degradation in response to management interventions for each patch of land. In the Zeku implementation, it was found that although different grazing policy scenarios could not significantly improve or decrease the overall grassland leaf area index, a rotational group grazing scenario with a land market tenure system did produce a smaller number of severely degraded grass patches than other policy scenarios (except regional continuous grazing). This provides a new perspective on the consequences of grassland management practices where past research has concentrated more on overall grassland productivity. The ABMGG can extend the ability of policy assessment tools to a high resolution level with pixel-specific real-time remote sensing data, making the assessment results more accurate and representative.

TI  - Influence of Urban Green Space and Facility Accessibility on Exercise and Healthy Diet in Hong Kong
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A cross-sectional study using a convenience sampling method was conducted to understand how green space and accessibility of common public open spaces in compact urban areas affect physical activity and healthy diets of residents. Methods A total of 554 residents completed a structured questionnaire on quality of life, physical activity level and healthy eating practice. Particularly, categories of physical activity and durations were obtained by using the short form Chinese International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-C), then the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)-minutes/week was calculated using the formulae (walking minutes x walking days x 3.3) + (moderate-intensity activity minutes x moderate days x 4.0) + (vigorous-intensity activity minutes x vigorous-intensity days x 8.0). The percentage of green space was calculated based on a spatial buffer with a 500 m radius from participants' geocoded addresses using a SPOT ('Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre' in French) satellite image-derived vegetation dataset. Parks, promenade and sports facilities were examples of open spaces. Results The sampled population who lived with green space averaged 10.11% +/- 7.95% (ranged 1.56-32.90%), with the majority (90%) performing physical activities at medium and high levels. MET-minutes/week was significantly associated (Pearson r = 0.092; p < 0.05) with the green space percentage. Relatively active residents commonly used open spaces within the district for performing exercise, in particular, parks and promenades were mostly used by older residents, while sports facilities by the younger groups at age 25-44 and <25 years. Conclusions Current findings suggested promotion of exercise could be achieved by the design or redesign of built environment to include more parks accessible to the residents with the increase of vegetation.

TI  - Mapping of Coastal Cities Using Optimized Spectral-Spatial Features Based Multi-Scale Superpixel Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high interior heterogeneity of land surface covers in high-resolution image of coastal cities makes classification challenging. To meet this challenge, a Multi-Scale Superpixels-based Classification method using Optimized Spectral-Spatial features, denoted as OSS-MSSC, is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, the multi-scale superpixels are firstly generated to capture the local spatial structures of the ground objects with various sizes. Then, the normalized difference vegetation index and extend multi-attribute profiles are introduced to extract the spectral-spatial features from the multi-spectral bands of the image. To reduce the redundancy of the spectral-spatial features, the crossover-based search algorithm is utilized for feature optimization. The pre-classification results at each single scale are, therefore, obtained based on the optimized spectral-spatial features and random forest classifier. Finally, the ultimate classification is generated via the majority voting of those pre-classification results in each scale. Experimental results on the Gaofen-2 image of Qingdao and WorldView-2 image of Hong Kong, China confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments verify that the OSS-MSSC method not only works effectively on the homogeneous regions, but also is able to preserve the small local spatial structures in the high-resolution remote sensing images of coastal cities.

TI  - Alternate Mapping Correlated k-Distribution Method for Infrared Radiative Transfer Forward Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The alternate mapping correlated k-distribution (AMCKD) method is studied and applied to satellite simulations. To evaluate the accuracy of AMCKD, the simulated brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere are compared with line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) or the observed data which are from Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board the Himawari-8, as well as Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) on board the Fengyun-3D. The result of AMCKD is also compared with the algorithm of Radiative Transfer for the Television Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV). Under the standard atmospheric profiles, the absolute errors of AMCKD in all longwave channels of AHI and MERSI are bounded by 0.44K compared to the benchmark results of LBLRTM, which are more accurate than those of RTTOV. In the most cases, the error of AMCKD is smaller than the NEDT at ST, while the error of RTTOV is larger than the instrument noise equivalent temperature (NEDT) at scene temperature (ST). Under real atmospheric profile conditions, the errors of AMCKD increase, because the input data from ERA-Interim reanalysis dataause bias in the satellite remote sensing results. In the most considered cases, the accuracy of AMCKD is higher than RTTOV, while the efficiency of AMCKD is slightly slower than RTTOV.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Pattern Analysis of China's Cities Based on High-Resolution Imagery from 2000 to 2015
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanization level in China has increased rapidly since beginning of the 21st century, and the monitoring and analysis of urban expansion has become a popular topic in geoscience applications. However, problems, such as inconsistent concepts and extraction standards, low precision, and poor comparability, existing in urban monitoring may lead to wrong conclusions. This study selects 337 cities at the prefecture level and above in China as research subjects and uses high-resolution images and geographic information data in a semi-automatic extraction method to identify urban areas in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. City size distribution patterns, urban expansion regional characteristics, and expansion types are analyzed. Results show that Chinese cities maintained a high-speed growth trend from 2000 to 2015, with the total area increasing by 115.79%. The overall scale of a city continues to expand, and the system becomes increasingly complex. The urban system is more balanced than the ideal Zipf distribution, but it also exhibited different characteristics in 2005. Urban areas are mostly concentrated in the eastern and central regions, and the difference between the east and the west is considerable. However, cities in the western region continuously expand. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou are the four largest cities in China. Approximately 73.30% of the cities are expanding in an extended manner; the urban form tends to be scattered, and land use efficiency is low. The new urban areas mainly come from cultivated land and ecological land.

TI  - Spatial-temporal changes of fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in Qinling-Daba Mountains from 2006 to 2015
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), the part of photosynthetically active radiation that is absorbed by vegetation, is one of the important parameters in terrestrial ecosystem simulating models. The purpose of this study was to clarify spatial-temporal changes of the FPAR in Qinling-Daba Mountains where is on the important north-south climate transitional zone in China. Based on the MODIS remote sensing data and climate datasets from 2006 to 2015, a linear regression analysis was used to examine spatial-temporal changes of FPAR at pixel scale in Qinling-Daba Mountains. A correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between vegetation FPAR and climate factors. The results showed that there was spatial difference in FPAR distribution in the Qinling-Daba Mountains, with high FPAR values in the center and southeast and lower values in the northwest and northeast of study area. They decreased with altitude, with obvious vertical zonality along mountains. From 2006 to 2015, the FPAR increased in the central region and decreased in the surrounding area. The areas with significantly increased FPAR values were mainly distributed in the basins of Jialing River and Danjiang River and the downstream of Hanjiang River. The FPAR values slightly decreased in parts of the Gannan Plateau and the Western Sichuan Plateau. During last decade, the FPAR of vegetation, on the whole, appeared a significantly increasing trend with a rate of 4.8% . 10 a(-1)(P<0.05) and the most outstanding vegetation was crop (P < 0.05). Among the four seasons, the FPAR significantly increased in winter (P<0.05). Annually, the correlation between vegetation FPAR and climate factors showed that vegetation FPAR was more correlated with mean annual temperature than that with mean annual precipitation on all vegetation types. However, the correlations differed among vegetation types. Coniferous forest and broad-leaved forest FPAR had higher correlations with mean annual temperature than other types, while grasslands and croplands were influenced much more by mean annual precipitation than by mean annual temperature.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition and Weighted Least Squares Filter
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the spatial resolution of multispectral images while maintaining spectral information to a greater extent, this paper proposes a remote sensing image fusion based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition and weighted least squares filter. On one hand, multivariate empirical mode decomposition solves the problem of spatial information distortion caused by the subimage frequency mismatch between the intensity component of the multispectral image and the panchromatic image in traditional remote sensing image fusion methods based on univariate empirical mode decomposition. On the other hand, remote sensing image fusion based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition usually suffer from serious spectral distortions due to the detail information contains low frequency components. To overcome these defects, the weighted least squares filter can estimate low frequency information of source image accurately and obtain the high-frequency information subsequently. Combine the advantages of both, the fused image obtained by different fusion rules has better spatial detail and spectral information retention. In this paper, different satellite data are selected for simulation experiments, and compared with other methods such as based multivariate empirical mode decomposition and atrous wavelet transform and based on weighted least squares filter, the results of experiment achieve good performance in both spectral and spatial qualities.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, and TDX DEMs for Hispaniola and implications for mapping vulnerability to coastal flooding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from remote sensing data provide a valuable and consistent data source for mapping coastal flooding at local and global scales. Mapping of flood risk requires quantification of the error in DEM elevations and its effect on delineation of flood zones. The ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X (TDX) DEMs for the island of Hispaniola were examined by comparing them with GPS and LiDAR measurements. The comparisons were based on a series of error measures including root mean square error (RMSE) and absolute error at 90% quantile (LE90). When compared with > 2000 GPS measurements with elevations below 7 m, RMSE and LE90 values for ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, TDX DEMs were 8.44 and 14.29, 3.82 and 5.85, 2.08 and 3.64, and 1.74 and 3.20 m, respectively. In contrast, RMSE and LE90 values for the same DEMs were 4.24 and 6.70, 4.81 and 7.16, 4.91 and 6.82, and 2.27 and 3.66 m when compared to DEMs from 150 km 2 LiDAR data, which included elevations as high as 20 m. The expanded area with LiDAR coverage included additional types of land surface, resulting in differences in error measures. Comparison of RMSEs indicated that the filtering of TDX DEMs using four methods improved the accuracy of the estimates of ground elevation by 20-43%. DTMs generated by interpolating the ground pixels from a progressive morphological filter, using an empirical Bayesian kriging method, produced an RMSE of 1.06 m and LE90 of 1.73 m when compared to GPS measurements, and an RMSE of 1.30 m and LE90 of 2.02 m when compared to LiDAR data. Differences in inundation areas based on TDX and LiDAR DTMs were between - 13% and - 4% for scenarios of 3, 5, 10, and 15 m water level rise, a much narrower range than inundation differences between ASTER, SRTM, ALOS and LiDAR. The TDX DEMs deliver high resolution global DEMs with unprecedented elevation accuracy, hence, it is recommended for mapping coastal flood risk zones on a global scale, as well as at a local scale in developing countries where data with higher accuracy are unavailable.

TI  - Assimilation of MWHS and MWTS radiance data from the FY-3A satellite with the POD-3DEnVar method for forecasting heavy rainfall
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An ensemble three-dimensional variational assimilation method based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (referred to as POD-3DEnVar) can not only provide flow-dependent covariances through the evolving ensemble of short-range forecasts, but also obtain directly the analysis field without an iterative process. Using the POD-3DEnVar method, a regional hybrid variational ensemble data assimilation system (referred to as POD-HVEDAS) is constructed with the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) as the observation operator. Observations from Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) and Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) onboard Fengyun3A are simultaneously assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by the POD-HVEDAS. Bias correction and quality control schemes for MWHS and MWTS microwave radiance are applied in the system. Three experiments (Con, Hybrid-DA, and POD-DA) are designed to investigate the assimilation ability of the POD-HVEDAS for heavy rainfall over the Yangtze River. The assimilation effects of POD-3DEnVar and WRFDA-Hybrid assimilation method are compared. The results show that the POD-HVEDAS can assimilate MWHS and MWTS microwave radiance effectively, and give a better precipitation forecast than that of the WRFDA-Hybrid method. And it is found that the assimilation increments of both POD-3DEnVar and WRFDA-Hybrid methods all show flow dependent characteristic. However, the improvements in the background wind, temperature and humidity fields by the POD-DA experiment are more obvious than those of the Hybrid-DA experiment, which play key roles in improving the accuracy of precipitation forecast. These promising results suggest initiulizing limited-area models with POD-3DEnVar method that assimilate microwave radiances is beneficial. In the future, POD-3DEnVar method will be used to study multiple cases to fully assess the robustness of POD-HVEDAS.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Rain Retrievals from <i>FY-3B</i> MWRI Brightness Temperatures Using the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the tropical cyclone rainfall retrieval using FY-3B Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) brightness temperatures (Tbs). The GPROF, a fully parametric approach based on the Bayesian scheme, is adapted for use by the MWRI sensor. The MWRI GPROF algorithm is an ocean-only scheme used to estimate rain rates and hydrometeor vertical profiles. An a priori database is constructed from MWRI simulated Tbs, the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) and Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) combined data, and ancillary data resulting in about 100 000 rainfall profiles. The performance of MWRI retrievals is consistent with DPR observations, even though MWRI retrievals slightly overestimate low rain rates and underestimate high rain rates. The total bias of MWRI retrievals is less than 13% of the mean rain rate of DPR precipitation. Statistical comparisons over GMI GPROF, GMI Hurricane GPROF (HGPROF), and MWRI GPROF retrievals show MWRI GPROF retrievals are consistent in terms of spatial distribution and rain estimates for TCs compared with the other two estimates. In terms of the global precipitation, the mean rain rates at different distances from best track locations for five TC categories are used to identify substantial differences between mean MWRI and GMI GPROF retrievals. After correcting the biases between MWRI and GMI retrievals, the performance of MWRI retrievals shows slight overestimate for light rain rates while underestimating rain rates near the eyewall for category 4 and 5 only.

TI  - Ship Detection From PolSAR Imagery Using the Complete Polarimetric Covariance Difference Matrix
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we proposed a complete polarimetric covariance difference matrix [CP]-based algorithm for ship detection in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery. To calculate [CP], we first developed a scheme to reflect the polarimetric scattering differences between ship pixel (SP) and its neighboring pixels (ISPs) and, then, dividedly accumulated the amplitude and phase differences between SP and ISPs. Compared to the polarimetric covariance difference matrix [P] developed in our earlier work, [CP] effectively overcomes the drawback of the lack of the phase information in [P]. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we applied the [CP]-based ship detection algorithm to four PolSAR data sets, including one UAVSAR L-band data set with 21 ships, two AIRSAR L-band data sets with 11 and 22 ships, respectively, and one Radarsat-2 C-band data set with 8 ships. Experimental results show that: 1) the proposed algorithm can effectively detect ships with high target-to-clutter ratio (TCR) values and 2) [CP] has a better performance than the traditional polarimetric covariance matrix [C] and [P] on ship detection. To be more specific, the average TCR value of the proposed algorithm (23.86 dB) is 6.07 and 7.47 dB higher than PNFC (i.e., the geometrical perturbation-polarimetric notch filter) and RSC (i.e., the reflection symmetry method), respectively.

TI  - Fine Land-Cover Mapping in China Using Landsat Datacube and an Operational SPECLib-Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine resolution land cover information is a vital foundation of Earth science. In this paper, a novel SPECLib-based operational method is presented for the classification of multi-temporal Landsat imagery using reflectance spectra from the spatial-temporal spectral library (SPECLib) for 30 m land-cover mapping for the whole of China. Firstly, using the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Global Land Cover (CCI_LC) product and the MODIS Version 6 Nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function adjusted reflectance (NBAR) product (MCD43A4), a global SPECLib with a spatial resolution of 158.85 km (equivalent to 1.43 degrees at the equator) and a temporal resolution of eight days was developed in the sinusoidal projection. Then, the Landsat datacube covering the whole of China was developed using all available observations of Landsat OLI imagery in 2015. Thirdly, the multi-temporal random forest method based on SPECLib was presented to produce an annual land-cover map with 22 land-cover types using the Landsat datacube. Finally, the annual China land-cover map was validated by two different validation systems using approximately 11,000 interpretation points. The mapping results achieved the overall accuracy of 71.3% and 80.7% and the kappa coefficient of 0.664 and 0.757 for the level-2 validation system (19 land-cover types) and the level-1 validation system (nine land-cover types), respectively. Therefore, the case study in China indicates that the proposed SPECLib method is an operational and accurate method for regional/global fine land-cover mapping at a spatial resolution of 30 m.

TI  - Evaluation of the accuracy of phenology extraction methods for natural vegetation based on remote sensing
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing vegetation phenology is the key step for the accuracy evaluation of extraction methods using remote sensing. There is no consensus about the advantages and disadvantages of different methods. It is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of various extraction methods. In this study, 18 combining methods for vegetation phenology remote sensing extraction and observation data from 23 ground phenology stations were used to evaluate the accuracy in extracting three key vegetation phenophases: Start Of the growing Season (SOS), End Of the growing Season (EOS) and Length Of the growing Season (LOS). The results showed that SG-Sa 0.1 (the combining Savitzky-Golay filter and Seasonal Amplitude method with a threshold of 0.1) had the optimal recognition effect. For single phenophase, the optimal combination for SOS, EOS and LOS was SG-Sa 0.1, SG-Sa 0.3 and DL-Sa 0.1, respectively. The minimum deviation between the optimal extraction results and the ground-based observation phenology data were more than five days, indicating the accuracy of extraction phenology using remote sensing data with 8-day temporal resolution. The deviation highlighted the importance of choosing a suitable extraction combination. In addition, remote sensing phenology and ground-based phenology cannot completely match. Therefore, the multiple evaluation indices used in this study, especially the deviation consistency can effectively select the optimal vegetation phenology remote sensing extraction combination for various phenophases.

TI  - Time-Series InSAR Monitoring of Permafrost Freeze-Thaw Seasonal Displacement over Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is widely distributed in the Tibetan Plateau. Seasonal freeze-thaw cycles of permafrost result in upward and downward surface displacement. Multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) observations provide an effective method for monitoring permafrost displacement under difficult terrain and climatic conditions. In this study, a seasonal sinusoidal model-based new small baselines subset (NSBAS) chain was adopted to obtain a deformation time series. An experimental study was carried out using 33 scenes of Sentinel-1 data (S-1) from 28 November 2017 to 29 December 2018 with frequent revisit (12 days) observations. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the surface displacements variation combined with different types of surface land cover, elevation and surface temperature factors were analyzed. The results revealed that the seasonal changes observed in the time series of ground movements, induced by freeze-thaw cycles were observed on flat surfaces of sedimentary basins and mountainous areas with gentle slopes. The estimated seasonal oscillations ranged from 2 mm to 30 mm, which were smaller in Alpine deserts than in Alpine meadows. In particular, there were significant systematic differences in seasonal surface deformation between areas near mountains and sedimentary basins. It was also found that the time series of deformation was consistent with the variation of surface temperature. Based on soil moisture active/passive (SMAP) L4 surface and root zone soil moisture data, the deformation analysis influenced by soil moisture factors was also carried out. The comprehensive analysis of deformation results and auxiliary data (elevation, soil moisture and surface temperature et al.) provides important insights for the monitoring of the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles in the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Mapping stocks of soil total nitrogen using remote sensing data: A comparison of random forest models with different predictors
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of soil total nitrogen (STN) is important for quantifying the spatial distribution of soil N (Nitrogen) stocks, determining the amount absorbed by crops and avoiding yield losses and environmental pollution. The objective of this research was to determine the spatial distribution of STN using a remote sensing approach and to investigate the importance of different predictors under two conditions: the bare soil condition and the vegetated condition. We also investigated whether the Sentinel-2A red-edge bands and relative spectral indices were suitable for STN estimation. Soil data were collected from the topsoil (0-20 cm) at 104 sampling sites on 06/15/2016 from farmland in a black soil region in Northeast China. Two Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) remote sensing images were acquired on 05/26/2016 and 08/03/2016 to represent the two conditions. Environmental variables included the terrain attributes, temperature and precipitation. Then, 21 predictors, including the original bands (O), normal spectral indices (S), red-edge indices (R) and environmental variables (E), were employed to estimate the spatial distribution of the STN content using a random forest (RF) model. Finally, different predictors were combined to construct RF models, and the prediction model with the best performance was selected to determine the spatial pattern of the STN content. The results showed that the predictors had different levels of importance under the two conditions. However, most environmental variables and normal spectral indices always play a significant role in the estimation of STN. The model with the combination of the original bands, normal spectral indices, red-edge indices and environmental variables (O + S + E + R) under the bare soil condition had the best prediction performance, and the combination of the original bands, normal spectral indices and red-edge indices (O + S + R) model had a performance similar to the O + S + E + R model. Therefore, the selection of suitable predictors is necessary to predict STN. The spatial pattern of STN was related to the crop type and elevation of the study area. The results of this study suggested that the proposed RF-based remote sensing method was able to accurately capture the variation in STN and that the performance of the prediction model can be improved by providing enough types of suitable predictors.

TI  - Evaluation of Clouds in Version 1 of the E3SM Atmosphere Model With Satellite Simulators
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study systematically evaluates clouds simulated by the Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1) against satellite cloud observations. Both low- (1 degrees) and high- (0.25 degrees) resolution EAMv1 configurations generally underestimate clouds in low latitudes and midlatitudes and overestimate clouds in the Arctic, although the error is smaller in the high-resolution model. The underestimate of clouds is due to the underestimate of optically thin to intermediate clouds, as EAMv1 generally overestimates optically intermediate to thick clouds. Other model errors include the largely underpredicted marine stratocumulus along the coasts and high clouds over the tropical deep convection regions. The underestimate of thin clouds results in too much longwave radiation being emitted to space and too little shortwave radiation being reflected back to space, while the overestimate of optically intermediate and thick clouds leads to too little longwave radiation being emitted to space and too much shortwave radiation being reflected back to space. EAMv1 shows better skill in reproducing the observed distribution of clouds and their properties and has smaller radiatively relevant errors in the distribution of clouds than most of the CFMIP1 and CFMIP2 models. It produces more supercooled liquid cloud fraction than CAM5 and most CMIP5 models primarily due to a new ice nucleation scheme and secondarily due to a reduction of the ice deposition growth rate.

TI  - A novel approach for extraction of Gaoshanhe-Group outcrops using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in the heavily loess-covered Baoji District, Western China
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the applicability of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for extraction of Gaoshanhe-Group outcrops in a heavily loess-covered area in the northern Baoji district of China, which is always a crucial but challenging issue in geological remote-sensing mapping. An integrated approach was employed to process the remote-sensing data: first, the interpretation target area of interest was clipped using certain slope and elevation difference thresholds (topographical analysis); second, band ratio (B4/B2) and fractal summation algorithms were conducted in succession to extract the bedrock-induced anomalies; third, spatial clumping and hot-spot analysis were performed in order to eliminate residual false anomalies; and finally, we introduced high-resolution Worldview 2 data for visual interpretation and further spectral analysis. The findings show that the rocky outcrops were somewhat spectrally indistinguishable, and they were identified mainly due to their generally moderate degree of spatial clustering. Thirteen anomalous pixels were extracted from nearly 200,000 pixels covering the study area, and our field reconnaissance verified the results. This research constitutes the first useful case study on the applicability of Landsat data-derived lithology interpretation in China's loess plateau region.

TI  - Absolute Radiometric Calibration Method Based on Surface Hyperspectral BRDF Model
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - An absolute radiometric calibration method based on the surface hyperspectral Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model is proposed, which the efficiency and frequency of on-orbit absolute radiometric calibration of remote sensors are improved by getting rid of the dependence on synchronous observation of satellite overpass time. In-flight high-frequency absolute radiometric calibration verification and application was carried out with Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8 using this method. The surface directional reflectance of the Dunhuang test site was measured by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) measurement system, and the hyperspectral BRDF model parameters of the Dunhuang site were inversed based on the semi-empirical kernel-driven model. Comparing the model calculated data with the measured data, the present model is proven to provide a better fit to measured data. The surface hyperspectral reflectance data of satellite observation direction calculated directly by surface BRDF model is used to replace the synchronous measurement data of satellite transit time. The high-frequency absolute radiometric calibration of Landsat-8 OLI is realized by using the reflectance basis method combined with MODIS official atmospheric data products. The relative deviation between the Landsat-8/OLI observed apparent radiance and the model calculated apparent radiance is less than 5% and the standard deviation is less than 2% in the first band to the sixth band. The result shows that the absolute radiometric calibration method based on the UAV BRDF model are in high consistency and stability with the satellite observations.

TI  - An Assessment of Global Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Products for Regional Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) are the key factors determining water availability for water resource management activities in river basins. While global P and ET data products have become more accessible, their performances in river basins with a diverse climate and landscape remain less discussed. This paper evaluated the performance of four representative global P (CHIRPSP, GLDAS(P), TRMMP and Persiann(P)) and ET products (CSIROET, GLDAS(ET), MODET and TerraClimate(ET)) against the reference data provided by the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia. The disparities among the data products both in the period from 2001 to 2016 and across the 22 catchments of MDB were related to a set of catchment characteristics (climate, terrain, etc.) to explore any possible contributors. The results show that the four global P products presented overall high consistency with AWAP(P) across the MDB catchments except in southeastern catchments with abundant rainfalls and large terrain variations. The Penman-Monteith algorithm based MODET underestimated ET in the MDB, especially in the arid, less vegetation covered catchments. While the CSIROET, which also estimated with the Penman-Monteith method, presented overall better estimations, which can be attributed to the better parameterization of the landscape in the simulation processes. The hydrological model based TerraClimate(ET) showed overall good consistency with AWAP(ET) except in the arid catchments, which might be attributed to the simplified water balance model it applied, however it did not adequately reflect the intensive ground water uses in these catchments. The findings indicated that basin and catchment characteristics had impacts on the accuracy of global products and therefore provided important implications for choosing appropriate product and/or conducting field calibrations for potential users in large basins characterized with diverse rainfall, terrain variations and land use patterns.

TI  - Sustained growth of high mountain lakes in the headwaters of the Syr Darya River, Central Asia
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous rise in summer temperature and consequent glacier wastage have led to a significant loss of frozen water resources in the mountain headwaters of the major river systems in Central Asia. High mountain lakes in the headwaters of the Syr Darya River serve as sensitive indicators of climate change in the region. In this study, lakes in the headwaters of the Syr Darya River are examined using a Landsat image series. A total of 959 lakes covering a total area of 328.39 +/- 5.51 km(2) were identified in 2015, of which 91% were distributed in the larger Naryn River basin, and the remaining lakes were in the smaller Kara Darya River basin. During the period of the 1990s to 2015, a clear expansion trend in both lake area (+ 6.64 km(2)) and number of lakes (+ 205) was observed. Glacial lakes contributed 69% of the increase in the number of lakes. Among the four lake types, proglacial lakes showed the fastest area expansion with an average relative growth rate of 94% from the 1990s to 2015, 5-8 times that of the other three lake types: nonglacial lakes, unconnected-fed lakes and unconnected-nonfed lakes. Lake Petrov was the fastest growing glacial lake (+ 0.05 km(2) yr(-1)) during the past century and will continue to expand as its supply glacier continues to retreat. The continuous expansion and potential outburst risk of the Lake Petrov poses a serious threat to downstream toxic tailing ponds of the Kumtor Gold Mine. Lake Song Kol, the largest natural lake in this region, presented a steady status during 1972-2017. The warming climate-caused acceleration of glacial melt is thought to be the primary reason for the lake enlargements in this region. The lake inventory prepared here is valuable baseline dataset for the evaluation of water resources in the Syr Darya River drainage basin and for the potential risk and hazard assessments of glacial lake outburst floods.

TI  - Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis and Modeling of the Topside Ionospheric and Plasmaspheric TECs
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The topside total electron contents (TECs) observed by the MetOp-A (above 832 km) and TerraSAR-X (above 520 km) satellites for multiple local times during 2008-2018 have been used to develop global topside ionospheric and plasmaspheric TEC models, based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Gridded TEC maps are first obtained from the original quiet time TECs, and then, they are decomposed into EOF basis modes and associated amplitude coefficients. The EOF analysis well captures the latitudinal, longitudinal, and seasonal variations of the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere, and the associated dependence on solar EUV forcing. The first five EOFs, which can account for more than 98.8% of the total variance, are applied in model construction. The comparison with two empirical models indicates that the EOF TEC models can reproduce the observations well, including TEC magnitudes and longitudinal variations. Moreover, the annual anomaly is obviously seen in the topside TECs. The global averaged TECs are greatest in December and smallest in June. With increasing solar EUV forcing, the global averaged TECs always increase, but the winter hemisphere TECs do not change much and even decrease, especially at night and in the Southern Hemisphere. The overall increasing rate with solar EUV forcing is larger under higher solar activity conditions. The direct plasma diffusion through ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling may not be able to explain some of the features seen in the topside TECs.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Surface Energy Balance System Model: A Case Study in the Nagqu River Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Calculation of actual evapotranspiration (AET) is of vital importance for the study of climate change, ecosystem carbon cycling, flooding, drought, and agricultural water demand. It is one of the more important components in the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance (SEB). How to accurately estimate AET especially for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with complex terrain remains a challenge for the scientific community. Using multi-sensor remote sensing data, meteorological forcing data, and field observations, AET was derived for the Nagqu river basin of the Northern Tibetan Plateau from a surface energy balance system (SEBS) model. As inputs for SEBS, improved algorithms and datasets for land surface albedo and a cloud-free normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were also constructed. The model-estimated AET were compared with results by using the combinatory method (CM). The validation indicated that the model estimates of AET agreed well with the correlation coefficient, the root mean square error, and the mean percentage error of 0.972, 0.052 mm/h, and -10.4%, respectively. The comparison between SEBS estimation and CM results also proved the feasibility of parameterization schemes for land surface parameters and AET.

TI  - Cropland Product Fusion Method Based on the Overall Consistency Difference: A Case Study of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is inconsistency between the existing remote sensing cropland products, whose accuracy of estimated cropland area and spatial positioning needs to be improved. The existing generalized methods of generating synergy cropland products for improving the accuracy of existing products do not consider the overall consistency difference between the different products in each grid cell in the fusion process. To reduce the impact of the abnormal estimated cropland areas of the individual cropland products on the results, this paper proposes a method of generating a synergy cropland product by fusing the multiple existing cropland products, based on the overall consistency difference. In the proposed method, the process of fusing the multiple existing cropland products is based on the overall consistency difference of the estimated cropland area of all the cropland products in each grid cell. The synergy cropland product is then generated after determining the best combination level with the cropland statistics. In this study, we set 2010 as the base year, and used the proposed method to conduct experiments with four remote sensing cropland products: GlobCover 2009, MODIS Cropland, MCD12Q1, and FROM-GLC within China, and national cropland statistics. The results show that the synergy cropland product generated by the proposed method has a higher accuracy of cropland area estimation and spatial positioning than the results obtained by the generalized model, as well as the original products.

TI  - Contrasting Post-Fire Dynamics between Africa and South America based on MODIS Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important driver of land cover change throughout the world, affecting processes such as deforestation, forest recovery and vegetation transition. Little attention has been given to the role of fire in shaping the temporal and spatial land cover changes among continents. This study has integrated two MODIS products (MCD64A1: Burned area and MCD12Q1: Land cover) over Africa and South America from 2001-2013 to explore the vegetation dynamics after fires. The results indicated that while Africa suffered from repeated fires, more than 50% of the total burned area in South America experienced only one fire. The vegetation dynamics of the high-density vegetated regions in the 10 years after a fire showed that the forest losses in the first year after a fire in Africa were slightly larger than that in South America (Africa: 17.2% vs. South America: 14.5% in the Northern Hemisphere). The continental comparison suggested that early successional forests in Africa recovered relatively fast (northern part: 10.2 years; southern part: 12.8 years) than in South America, which recovered (18.4 years) slowly in Northern Hemisphere or ever with no recovery in the Southern Hemisphere. No clear information of the recoveries of other vegetation types (i.e., shrub, grass and crop) in Africa or South America could be identified from the satellite data. In addition, we also analyzed the changes of high-density vegetation in non-burned regions in both continents. These findings highlighted the impact of the fire regime on the vegetation changes in Africa, which appear resilient to fire, but there were complex systems in South America related to fires.

AB  - River water discharge (WD) is an essential component when monitoring a regional hydrological cycle. It is expressed in terms of surface runoff (R) when a unit of river basin surface area is considered. To compensate for the decreasing number of hydrological stations, remotely-sensed WD estimation has been widely promoted over the past two decades, due to its global coverage. Previously, remotely-sensed WD was reconstructed either by correlating nearby remotely-sensed surface responses (e.g., indices and hydraulic variables) with ground-based WD observations or by applying water balance formulations, in terms of R, over an entire river basin, assisted by hydrological modeling data. In contrast, the feasibility of using remotely-sensed hydrological variables (RSHVs) and their standardized forms together with water balance representations (WBR) obtained from the river upstream to reconstruct estuarine R for an entire basin, has been rarely investigated. Therefore, our study aimed to construct a correlative relationship between the estuarine observed R and the upstream, spatially averaged RSHVs, together with their standardized forms and WBR, for the Mekong River basin, using estuarine R reconstructions, at a monthly temporal scale. We found that the reconstructed R derived from the upstream, spatially averaged RSHVs agreed well with the observed R, which was also comparable to that calculated using traditional remote sensing data (RSD). Better performance was achieved using spatially averaged, standardized RSHVs, which should be potentially attributable to spatially integrated information and the ability to partly bypass systematic biases by both human (e.g., dam operation) and environmental effects in a standardized form. Comparison of the R reconstructed using the upstream, spatially averaged, standardized RSHVs with that reconstructed from the traditional RSD, against the observed R, revealed a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) above 0.91 and below 0.81, a root-mean-squares error (RMSE) below 6.1 mm and above 8.5 mm, and a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) above 0.823 and below 0.657, respectively. In terms of the standardized water balance representation (SWBR), the reconstructed R yielded the best performance, with a PCC above 0.92, an RMSE below 5.9 mm, and an NSE above 0.838. External assessment demonstrated similar results. This finding indicated that the standardized RSHVs, in particular its water balance representations, could lead to further improvement in estuarine R reconstructions for river basins affected by various systematic influences. Comparison between hydrological stations at the Mekong River Delta entrance and near the estuary mouth revealed tidally-induced backwater effects on the estimated R, with an RMSE difference of 4-5 mm (equivalent to 9-11% relative error).

TI  - Quantification of water and exposed lined areas of coal-bed methane water ponds using regular true-color images by developing a novel uniformness based multi-component algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming supplies about 40 percent of coal in the United States. In recent decades, coalbed methane (CBM) extracted from coal beds has become an important source of energy in the United States and other countries. CBM water is the produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction. The use of CBM water from the Powder River Basin for irrigation is limited by its relatively high sodium adsorption ratio so the water has to be maintained in lined retention ponds. The liners can be detached from the pond bed, breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events, and can wear out with time. Water level changes due to constant and dynamic evaporation and precipitation of rainfalls and snowfalls and refilling by gas companies. The objectives of this study are: (1) to develop and validate a novel uniformness based multi-component algorithm to quantify the areas of water and exposed (not submerged in water) liners of the retention ponds from regular red-green-blue (RGB) images, and (2) to quantify the areas of water and liners of the CBM retention ponds in the Powder River Basin using high-resolution true-color images such as free Google Earth imagery. The multi-component algorithm is composed of a sequence of processes: georeferencing, denoising, RGB to L* a* b* color space transformation, K-mean clustering analysis, intelligent identification of connected component in each class, extraction of water body based on maximum uniformness, extraction of exposed lined zones based on uniformness or least root-mean-square value of RGB, and eventually calculation of water area and exposed line area. Application of the multi-component algorithm to the CBM retention ponds in the Powder River Basin using high-resolution true-color images shows that the algorithm can extract accurately water area and the exposed area of liners from these images of high spatial resolution (0.20 similar to 0.34 m), providing a useful tool to use regular RGB images as a resource for monitoring reservoirs, lakes or artificial small ponds.

TI  - Land subsidence (2004-2013) in Changzhou in Central Yangtze River delta revealed by MT-InSAR
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence in Changzhou City in the central Yangtze River Delta of China poses a serious threat to the safety of the environment and infrastructures. Excessive groundwater withdrawal, rapid urbanisation and industrial activities contribute to land subsidence in this area. In this study, we used the multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of land subsidence in Changzhou. Twenty-five ENVISAT ASAR and 29 TerraSAR-X images acquired from 2004 to 2013 were used to determine the rate and temporal evolution of land subsidence. We used the ERA-Interim model instead of spatiotemporal filtering in traditional MT-InSAR to mitigate the atmospheric phase screen. The InSAR-derived results were evaluated by comparing data from three time series methods and different bands (C and X bands), and accuracy was validated through levelling surveys and GPS measurements. For three regions, a distinct subsidence pattern was observed in major industrial areas with a maximum subsidence rate of up to -39.9mm/year. We also characterised the spatiotemporal variations of land subsidence in major industrial areas in Changzhou. The deformation of large-scale man-made linear features, namely high-speed railways, highway networks and a bridge, was analysed. The spatiotemporal characteristics and possible reasons for the observed subsidence were discussed to provide a reference for future urban development planning in Changzhou.

TI  - An Improved Multi-temporal and Multi-feature Tea Plantation Identification Method Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As tea is an important economic crop in many regions, efficient and accurate methods for remotely identifying tea plantations are essential for the implementation of sustainable tea practices and for periodic monitoring. In this study, we developed and tested a method for tea plantation identification based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images and a multi-feature Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We used phenological patterns of tea cultivation in China's Shihe District (such as the multiple annual growing, harvest, and pruning stages) to extracted multi-temporal Sentinel-2 MSI bands, their derived first spectral derivative, NDVI and textures, and topographic features. We then assessed feature importance using RF analysis; the optimal combination of features was used as the input variable for RF classification to extract tea plantations in the study area. A comparison of our results with those achieved using the Support Vector Machine method and statistical data from local government departments showed that our method had a higher producer's accuracy (96.57%) and user's accuracy (96.02%). These results demonstrate that: (1) multi-temporal and multi-feature classification can improve the accuracy of tea plantation recognition, (2) RF classification feature importance analysis can effectively reduce feature dimensions and improve classification efficiency, and (3) the combination of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images and the RF algorithm improves our ability to identify and monitor tea plantations.

TI  - Roughness and vegetation change detection: A pre-processing for soil moisture retrieval from multi-temporal SAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal analysis has been widely acknowledged as a promising method to derive soil moisture from radar backscatter observations. The method assumes that only soil moisture varies in the period of interest, while all other parameters such as vegetation water content and soil surface roughness are sufficiently time invariant. However, this assumption is not easy to satisfy in agricultural areas where cultivation practices such as ploughing and irrigation are irregularly conducted between radar acquisitions. The paper has proposed an unsupervised change detection method to serve as a pre-processing procedure for multi-temporal retrieval. Briefly, the temporal ratio of HV and the temporal difference of HV/VV and VV polarizations were selected as the optimal feature space, using a genetic algorithm based feature selection algorithm and an extensive synthetic data set. The change map is determined from a two-step procedure with the first step producing multiple over-detected change maps for the period of interest using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method. The second step merges the multiple change maps to remove the false alarms with a principle similar to the ensemble machine learning. Evaluation on a synthetic data set demonstrated that the proposed method can largely remove the error in multi-temporal soil moisture retrieval that is caused by abrupt roughness and vegetation changes. Evaluation on real radar data sets, including airborne L-band radar, RAD-ARSAT-2 at C-band and COSMO SkyMed at X-band, demonstrated an accurate identification ( > 0.9) while yielding a low false-alarm rate ( < 0.1). These results suggest that the method may be used as a pre-processing stage of global soil moisture retrieval from radar satellite missions with a high revisit frequency, such as Sentinel-1 and SAOCOM-1.

TI  - Dog ownership, the natural outdoor environment and health: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Dog owners walking their dog in natural outdoor environments (NOE) may benefit from the physical activity facilitated by dog walking and from time spent in nature. However, it is unclear whether dog owners receive additional health benefits associated with having access to NOE above the physical activity benefit of walking with their dog. We investigated associations between dog ownership, walking, time spent in NOE and health and whether these associations differed among those with good and poor access to NOE and those living in green and less green areas.Design Cross-sectional study.Setting The Positive Health Effects of the Natural Outdoor Environment in Typical Populations in Different Regions in Europe project.Participants n=3586 adults from Barcelona (Spain), Doetinchem (the Netherlands), Kaunas (Lithuania) and Stoke-on-Trent (UK).Data collection and analysis We calculated access to NOE with land maps and residential surrounding greenness with satellite data. Leisure time walking, time spent in NOE and general and mental health status were measured using validated questionnaires. Associations were estimated using multilevel analysis with a random intercept defined at the neighbourhood level.Results Dog ownership was associated with higher rates of leisure time walking and time spending in NOE (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.54 and 2.37, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.79, respectively). These associations were stronger in those living within 300 m of a NOE and in greener areas. No consistent associations were found between dog ownership and perceived general or mental health status.Conclusions Compared with non-dog owners, dog owners walked more and spent more time in NOE, especially those living within 300 m of a NOE and in greener areas. The health implications of these relationships should be further investigated. In a largely physically inactive society, dog walking in NOE may be a simple way of promoting physical activity and health.

TI  - Analysis of L-Band SAR Data for Soil Moisture Estimations over Agricultural Areas in the Tropics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to analyze the potential use of L-band radar data for the estimation of soil moisture over tropical agricultural areas under dense vegetation cover conditions. Ten radar images were acquired using the Phased Array Synthetic Aperture Radar/Advanced Land Observing Satellite (PALSAR/ALOS)-2 sensor over the Berambadi watershed (south India), between June and October of 2018. Simultaneous ground measurements of soil moisture, soil roughness, and leaf area index (LAI) were also recorded. The sensitivity of PALSAR observations to variations in soil moisture has been reported by several authors, and is confirmed in the present study, even for the case of very dense crops. The radar signals are simulated using five different radar backscattering models (physical and semi-empirical), over bare soil, and over areas with various types of crop cover (turmeric, marigold, and sorghum). When the semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) is parameterized as a function of the LAI, to account for the vegetation's contribution to the backscattered signal, it can provide relatively accurate estimations of soil moisture in turmeric and marigold fields, but has certain limitations when applied to sorghum fields. Observed limitations highlight the need to expand the analysis beyond the LAI by including additional vegetation parameters in order to take into account volume scattering in the L-band backscattered radar signal for accurate soil moisture estimation.

TI  - SKIM, a Candidate Satellite Mission Exploring Global Ocean Currents and Waves
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Sea surface Kinematics Multiscale monitoring (SKIM) satellite mission is designed to explore ocean surface current and waves. This includes tropical currents, notably the poorly known patterns of divergence and their impact on the ocean heat budget, and monitoring of the emerging Arctic up to 82.5 degrees N. SKIM will also make unprecedented direct measurements of strong currents, from boundary currents to the Antarctic circumpolar current, and their interaction with ocean waves with expected impacts on air-sea fluxes and extreme waves. For the first time, SKIM will directly measure the ocean surface current vector from space. The main instrument on SKIM is a Ka-band conically scanning, multi-beam Doppler radar altimeter/wave scatterometer that includes a state-of-the-art nadir beam comparable to the Poseidon-4 instrument on Sentinel 6. The well proven Doppler pulse-pair technique will give a surface drift velocity representative of the top meter of the ocean, after subtracting a large wave-induced contribution. Horizontal velocity components will be obtained with an accuracy better than 7 cm/s for horizontal wavelengths larger than 80 km and time resolutions larger than 15 days, with a mean revisit time of 4 days for of 99% of the global oceans. This will provide unique and innovative measurements that will further our understanding of the transports in the upper ocean layer, permanently distributing heat, carbon, plankton, and plastics. SKIM will also benefit from co-located measurements of water vapor, rain rate, sea ice concentration, and wind vectors provided by the European operational satellite MetOp-SG(B), allowing many joint analyses. SKIM is one of the two candidate satellite missions under development for ESA Earth Explorer 9. The other candidate is the Far infrared Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM). The final selection will be announced by September 2019, for a launch in the coming decade.

TI  - The Impact of Variability in SAR Satellite Imagery on Classification
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a useful tool to gather intelligence from remote sensing data; it helps make sense of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data via discovery and exploitation. The challenge of utilizing AI in SAR applications is obtaining (large enough) comprehensive sets of labeled training data because SAR data has significant variation across sensor-related characteristics, across processing parameters, and across the different collection plans. This work evaluates the impact of SAR satellite imagery variations on classification accuracy, and demonstrates this by classifying pixels of SAR imagery into land, water, and ship for varying conditions (area-of-interest, incidence angle, spatial resolution, etc.). Results showed that variations in the area-of-interest (AOI), incidence angle, and spatial resolution impacted the classification results obtained using an artificial neural network (ANN). This work also demonstrated that ANNs trained on SAR imagery can be used to infer training data labels of other SAR imagery obtained from different conditions, provided that the changes in condition produced less than a 5% classification error or increased class separation for some (or all) of the classes being discriminated.

TI  - Ecotoxicoproteomics: A decade of progress in our understanding of anthropogenic impact on the environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic pollutants are found worldwide. Their fate and effects on human and ecosystem health must be appropriately monitored. Today, ecotoxicology is focused on the development of new methods to assess the impact of pollutant toxicity on living organisms and ecosystems. In situ biomonitoring often uses sentinel animals for which, ideally, molecular biomarkers have been defined thanks to which environmental quality can be assessed. In this context, high-throughput proteomics methods offer an attractive approach to study the early molecular responses of organisms to environmental stressors. This approach can be used to identify toxicity pathways, to quantify more precisely novel biomarkers, and to draw the possible adverse outcome pathways. In this review, we discuss the major advances in ecotoxicoproteomics made over the last decade and present the current state of knowledge, emphasizing the technological and conceptual advancements that allowed major breakthroughs in this field, which aims to "make our planet great again".Significance: Ecotoxicoproteomics is a protein-centric methodology that is useful for ecotoxicology and could have future applications as part of chemical risk assessment and environmental monitoring. Ecotoxicology employing non-model sentinel organisms with highly divergent phylogenetic backgrounds aims to preserve the functioning of ecosystems and the overall range of biological species supporting them. The classical proteomics workflow involves protein identification, functional annotation, and extrapolation of toxicity across species. Thus, it is essential to develop multi-omits approaches in order to unravel molecular information and construct the most suitable databases for protein identification and pathway analysis in non-model species. Current instrumentation and available software allow relevant combined transcriptomic/proteomic studies to be performed for almost any species. This review summarizes these approaches and illustrates how they can be implemented in ecotoxicology for routine biomonitoring.

TI  - A workflow for Sustainable Development Goals indicators assessment based on high-resolution satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - For evaluating the progresses towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global indicator framework was developed by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals Indicators. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology and a set of workflows for calculating SDGs indicators. The main improvements consist of using moderate and high spatial resolution satellite data and state-of-the-art deep learning methodology for land cover classification and for assessing land productivity. Within the European Network for Observing our Changing Planet (ERA-PLANET), three SDGs indicators are calculated. In this research, harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data are analyzed and used for land productivity analysis and yield assessment, as well as Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 time series are utilized for crop mapping. We calculate for the whole territory of Ukraine SDG indicators: 15.1.1 - 'Forest area as proportion of total land area'; 15.3.1 - 'Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area'; and 2.4.1 - 'Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture'. Workflows for calculating these indicators were implemented in a Virtual Laboratory Platform. We conclude that newly available high-resolution remote sensing products can significantly improve our capacity to assess several SDGs indicators through dedicated workflows.

T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations by satellite sensors provide data on inland water systems at spatial and temporal coverage superior to current monitoring programmes. We derived an empirical relationship for Secchi depth using in situ data from eight lakes and data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager between 1999 and 2018 in the Rotorua Lakes Region in New Zealand. This relationship was then applied to all Landsat data of 23 lakes in that region. A trend analysis on annual and summertime averages of Secchi depth revealed several statistically significant and positive trends, indicating improving water clarity. Our trends were in agreement with those based on in situ observations illustrating the opportunities of remote sensing time series data for lake monitoring and management.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing for Phenotyping Tar Spot Complex Resistance in Maize
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tar spot complex (TSC), caused by at least two fungal pathogens, Phyllachora maydis and Monographella maydis, is one of the major foliar diseases of maize in Central and South America. P. maydis was also detected in the United States of America in 2015 and since then the pathogen has spread in themaize growing regions of the country. Although remote sensing (RS) techniques are increasingly being used for plant phenotyping, they have not been applied to phenotyping TSC resistance in maize. In this study, several multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and thermal imaging of maize plots under disease pressure and disease-free conditions were tested using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over two crop seasons. A strong relationship between grain yield, a vegetative index (MCARI2), and canopy temperature was observed under disease pressure. A strong relationship was also observed between the area under the disease progress curve of TSC and three vegetative indices (RDVI, MCARI1, and MCARI2). In addition, we demonstrated that TSC could cause up to 58% yield loss in the most susceptible maize hybrids. Our results suggest that the RS techniques tested in this study could be used for high throughput phenotyping of TSC resistance and potentially for other foliar diseases of maize. This may help reduce the cost and time required for the development of improved maize germplasm. Challenges and opportunities in the use of RS technologies for disease resistance phenotyping are discussed.

TI  - Tracking three decades of land use and land cover transformation trajectories in China's large river deltas
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large river deltas are characterized by complicated land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics driven by intertwined natural and anthropogenic processes. Understanding spatiotemporal LULC dynamics associated with multiple drivers can help mitigate the adverse ecological impacts resulting from human activities. This research tracked spatiotemporal LULC trajectories in relation to multiple natural and anthropogenic driving processes and explored their correlations within four large river deltas (the Liaohe River Delta [LRD], Yellow River Delta [YRD], Yangtze River Delta [YtRD], and Pearl River Delta [PRD]) in China from 1980 to 2010. The results showed that the coastal wetlands had undergone transformations with 39% in LRD, 85.1% in YRD, 96.5% in YtRD, and 100% in PRD, respectively. The LULC transformations were linked with six major driving processes (accretion, erosion, reclamation, restoration, succession, and regressive succession) and were impacted by complex coupled effects between natural and anthropogenic drivers. Reclamation-related LULC transformation types dominated in the four river deltas and had greater spatiotemporal interactions than the other driving processes. Reclamation and restoration as well as accretion and erosion showed high positive correlations in all four river deltas, but other pairwise correlations of driving processes presented regional variations. This study presents an overview of the patterns and processes of complex multitemporal LULC dynamics and can be replicated elsewhere in areas where land reclamation activities are entangled with natural processes. A scrolling' development pattern with reasonable magnitudes of land reclamation for the river deltas is proposed as a spatial strategy to minimize the adverse ecological impacts of human activity.

TI  - BRAF immunohistochemistry predicts sentinel lymph node involvement in intermediate thickness melanomas
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel node biopsy (SNB) is an important step in melanoma staging and prognostication. It is commonly performed for patients with intermediate thickness melanomas, based on clinicopathological features. However, only 20-25% of patients eventually demonstrate nodal involvement. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether tissue biomarkers with links to melanoma biology, together with clinicopathological parameters, could aid in the prediction of sentinel node involvement and improve selection of patients for SNB. In addition, we examined the role of these clinical or biological markers in disease outcome.MethodsWe collected a case-control cohort of 140 intermediate thickness (Breslow 0,9-4,0mm) melanoma patients with or without SNB involvement matched for age, gender, Breslow thickness and location. From this cohort, we tested the predictive value of common clinicopathological parameters (ulceration, mitotic count and tumor regression) and FMNL-2, ezrin and BRAF V600E immunoreactivity, for sentinel node involvement and survival. We further analyzed the correlations in the superficial spreading melanoma subtype.ResultsBased on our case control analysis, of the markers, BRAF V600E status (p = 0.010) and mitotic count (p = 0.036) correlated with SNB involvement. SNB status was a strong independent prognosticator for recurrence free survival (RFS p<0.001), melanoma specific survival (MSS p = 0.000) and overall survival (OS p = 0.029). In the superficially spreading melanoma subgroup, BRAF V600E positivity indicated poorer RFS (p = 0.039) and OS (p = 0.012). By combining the Breslow thickness, mitotic count and BRAF immunohistochemistry, we identified a group of superficially spreading melanomas with an excellent survival probability independent of SNB status.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that BRAF immunohistochemistry could serve as a useful addition to a marker panel for selecting intermediate thickness melanoma patients for SNB.

TI  - Near infrared band of Landsat 8 as water index: a case study around Cordova and Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, Philippines
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water bodies by extraction using water indexes from remotely sensed images has proven to be effective in delineating surface water against its surrounding. This study tested and assessed the Normalized Difference Water Index, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Automated Water Extraction Index, and near infrared (NIR) band using Landsat 8 imagery acquired on September 3, 2016. The threshold method was adapted for surface water extraction. To avoid over and under-estimation of threshold values, the optimum threshold value of each of the water indexes was obtained by implementing a geoprocessing model. Examining images of Landsat 8, NIR band has the largest difference in reflectance values between water and non-water bodies. Thus, NIR band exhibits the highest contrast between water and non-water bodies. An optimum threshold value of 0.128 for NIR band achieved an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa hat (K-hat) coefficient of 99.3% and 0.986, respectively. NIR band of Landsat 8 as water index was found more satisfactory in extracting water bodies compared to the multi-band water indexes. This study shows that the optimum threshold values of each of the water indexes considered in this study were determined conveniently, where highest value of OA and K-hat coefficient were obtained by creating and implementing a graphical modeler in Quantum Geographic Information System that automates from setting threshold value to accuracy assessment. This study confirms that remote sensing can extract or delineate water bodies rapidly, repeatedly and accurately.

TI  - Distribution and condition of coral reef ecosystem in Tanah Merah Bay, Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia.
T2  - AACL Bioflux
M3  - Article
AB  - The coral reef ecosystem in the Tanah Merah Bay (Depapre) is quite large and varied and even relatively pristine. On the one hand, destructive fishing is still common, especially the use of explosives and the use of tuba root anesthesia and even marine tourism activities such as snorkeling and diving that are less professional and the installation of fishing anchors. Ironically, data and information, especially the distribution and condition of corals, are still limited. This study aims to determine the distribution, condition of coral cover and coral damage as initial data and information in sustainable management. The collection of coral reef distribution data uses the Geographic Information System (GIS) method by analyzing SPOT-6 Satellite Imagery. Coral cover and coral damage data gathering used a survey approach with the Point Intercept Transect (PIT) method. The results showed that the distribution of coral spread along the coast of the Tanah Merah Bay region with the highest coral cover in Tanjung Tanah Merah, Tanjung Amay, Tanjung Harlem, Tanjung Sarebo and Amayepa and the lowest at Kwahkebo islands and Tanjung Kuburan Tablasufa. The dominant life form categories are Coral Massive (CM), Coral Branching (CB), Coral Foliose (CF), branching Acropora (ACB) and table Acropora (ACT). Rubble is found to be highest in Amayepa and Tanjung Tanah Merah, Dead Coral/Dead Coral with Alga is found highest at Kwahkebo islands and Amayepa due to use blast fishing. Bleaching was also found in almost all stations due to use of tuba roots.

TI  - Population effects of heavy metal pollution in wild Algerian mice (<i>Mus spretus</i>)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal mining is one of the largest sources of environmental pollution. The analysis of different types of biomarkers in sentinel species living in contaminated areas provides a measure of the degree of the ecological impact of pollution and is thus a valuable tool for human and environmental risk assessments. In previous studies we found that specimens from two populations of the Algerian mice (Mus spretus) living in two abandoned heavy metal mines (Aljustrel and Preguica, Portugal) had higher body burdens of heavy metals, which led to alterations in enzymatic activities and in haematological, histological and genotoxic parameters, than mice from a nearby reference population. We have now analysed individuals from the same sites at the biometric and genetic levels to get a broader portrayal of the impact of heavy metal pollution on biodiversity, from molecules to populations. Size and shape variations of the mouse mandible were searched by implementing the geometric morphometric method. Population genetic differentiation and diversity parameters (phi ST estimates; nucleotide and haplotype diversities) were studied using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cytb) and the control region (CR). The morphometric analyses revealed that animals from the three sites differed significantly in the shape of the mandible, but mandibular shape varied in a more resembling way within individuals of both mine sites, which is highly suggestive for an effect of environmental quality on normal development pathways in Algerian mice. Also, antisymmetry in mandible size and shape was detected in all populations, making these traits not reliable indicators of developmental instability. Overall little genetic differentiation was found among the three populations, although pairwise phi ST comparisons revealed that the Aljustrel and the Preguica populations were each differentiated from the other two populations in Cytb and in CR, respectively. Genetic diversity parameters revealed higher genetic diversity for Cytb in the population from Aljustrel, while in the population from Preguica diversity of the two markers changed in opposite directions, higher genetic diversity in CR and lower in Cytb, compared to the reference population. Demographic changes and increased mutation rates may explain these findings. We show that developmental patterns and genetic composition of wild populations of a small mammal can be affected by chronic heavy metal exposure within a relatively short time. Anthropogenic stress may thus influence the evolutionary path of natural populations, with largely unpredictable ecological costs.

TI  - Evaluating the Met Office Unified Model land surface temperature in Global Atmosphere/Land 3.1 (GA/L3.1), Global Atmosphere/Land 6.1 (GA/L6.1) and limited area 2.2 km configurations
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A limitation of the Met Office operational data assimilation scheme is that surface-sensitive infrared satellite sounding channels cannot be used during daytime periods where numerical weather prediction (NWP) model background land surface temperature (LST) biases are greater than 2 K in magnitude. The Met Office Unified Model (UM) has a significant cold LST bias in semi-arid regions when compared with satellite observations; a range of UM configurations were assessed with different model resolutions, land surface cover datasets and bare soil parameterisations. UM LST biases were evaluated at global resolution and in a limited area model (LAM) at a 2.2 km resolution over the SALSTICE (Semi-Arid Land Surface Temperature and IASI Calibration Experiment) experimental domain in south-eastern Arizona. This validation is in conjunction with eddy-covariance flux tower measurements. LST biases in the Global Atmosphere/Land 3.1 (GA/L3.1) configuration were largest in the mid-morning with respect to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra (-13.6 +/- 2.8 K at the Kendall Grassland site). The diurnal cycle of LST in Global Atmosphere/Land 6.1 (GA/L6.1) showed a significant improvement relative to GA/L3.1 with the cold LST biases reduced to -1.4 +/- 2.7K and -3.6 +/- 3.0 K for Terra and Aqua overpasses, respectively. The higher-resolution LAM showed added value over the global configurations.The spatial distribution of the LST biases relative to MODIS and the modelled bare soil cover fraction were found to be moderately correlated (0.61 +/- 0.08) during the daytime, which suggests that regions of cold LST bias are associated with low bare soil cover fraction. Coefficients of correlation with the shrub surface fractions followed the same trend as the bare soil cover fraction, although with a less significant correlation (0.36 +/- 0.09), and indicated that the sparse vegetation canopies in south-eastern Arizona are not well represented in UM ancillary datasets. The x component of the orographic slope was positively correlated with the LST bias (0.41 +/- 0.05 for MODIS Aqua) and identified that regions of cold model LST bias are found on easterly slopes, and regions of warm model LST bias are found on westerly slopes. An overestimate in the modelled turbulent heat and moisture fluxes at the eddy-covariance flux sites was found to be coincident with an underestimate in the ground heat flux.

TI  - A tool for Swarm satellite data analysis and anomaly detection
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we introduce a system pipeline for the analysis of earth's electromagnetic field that is used to analyse precursors to earthquakes. Data gathered by the Swarm satellites are used to present the utility of our system. Our objective is to provide a streamlined method to analyze electromagnetic data over a region and investigate the relationship of precursory signals to seismic events. The process follows three distinct stages: data extraction, data pre-processing and anomaly detection. The first stage consists of the region selection and data extraction. The second stage consists of four different pre-processing methods that address the data sparsity problem and the cause of artificial anomalies. The last stage is the Anomaly Detection (AD) of the Swarm satellite data, over the investigated region. The different methods that are implemented are known to perform well in the field of AD. Following the presentation of our system, a case study is described where the seismic event of 6.2 M-w is in Ludian, China and occurred on 3rd August 2014. The event is used to present the usefulness of our approach and pinpoint some critical problems regarding satellite data that were identified.

TI  - Instantaneous sea ice drift speed from TanDEM-X interferometry
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The drift of sea ice is an important geophysical process with widespread implications for the ocean energy budget and ecosystems. Drifting sea ice can also threaten marine operations and present a hazard for ocean vessels and installations. Here, we evaluate single-pass along-track synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (S-ATI) as a tool to assess ice drift while discussing possible applications and inherent limitations. Initial validation shows that TanDEM-X phase-derived drift speed corresponds well with drift products from a ground-based radar at Utqiagvik, Alaska. Joint analysis of TanDEM-X and Sentinel-1 data covering the Fram Strait demonstrates that S-ATI can help quantify the opening/closing rate of leads with possible applications for navigation. S-ATI enables an instantaneous assessment of ice drift and dynamic processes that are otherwise difficult to observe. For instance, by evaluating sea ice drift through the Vilkitsky Strait, Russia, we identified short-lived transient convergence patterns. We conclude that S-ATI enables the identification and analysis of potentially important dynamic processes (e.g., drift, rafting, and ridging). However, current limitations of S-ATI are significant (e.g., data availability and they presently only provide the cross-track vector component of the ice drift field) but may be significantly reduced with future SAR systems.

TI  - Long-term surveillance defines spatial and temporal patterns implicating <i>Culex tarsalis</i> as the primary vector of West Nile virus
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) has become the most epidemiologically important mosquito-borne disease in the United States, causing similar to 50,000 cases since its introduction in 1999. Transmitted primarily by Culex species, WNV transmission requires the complex interplay between bird reservoirs and mosquito vectors, with human cases the result of epizootic spillover. To better understand the intrinsic factors that drive these interactions, we have compiled infection data from sentinel chickens, mosquito vectors, and human cases in Iowa over a 15 year period (2002-2016) to better understand the spatial and temporal components that drive WNV transmission. Supplementing these findings with mosquito abundance, distribution, and host preferences data, we provide strong support that Culex tarsalis is the most important vector of human WNV infections in the region. Together, our analysis provides new insights into WNV infection patterns in multiple hosts and highlights the importance of long-term surveillance to understand the dynamics of mosquito-borne-disease transmission.

TI  - Comparing the accuracy of MODIS data products for vegetation detection between two environmentally dissimilar ecoregions: the Choco-Darien of South America and the Great Basin of North America
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The daily images produced by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites have been widely used to monitor global vegetation. Using these data, the Earth Observing System operated by US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has developed a variety of MODIS products focused on the monitoring and evaluation of vegetation condition. These products have three possible sources of variation that can affect the sensitivity of vegetation detection: 1) orbital and mechanical differences between MODIS sensors aboard Aqua or Terra, 2) the preprocessing algorithms used to generate multitemporal cloud-free mosaics (MAIAC or original MODIS algorithm), and/or 3) post-processing algorithms applied by users to optimize vegetation index values derived from temporal sequences of imagery. We evaluated these sources of variation by comparing the results of a vegetation classification for two different ecoregions. The accuracies of vegetation classifications utilizing either the Aqua or Terra MODIS sensors, the MAIAC or original MODIS preprocessing algorithms, and two common post-processing techniques (Asymmetric Gaussian or Savitzky and Golay function) were compared to determine which set of techniques or sensors yielded the best results. The ecoregions we chose to use were the Great Basin of North America and Choco-Darien of South America. We compared four different MODIS data products (MOD13Q1, MYD13Q1, MOD09Q1, and MYD09Q1) as predictor variables using Random Forest as the classification algorithm to generate a land cover map. We found that the accuracy of the vegetation classifications (using Kappa as measure of accuracy) changed significantly depending on the MODIS platform (Terra or Aqua), the preprocessing algorithm (MAIAC or MODIS), and the two postprocessing algorithms for both ecoregions. Our result suggests that comparative analyses are needed to optimize the results when equivalent MODIS products are used in vegetation detection and classification.

TI  - Effectiveness of annual flu vaccination until week four of season 2018/2019
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE SALUD PUBLICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Annual flu vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent the disease and its complications. Vaccine effectiveness (EV) vanes from season to season, requiring annual re-evaluation. The objective of this work was to estimate the preliminary effectiveness of the influenza vaccine until epidemiological week 4 of the 2018/2019 season, in patients admitted to a third level hospital.Methods: The Test Negative Design (TDN) was carried out at the Hospital General Umversitario de Alicante. Patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza (RT-PCR positive for any influenza virus, in clinical sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate) and those with clinical suspicion of influenza and negative RT-PCR, from week 40 to week 4 of the 2018/2019 influenza season, were considered as controls. The vaccination coverage was calculated in the cases and in the controls, and the EV with its 95% confidence interval using the formula: EV = (1-Odds Ratio) x 100.Results: We included 524 patients: 58 cases and 466 controls. The overall EV for prevention of influenza cases was 42.5 % (95% CI -17.1 to 71.8) and for those over 1 year of age 63.7 % (95% CI 25.4 to 82.3).Conclusions: The 2018-2019 influenza vaccine is effective in preventing influenza cases in patients admitted up to week 4 of the 2018-19 season. Results are preliminary and may vary and should be re-evaluated at the end of the season.

TI  - Analysis of Postoperative Complications After 303 Sentinel Lymph Node Identification Procedures Using the SentiMag® Method in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of this paper was to assess the complications following sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients using the SentiMag (R) method.Material/Methods: The study material consisted of 368 patients who had received the SLNB procedure in combination with wide local excision (WLE), simple mastectomy or who had an autonomous SLNB procedure in the period from January 2014 to September 2017. The final study group consisted of 303 patients who attended follow-up consultations.Results: Sensory disturbances in the arm occurred in 12 patients (9.9%), including 3 patients (1.5%) after WLE and 9 patients (8.4%) after simple mastectomy. Restricted mobility in the upper limb was experienced by 9 patients (7.1%), including 3 patients (1.5%) after WLE and 6 patients (5.6%) after simple mastectomy. Minimal-degree lymphedema developed in 9 patients (7.5%), including 2 patients (1%) after WLE and 7 patients (6.5%) after simple mastectomy. A significant correlation was demonstrated between the incidence of these complications and the number of lymph nodes dissected. A significantly higher incidence of paresthesia and lymphedema was revealed for simple mastectomy with SLNB when compared to WLE with SLNB. Discolorations upon tracer administration were observed in 47 patients (15.5%).Conclusions: SentiMag (R) is a safe sentinel lymph node identification method used in breast cancer and has a low risk of complications. The rate of complications increases together with the number of dissected lymph nodes and the extent of the surgery. The possibility of temporary discolorations on the skin should be communicated to the patients explicitly prior to surgery.

AB  - Global warming is inducing the elevational alpine treeline ecotone (ATE) to migrate to higher elevations in the Himalaya. Prior research on ATE dynamics has been primarily based on field inventory and studied at the community level. The potential of using remote sensing and geographic information system for the delineation of the treeline ecotone has been explored. In this study, we used satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from Landsat-1/2 Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Resourcesat-1/2 Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS-III), and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) to investigate long-term ATE dynamics. Satellite remote sensing of treeline in Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya revealed an upward shift over the past four decades. The ATE has shifted c. 452 m +/- 74 m upward in vertical dimension at a rate c. 113 m decade(-1). Furthermore, the land surface phenology along ATE and forest area has changed significantly over the past 33 years. The significant positive trend in length of the growing season (LOS; p < 0.05) and delay in the end of the growing season (EOS) was observed. The start of the growing season (SOS) had a negative tendency with non-significant linear trend. The treeline upward shift and significant lengthening of the growing season at ATE and forest area indicate changing climatic patterns and processes.

TI  - A Sentinel-1 based hot-spot analysis: landslide mapping in north-western Italy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 6-days repeatability of Sentinel-1 constellation allows building up an interferometric stack with unprecedented velocity. Easily updatable hot-spot analyses, frequently repeated following the update of Sentinel-1 images, represent very useful tools for MTInSAR (Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data analysis. Mountain regions are a challenging environment for interferometric analyses because of their climatic, morphological and land cover characteristics. In this context, MTInSAR data can retrieve reliable information over wide areas, with high cost-benefits ratio and where the installation of ground-based devices is not feasible. Considering the well-known limitations of interferometric techniques (such as fast motions or temporal and spatial decorrelation), hot-spot analyses are a viable solution for semi-automatic ground movements extraction over mountain regions. In this work, we present an example of a hot-spot analysis applied to a large stack of MTInSAR products generated by means of SqueeSAR technique over an alpine region (Valle d'Aosta, north-western Italy). The obtained outputs allow detecting 277 moving areas connected to landslides and mass wasting processes in general. These products are intended to be implemented in the landslide risk management chain of the region, focusing on landslide state of activity definition and landslide mapping.

TI  - Passive Airborne Fourier Transform Infrared Remote Detection of Methanol by Use of Wavelet Analysis as A Feature Extraction Method
T2  - ANALYTICAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wavelet analysis was evaluated as a data preprocessing tool in the construction of automated classifiers for the detection of volatile organic compounds from passive Fourier transform infrared remote sensing data collected in a downward-looking mode from an aircraft platform. The discrete wavelet transform was applied to single-beam spectra and patterns were formed with either the wavelet coefficients directly or with spectra reconstructed with selected resolution levels of the wavelet decomposition. Automated classifiers were constructed with support vector machines (SVM) and used to detect releases of methanol from an industrial site. A key issue in this work was the desire to use data collected during controlled experiments on the ground to train the SVM classifiers. Spectral backgrounds in these ground-collected data are different than those encountered as the aircraft flies, however, and the development of successful classification models requires spectral preprocessing to suppress background signatures. Biorthogonal wavelets were used to generate patterns and resulted in SVM models that produced no missed methanol detections and false detection rates of less than 0.1% when applied to prediction data not used in the development of the model. The SVM classifiers constructed with wavelet processing were compared to one based on unprocessed spectra and also to one computed with spectra preprocessed with Butterworth high-pass digital filters.

TI  - Prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection among Tuberculosis Patients in Nepal.
T2  - Journal of Nepal Health Research Council
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: National Tuberculosis Program has envisioned to provide human immunodeficiency virus testing for all tuberculosis patients. However, human immunodeficiency virus testing coverage among notified tuberculosis patients is very low in Nepal. Hence, it is difficult to reflect the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection among Tuberculosis patients based on the information available from the routine system. Hence National Tuberculosis Program carried out sentinel surveillance to assess the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection among tuberculosis patients and its associated factors in Nepal.METHODS: This study is cross-sectional study type conducted at six sentinel sites across the country. This study lasted for six months starting from March 2017 to August 2017. The sample size was calculated using Epiinfo STATCAL application assuming confidence interval at 95%, 85% power and 5% non-response rate. The required sample size was 1672 tuberculosis patients. Ethical approval was obtained from Nepal Health Research Council. All types of tuberculosis patients who were equal or above 15 years were included in the study. Human immunodeficiency viruse testing was performed among tuberculosis patients as per the testing algorithm recommended by national guideline.RESULTS: The study was carried out among 1664 tuberculosis patients registered for tuberculosis treatment during the study period. More than two thirds of tuberculosis patients (67%) were male. The median age of tuberculosis patients was found 32 years. During human immunodeficiency virus testing, 41 out of 1664 tuberculosis patients were found human immunodeficiency virus positive resulting human immunodeficiency virus infection seroprevalence among tuberculosis patients to 2.5%. Prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection was significantly associated with age (P=0.002), caste/ethnicity (P=0.025), religion (P=0.015) and occupation (P=0.014) of tuberculosis patients.CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection among tuberculosis patients was found 2.5%. Information and access to tuberculosis/human immunodeficiency virus services needs to be increased toaddress tuberculosis-human immunodeficiency virus co-infection in Nepal.

TI  - Adenosine A2a receptor promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis
T2  - ONCOIMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of new lymphatic vessels, or lymphangiogenesis, is a critical step of the tissue repair program. In pathological conditions involving chronic inflammation or tumorigenesis, this process is often dysregulated and can contribute to disease progression. Yet, lymphangiogenesis is still incompletely understood. In this study, we identified A2a adenosinergic signaling as an important regulator of inflammatory and tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis. Using Adora2a (A2a)-deficient mice, we demonstrated that A2a signaling was involved in the formation of new lymphatic vessels in the context of peritoneal inflammation. We also demonstrated that tumor-associated and sentinel lymph node lymphangiogenesis were impaired in A2a-deficient mice, protecting them from lymph node metastasis. Notably, A2a signaling in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells contributed to sentinel lymph node metastasis. In A2a-deficient tumor-draining lymph nodes, impaired lymphangiogenesis was associated with a reduced accumulation of B cells and decreased VEGF-C levels. Supporting a role for non-hematopoietic A2a signaling, we observed that primary murine lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) predominantly expressed A2a receptor and that A2a signaling blockade altered LEC capillary tube formation in vitro. Finally, we observed that Adora2a, Nt5e and Entpd1 gene expression positively correlated with Lyve1, Pdpn and Vegfc in several human cancers, thereby supporting the notion that adenosine production and A2a receptor activation might promote lymphangiogenesis in human tumors. In conclusion, our study highlights a novel pathway regulating lymphangiogenesis and further supports the use of A2a or adenosine blocking agents to inhibit pathological lymphangiogenesis in cancers and block the dissemination of tumor cells through the lymphatic system.

TI  - Introducing Thermal Inertia for Monitoring Snowmelt Processes With Remote Sensing
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal inertia has been successfully used in remote sensing applications that span from geology, geomorphology to hydrology. In this paper, we propose the use of thermal inertia for describing snow dynamics. Two different formulations of thermal inertia were tested using experimental and simulated data related to snowpack dynamics. Experimental data were acquired between 2012 and 2017 from an automatic weather station located in the western Italian Alps at 2,160 m. Simulations were obtained using the one-dimensional multilayer Crocus model. Results provided evidences that snowmelt phases can be recognized, and average snowpack density can be estimated reasonably well from thermal inertia observations (R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 65 kg/m(3)). The empirical model was also validated with manual snow density measurements (R-2 = 0.80; RMSE = 54 kg/m(3)). This study is the first attempt at the exploitation of thermal inertia for snow monitoring, combining optical and thermal remote sensing data.Plain Language Summary Alpine snow represents a fundamental reservoir of fresh water at midlatitude. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to estimate snow properties in different spectral domains. In particular, the knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of snow density could allow modeling of the snow water equivalent, which knowledge is crucial for managing water resources in the face of current climate change. In this study we show for the first time that snow thermal inertia can contribute to monitoring of snowmelt processes and snow density, opening new perspectives for remote sensing of the cryosphere.

TI  - Extracting built-up areas from Sentinel-1 imagery using land-cover classification and texture analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are continuously expanding, against the background of accelerating urbanization, while their correct detection might be useful in a wide range of applications in urban planning and environmental studies. The paper proposes the development of a new method for the detection of the built-up areas based on SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, combining two images on ascendant and descendant orbits, while keeping both polarizations. In the pre-processing operation, we have obtained 4 backscattering bands, 4 primary texture bands, and 12 secondary texture bands which were subsequently used for classification purposes. The method combines a classification of the SAR images with a texture analysis (Iso-Tex) by using spectral signatures and a separation threshold. The results were compared to those achieved in a supervised classification for two cities in Central and Eastern Europe: Cluj-Napoca, in Romania and Wroclaw, in Poland. The potential of the new Iso-Tex method has been proven by the transition to a higher accuracy level compared to the supervised classification. The main advantage of the method is the separation of classes generating detection problems to both radar and optical systems (bare soil, excessively humid soil areas, and the upper part of the slopes).

TI  - The 2005-2016 Trends of Formaldehyde Columns Over China Observed by Satellites: Increasing Anthropogenic Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds and Decreasing Agricultural Fire Emissions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use 2005-2016 observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns over China from the OMI, GOME-2, and SCIAMACHY satellite instruments to evaluate long-term trends in emission inventories of volatile organic compounds (V005) that affect air quality. The observations show large increases over 2005-2016 in the North China Plain (+1.1 +/- 0.5% a(-1) relative to 2005) and the Yangtze River Delta region (+1.5 +/- 0.4% a(-1) relative to 2005), consistent with the trend of anthropogenic VOC emissions in the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC). Unlike other pollutants, VOC emissions have not been decreasing in recent years. An exception is the Huai River Basin in rural eastern China where the satellite data show rapidly decreasing VOC emissions since the early 2010s that appear to reflect bans on agricultural fires.Plain Language Summary Satellite observations of formaldehyde can detect emissions of volatile organic compounds (V005), which are of concern for air quality. Here we use 2005-2016 satellite observations of formaldehyde over China to infer trends in VOC emissions. We find increases of 13% in the North China Plain and 18% in the Yangtze River Delta. Unlike other pollutants, emissions of VOCs in China have not decreased in recent years. An exception is in rural areas where post-2010 restrictions on crop burning to improve air quality have resulted in sharp decreases of VOC emissions.

TI  - Geodetic Observations of the 2018 <i>Mw</i> 7.5 Sulawesi Earthquake and Its Implications for the Kinematics of the Palu Fault
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ascending and descending interferometric synthetic aperture radar data are used to investigate the fault rupture and slip model of the 2018 Mw 7.5 Sulawesi, Indonesia, earthquake. The best fitting slip model indicates that this earthquake ruptured not only a segment extending the Palu fault to the north but also a northwestern segment offshore. The slip on the onshore fault is predominant left-lateral strike slip. The slip on the offshore fault is dominated by normal faulting with a maximum slip of similar to 6.3 m. The newly discovered offshore normal faulting is likely to be the cause of the tsunami after the shock. Combined with previous geomorphic, tectonic, geodetic, and modeling studies, we suggest that the kinematics of the Palu fault maintained the same style of faulting from north to south, which resulted from an oblique extension occurred on an east dipping fault at depths. The deformation pattern of NW Sulawesi is dominated by this slip mechanism.Plain Language Summary On 28 September 2018, a large earthquake (Mw 7.5) struck the Palu city, Sulawesi Island, eastern Indonesia, where three tectonic plates, the Indo-Australian, Philippine Sea and Sunda Plates, interact. Using a joint analysis of ALOS-2 and Landsat 8 satellite images, we found coseismic slip partitioning during this earthquake. We propose a conceptual structural model to interpret the slip mechanism, where oblique extension occurred on an east dipping fault at depth and the slip is partitioned into left-lateral strike-slip motion at the ground surface and normal faulting at the scabed surface. A similar small-scale geological system is observed in the Palu basin along the same fault system, which provides good evidence for this mechanism. Our study has important implications for understanding the geohazards and deformation mechanism of faults in eastern Indonesia.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of Cloud Top Radiative Cooling Rate for Marine Stratocumulus
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top radiative cooling rate (CTRC) is the leading term in the energy budget of a marine boundary layer capped by stratocumulus. It plays a significant role in the formation, evolution, and maintenance of the stratocumulus cloud system. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating the CTRC, with high accuracy, from passive satellite data only. The estimation relies on a radiative transfer model with inputs from satellite-retrieved cloud parameters in combination with reanalysis sounding that is revised, in a physically coherent way, by satellite data. The satellite-based estimates CTRC agree with ground-based ones to within similar to 10%. The high accuracy largely benefits from the good capability of satellite data in constraining parameters of most influence to the CTRC such as free-tropospheric sounding, cloud top temperature, and cloud optical depth. Applying this technique, we generate a climatology of CTRC during summer over the Southern Hemisphere tropical and subtropical oceans.Plain Language Summary Everything cools radiatively. For marine low-lying clouds, the radiative cooling at the cloud top makes the ambient air heavier and sink and, equivalently, the underlying air lighter and float. This forms a vertical mixing process that brings moisture from the underlying sea surfaces upward to feed the clouds, preventing them from dissipation. Therefore, the cloud top radiative cooling rate (CTRC) is one of the most important variables for understanding the behaviors of marine low clouds and their interactions with the Earth's climate system. Despite its significance, the CTRC has rarely been retrieved, with good accuracy, from satellite, the only observational tool that offers global coverage. This study fills this gap by developing a novel remote sensing method to estimate the CTRC from satellite data at an accuracy of 10%. This new capability will help advance our understanding of many poorly understood behaviors of marine low clouds over regions with scarce observations (e.g., middle- and high-latitude oceans). More broadly, the new remote sensing products will improve the accuracy with which the future climate is predicted because our climate system is sensitive to the low cloud mixing process that is regulated by the CTRC.

TI  - The Complementarity between Property Rights and Market Access for Crop Cultivation in Southern Rhodesia: Evidence from Historical Satellite Data
T2  - ECONOMIC HISTORY OF DEVELOPING REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture plays a central role in the efforts to fight poverty and achieve economic growth. This is especially relevant in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where the majority of the population lives in rural areas. A key issue that is generally believed to unlock agricultural potential is the recognition of property rights through land titling, yet there is no overwhelming empirical evidence to support this in the case of SSA. This paper investigates access to markets as an important pre-condition for land titles to result in agricultural growth. Using the case of Southern Rhodesia, we investigate whether land titles incentivised African large-scale holders in the Native Purchase Areas (NPAs) to put more of their available land under cultivation than their counterparts in the overcrowded Tribal Trust Areas (TTAs). We create a novel dataset by applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm on Landsat imagery for the period 1972 to 1984 - the period during which the debate on the nexus between land rights and agricultural production intensified. Our results indicate that land titles are only beneficial when farmers are located closer to main cities, main roads and rail stations or sidings.

TI  - How to infer what persistent things are up to - a Fregean puzzle for traditional Fregeans
T2  - INQUIRY-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - How do we inferentially unify separately acquired empirical information into a single comprehensive picture of the lives of persistent particulars? This paper argues that hidden in such inferences is a Fregean puzzle that can only be solved by individuating our demonstratives thoughts in terms of object-dependent Fregean Senses. I begin by characterizing some constraints on a non-skeptical account of our inferential unification of empirical information. I then go on to show that traditional Fregean views of Sense cannot explain the rationality of such inferences; the consequence of which would be widespread skepticism concerning fundamental aspects of our empirical worldview. I show how the theory of object-dependent Senses can account for the rationality of the puzzling inferences. Lastly, I consider the alternative that we abandon a Fregean explanation of the rationality of inferences. While not fully dismissing that option, I briefly raise, what I take to be, a daunting challenge that uniquely faces non-Fregean views of rational inference.

TI  - The Interaction Between Boundary Layer and Convection Schemes in a WRF Simulation of Post Cold Frontal Clouds Over the ARM East North Atlantic Site
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The correct representation of low-level midlatitude clouds found in the wake of cold fronts strongly relies on the representation of planetary boundary layer (PBL) and convection processes, which are typically parameterized separately in numerical models. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), this study investigates how distinct pairs of PBL and convection parameterization schemes represent cloud fraction in the post cold frontal region. The simulations focus on the region of the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Eastern North Atlantic observation site in the Azores Islands in the wake of a cold front that passed on 25 December 2015. Different PBL and convection schemes are combined to create 12 distinct configurations. The main differences between the selected physical parameterizations are the strength of vertical mixing and the entrainment. The simulations produce a wide range of cloud fractions, where some configurations significantly underestimate while others clearly overestimate satellite and surface-based estimates of cloud fraction. A skill score is used to quantitatively assess the performance of each configuration with respect to ground-based radar data. The key processes that are found to significantly impact the cloud fraction distribution are the strength of the PBL decoupling, the vertical wind shear, entrainment and detrainment rates in shallow convection, and the occurrence of drizzle. This indicates that to successfully simulate post cold frontal clouds, modeled physics must balance strong internal vertical mixing and weak exchange with the free troposphere. For this case study, cloud fraction was more sensitive to the choice of convection scheme than PBL scheme.

TI  - Validation, Stability, and Consistency of MODIS Collection 6.1 and VIIRS Version 1 Deep Blue Aerosol Data Over Land
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deep Blue (DB) algorithm has been used to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) over land from multiple satellite instruments, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua platforms and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This study first validates the latest MODIS (Collection 6.1) and VIIRS (Version 1) DB data products against Aerosol Robotic Network observations. On global average, the typical level of uncertainty in AOD is slightly better than +/-(0.05 + 20%) relative to Aerosol Robotic Network. AE is quantitatively more uncertain but qualitatively shows skill at distinguishing between fine-mode and coarse-mode dominated aerosol columns. Results are also compared with the previous MODIS Collection 6. The stability of the three DB data sets ranges from 0.005-0.01 AOD per decade. Second, spatial and temporal patterns in AOD and AE are compared between the three data sets. It is found that they all show similar patterns of spatial coverage, which is predominantly linked to cloud cover, snow, and polar night. Regional time series of AOD also show highly consistent seasonal and interannual variations and are strongly correlated, although have offsets in some regions due to a combination of algorithmic and sensor-related differences.Plain Language Summary Aerosols are small particles in the atmosphere like desert dust, volcanic ash, smoke, industrial haze, and sea spray. Understanding them is important for applications such as hazard avoidance, air quality and human health, and climate studies. Satellite instruments provide an important tool to study aerosol loading over the world. However, individual satellites do not last forever, and newer satellites often have improved capabilities compared to older ones. This paper evaluates the latest version of the Deep Blue algorithm for monitoring aerosols as applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite instruments. The two MODIS sensors provide data from 2000 and 2002 onward, while the first VIIRS was launched in late 2011, and VIIRS will carry on the MODIS data records into the future. The evaluation is performed by comparing to ground-truth data which are part of (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) NASA's global Aerosol Robotic Network. The stability in time and consistency between the MODIS and VIIRS data sets are also examined.

TI  - Vertical accuracy assessment of global digital elevation models and validation of gravity database heights in Niger
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assessed the vertical accuracy of ASTER GDEM (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer - Global Digital Elevation Model) version 2, AW3D30 (ALOS World 3D - 30m) and the 1 and 3 arc-seconds versions of SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) in Niger Republic. We explored the GDEMs to evaluate large void and erroneous pixel areas. GDEMs were then compared to three kinds of ground control data located on several sites and all merged data after vertical datum matching. We also analysed the vertical accuracy by land cover and compared GDEMs to each other. We finally validated the gravity database heights by using the relatively most accurate GDEM. All GDEMs still contain void pixels except for SRTM3 CGIAR, it was then retained for the assessment with 1 arc-second GDEMs. The vertical accuracies in terms of RMS (Root Mean Square) and in m are: ASTER (6.2, 8.0, 9.8 and 9.2), AW3D30 (2.2, 2.1, 1.8 and 1.6), SRTM1 (3.8, 4.3, 2.5 and 2.9) and SRTM3 (3.7, 4.1, 2.4 and 2.7) compared to levelling data, local DEM of Imouraren, GPS (Global Positioning System) data and all merged data. Absolute height differences are less than 10 m at 74.00%, 99.99%, 99.91% and 99.98% for ASTER, AW3D30, SRTM1 and SRTM3, respectively. AW3D30 is the most accurate and ASTER is the least accurate. For all GDEMs, different accuracies were found depending on land cover classes that could be caused by the random spatial distribution of validation data. Small differences were observed between SRTM and AW3D30 and large values between the two models and ASTER similarly. The gravity database was validated using AW3D30, large values of height differences were found in the northern part in agreement with the database specifications and in the southern part indicating erroneous elevations.

TI  - Exposure of tourism development to salt karst hazards along the Jordanian Dead Sea shore
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dead Sea shore is a unique, young and dynamic salt karst system. Development of the area began in the 1960s, when the main water resources that used to feed the Dead Sea were diverted towards deserts, cities and industries. During the last decade, the water level has fallen by more than 1m per year, causing a hydrostatic disequilibrium between the underground fresh waters and the base level. Thousands of underground cavities have developed as well as hectometre-sized landslides. Despite these unfavourable environmental conditions, large tourism development projects have flourished along the northern coast of the Jordanian Dead Sea. In this work, which is based on a multi-method approach (analyses of radar and optical satellite data, in situ observations, and public science), we show that a 10 km long strip of coast that encompass several resorts is exposed to subsidence, sinkholes, landslides and flash floods. Geological discontinuities are the weakest points where the system can re-balance and where most of the energy is dissipated through erosional processes. Groundwater is moving rapidly along fractures to reach the dropping base level. The salt that fills the sediments matrix is dissolved along the water flow paths favouring the development of enlarged conduits, cavities and then the proliferation of sinkholes. The front beaches of the hotels, the roads and the bridges are the most affected infrastructure. We point out the importance for the land planners to include in the Dead Sea development schemes the historical records and present knowledge of geological hazards in the area.

TI  - Pansharpening using data-centric optimization approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth's observation satellites provide simultaneously both multispectral (XS) and panchromatic (pan) images but XS image has a lower spatial resolution when compared to pan image. Pansharpening is a pixel-level fusion technique resulting in a high-resolution multispectral image in terms of both spatial and spectral resolution. The problem lies in maintaining the spectral characteristics of each channel of the XS image when pan image is used to estimate the high spatial XS image. Many techniques have been proposed to address the problem. A popular method involves a sensor-based approach where correlation among the XS channels and correlation between the pan and spectral channels are incorporated. In this paper, we take a wholesome approach based on the reflectance data irrespective of the sensor physics. A linear regression model is formulated between the XS channel and the panchromatic data. We formulate an optimization problem in terms of Lagrange multiplier to maximise the spectral consistency of the fused data with respect to the original XS data, and to minimise the error in variance between the reference data and the computed data. We validate and compare our method with IHS and Brovey methods based on evaluation metrics such as Chi-square test and the R-2 test. The implementation is done and presented using IKONOS satellite data.

TI  - Recession and Morphological Changes of the Debris-Covered Milam Glacier in Gori Ganga Valley, Central Himalaya, India, Derived From Satellite Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the recession of the Milam glacier in the Gori Ganga valley, Uttarakhand Himalaya, using historical plane-table survey maps, topographical maps, Corona image (1968), Landsat 5 TM (1990), Landsat 7 ETM+ (2001), and Sentinel 2 (2017) satellite data. We estimate that the Milam glacier has receded by 1565.4 +/- 20.6 m (31.9 +/- 0.4 m a(-1)) over the period 1968-2017, while lower recession rate (21.1 +/- 1.7 m a(-1) ) was observed between 2001 and 2017. The Milam glacier lost 2.27 +/- 0.06 km(2) of its area from 1968 to 2017 due to recession. Two tributary glaciers detached from the main trunk between 1990 and 2017, which indicates glacier thinning and melting. The glacier recession also resulted in deformation of moraine ridges on either sides in lower ablation zone of Milam glacier, which is caused due to the removal of basal ice support caused by glacier melting.

TI  - Numerical study on the response of the largest lake in China to climate change
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are sensitive indicators of climate change. There are thousands of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), and more than 1200 of them have an area larger than 1 km(2); they respond quickly to climate change, but few observation data of lakes are available. Therefore, the thermal condition of the plateau lakes under the background of climate warming remains poorly understood. In this study, the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset developed by the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITPCAS), MODIS lake surface temperature (LST) data and buoy observation data were used to evaluate the performance of lake model FLake, extended by simple parame-terizations of the salinity effect, for brackish lake and to reveal the response of thermal conditions, radiation and heat balance of Qinghai Lake to the recent climate change. The results demonstrated that the FLake has good ability in capturing the seasonal variations in the lake surface temperature and the internal thermal structure of Qinghai Lake. The simulated lake surface temperature showed an increasing trend from 1979 to 2012, positively correlated with the air temperature and the downward longwave radiation while negatively correlated with the wind speed and downward shortwave radiation. The simulated internal thermodynamic structure revealed that Qinghai Lake is a dimictic lake with two overturn periods occurring in late spring and late autumn. The sur-face and mean water temperatures of the lake significantly increased from 1979 to 2012, while the bottom temperatures showed no significant trend, even decreasing slightly from 1989 to 2012. The warming was the strongest in winter for both the lake surface and air temperature. With the warming of the climate, the later ice-on and earlier ice-off trend was simulated in the lake, significantly influencing the interannual and seasonal variability in radiation and heat flux. The annual average net shortwave radiation and latent heat flux (LH) both increase obviously while the net longwave radiation and sensible heat flux (SH) decrease slightly. Earlier ice-off leads to more energy absorption mainly in the form of shortwave radiation during the thawing period, and later ice-on leads to more energy release in the form of longwave radiation, SH and LH during the ice formation period. Meanwhile, the lake-air temperature difference increased in both periods due to shortening ice duration.

TI  - Estimation of hourly land surface heat fluxes over the Tibetan Plateau by the combined use of geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of land surface heat fluxes is important for energy and water cycle studies, especially on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), where the topography is unique and the land-atmosphere interactions are strong. The land surface heating conditions also directly influence the movement of atmospheric circulation. However, high-temporal-resolution information on the plateau-scale land surface heat fluxes has been lacking for a long time, which significantly limits the understanding of diurnal variations in land-atmosphere interactions. Based on geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data, the surface energy balance system (SEBS) was used in this paper to derive hourly land surface heat fluxes at a spatial resolution of 10 km. Six stations scattered throughout the TP and equipped for flux tower measurements were used to perform a cross-validation. The results showed good agreement between the derived fluxes and in situ measurements through 3738 validation samples. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for net radiation flux, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and soil heat flux were 76.63, 60.29, 71.03 and 37.5 W m(-2), respectively; the derived results were also found to be superior to the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) flux products (with RMSEs for the surface energy balance components of 114.32, 67.77, 75.6 and 40.05 W m(-2), respectively). The diurnal and seasonal cycles of the land surface energy balance components were clearly identified, and their spatial distribution was found to be consistent with the heterogeneous land surface conditions and the general hydrometeorological conditions of the TP.

TI  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar speckle filtering by multiscale edge detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images are disturbed by an inherent noise having multiplicative properties called "speckle." This noise is undesirable, and its treatment is difficult. To reduce the speckle, a polarimetric filtering is necessary to improve the image quality. The purpose of PolSAR filtering is to use the polarimetric information in the different channels to develop an efficient algorithm adapted to this data type, to reduce well the speckle and preserve the contained information. We present the PolSAR wavelet filtering applying the stationary wavelet transform: filtering by multiscale edge detection with two improvement techniques of wavelet coefficients, filtering by wavelet thresholding using the hard and soft thresholding and their two enhanced versions. Our contribution is based on the adaptation of wavelet thresholding to PolSAR data and on improvement techniques to filter polarimetric covariance or coherency matrix elements and span. The methods are applied to the fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images acquired over Algiers, Algeria (C-band), to the three polarimetric E-SAR images acquired on Oberpfaffenhofen area located in Munich, Germany (P-band), and to the simulated PolSAR images (L-band). We evaluate the performance of each filter based on the following criteria: smoothing homogeneous areas, preserving contours, and polarimetric information. Experimental results and a comparative study are included. (c) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Patterns and drivers of dimethylsulfide concentration in the northeast subarctic Pacific across multiple spatial and temporal scales
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The northeast subarctic Pacific (NESAP) is a globally important source of the climate-active gas dimethylsulfide (DMS), yet the processes driving DMS variability across this region are poorly understood. Here we examine the spatial distribution of DMS at various spatial scales in contrasting oceanographic regimes of the NESAP. We present new high-spatial-resolution measurements of DMS across hydrographic frontal zones along the British Columbia continental shelf, together with key environmental variables and biological rate measurements. We combine these new data with existing observations to produce a revised summertime DMS climatology for the NESAP, yielding a broader context for our sub-mesoscale process studies. Our results demonstrate sharp DMS concentration gradients across hydrographic frontal zones and suggest the presence of two distinct DMS cycling regimes in the NESAP, corresponding to microphytoplankton-dominated waters along the continental shelf and nanoplankton-dominated waters in the cross-shelf transitional zone. DMS concentrations across the continental shelf transition (range < 1-10 nM, mean 3.9 nM) exhibited positive correlations to salinity (r = 0.80), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA; r = 0.51), and the relative abundance of prymnesiophyte and dinoflagellates (r = 0.89). In contrast, DMS concentrations in nearshore coastal transects (range < 1-24 nM, mean 6.1 nM) showed a negative correlation with salinity (r = -0.69; r = -0.78) and SSHA (r = -0.81; r = -0.75) and a positive correlation to relative diatom abundance (r = 0.88; r = 0.86). These results highlight the importance of bloom-driven DMS production in continental shelf waters of this region and the role of prymnesiophytes and dinoflagellates in DMS cycling further offshore. In all areas, the rate of DMS consumption appeared to be an important control on observed concentration gradients, with higher DMS consumption rate constants associated with lower DMS concentrations. We compiled a data set of all available summertime DMS observations for the NESAP ( including previously unpublished results) to examine the performance of several existing algorithms for predicting regional DMS concentrations. None of these existing algorithms was able to accurately reproduce observed DMS distributions across the NESAP, although performance was improved by the use of regionally tuned coefficients. Based on our compiled observations, we derived an average summertime distribution map for DMS concentrations and sea-air fluxes across the NESAP, estimating a mean regional flux of 0.30 Tg of DMS-derived sulfur to the atmosphere during the summer season.

TI  - Radiative transfer modelling reveals why canopy reflectance follows function
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing is potentially highly informative to track Earth's plant functional diversity. Yet, causal explanations of how and why plant functioning is expressed in canopy reflectance remain limited. Variation in canopy reflectance can be described by radiative transfer models (here PROSAIL) that incorporate plant traits affecting light transmission in canopies. To establish causal links between canopy reflectance and plant functioning, we investigate how two plant functional schemes, i.e. the Leaf Economic Spectrum (LES) and CSR plant strategies, are related to traits with relevance to reflectance. These traits indeed related to both functional schemes, whereas only traits describing leaf properties correlated with the LES. In contrast, traits related to canopy structure showed no correlation to the LES, but to CSR strategies, as the latter integrates both plant economics and size traits, rather than solely leaf economics. Multiple optically relevant traits featured comparable or higher correspondence to the CSR space than those traits originally used to allocate CSR scores. This evidences that plant functions and strategies are directly expressed in reflectance and entails that canopy 'reflectance follows function'. This opens up new possibilities to understand differences in plant functioning and to harness optical remote sensing data for monitoring Earth's functional diversity.

TI  - Does the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index explain spatial and temporal variability in sap velocity in temperate forest ecosystems?
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the link between vegetation characteristics and tree transpiration is a critical need to facilitate satellite-based transpiration estimation. Many studies use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy for tree biophysical characteristics, to estimate evapotranspiration. In this study, we investigated the link between sap velocity and 30 m resolution Landsat-derived NDVI for 20 days during 2 contrasting precipitation years in a temperate deciduous forest catchment. Sap velocity was measured in the Attert catchment in Luxembourg in 25 plots of 20 x 20 m covering three geologies with sensors installed in two to four trees per plot. The results show that, spatially, sap velocity and NDVI were significantly positively correlated in April, i.e. NDVI successfully captured the pattern of sap velocity during the phase of green-up. After green-up, a significant negative correlation was found during half of the studied days. During a dry period, sap velocity was un-correlated with NDVI but influenced by geology and aspect. In summary, in our study area, the correlation between sap velocity and NDVI was not constant, but varied with phenology and water availability. The same behaviour was found for the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). This suggests that methods using NDVI or EVI to predict small-scale variability in (evapo)transpiration should be carefully applied, and that NDVI and EVI cannot be used to scale sap velocity to stand-level transpiration in temperate forest ecosystems.

TI  - Research of the Application of Remote Sensing Technology in Monitoring Water Pollution Caused by Coal Suspended Matter in Typical Coal Mining Areas of Western China
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the data of satellites Sentienl-2A and ZY-3, the study used the method combining visual interpretation with high spatial resolution and SWIR empirical model to extract, sort and do statistical analysis of the water pollution caused by coal suspended matter in two typical mining areas of western China, Shendong and Zhungeer. The results show that the water pollution is quite serious both in surface mining and underground mining areas. Polluted water in Shendong coal mining area accounts for 86.44%, while that in Zhungeer coal mining area represents 74.84%. The main factors resulting in water pollution are coal dust and coal-washing wastewater. Water bodies within coal mining areas, of nearby river systems and even in parts of the Yellow River near Zhungeer coal mining area are polluted from slight to serious degrees. Meanwhile, water bodies which are close to coal mining areas with weak mobility and slow circulation are more easily polluted. The method used in this paper is better than traditional visual interpretation analysis used in periodic monitoring in coal mining areas, because it does not need much human intervention and has a reliable basic theory. It can assess the condition of water bodies rapidly and provide information for regulators.

TI  - The Global Fire Atlas of individual fire size, duration, speed and direction
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and human-ignited fires affect all major biomes, altering ecosystem structure, biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric composition. Satellite observations provide global data on spatiotemporal patterns of biomass burning and evidence for the rapid changes in global fire activity in response to land management and climate. Satellite imagery also provides detailed information on the daily or sub-daily position of fires that can be used to understand the dynamics of individual fires. The Global Fire Atlas is a new global dataset that tracks the dynamics of individual fires to determine the timing and location of ignitions, fire size and duration, and daily expansion, fire line length, speed, and direction of spread. Here, we present the underlying methodology and Global Fire Atlas results for 2003-2016 derived from daily moderate-resolution (500 m) Collection 6 MCD64A1 burned-area data. The algorithm identified 13.3 million individual fires over the study period, and estimated fire perimeters were in good agreement with independent data for the continental United States. A small number of large fires dominated sparsely populated arid and boreal ecosystems, while burned area in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes was driven by high ignition densities that resulted in numerous smaller fires. Long-duration fires in boreal regions and natural landscapes in the humid tropics suggest that fire season length exerts a strong control on fire size and total burned area in these areas. In arid ecosystems with low fuel densities, high fire spread rates resulted in large, short-duration fires that quickly consumed available fuels. Importantly, multiday fires contributed the majority of burned area in all biomass burning regions. A first analysis of the largest, longest and fastest fires that occurred around the world revealed coherent regional patterns of extreme fires driven by large-scale climate forcing. Global Fire Atlas data are publicly available through http://www.globalfiredata.org (last access: 9 August 2018) and https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1642, and individual fire information and summary data products provide new information for benchmarking fire models within ecosystem and Earth system models, understanding vegetation-fire feedbacks, improving global emissions estimates, and characterizing the changing role of fire in the Earth system.

TI  - The New First-in-Human EMA Guideline: Disruptive or Constructive? Outcomes From the First EUFEMED Discussion Forum
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Federation for Exploratory Medicines Development (EUFEMED) organized a meeting in Leuven, Belgium entitled 'The new FIH EMA guideline: Disruptive or constructive?' to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss the guideline's operational impact. The revised EMA Guideline on strategies to identify and mitigate risks for first-in-human (FIH) and early clinical trials with investigational products was published on 20 July 2017. The revision gave guidance on sentinel dosing/staggering of subjects within a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial, permissible maximum exposure/investigation of supra-therapeutic doses and dose escalations above the no-observed adverse effect level. As the guidelines came into operation on 1 February, 2018 it was assumed that by the date of the meeting many early phase stakeholders had gathered sufficient first-hand experience of working within the guideline to discuss their thoughts on its impact. The concluding part of the meeting focused on the possible differences between European countries in handling the revised FIH guideline and ways of achieving harmonization. Information on current industry practice was gathered by online polling during the meeting, where perception of the revised guideline as either 'disruptive' or 'constructive' was explored at the start and at the end of the Forum along with recommendations on reducing future regulatory discordance. It was generally agreed that the necessary changes encompassed by new guidelines included both constructive and disruptive aspects. The final vote on whether the new FIH guideline is disruptive or constructive was taken by 69 delegates: 51% stated that it was both constructive and disruptive, 48% decided on constructive, none on disruptive and 1% were still undecided. It was generally accepted that stakeholders need to continue in a process of stakeholder engagement and discussion, particularly on critical safety issues. Such an approach allows partners to adopt a proactive approach to sharing best practice. For example, attendees agreed that a 'Question and Answer' document harmonized between the European agencies is required for the sentinel approach and for the selection of supratherapeutic doses.

M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are major drivers of environmental change at all scales and are especially at risk from the ensuing effects, which include poor air quality, flooding and heat waves. Typically, these issues are studied on a city-by-city basis owing to the spatial complexity of built landscapes, local topography and emission patterns. However, to ensure knowledge sharing and to integrate local-scale processes with regional and global scale modelling initiatives, there is a pressing need for a world-wide database on cities that is suited for environmental studies. In this paper we present a European database that has a particular focus on characterising urbanised landscapes. It has been derived using tools and techniques developed as part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, which has the goal of acquiring and disseminating climate-relevant information on cities worldwide. The European map is the first major step toward creating a global database on cities that can be integrated with existing topographic and natural land-cover databases to support modelling initiatives.

TI  - Assessing potential environmental influences on killer whale (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) distribution patterns in the Bremer Canyon, south-west Australia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Submarine canyons play an important role in the regional distribution, abundance and dispersal of marine biota and are increasingly being recognised as geomorphic features of high conservation significance along Australia's continental margin. Certain canyons have been described as foraging hotspots' attributable to the high abundance of apex cetacean species aggregating in these areas. Anecdotal evidence of large seasonal aggregations of killer whales in the Bremer Canyon, south-west Australia, has attracted significant research attention in the last decade. To identify important environmental drivers influencing aggregation patterns, a predictive spatial habitat model using the Maxent model was developed based on presence-only whale sighting data. In addition, remotely sensed sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations were assessed to investigate the spatio-temporal variation in sea surface conditions. Habitat preference was predicted in areas between canyon heads, with the most influential predictor variables being depth and distance from the continental shelf break. Analysis of remote-sensing data highlighted low localised variability in surface waters and illustrated the seasonal trends of the Leeuwin Current. This study demonstrates the influence of bathymetry and submarine geomorphology on enhanced cetacean abundance and highlights the need for recognition of this potential foraging area in marine reserve planning.

TI  - Used Daily Dose vs. Defined Daily Dose-Contrasting Two Different Methods to Measure Antibiotic Consumption at the Farm Level
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tackling the problem of rising antibiotic resistance requires valid and comparable data on the use of antimicrobial drugs in livestock. To date, no harmonized monitoring of antimicrobial usage in animals is available, and there is no system to assess usage data throughout Europe, thus hampering a direct comparison between different European countries. Most of the currently applied monitoring systems are based on sales data. Placement of sales data in relation to the population at risk requires overall assumptions about the weights of the animals treated and the doses applied. Only a few monitoring systems collect data in which the number of treated animals is reported exactly and does not need to be estimated. To evaluate the influence of different calculation methods on the standardizing procedure of antibiotic usage and benchmarking of farms, the treatment frequency for several farms (broiler, suckling piglets, and fattening pigs) was calculated in the following two different ways: first, based on the Used Daily Dose (-Two), and second, based on the Defined Daily Dose (TFDDD). To support this evaluation, consumption data from the Veterinary Consumption of Antibiotics Sentinel (VetCAb-S) project in Germany were used as example data. The results show discrepancies between both outcomes depending on the calculation method applied. In broiler holdings, the median values of TFDDD were 20.89% lower than the median values of TFUDD. In suckling piglets and fattening pig holdings, the median values of TFDDD were increased 77.14% and 16.33%, respectively, which may have serious implications for the benchmarking of farms. Furthermore, this finding reflects that the calculation procedure also has an impact on the comparison between populations. Therefore, UDD-based calculations should be preferred to run monitoring systems with a benchmark mission. If, in contrast, the DDD approach is chosen to compare antimicrobial usage between populations, additional considerations should be made to adjust for the addressed discrepancies.

TI  - Evaluation of Radarsat-2 quad-pol SAR time-series images for monitoring groundwater irrigation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater assists farmers to irrigate crops for fulfilling the crop-water requirement. Indian agriculture system is characterized by three cropping seasons known as Kharif (monsoon), Rabi (post-monsoon) and summer (pre-monsoon). In tropical countries like India, monitoring cropping practices using optical remote sensing during Kharif and Rabi seasons is constraint due to the cloud cover, which can be well addressed by microwave remote sensing. In the proposed research, the strength of C-band polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series images were evaluated to classify groundwater irrigated croplands for the Kharif and Rabi cropping seasons of the year 2013. The present study was performed in the Berambadi experimental watershed of Kabini river basin, southern peninsular India. A total of fifteen polarimetric variables were estimated includes four backscattering coefficients (HH, HV, VH, VV) and eleven polarimetric indices for all Radarsat-2 SAR images. The cumulative temporal sum (seasonal and dual-season) of these parameters was supervised classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with intensive ground observation samples. Classification results using the best equation (highest accuracy and kappa) shows that the Kharif, Rabi and irrigated double croplands are respectively 9.58 km(2) (20.6%), 16.14 km(2) (34.7%) and 6.22 km(2) (13.4%) with a kappa coefficient respectively 0.84, 0.74 and 0.94.

TI  - Developing High Resolution Baseline Coast Resource Maps Using World View 2 Imagery for a Coastal Village in Fiji
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Fiji, like most Pacific Island countries, there have been numerous reports of degradation of coastal resources, including adverse changes in abundance and stock distribution of numerous aquatic species associated with the coastal habitat. To develop effective management plans, assessment of existing coastal resources is pertinent. High spatial resolution satellite imagery, combined with geographic information systems allow for efficient and synoptic mapping of coastal resources to provide a baseline for developing effective and improved management plans. The purpose of this study was to develop a baseline habitat map of the intertidal benthic cover in Komave Village, Coral Coast, Sigatoka, Fiji. Resource mapping was based on high resolution (2 m) WorldView-2 imagery. Ground-truthing was attained by means of on-site data logging of the intertidal resources, image capturing and GPS recording. Based on these records, the benthic cover was classified into seven classes: 'coral,' 'algae,' 'brown algae,' 'volcanic rocks,' 'sand and gravel,' 'sea grass,' and 'bare.' Ground referencing points were randomly assigned for either supervised classification training or accuracy assessment. A community participatory research approach was used to conduct interviews to assimilate information on fishing sites and coastal land use activities. This exercise explored the social-ecological approach in natural resource management and how it can become an important tool in coastal conservation practices. The coastal resource map generated through this study serves as a baseline for monitoring the status and spatial distribution of the coastal resources in Komave. Annual mapping of the resources and enrichment of maps along with iterative village consultation will enable managers to develop and gauge the effectiveness of coastal management plans. This high resolution map is particularly relevant to Fiji as it is the first of its kind for the country. This work also serves to reduce the global information gap of coastal resource status for Fiji.

TI  - STAT3 and Endothelial Cell-Cardiomyocyte Dialog in Cardiac Remodeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - This article presents an overview of the central role of STAT3 in the crosstalk between endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes in the heart. Endothelial cell STAT3 has a key role in in fl ammation that underlies cardiovascular disease and impacts on cardiac structure and function. STAT3 in endothelial cells contributes to adverse cardiomyocyte genetic reprograming, for instance, during peripartum cardiomyopathy. Conversely, cardiomyocyte STAT3 is important for maintaining endothelial cell function and capillary integrity with aging and hypertension. In addition, STAT3 serves as a sentinel for stress in the heart. Recent evidence has revealed that the redox nature of STAT3 is regulated, and STAT3 is responsive to oxidative stress (ischemia-reperfusion) so as to induce protective genes. At the level of the mitochondrion, STAT3 is important in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation,metabolism, andmitochondrial integrity. STAT3 may also control calcium release from the ER so as to limit its subsequent uptake by mitochondria and the induction of cell death. Under normal conditions, some STAT3 localizes to intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes and serves to transmit pro-fibrotic gene induction signals in the nucleus with increased blood pressure. Further research is needed to understand how the sentinel role of STAT3 in both endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes is integrated in order to coordinate the response of the heart to both physiological and pathological demands.

TI  - Systems thinking as a pathway to global warming beliefs and attitudes through an ecological worldview
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior research has found that systems thinking, the tendency to perceive phenomena as interconnected and dynamic, is associated with a general proenvironmental orientation. However, less is known about its relationship with public understanding of climate change and/or whether this relationship varies across people with different political views. Because climate change is a highly politicized issue, it is also important to understand the extent to which systems thinking can foster acceptance of climate science across political lines. Using an online sample of US adults (n = 1,058), we tested the degree to which systems thinking predicts global warming beliefs and attitudes (e.g., believing that global warming is happening, that it is human-caused, etc.), independent of an ecological worldview (i.e., the New Ecological Paradigm). We found that although systems thinking is positively related to global warming beliefs and attitudes, the relationships are almost fully explained by an ecological worldview. Indirect effects of systems thinking are consistently strong across political ideologies and party affiliations, although slightly stronger for conservatives and Republicans than for liberals and Democrats, respectively. We did not find evidence of the converse: Systems thinking does not seem to mediate the relationship between an ecological worldview and global warming beliefs and attitudes. Together, these findings suggest that systems thinking may support the adoption of global warming beliefs and attitudes indirectly by helping to develop an ecological ethic that people should take care of and not abuse the environment.

TI  - FRESCO-B: a fast cloud retrieval algorithm using oxygen B-band measurements from GOME-2
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The FRESCO (Fast Retrieval Scheme for Clouds from the Oxygen A band) algorithm is a simple, fast and robust algorithm used to retrieve cloud information in operational satellite data processing. It has been applied to GOME-1 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment), SCIA-MACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography), GOME-2 and more recently to TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument). FRESCO retrieves effective cloud fraction and cloud pressure from measurements in the oxygen A band around 761 nm. In this paper, we propose a new version of the algorithm, called FRESCO-B, which is based on measurements in the oxygen B band around 687 nm. Such a method is interesting for vegetated surfaces where the surface albedo is much lower in the B band than in the A band, which limits the ground contribution to the top-of-atmosphere reflectances. In this study we first perform retrieval simulations. These show that the retrieved cloud pressures from FRESCO-B and FRESCO differ only between -10 and +10 hPa, except for high, thin clouds over vegetation where the difference is larger (about +15 to +30 hPa), with FRESCO-B yielding higher pressure. Next, inter-comparison between FRESCO-B and FRESCO retrievals over 1 month of GOME-2B data reveals that the effective cloud fractions retrieved in the O-2 A and B bands are very similar (mean difference of 0.003), while the cloud pressures show a mean difference of 11.5 hPa, with FRESCO-B retrieving higher pressures than FRESCO. This agrees with the simulations and is partly due to deeper photon penetrations of the O-2 B band in clouds compared to the O-2 A-band photons and partly due to the surface albedo bias in FRESCO. Finally, validation with ground-based measurements shows that the FRESCO-B cloud pressure represents an altitude within the cloud boundaries for clouds that are not too far from the Lambertian reflector model, which occurs in about 50% of the cases.

TI  - The future of Southeast Asia's forests
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - While Southeast Asia's forests play important roles in biodiversity conservation and global carbon (C) balance, the region is also a deforestation hotspot. Here, we consider the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to portray a range of plausible futures for the region's forests, employing a state-of-the-art land change modelling procedure and remotely sensed data. We find that by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, SSP 3 (regional rivalry/a rocky road), the region's forests would shrink by 5.2 million ha. The region's aboveground forest carbon stock (AFCS) would decrease by 790 Tg C, 21% of which would be due to old-growth forest loss. Conversely, under the best-case scenario, SSP 1 (sustainability/taking the green road), the region is projected to gain 19.6 million ha of forests and 1651 Tg C of AFCS. The choice of the pathway is thus critical for the future of the region's forests and their ecosystem functions and services.

TI  - AmyZ1: a novel α-amylase from marine bacterium Pontibacillus sp. ZY with high activity toward raw starches
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundStarch is an inexpensive and renewable raw material for numerous industrial applications. However, most starch-based products are not cost-efficient due to high-energy input needed in traditional enzymatic starch conversion processes. Therefore, -amylase with high efficiency to directly hydrolyze high concentration raw starches at a relatively lower temperature will have a profound impact on the efficient application of starch.ResultsA novel raw starch digesting -amylase (named AmyZ1) was screened and cloned from a deep-sea bacterium Pontibacillus sp. ZY. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AmyZ1 was a member of subfamily 5 of glycoside hydrolase family 13. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant AmyZ1 showed high activity at pH 6.0-7.5 and 25-50 degrees C. Its optimal pH and temperature were 7.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Similar to most -amylases, AmyZ1 activity was enhanced (2.4-fold) by 1.0mM Ca2+. Its half-life time at 35 degrees C was also extended from about 10min to 100min. In comparison, AmyZ1 showed a broad substrate specificity toward raw starches, including those derived from rice, corn, and wheat. The specific activity of AmyZ1 towards raw rice starch was 12,621196U/mg, much higher than other reported raw starch hydrolases. When used in raw starch hydrolyzing process, AmyZ1 hydrolyzed 52%, 47% and 38% of 30% (w/v) rice, corn, and wheat starch after 4h incubation. It can also hydrolyze marine raw starch derived from Chlorella pyrenoidosa, resulting in 50.9mg/g DW (dry weight of the biomass) of reducing sugars after 4h incubation at 35 degrees C. Furthermore, when hydrolyzing raw corn starch using the combination of AmyZ1 and commercial glucoamylase, the hydrolysis rate reached 75% after 4.5h reaction, notably higher than that obtained in existing starch-processing industries.Conclusions p id=Par3 As a novel raw starch-digesting -amylase with high specific activity, AmyZ1 efficiently hydrolyzed raw starches derived from both terrestrial and marine environments at near ambient temperature, suggesting its application potential in starch-based industrial processes.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite data on deforestation and weather in Malawi and linking those datasets with household survey datasets, we estimate the causal effect of deforestation on access to clean drinking water. In the existing literature on forest science and hydrology, the consensus is that deforestation increases water yield. In this study, we directly examine the causal effect of deforestation on households' access to clean drinking water. Results of the two-stage least-squares (2SLS) with cluster and time fixed-effect estimations illustrate strong empirical evidence that deforestation decreases access to clean drinking water. Falsification tests show that the possibility of our instrumental variable picking up an unobserved time trend is very unlikely. We find that a 1.0-percentage-point increase in deforestation decreases access to clean drinking water by 0.93 percentage points. With this estimated impact, deforestation in the last decade in Malawi (14%) has had the same magnitude of effect on access to clean drinking water as that of a 9% decrease in rainfall.

TI  - Enhanced sentinel surveillance for hepatitis B infection in 200 counties in China, 2013-2016
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hepatitis B infection is a major public health challenge in China. Clinicians report hepatitis B cases to the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System. A 2007 study found that only 35% of hepatitis B cases that had been reported as acute infections met a rigorous case definition of acute hepatitis B, implying overreporting of new-onset infections. To increase the accuracy of reported acute hepatitis B infections, in 2013, we initiated enhanced hepatitis B surveillance in 200 sentinel counties. We compared incidences and proportions of different stages of hepatitis B infection before and after implementation of enhanced surveillance. We checked the accuracy of reported data and re-diagnosed hepatitis B cases reported as acute infection according to the enhanced diagnostic criteria and calculated positive predictive value(PPV) of acute hepatitis B reports. Compared to previous surveillance, with enhanced surveillance, the incidence of reported acute hepatitis B infection decreased by 53.7% and the proportion of unclassified hepatitis B infection was reduced by 79.4%. From 2013 to 2016, the PPV of acute hepatitis B increased (55.8% to 71.0%); PPV rates in western and rural areas were lower than in other areas. We recommend enhancing hepatitis B surveillance nationwide using these new standards, and raising western and rural areas clinicians' diagnostic and reporting capacity, and ensuring sufficient resources for IgM anti-HBc testing.

TI  - Surveillance of Mosquitoes (Diptera, Culicidae) in a Northern Central Region of Spain: Implications for the Medical Community
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquitoes are important to public and animal health due to their capacity to transmit diseases. Since the Zika virus was declared a pandemic by the WHO in 2016, and it has been recorded in different regions of Mediterranean Area (included Spain), the Government of La Rioja (Northern Spain) through the Center of Rickettsiosis and Arthropod-Borne Diseases, implemented an entomological surveillance programme of mosquitoes in La Rioja and in a close area of Navarra. This surveillance extended to some of the pathogens that they can transmit. Here we describe the framework of the initial surveillance programme for the detection of mosquitoes and associated human pathogens. We outline the benefits and the limitation of the programme to date, and explore how greater benefits can be achieved, for example using a One Health approach. Entomological surveillance has been carried out with BG-Sentinel traps, human bait technique and other methods such as collecting adults in resting places or immature stages by dipping in several wetlands. Since Aedes albopictus, vector of arbovirus such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika, has not been detected yet in the region, the entomological programme included the surveillance of this exotic species using ovitraps in the most important cities. Morphological identification was supported using the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I and the internal transcribed spacer 2 genes analysis. In 2016 and 2017, more than 6,000 mosquitoes were collected. The mosquito's community included 21 species associated with six genera: Anopheles (n = 4), Aedes (n = 5), Culex (n = 6), Cullseta (n = 4), Uranotaenia (n = 1) and Coquillettidia (n = 1). Eleven species represent new records for La Rioja and Navarra regions. Several species were collected biting humans and a great proportion of the sampled mosquito population are competent vectors of several pathogens, such as West Nile virus. Sequences closely related to mosquito-only flavivirus have been detected in 0.34% of analysed pools. At the same time, the epidemiological surveillance emphasis is placed in the early detection of mosquito-borne diseases in primary health and emergency services. The surveillance programme represents a relevant and necessary assessment of the risk of pathogen transmission in a region, and it allows for the establishment of the appropriate preventive measures.

TI  - [Discussion on the indications of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer in the era of precision medicine].
T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the clinical benefits of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) acquired by breast cancer patients with clinically positive axillary lymph node (ALN), and further optimize the IM-SLNB indications. Methods: All primary breast cancer patients with clinically positive ALN from February 2014 to September 2017 were prospectively recruited in this study. IM-SLNB was performed under the guidance of the modified injection technique. The success rate and visualization rate of IM-SLNB, metastatic rate of internal mammary sentinel lymph node (IMSLN) and its related factors were analyzed, and the clinical benefits were accessed according to the current guidelines. Results: Among 126 patients, all of 94 patients (74.6%) who showed internal mammary drainage successfully underwent IM-SLNB. The incidence of internal mammary artery bleeding and pleural lesion were 4.3%(4/94) and 9.6%(9/94), respectively. The metastatic rate of IMSLN was 38.3% (36/94), which was significantly associated with the number of positive ALN (P<0.001) and tumor size (P=0.024). The lymph node staging of 94 patients who underwent IM-SLNB was more accurate. Among them, 36 cases with positive IMSLN underwent internal mammary radiotherapy (IMRT), while the other 58 cases with negative IMSLN avoided radiotherapy. Conclusions: IM-SLNB should be routinely performed in patients with positive ALN. IM-SLNB can provide more accurate staging and guide tailored IMRT to benefit more breast cancer patients.
AB  - 目的： 探讨乳腺癌内乳前哨淋巴结活检(IM－SLNB)在临床腋窝淋巴结阳性患者中的临床效果，进一步优化IM－SLNB的适应证。 方法： 前瞻性研究2014年2月至2017年9月，就诊于山东省肿瘤医院乳腺病中心、临床腋窝淋巴结阳性的126例原发乳腺癌患者的临床资料，在新型注射技术引导下经肋间行IM－SLNB，分析IM－SLNB成功率、显像率、内乳前哨淋巴结(IMSLN)转移率及其相关因素，根据乳腺癌临床实践指南评估其临床获益。 结果： 126例患者中，94例(74.6%)有IMSLN显像，均成功接受IM－SLNB，内乳血管和胸膜损伤的发生率分别为4.3%(4/94)和9.6%(9/94)。IMSLN转移率为38.3%(36/94)，与腋窝淋巴结阳性数目(P<0.001)和肿瘤大小(P＝0.024)均有关。94例行IM－SLNB患者均可获得更准确的淋巴分期，其中36例IMSLN阳性患者行内乳放疗，58例IMSLN阴性患者避免内乳放疗。 结论： IM－SLNB应常规在临床腋窝淋巴结阳性的乳腺癌患者中实施，以指导更准确的淋巴分期，制订个体化放疗策略，使更多的乳腺癌患者获益。.

TI  - Stage Two Malignant Melanoma of the Clitoris: A Case Report
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mucosal melanomas are rare in comparison to cutaneous melanomas, accounting for approximately 1% of all melanoma cases. Vulvovaginal melanoma is the least common mucosal melanoma subtype. For patients without distant metastases at presentation, regional lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic indicator. Lymphoscintigraphy is a method used to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN), directing subsequent biopsies to the lymph node at highest risk for cancer spread.We present a 67-year-old Hispanic female with stage II B (T4aN0M0) melanoma of the clitoris. The patient initially sought medical treatment for a pigmented vulvar lesion over her clitoris that occasionally bleeds. She stated that over the past month the lesion began to grow peripherally and then acquired a very dark color. The patient underwent local excision of the mass and subsequent pathology revealed malignant melanoma. The patient underwent lymphoscintigraphy which allowed localization and subsequent biopsy of the left inguinal sentinel node. The left inguinal sentinel node was negative for metastatic melanoma. It was opted to keep her under observation.Compared to cutaneous melanoma, patients with mucosal melanoma usually present with more advanced disease, and thus efficacious imaging practices play a significant role in the management of the disease. Lymphoscintigraphy is a well-tolerated, validated, cost-effective, and reliable method of detecting sentinel nodes with minimal radiation exposure to the patient. In our case, early clinical detection allowed for prompt surgical intervention, pathologic diagnosis, and reliable staging via lymphoscintigraphy of a rare form of malignant melanoma.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE HIGH IMPACT CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - We are reporting a case of a 54-year-old transgender female with a history of breast augmentation with bilateral silicone implants. Seventeen years later, she presented with an enlarging right breast mass. Pathology confirmed breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Ann Arbor Stage IIE, TNM Stage III BIA-ALCL). The patient underwent bilateral capsulectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy with adjuvant CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy, and radiotherapy to the right chest, axilla, and supraclavicular lymph nodes. BIA-ALCL is a rare entity, especially in transgender females. We report this case and a review of the literature in this report.

TI  - a careful balance: materialist concern meets spiritual function in balkh, afghanistan
T2  - MATERIAL RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article outlines the Aga Khan Trust for Culture's heritage preservation practices at the shrine of Khwaja Parsa in Balkh, Afghanistan. It explores how this organization's approach to the preservation of authenticity supports both classic preservation principles whilst also showing allegiance to Islamic practices that are compatible with the way this mosque and shrine complex is used in Balkh. One focus of the critical approach to heritage research has been on describing the tension between a preservationist' approach to heritage work - with its attached focus on the values of materiality, monumentality and aesthetics - and an approach that shows allegiance to religious or spiritual traditions that make sense in situ. This paper argues against this constructed dichotomy to reveal how the Aga Khan Trust for Culture's heritage work in Balkh empowers a hybridized, vernacularized heritage preservation practice that reflects both this organisation's worldview and political objectives.

TI  - Temporal and spatial dynamics of phenology along the North-South Transect of Northeast Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is sensitive to climate change and, as such, is often regarded as an indicator of climate change. It is a common practice to extract vegetation phenological indicators based on satellite remote sensing data. In this study, we used the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Study (GIMMS) Third-Generation normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3G) to investigate temporal and spatial changes in phenology in Northeast Asia. Based on the maximum rate of change in the NDVI and dynamic threshold, we used the Asymmetric Gaussian model, Double Logistic method, and Savitzky-Golay filter to extract the start of the growing season (SOS), the end of the growing season (EOS), and the length of the growing season (LOS), respectively, along the North-South Transect of Northeast Asia (NSTNEA) from 1982 to 2014. We then compared the differences in SOS, EOS, and LOS and considered their spatio-temporal dynamics and relationship with temperature. The results show that the Asymmetric Gaussian model has the highest stability among the three methods. Dynamic thresholds corresponding to the maximum change rate of NDVI were mainly between 0.5 and 0.6. From 1982 to 2014, the SOS in the NSTNEA region occurred approximately 0.19 days earlier each year; the trends in EOS and LOS were not significant. In general, temperature and latitude have a strong linear relationship, both of which significantly impact vegetation phenology in the NSTNEA region. In addition, elevation also significantly impacts on vegetation phenology in the NSTNEA region.

TI  - Predicting spatiotemporal changes of channel morphology in the reach of Teesta River, Bangladesh using GIS and ARIMA modeling
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Teesta is one of the most dynamic river systems in Bangladesh, supporting the local livelihood patterns of millions of riparian people over a long time. However, there is an increasing concern regarding such a dynamic system, due to its channels being subjected to regular shifting and threatening engineering projects, which results in various socio-economic and environmental problems. Therefore, the objective of the study is to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of channel morphology and predict mid-line channel shifting in the reach of the Teesta River, Bangladesh during 1972-2031, using multi-temporal Landsat images data with GIS, spatial autocorrelation index, and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The results show that the temporal changes in channel shifting rates were mostly affected by high sedimentation in the river flow path, whereas the spatial changes along the channel reaches were primarily controlled by the differences of river banks, as demonstrated by the various bar area formations. The relationship between the bar area and the braided index exhibits a strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.96, p < 0.01), while a moderate correlation occurs (R-2 = 0.50; p < 0.05) between the sinuosity index and time, suggesting a high rate of sedimentation and changing the flow of the river affected by the channel banks. The results of the ARIMA model indicate that the maximum mid-line channel shifting will occur in the rightward direction for the period between 2017 and 2024, and leftward mid-line channel shifting between 2024 and 2031. The spatial autocorrelation results suggest that the decreasing bar area increases the spatial pattern of the channel. Overall, the maximum lateral channel shifting occurs in the right bank side; thus, the channel reach is sensitive to lateral shifting and requires protection utilizing engineering structures, as a huge population and extensive agricultural lands are being displaced on its rightward floodplain.

TI  - A Satellite Assessment of the Urban Heat Island in Morocco
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban ecosystems interact with surroundings via land cover changes and their subsequent impact on surface temperature. In emerging countries, large urban agglomerations often form around cities, and only a few studies have evaluated their impact. This study carries out the first ever large-scale assessment of urban heat island (UHI) and reflects on its mitigation in Morocco. The analysis reveals a well-defined UHI in urban areas built within vegetated lands and an urban heat sink (UHS) in urban areas built within arid regions. Both UHI and UHS amplitudes are higher during day than nighttime, emphasizing vegetation physiological activity. This study shows a monotonic increase in UHI amplitude with urban area size. However, unlike previous studies, this analysis shows that, as urban areas built in desert-like environments grow in size, the UHS gradually decreases to ultimately turn into an UHI. On average, cities built within vegetation are warmer than the rural fringe by 1.51 degrees C during daytime. This suggests that daytime urban heating may exacerbate the potential climate warming. These results also suggest that adapted trees constitute a natural cooling mechanism and should be part of urban heating mitigation in Morocco.

TI  - Characterization of natural hydrocarbon seepage in the South Caspian Sea off Iran using satellite SAR and geological data
T2  - MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two groups of oil slicks have been repeatedly detected in the Southern Caspian Sea, off Cape Sefidrud and close to the Iranian coast of the sea on the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites in April-June 2018. Analysis of the SAR images together with bathymetry, geological and geophysical data in geographic information system showed that these manifestations (oil slicks) visible on the sea surface have natural origin, related to the bottom seepage phenomenon and are associated with existing hydrocarbon system. Oil slicks are concentrated over the continental slope and related to local geological formations of the sedimentary cover having oil deposits related to paleo-delta of Sefidrud River. Our evidence shows that two seeps in this area are active and repeating. It is concluded that the SAR is an excellent tool for monitoring of seepage phenomenon. Moreover, results indicate that the use of remote methods to identify offshore natural oil seeps related to existing active petroleum system can be considered as a well-accepted approach to support oil and gas exploration in frontier areas such as the South Caspian Basin.

TI  - Grassland vegetation phenological variations and responses to climate change in the Xinjiang region, China
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is one of the most prominent and sensitive indicators of the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. To understand and predict the changes in terrestrial ecosystems, it is important to investigate phenological changes. In this study, we investigated vegetation phenology in grasslands in Xinjiang, which is a typical arid and semiarid region in China. We analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in grassland phenology in response to climate change from 2001 to 2014 using the MODIS MCD12Q2-Land Cover Dynamics global phenology product and concurrent meteorological data. The effects of monthly temperature and precipitation on the grassland start of the growing season (SOS) in spring were analyzed with the partial least squares (PLS) method. We found that the MCD12Q2 phenology data could successfully reflect the SOS of the grassland vegetation in Xinjiang. The perennial mean grassland phenology in Xinjiang exhibited significant differences among elevation zones. For each 1000 m increase in the elevation gradient, the SOS was delayed by 13 days. The SOS of the different grassland types in Xinjiang varied from day of year (DOY) 100 to DOY 136, and grassland SOS advanced at a rate of 0.11 d/a. The relative percentage of advanced area (57.5%) was larger than that of delayed area (42.5%), and the percentages of significantly advanced area (4.6%) and significantly delayed area (2.6%) were low. Temperature plays a decisive role in grassland SOS. Warmer temperatures in early spring and lower temperatures and less precipitation in January were more favorable for grassland SOSs in this region than were other temperature and precipitation regimes, and increased precipitation during the early spring had a more favorable effect on grassland SOS in low-altitude areas than in high-altitude areas.

TI  - Assessment of empirical algorithms for bathymetry extraction using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry estimated from optical satellite imagery has been increasingly implemented as an alternative to traditional bathymetric survey techniques. The availability of new sensors such as Sentinel-2 with improved spatial and temporal resolution, in comparison with previous optical sensors, offers innovative capabilities for bathymetry derivation. This study presents an assessment of the fit between satellite data and the underlying models in the most widely used empirical algorithms: the linear band model and the log-transformed band ratio model using Sentinel-2A data. Both models were tested in two study areas of the Irish coast with different morphological and environmental conditions. Results showed that the linear band model fitted better than the log-transformed band ratio model providing coefficient of determination values, R-2, between 0.83 and 0.88 (0 m-10 m) for the five images considered in the study. The closest fit was found in the depth range 2 m-6 m. Atmospheric correction, bottom type influence, and water column conditions proved to be key factors in the bathymetric derivation using these satellite datasets.

TI  - The summer upwelling of the Eastern Aegean Sea detected from MODIS SST scenes from 2003 to 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The summer upwelling of the Eastern Aegean Sea is investigated by daily night-time MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Sea Surface Temperature scenes in the periods from June to November (extended summer) 2003-2015. The analysis is supported by wind data downloaded from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis archive. On average over these summers, upwelling and Etesian wind occurred 69% and 78% of time, respectively. The highest correlation between upwelling and wind was found from June to September, with the beginning of the upwelling events shifted between 24 and 48 h after the start of the Etesian wind. The upwelling always begins in the same areas of the Eastern Aegean coast with the only differences that these areas tesian wind pattern. The largest upwelling events occurred in summers 2003-2009 and not in the following years of the study period. The upwelled cold surface water, still pushed by the persistent Etesian wind, fills part of South-Eastern Aegean and eventually outflows the Aegean Sea through Kassos and Karpathos Straits of the eastern Cretan Arc.

TI  - Northern Hemisphere contrail properties derived from Terra and Aqua MODIS data for 2006 and 2012
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear contrail coverage, optical property, and radiative forcing data over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) are derived from a year (2012) of Terra and Aqua Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and compared with previously published 2006 results (Duda et al., 2013; Bedka et al., 2013; Spangenberg et al., 2013) using a consistent retrieval methodology. Differences in the observed Terra-minus-Aqua screened contrail coverage and patterns in the 2012 annual-mean air traffic estimated with respect to satellite overpass time suggest that most contrails detected by the contrail detection algorithm (CDA) form approximately 2 h before overpass time. The 2012 screened NH contrail coverage (Mask B) shows a relative 3 % increase compared to 2006 data for Terra and increases by almost 7 % for Aqua, although the differences are not expected to be statistically significant. A new post-processing algorithm added to the contrail mask processing estimated that the total contrail cirrus coverage visible in the MODIS imagery may be 3 to 4 times larger than the linear contrail coverage detected by the CDA. This estimate is similar in magnitude to the spreading factor estimated by Minnis et al. (2013). Contrail property retrievals of the 2012 data indicate that both contrail optical depth and contrail effective diameter decreased approximately 10 % between 2006 and 2012. The decreases may be attributed to better background cloudiness characterization, changes in the waypoint screening, or changes in contrail temperature. The total mean contrail radiative forcings (TCRFs) for all 2012 Terra observations were - 6.3, 14.3, and 8.0 mW m(-2) for the shortwave (SWCRF), long-wave (LWCRF), and net forcings, respectively. These values are approximately 20% less than the corresponding 2006 Terra estimates. The decline in TCRF results from the decrease in normalized CRF, partially offset by the 3 % increase in overall contrail coverage in 2012. The TCRFs for 2012 Aqua are similar, -6.4, 15.5, and 9.0 mW m(-2) for shortwave, long-wave, and net radiative forcing. The strong correlation between the relative changes in both total SWCRF and LWCRF between 2006 and 2012 and the corresponding relative changes in screened contrail coverage over each air traffic region suggests that regional changes in TCRF from year to year are dominated by year-to-year changes in contrail coverage over each area.

TI  - Constraining the aerosol influence on cloud liquid water path
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of aerosols on cloud properties is one of the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate. Significant progress has been made in constraining this forcing using observations, but uncertainty remains, particularly in the magnitude of cloud rapid adjustments to aerosol perturbations. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is the leading control on liquid-cloud albedo, making it important to observationally constrain the aerosol impact on LWP.Previous modelling and observational studies have shown that multiple processes play a role in determining the LWP response to aerosol perturbations, but that the aerosol effect can be difficult to isolate. Following previous studies using mediating variables, this work investigates use of the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) and LWP for constraining the role of aerosols. Using joint-probability histograms to account for the non-linear relationship, this work finds a relationship that is broadly consistent with previous studies. There is significant geographical variation in the relationship, partly due to role of meteorological factors (particularly relative humidity). The N-d-LWP relationship is negative in the majority of regions, suggesting that aerosol-induced LWP reductions could offset a significant fraction of the instantaneous radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci).However, variations in the N-d-LWP relationship in response to volcanic and shipping aerosol perturbations indicate that the N-d-LWP relationship overestimates the causal N-d impact on LWP due to the role of confounding factors. The weaker LWP reduction implied by these "natural experiments" means that this work provides an upper bound to the radiative forcing from aerosol-induced changes in the LWP.

TI  - Waterbody mapping: a comparison of remotely sensed and GIS open data sources
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water maps are essential for many environmental applications. Waterbody delineation from satellite images remains a challenging task due to sensor limitations, the presence of clouds, the low albedo surfaces in urban areas, topographic, and atmospheric conditions. In this paper, a model based on the Supported Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was adopted for waterbody extraction from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RapidEye satellite images. As well, the accuracy of two other sources (OpenStreetMapping (OSM) and Military Geographic Institute (MGI)) was tested. The free images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI were more accurate (Kappa (KHAT):0.89, 0.88) data sources than commercial RapidEye images (KHAT: 0.79). Regarding the performance between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 obtained the most accurate results (overall accuracy 94.49 vs. 94.17, commission error 1.34 vs. 1.87). Due to the variable spatial resolution of OSM and MGI data, it was not possible to detect small waterbodies with these sources, and therefore high values of omission error and a strong underestimation of the area of surface water were obtained. This study demonstrates the suitability of free images for mapping and monitoring of surface waterbodies, including small water bodies.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of the suspended particle size in Hongze Lake based on GF-1 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing analyses of water colour, suspended particle size is an important optical parameter that also plays an important role in inland and coastal biogeochemical processes. Knowledge of the suspended particle size and its changes in month and area can be used to assess the contributions by suspended particulate matter to backscatter coefficient, particle sinking, and carbon sequestration under lake water. In this study, in situ samples collected in the summer and winter from Hongze Lake (HZL), 2016, were used to develop an empirical model to estimate the median diameter (D-V(50)) of suspended particle sizes. The spatial distributions of D-V(50) were derived using 37 WFV (Wide Field Viewer) images of GF-1 (GaoFen-1), China, and the fluctuational diversification and the potential influencing factors were discussed. Several crucial findings can be drawn: (1) the empirical band ratio algorithm R-rs,R-green: R-rs,R-red was suitable for D-V(50) estimation with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of approximately 0.7 for the modelling data. In addition, the validation data showed that the MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) is below 34%, the RMSE (root mean square error) is less than 4.2 mu m, and the Mean ratio is close to 1; (2) the average median particle size shows an increasing trend from the northeast of the lake (NE) to Chengzi Lake (CZL) and the wetland (WL) in HZL from 2015 to 2016; (3) the D-V(50) of HZL is higher in summer than in the other seasons during the study period; (4) the fluctuation in hydrological factors, especially the monthly water discharge and flow, might be the driving force behind the seasonal variations in D-V(50) of HZL; and (5) channel transportation reduced D-V(50), and the reduced amplitude might be more than 22%.

TI  - Mapping pasture biomass in Mongolia using Partial Least Squares, Random Forest regression and Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a robust methodology to estimate pasture biomass across the huge land surface of Mongolia (1.56 x 10(6) km(2)) using high-resolution Landsat 8 satellite data calibrated against field-measured biomass samples. Two widely used regression models were compared and adopted for this study: Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Random Forest (RF). Both methods were trained to predict pasture biomass using a total of 17 spectral indices derived from Landsat 8 multi-temporal satellite imagery as predictor variables. For training, reference biomass data from a field survey of 553 sites were available. PLS results showed a satisfactory correlation between field measured and estimated biomass with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.750 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 101.10 kg ha(-1). The RF regression gave similar results with R-2 = 0.764, RMSE = 98.00 kg ha(-1). An examination of feature importance found the following vegetation indices to be the most relevant: Green Chlorophyll Index (CLgreen), Simple Ratio (SR), Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index EVI1 and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indices. With respect to the spectral reflectances, Red and Short Wavelength Infra-Red2 (SWIR2) bands showed the strongest correlation with biomass. Using the developed PLS models, a spatial map of pasture biomass covering Mongolia at a spatial resolution of 30 m was generated. Our study confirms the high potential of RF and PLS regression (PLSR) models to predict pasture biomass. The computationally simpler PLSR model is preferred for applications involving large regions. This method can be implemented easily, provided that sufficient reference data and cloud-free observations are available.

TI  - A spatio-temporal fusion method for remote sensing data Using a linear injection model and local neighbourhood information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a spatio-temporal fusion method for remote sensing images by using a linear injection model and local neighbourhood information. In this method, the linear injection model is first introduced to generate an initial fused image, the spatial details are extracted from the fine-resolution image at the base date, and are weighted by a proper injection gains. Then, the spatial details and the relative spectral information from the coarse-resolution images are blended to generate the fusion result. To further enhance its robustness to the noise, the local neighbourhood information, derived from the fine-resolution image and the fused result simultaneously, is introduced to refine the initial fused image to obtain a more accurate prediction result. The algorithm can effectively capture phenology change or land-cover-type change with minimum input data. Simulated data and two types of real satellite images with seasonal changes and land-cover-type changes are employed to test the performance of the proposed method. Compared with a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and a flexible spatio-temporal fusion algorithm (FSDAF), results show that the proposed approach improves the accuracy of fused images in phenology change area and effectively captures land-cover-type reflectance changes.

TI  - Mapping forest disturbance across the China-Laos border using annual Landsat time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Laos border area is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and has undergone unprecedented social and economic shifts related to extensive land conversion to cash plantations in recent decades. However, spatially and temporally detailed information on land conversion and forest disturbance does not exist in this area. The aim of this study is to map and analyse spatiotemporal changes in forest disturbance from 1991 to 2016 along the China-Laos border using annual Landsat time series images. Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr), based on a temporal segmentation algorithm, was used with the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) as a disturbance index in this study. The results show that the overall accuracy of forest disturbance is 89.72% +/- 0.67% and that the estimated forest disturbance area between 1991 and 2016 reaches 4366.14 km(2) +/- 887.17 km(2) (at the 95% confidence interval). This accounts for 16.73% of the total area of forest cover in 1991, which is based on the error-adjusted estimator of area. The trend in the forest disturbance area increased from 1991 to 1995 and then continued downward. The forest disturbance area across the China-Laos border is closely related to global rubber prices as well as the policies and economies of the two countries and cooperation between China and Laos. Compared to Laos, the percentage of disturbed forest area is higher within China, except for some individual years (e.g., 1998-1999, 2004-2005, 2009 and 2016). The average annual disturbed forest area is 98.44 km(2) (0.76%) within China and 69.49 km(2) (0.53%) within Laos. Large disturbed patches are much more common within China than within Laos. This study highlights the merit of using dense Landsat time series for mapping the human-induced processes of forest disturbance in tropical areas, and the role of economic globalization and regional geopolitics in cross-border forest management.

TI  - Outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 linked to raw drinking milk resolved by rapid application of advanced pathogen characterisation methods, England, August to October 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coil (STEC) O157:H7 occurred on the Isle of Wight between August and October 2017. Of the seven cases linked to the outbreak, five were identified through the statutory notification process and two were identified through national surveillance of whole genome sequencing data. Enhanced surveillance questionnaires established a common link to a farm, and link to the likely food vehicle, raw drinking milk (RDM). Microbiological investigations, including PCR, identified the presence of STEC O157:H7 in samples of RDM. Analysis of core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of STEC O157:H7 from human stool specimens, animal faecal samples and RDM demonstrated a one SNP difference between isolates, and therefore close genetic relatedness. Control measures that were put in place included suspension of sales and recall of RDM, as well as restrictions on public access to parts of the farm. Successful integration of traditional epidemiological surveillance and advanced laboratory methods for the detection and characterisation of STEC O157:H7 from human, animal and environmental samples enabled prompt identification of the outbreak vehicle and provided evidence to support the outbreak control team's decision-making, leading to implementation of effective control measures in a timely manner.

TI  - Analysis of remote sensing time-series data to foster ecosystem sustainability: use of temporal information entropy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed time-series data have provided valuable information and sound foundations for ecological sustainability studies. Ecosystem sustainability has been viewed as a dynamic process that requires an ecosystem to deal with climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Following this school of thought, ecosystem sustainability can be portrayed in terms of order and disorder using spatio-temporal analysis of entropy-related indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series. Information theory and entropy-related measures have provided insights for complex systems analysis and have high relevance in ecology; however, less attention has been focused on temporal evolution and dynamics. The overall aim of this study is to propose an index called 'temporal information entropy' (H-t), and it is an entropy-related index able to describe the degree of order and regularity within a time-series of observations. We then assess H-t's ability to measure the ecosystem sustainability of Yanhe watershed based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI time-series. Our results indicate that temporal information entropy of ecological time-series data may be used as a natural indicator with respect to sustainability, and in some degree, it helps us to get a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics from a physical-based standpoint.

TI  - A regularised model-based pan-sharpening method for remote sensing images with local dissimilarities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining the spectral information of a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image and the spatial information of a high-resolution panchromatic (HRP) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image has become an important and interesting issue. Local dissimilarities between the LRMS image and the HRP image affect the performance of the pan-sharpening technique. This paper presents a model-based pan-sharpening method with global and nonlocal spatial similarity regularisers to reduce the effects of the local dissimilarities. The degraded model relating the LRMS image to the unknown HRMS image is employed as the data-fitting term to keep spectral fidelity. Two spatial similarity constraints are utilized to further enhance the spatial resolution of the unknown HRMS image. The first regularisation term is under the assumption that the high-pass component of each HRMS band has the similar geometry structure with the adjusted high-pass component of the HRP image. A modulation matrix is constructed to reduce the contrast differences. Moreover, nonlocal self-similarity characteristic of the high-pass component extracted from each HRMS band is considered as another regulariser, which is an effective structural prior to improve the local spatial quality of the HRMS image. The weights of nonlocal similarity model are learned from the high-pass component of available HRP image. Experiments conducted on QuickBird and IKONOS data validate that the proposed pan-sharpening method can achieve better performance compared with several traditional and state-of-the-art pan-sharpening algorithms in terms of quantitative evaluation and visual analysis.

TI  - An automatic shadow detection method for high-resolution remote sensing imagery based on polynomial fitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most existing shadow detection models and algorithms require extensive calculations and have difficulties effectively removing features, such as water bodies, some dark objects and bluish ground objects. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution automatic shadow extraction algorithm based on the process of histogram fitting. First, the histogram of the whole image is fitted by fourth and fifth-degree polynomials according to the histogram difference of the near-infrared bands of different shadow areas in the remotely sensed image. Second, the shadow area is preliminarily extracted based on the relationships between the shadow features of the remote sensing image and the intersections of the fourth- and fifth-degree polynomials. Then, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) is applied to extract the water bodies. Finally, to obtain the shaded area, the scanning line seed filling algorithm is applied to remove the water bodies falsely detected as shadows in the preliminary shading extraction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by using the various high-resolution images including GaoFen-1 (GF-1), GaoFen-2 (GF-2), QuickBird2, and ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3), as well as an elaborate comparison to histogram threshold segmentation algorithms such as Component 3 (C3) algorithm, multi-elements extraction algorithm multi-band detection algorithm, and spectral correlation algorithm based on spectral features. The results of experiment showed that the proposed algorithm could extract the shadows of various images, achieve satisfied results, and completely remove water bodies.

TI  - A new method for estimating of evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture from optical and thermal infrared measurements: the simplified triangle
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) provides a promising approach towards deriving accurate spatiotemporal estimates of key parameters characterizing land surface interactions, such as latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes as well as soil moisture content. This paper proposes a very simple method to implement, yet reliable to calculate evapotranspiration fraction (EF) and surface moisture availability (M-o) from remotely sensed imagery of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface radiometric temperature (T-ir). The method is unique in that it derives all of its information solely from these two images. As such, it does not depend on knowing ancillary surface or atmospheric parameters, nor does it require the use of a land surface model. The procedure for computing spatiotemporal estimates of these important land surface parameters is outlined herein stepwise for practical application by the user. Moreover, as the newly developed scheme is not tied to any particular sensor, it can also be implemented with technologically advanced EO sensors launched recently or planned to be launched such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel 3. The latter offers a number of key advantages in terms of future implementation of the method and wider use for research and practical applications alike.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to describe the characteristics of infections with Staphylococcus aureus with reduced vancomycin susceptibility (SARVS) including vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) in South Korea, using data from the national sentinel surveillance system during 2014-2016. A total of 66 patients infected or colonized with SA-RVS were reported using the sentinel surveillance system. Among them, VISA was confirmed in 14 isolates (21.2%) and no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) was detected. Most of patients had any kind of indwelling devices (81.8%, 54/66) and underwent surgical procedures in the previous 6 months (84.8%, 56/66). Patients who admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in the previous 3 months were 68.2% (45/66). Furthermore, patients who used vancomycin or had MRSA in the previous 1 month were 54.5% (36/66) and 59.1% (39/66), respectively. Upon review of the medical records, 54.5% (36/66) of patients were classified as having SA-RVS associated infection and 30-day mortality was 19.4% (7/36). Our findings revealed that there was no VRSA in South Korea. SA-RVS including VISA existed particularly in patients who had indwelling devices, history of surgical procedure, and history of ICU admission.

Here, we used multispectral satellite and aircraft data to evaluate the relationship between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) infestation in commercial winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields in Kansas, USA. We used visible and near-infrared data from each aerial platform to develop a series of NDVI maps for multiple fields for most of the winter wheat growing season. Hessian fly infestation in each field was surveyed in a uniform grid of multiple sampling points. For both satellite and aircraft data, NDVI decreased with increasing pest infestation. Despite the coarse resolution, NDVI from satellite data performed substantially better in explaining pest infestation in the fields than NDVI from high-resolution aircraft data. These results indicate that remote sensing data can be used to assess the areas of poor growth and health of wheat plants due to Hessian fly infestation. Our study suggests that remotely sensed data, including those from satellites orbiting >700 km from the surface of Earth, can offer valuable information on the occurrence and severity of pest infestations in agricultural areas.

TI  - Framing the neoliberal canon: resisting the market myth via literary enquiry
T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is widespread recognition that neoliberal rhetoric about 'free markets' stands in considerable tension with 'really existing' neoliberalizing processes. However, the oft-utilized analytical distinction between 'pure' economic and political theory and 'messy' empirical developments takes for granted that neoliberalism, at its core, valorizes free markets. In contrast, the paper explores whether neoliberal intellectuals ever made such an argument. Using Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman as exemplars, our reading of canonical neoliberal texts focuses on author framing gestures, particular understandings of the term 'science', techniques of characterization, and constructions of epistemological legitimacy. This enables us to avoid the trap of assuming that these texts are about free markets and instead enquires into their constitution as literary artefacts. As such, we argue that the remaking of states and households rather than the promotion of free markets is at the core of neoliberalism. Our analysis has significant implications. For example, it means that authoritarian neoliberalism is not a departure from but actually more in line with the 'pure' neoliberal canon than in the past. Therefore, neoliberalism ought to be critiqued not for its rhetorical promotion of free markets but instead for seeking to reorganize societies in coercive, non-democratic and unequal ways. This also enables us to acknowledge that households are central to resistance to neoliberalism as well as to the neoliberal worldview itself.

TI  - Exploring a combined multispectral multitemporal approach as an effective method to retrieve cloudless multispectral imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of satellite information has improved Earth observation applications globally. However, primary satellite information is not as immediate as desirable. Indeed, besides the geometric and atmospheric limitations, clouds, cloud shadows, and haze generally contaminate optical imagery. Actually, such a contamination is intended as missing information and should be replaced. However, because the most common cloud masking algorithms take advantage by employing thermal images, here the objective is to provide an alternative algorithm suitable for multispectral imagery only. In addition, the work combines a multispectral/multitemporal approach as an effective method to retrieve daytime cloudless and shadow-free optical imagery. Experiment is undertaken upon mid-to low-spatial resolution data from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI, each for a different scene. A multitemporal stack, for the same image scene, is employed to retrieve a composite uncontaminated image over 1 year. The approach relies on a clouds and cloud shadows masking step, based on spectral features, a bandby- band multitemporal effect adjustment to avoid significant seasonal variations, and a data reconstruction phase based on automatic selection of the most suitable pixels from the stack. Results have been compared with a recognized masking algorithm approach and tested with uncontaminated image samples for the same scene. Accuracy and spectral features of the results provide high consistency. (c) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Vegetation Responses to 2012-2016 Drought in Northern and Southern California
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The prolonged 2012-2016 California drought has raised many issues including concerns over reduced vegetation health. Drought impacts are complicated by geographical differences in hydroclimatic variability due to a climatic dipole influenced by the Pacific. Analysis of MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index from 2000 to 2018 reveals differences in drought and vegetation responses in Northern versus Southern California (NorCal vs SoCal, see definition in section ). The greatest declines in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were focused in the SoCal, while NorCal appears not severely affected thus far. It appears that both the strength of drought and the sensitivity of the vegetation to drought are larger in SoCal. The exacerbated aridity in SoCal is a trend extending throughout the past and present century. The spatial differences in hydroclimatology and vegetation responses are important considerations for statewide climate change adaptation-with SoCal potentially facing greater challenges.

TI  - A simple assessment approach for winter wheat loss risk impacted by water stress
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - In this study, an empirical assessment approach for the risk of crop loss due to water stress was developed and used to evaluate the risk of winter wheat loss in China, the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. We combined statistical and remote sensing data on crop yields with climate data and cropland distribution to model the effect of water stress from 1982 to 2011. The average value of winter wheat loss due to water stress for the three European countries was about -931 kg/ha, which was higher than that in China (-570 kg/ha) and the United States (-367 kg/ha). Our study has important implications for the operational assessment of crop loss risk at a country or regional scale. Future studies should focus on using higher spatial resolution remote sensing data, combining actual evapotranspiration to estimate water stress, improving the method for downscaling of statistical crop yield data and establishing more sophisticated zoning methods.

TI  - Combined use of satellite and surface observations to study aerosol optical depth in different regions of China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of essential atmosphere parameters for climate change assessment as well as for total ecological situation study. This study presents long-term data (2000-2017) on time-space distribution and trends in AOD over various ecological regions of China, received from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (combined Dark Target and Deep Blue) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), based on satellite Terra. Ground-based stations Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) were used to validate the data obtained. AOD data, obtained from two spectroradiometers, demonstrate the significant positive correlation relationships (r= 0.747), indicating that 55% of all data illustrate relationship among the parameters under study. Comparison of results, obtained with MODIS/MISR Terra and AERONET, demonstrate high relation (r= 0.869 - 0.905), while over 60% of the entire sampling fall within the range of the expected tolerance, established by MODIS and MISR over earth (+/- 0.05 +/- 0.15 x AOD(AERONET) and 0.05 +/- 0.2 x AOD(AERONET)) with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.097-0.302 and 0.067-0.149, as well as low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.068-0.18 and 0.067-0.149, respectively. The MODIS search results were overestimated for AERONET stations with an average overestimation ranging from 14 to 17%, while there was an underestimate of the search results using MISR from 8 to 22%.

TI  - Theia Snow collection: high-resolution operational snow cover maps from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Theia Snow collection routinely provides high-resolution maps of the snow-covered area from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations. The collection covers selected areas worldwide, including the main mountain regions in western Europe (e.g. Alps, Pyrenees) and the High Atlas in Morocco. Each product of the Theia Snow collection contains four classes: snow, no snow, cloud and no data. We present the algorithm to generate the snow products and provide an evaluation of the accuracy of Sentinel-2 snow products using in situ snow depth measurements, higher-resolution snow maps and visual control. The results suggest that the snow is accurately detected in the Theia snow collection and that the snow detection is more accurate than the Sen2Cor outputs (ESA level 2 product). An issue that should be addressed in a future release is the occurrence of false snow detection in some large clouds.

TI  - Remotely sensing harmful algal blooms in the Red Sea
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are of global concern, as their presence is often associated with socio-economic and environmental issues including impacts on public health, aqua-culture and fisheries. Therefore, monitoring the occurrence and succession of HABs is fundamental for managing coastal regions around the world. Yet, due to the lack of adequate in situ measurements, the detection of HABs in coastal marine ecosystems remains challenging. Sensors on-board satellite platforms have sampled the Earth synoptically for decades, offering an alternative, cost-effective approach to routinely detect and monitor phytoplankton. The Red Sea, a large marine ecosystem characterised by extensive coral reefs, high levels of biodiversity and endemism, and a growing aquaculture industry, is one such region where knowledge of HABs is limited. Here, using high-resolution satellite remote sensing observations (1km, MODIS-Aqua) and a second-order derivative approach, in conjunction with available in situ datasets, we investigate for the first time the capability of a remote sensing model to detect and monitor HABs in the Red Sea. The model is able to successfully detect and generate maps of HABs associated with different phytoplankton functional types, matching concurrent in situ data remarkably well. We also acknowledge the limitations of using a remote-sensing based approach and show that regardless of a HAB's spatial coverage, the model is only capable of detecting the presence of a HAB when the Chl-a concentrations exceed a minimum value of similar to 1 mg m(-3). Despite the difficulties in detecting HABs at lower concentrations, and identifying species toxicity levels (only possible through in situ measurements), the proposed method has the potential to map the reported spatial distribution of several HAB species over the last two decades. Such information is essential for the regional economy (i.e., aquaculture, fisheries & tourism), and will support the management and sustainability of the Red Sea's coastal economic zone.

TI  - VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Products Over Land: Extending the EOS Long-Term Aerosol Data Records
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A primary goal of the Deep Blue (DB) project is to create consistent long-term aerosol data records, suitable for climate studies, using multiple satellite instruments. In order to continue Earth Observing System (EOS)-era aerosol products into the Joint Polar Satellite System era, we have successfully ported the DB algorithm to process data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Although the basic structure of the VIIRS algorithm is similar to that for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), many enhancements have been made compared to the MODIS collection 6 (C6) version. Most have also been implemented in the latest MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1). For example, a new smoke mask was developed based on the spectral curvature of measured reflectance to distinguish biomass burning smoke from weakly absorbing urban/industrial aerosols. Consequently, a new aerosol-type flag was added into the VIIRS DB data set. In addition, new dust models have been developed to account for the nonsphericity of mineral dust. As a result, a discontinuity in the retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) of Saharan dust plumes seen in MODIS C6 products near the boundary between North Africa and the Atlantic has been much reduced. We have also evaluated the VIIRS and MODIS Terra/Aqua C6.1 AOD against Aerosol Robotic Network data. VIIRS and MODIS retrievals show similar performance; around 80% of matchups agree with Aerosol Robotic Network within the expected error of +/-(0.05 + 20)%, indicating that DB can provide consistent AOD through the historical EOS and present Joint Polar Satellite System eras.

TI  - Step-wise Land-class Elimination Approach for extracting mixed-type built-up areas of Kolkata megacity
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of urban built-up areas is an important aspect of urban planning and understanding the complex drivers and biophysical mechanism of urban climate processes. However, built-up area extraction using Landsat data is a challenging task due to spatio-temporal dynamics and spatially intermixed nature of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) in the cities of the developing countries, particularly in tropics. In the light of advantages and drawbacks of the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Built-up Area Extraction Method (BAEM), a new and simple method i.e. Step-wise Land-class Elimination Approach (SLEA) is proposed for rapid and accurate mapping of urban built-up areas without depending exclusively on the band specific normalized indices, in order to pursue a more generalized approach. It combines the use of a single band layer, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image and another binary image obtained through Logit model. Based on the spectral designation of the satellite image in use, a particular band is chosen for identification of water pixels. The Double-window Flexible Pace Search (DFPS) approach is employed for finding the optimum threshold value that segments the selected band image into water and non-water categories. The water pixels are then eliminated from the original image. The vegetation pixels are similarly identified using the NDVI image and eliminated. The residual pixels left after elimination of water and vegetation categories belong either to the built-up areas or to bare land categories. Logit model is used for separation of the built-up areas from bare lands. The effectiveness of this method was tested through the mapping of built-up areas of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India from Thematic Mapper (TM) images of 2000, 2005 and 2010, and Operational Land Imager (OLI) image of 2015. Results of the proposed SLEA were 95.33% accurate on the whole, while those derived by the NDBI and BAEM approaches returned an overall accuracy of 83.67% and 89.33%, respectively. Comparisons of the results obtained using this method with those obtained from NDBI and BAEM approaches demonstrate that the proposed approach is quite reliable. The SLEA generates new patterns of evidence and hypotheses for built-up areas extraction research, providing an integral link with statistical science and encouraging trans-disciplinary collaborations to build robust knowledge and problem solving capacity in urban areas. It also brings landscape architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape and ecological engineering, and other practice-oriented fields to bear together in processes for identifying problems and analyzing, synthesizng, and evaluating desirable alternatives for urban change. This method produced very accurate results in a more efficient manner compared to the earlier built-up area extraction approaches for the landscape and urban planning.

TI  - Establishment and Verification of a Bagged-Trees-Based Model for Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis for Early Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Lymph node metastasis is a multifactorial event. Several scholars have developed nomograph models to predict the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) metastasis before operation. According to the clinical and pathological characteristics of breast cancer patients, we use the new method to establish a more comprehensive model and add some new factors which have never been analyzed in the world and explored the prospect of its clinical application.Materials and methods: The clinicopathological data of 633 patients with breast cancer who underwent SLN examination from January 2011 to December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Because of the imbalance in data, we used smote algorithm to oversample the data to increase the balanced amount of data. Our study for the first time included the shape of the tumor and breast gland content. The location of the tumor was analyzed by the vector combining quadrant method, at the same time we use the method of simply using quadrant or vector for comparing. We also compared the predictive ability of building models through logistic regression and Bagged-Tree algorithm. The Bagged-Tree algorithm was used to categorize samples. The SMOTE-Bagged Tree algorithm and 5-fold cross-validation was used to established the prediction model. The clinical application value of the model in early breast cancer patients was evaluated by confusion matrix and the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).Results: Our predictive model included 12 variables as follows: age, body mass index (BMI), quadrant, clock direction, the distance of tumor from the nipple, morphology of tumor molybdenum target, glandular content, tumor size, ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67. Finally, our model obtained the AUC value of 0.801 and the accuracy of 70.3%.We used logistic regression to established the model, in the modeling and validation groups, the area under the curve (AUC) were 0.660 and 0.580.We used the vector combining quadrant method to analyze the original location of the tumor, which is more precise than simply using vector or quadrant (AUC 0.801 vs. 0.791 vs. 0.701, Accuracy 70.3 vs. 70.3 vs. 63.6%).Conclusions: Our model is more reliable and stable to assist doctors predict the SLN metastasis in breast cancer patients before operation.

TI  - Hospital-acquired influenza in an Australian tertiary Centre 2017: a surveillance based study
T2  - BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2017, Australia experienced its highest levels of influenza virus activity since the 2009 pandemic. This allowed detailed comparison of the characteristics of patients with community and hospital-acquired influenza, and infection control factors that contributed to influenza spread.Methods: A surveillance based study was conducted on hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza at the Canberra Hospital during April-October 2017. Differences between the hospital-acquired and community-acquired patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed by univariate analysis. Epidemiologic curves were developed and cluster distribution within the hospital was determined.Results: Two hundred and ninety-two patients were included in the study. Twenty-eight (9.6%) acquired influenza in hospital, representing a higher proportion than any of the previous 5 years (range 0.9-5.8%). These patients were more likely to have influenza A (p = 0.021), had higher rates of diabetes (p = 0.015), malignancy (p = 0.046) and chronic liver disease (p = 0.043). Patients acquiring influenza in hospital met clinical criteria for influenza like illness in 25% of cases, compared with 64.4% for community-acquired cases (p < 0.001). Hospital-acquired influenza cases occurred in two distinct clusters. Patients were moved an average of 5 times after diagnosis. Mean length of stay following diagnosis was 13 days compared to 5 days for community-acquired cases (p < 0.001). Of the patients with hospital-acquired influenza, 22 were in shared rooms during their incubation period and 9 were not isolated in single rooms following diagnosis. Treatment was initiated within the recommended 48 h period following symptom onset for 62.5% of hospital-acquired cases compared with 39.8% of community-acquired cases (p = 0.033).Conclusions: Our results show that clinical presentation differed between patients with hospital-acquired influenza compared with those who acquired influenza in the community. Cases occurred in two clusters suggesting intra-hospital transmission rather than random importation from the community, highlighting the importance of infection control measures to limit influenza spread. Patients with hospital-acquired influenza may present without classical features of an influenza-like illness and this should promote earlier diagnostic testing and isolation to limit spread. Movement of patients after diagnosis is likely to facilitate spread within the hospital.

TI  - Characteristics of Summer Season Raindrop Size Distribution in Three Typical Regions of Western Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Raindrop size distribution (DSD) measurements were taken with an onboard OTT Particle Size Velocity (Parsivel) disdrometer over the western Pacific during a marine survey from June to July 2014. Three subregions named south western Pacific (SWP), west western Pacific, and north western Pacific were separated for a comparative study of the variability of DSD. In addition to disdrometer data, FengYun-2E, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Final Analysis, and radiosonde data sets are used to illustrate the dynamical and microphysical characteristics associated with summer season rainfall of western Pacific. The DSD characteristics of six different rain rates and two rain types (convective and stratiform) were studied. Histograms of normalized intercept parameter log(10)(N-w) and mass-weighted mean diameter D-m indicated largest log(10)(N-w) values in west western Pacific, while largest D-m values in south western Pacific, and the convective clusters in three regions could be identified between maritime like and continental like. The constrained relations between shape mu and slope Lambda, N-w, and D-m of gamma DSDs are derived. An inverse relation of the coefficients and exponents of Z-AR(b) for convective rain were found in three regions. The R (Z(H), Z(DR)) estimator is proved to be more accurate than Z-R relation algorithm. And the empirical relations between D-m and radar reflectivity factor in the Ku and Ka bands are also derived to improve the rainfall retrieval algorithms in the open sea of Pacific. Furthermore, the possible causative mechanisms for the significant DSD variability in three regions were investigated with respect to convective intensity, raindrop evaporation, and other meteorological variables.

TI  - Estimation of emissions from biomass burning in China (2003-2017) based on MODIS fire radiative energy data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning plays a significant role in air pollution and climate change. In this study, we used a method based on fire radiative energy (FRE) to develop a biomass burning emission inventory for China from 2003 to 2017. Daily fire radiative power (FRP) data derived from 1 km MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MOD14/MYD14) were used to calculate FRE and combusted biomass. Available emission factors were assigned to four biomass burning types: forest, cropland, grassland, and shrubland fires. The farming system and crop types in different temperate zones were taken into account in this research. Compared with traditional methods, the FRE method was found to provide a more reasonable estimate of emissions from small fires. The estimated average annual emission ranges, with a 90% confidence interval, were 91.4 (72.7-108.8) TgCO(2) yr(-1), 5.0 (2.3-7.8) TgCO yr(-1), 0.24 (0.05-0.48) TgCH(4) yr(-1), 1.43 (0.53-2.35) TgNMHC yr(-1), 0.23 (0.05-0.45) TgNO(x) yr(-1), 0.09 (0.02-0.17) TgNH(3) yr(-1), 0.03 (0.01-0.05) Tg SO2 yr(-1), 0.04 (0.01-0.08) Tg BC yr(-1), 0.27 (0.07-0.49) TgOC yr(-1), 0.51 (0.19-0.84) TgPM(2.5) yr(-1), 0.57 (0.15-1.05) Tg PM10 yr(-1), where NMHC, BC, and OC are nonmethane hydrocarbons, black carbon, and organic carbon, respectively. Forest fires are determined to be the primary contributor to open fire emissions, accounting for 45% of the total CO2 emissions (average 40.8 Tg yr(-1)). Crop residue burning ranked second place with a large portion of 39% (average 35.3 Tg yr(-1)). During the study period, emissions from forest and grassland fires showed a significant downward trend. Crop residue emissions continued to rise during 2003-2015 but dropped by 42% in 2015-2016. Emissions from shrubland were negligible and little changed. Forest and grassland fires are concentrated in northeastern China and southern China, especially in the dry season (from October to March of the following year). Plain areas with high crop yields, such as the North China Plain, experienced high agricultural fire emissions in harvest seasons. Most shrubland fires were located in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces. The resolution of our inventory (daily, 1 km) is much higher than previous inventories, such as GFED4s and GFASv1.0. It could be used in global and regional air quality modeling.

TI  - 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay Could Not Predict Benefit of Post-mastectomy Radiotherapy in T1-2 N1mic ER-Positive HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: It is still controversial whether post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) is necessary for women with T1-2 N1mic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay has been validated in T1-2 N1 breast cancer to be prognostic of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and overall survival (OS). This study aims to evaluate the predict value of 21-gene recurrence score assay for the benefit of PMRT in T1-2 N1mic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer.Methods: A population-based cohort study was performed on women with T1-2 N1mic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer who underwent mastectomy and were evaluated using the 21-gene RS in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry between 2004 and 2015. Clinical characteristics as well as OS and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were compared between patients with and without PMRT in patients with a Low-, Intermediate-, and High-RS. Multivariate COX regression analysis was performed to investigate if the 21-gene RS assay could predict benefit of PMRT in this group of breast cancer patients.Results: A total of 1571 patients met the criteria of our study and were enrolled, including 970 patients in the Low-Risk group (score <18), 508 in the Intermediate-Risk group (score 18-30), and 93 patients in the High-Risk group (score >30). In the High-Risk group, there were more patients with age >= 50 (87.0 vs. 64.3%, P = 0.040) and received chemotherapy with a borderline significance (91.3 vs. 72.9%, P = 0.066) in the PMRT subgroup than in the no PMRT subgroup. In all three groups, OS was comparable between the PMRT subgroup and the no PMRT subgroup. Furthermore, multivariate analysis did not show any OS benefit for PMRT based on the 21-gene recurrence score.Conclusion: This study showed that the 21-gene RS assay was not able to predict the benefit of PMRT for OS in women with T1-2 N1 mic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. However, further prospective larger sample-size trials are warranted to determine if a benefit exists.

TI  - Estimation of latent heat flux using satellite land surface temperature and a variational data assimilation scheme over a eucalypt forest savanna in Northern Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the performance of the combined-source variational data assimilation scheme (CS-VDA) is assessed in detail using in situ heat fluxes (i.e. sensible heat (H) and latent heat (LE)) collected at a Eucalypt forest savanna of Northern Australia (Howard Springs). The CS VDA scheme estimates surface turbulent heat fluxes via assimilation of sequences of land surface temperature (LST) and meteorological data into a surface energy balance model and a dynamic model, The main objectives of this paper were to extend previous studies to a semi-arid ecosystem and to evaluate the potential of using global meteorological forcing data (GMD) to drive the CS VDA model (rather than in-situ meteorological observations). In order to study the new errors associated with the use of GMD, the effects on LE of the uncertainty in air temperature and wind speed (the two key meteorological factors that controls the total estimation error) was quantitatively characterized. Using hourly in-situ measurements as inputs, the daily-averaged LE RMSE(daily )was 54 W/m(2), which agrees with the errors previously reported in the literature. As expected, replacing local meteorological data with GMD reduces the performance of the LE estimation (GMA: RMSEdaily = 82 W/m(2), GLDAS: RMSEdaily = 151 W/m(2)). However, LE RMSE values at 8-day temporal scale for GMA are RMSE8-days = 32 W/m(2), similar to those reported in this area for other models (MODIS (MOD16A2) and Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS)). The error propagation analysis indicate that the CS VDA model is very sensitive to uncertainties in wind speed measurements. Moreover, there are large discrepancies between in situ and GMD wind speed. These two factors combined can explain the degradation in LE estimations. In this context, our study is a first step towards the characterization of an operational daily LE estimation scheme using hourly LST observations.

TI  - Remote sensing for vegetation monitoring in carbon capture storage regions: A review
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an emerging climate change mitigation technology which prevents carbon dioxide (CO2) from entering the atmosphere, so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental monitoring in CCS sites is critical for ensuring that any CO2 leakage and its effect on biota, especially vegetation, is detectable. It also plays an important role in creating a social license to operate and assuring the general public that the mechanisms for leak detection and remediation are in place. This review overviews current remote sensing technologies for vegetation monitoring of CCS sites/regions (with a focus on rangelands and pastures), including medium-to-high resolution satellite, aerial (both manned and unmanned aircrafts) and in situ sensors and methods. Our literature survey has pointed out that remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral sensors, can accurately detect CO2 leakage derived effects on vegetation. It can compensate the two main drawbacks of operational systems for detecting these effects over large areas. One is the areas affected tend to be relatively small (1-15 m); and the other is symptoms in vegetation tissues tend to be similar to other stresses, such as nutrient or water deficiency. With this in mind, we have recommend that a comprehensive system should be put in place. It integrates continuous monitoring with ad-hoc detection to assess vegetation conditions in a planned CCS site. Site-based pheonocams and area-based medium-resolution satellite remote sensing sources can be used to compare any given point in time (e.g. the injection point) with the condition at the same location in the past. Before an injection commences, a baseline assessment should be conducted using the combination of high resolution aerial hyperspectral imaging and medium-resolution long-term data from Landsat sensors. Further acquisition of high-resolution aerial imagery (ideally hyperspectral) is particularly useful following specific detected CO2 leaking events. Aiming at bridging the gaps between research, development and implementation of CCS, this review will contribute to environmental and social impacts of sustainable energy policies, including climate change mitigation and environmental pollution reduction.

TI  - Evaluating a new algorithm for satellite-based evapotranspiration for North American ecosystems: Model development and validation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a different operational approach to estimate 8-day average daily evapotranspiration (ET) using both routinely available data and the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation for canopy transpiration and evaporation of intercepted water and Priestley and Taylor for soil evaporation. Our algorithm considered the environmental constraints on canopy resistance and ET by (1) including vapor pressure deficit (VPD), incoming solar radiation, soil moisture, and temperature constraints on stomatal conductance; (2) using leaf area index (LAI) to scale from the leaf to canopy conductance; and (3) calculating canopy resistance as a function of environmental variables such as net radiation and VPD. Remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and satellite soil moisture data were used to derive the ET model. The algorithm was calibrated and evaluated using measured ET data from 20 AmeriFlux Eddy covariance flux sites for the period of 2003-2012. We found good agreements between our 8-day ET estimates and observations with mean absolute error (MAE) ranges from 0.17 mm/day to 0.94 mm/day compared with MAE ranging from 0.28 mm/day to 1.50 mm/day for MODIS ET. Compared to MODIS ET, our proposed algorithm has higher correlations and higher Willmott's index of agreement with observations for the majority of the Ameriflux sites. The strong relationship between the model estimated ET and the flux tower observations implies that our model has the potential to be applied to different ecosystems and at different temporal scales.

TI  - First report of Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:- in free-ranging striped dolphins (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>), Italy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2015 and the beginning of 2018 (January-March), 30 cetaceans were found stranded along the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy. Necropsies were performed in 22 cases and infectious diseases resulted the most common cause of death. Three striped dolphins, showed a severe coinfection involving the monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium (Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:-). The isolates were characterized based on antimicrobial resistance, Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat Analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). All isolates demonstrated the same multidrug resistant genotype (ASSuT isolates), showed three different MLVA profiles, two of which closely related, and were identified as Sequence Type 34. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis confirmed strong correlations between two out of the three isolates. To our knowledge, S. 1,4,[5],12:i:-, one of the most common serovars in cases of human infection and food sources worldwide, has not previously been described in marine mammals, and reports of Salmonella-associated disease in free-ranging cetaceans are rare. These results highlight the role of cetaceans as sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment, suggest a potential risk for cetaceans and public health along the North Western Italian coastline and indicate cetaceans as a novel potential reservoir for one of the most widespread Salmonella serovars.

TI  - Long-term variation of phytoplankton biomass and physiology in Taihu lake as observed via MODIS satellite
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of phytoplankton biomass (noted as phytoplankton carbon, C-phyto) and evaluation of phytoplankton physiology is central to the estimation of primary productivity and the carbon cycle. This issue has been widely considered in oceans but not in inland water. Here, we develop experiential and semi analytical models, which validated by independent in situ measurement data, respectively, to derive C-phyto and phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 675 nm (a(ph)(675)) from MODIS. The effects of nutrients and temperature on the seasonal variation of phytoplankton physiology were assessed through a novel proxy of C-phyto to a(ph)(675) ratio (C-phyto/a(ph)(675)) over the Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China. Significant seasonal climatological cycles of C-phyto, a(ph)(675) and C-phyto/a(ph)(675) were observed in Lake Taihu, especially in Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay, where algal blooms occur frequently. The highest C-phyto and a(ph)(675) values were observed in summer due to the growth of phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a concentration. Lower values were observed in winter and spring, which are characterized by relatively high total nitrogen levels and low irradiance, owing to the low temperature astricts the algae growth. However, the C-phyto/a(ph)(675) shows an opposite trend compared to C-phyto and a(ph)(675), which have high values in winter and low values in summer. The analysis of C-phyto, a(ph)(675) and C-phyto/aph(675) with total phosphorus (TP) levels and temperature indicates that TP are the main positive driver of the increase in C-phyto and a(ph)(675) and negatively regulate C-phyto/a(ph)(675). Warming promotes an increase in C-phyto and a(ph)(675) and restricts C-phyto/a(ph)(675) in summer. Biomass and nutrient levels are the primary drivers of the decrease of C-phyto/a(ph)(675) in such a typical eutrophic lake. The results present some new findings compared to previous oceanic studies and expand our knowledge in the study of phytoplankton biomass and physiology in eutrophic lakes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A new multi-sensor integrated index for drought monitoring
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most expensive but least understood natural disasters. Remote sensing based integrated drought indices have the potential to describe drought conditions comprehensively, and multi-criteria combination analysis is increasingly used to support drought assessment. However, conventional multi-criteria combination methods and most existing integrated drought indices fail to adequately represent spatial variability. An index that can be widely used for drought monitoring across all climate regions would be of great value for ecosystem management. To this end, we proposed a framework for generating a new integrated drought index applicable across diverse climate regions. In this new framework, a local ordered weighted averaging (OWA) model was used to combine the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) developed using the Vegetation Index based on Universal Pattern Decomposition method (VIUPD), the Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observation System (AMSR-E), and the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). This new index, which we call the "Geographically Independent Integrated Drought Index (GIIDI)," was validated in diverse climate divisions across the continental United States. Results showed that GIIDI was better correlated with in-situ PDSI, Z-index, SP1-1, SPI-3 and SPEI-6 (overall r-value = 0.701, 0.794, 0.811, 0.733, 0.628; RMSE = 1.979, 0.810, 0.729, 1.049 and 1.071, respectively) when compared to the Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI), Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI), PCI, TCI, SMCI, and VCI. GIIDI also performed well in most climate divisions for both short-term and long-term drought monitoring. Because of the superior performance of GIIDI across diverse temporal and spatial scales, GIIDI has considerable potential for improving our ability to monitor drought across a range of biomes and climates.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Employing an efficient and robust prediction system along with early warnings is useful to reduce the effects of devastating earthquakes. Thermal anomaly, as an earthquake precursory, is widely confirmed. In this study, to characterize the thermal anomalies within a 10-year specific observation interval of Land Surface Temperature (LST), satellite data products obtained from MODIS-Aqua (March 16th to May 16th, every year from 2004 to 2013) were analyzed using Robust Satellite Technique (RST) method. The Saravan earthquake (April 16th, 2013, M-w = 7.8, Iran) were used for validation phase, and the year 2012, as a relatively seismically unperturbed year (no earthquakes with M-w > 3.5 regarding target time and region), was taken for confutation phase. For the first time, to reduce the effects of the topography with respect to vegetation cover, using unsupervised classification, the study area was divided into the low and high elevation regions. The results of the present study showed the Significant Sequences of LST Anomalies (SSLAs) from several days before and immediately after the Saravan earthquake appeared in the north, south, and center of the study area. However, no anomalies were observed in a seismically unperturbed year (2012). Therefore, the results confirmed the existence of space-time thermal anomalies related to destructive earthquakes and revealed that the RST method is a reliable approach to detect disturbances of the Earth's thermal emission.

TI  - Arboviral diseases and malaria in Australia, 2014-15: Annual report of the National Arbovirus and Malaria Advisory Committee
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This report describes the epidemiology of mosquito-borne diseases of public health importance in Australia during the 2014-15 season (1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015) and includes data from human notifications, sentinel chicken, vector and virus surveillance programs. The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System received notifications for 12,849 cases of disease transmitted by mosquitoes during the 2014-15 season. The Australasian alphaviruses Barmah Forest virus and Ross River virus accounted for 83% (n=10,723) of notifications. However, over-diagnosis and possible false positive diagnostic test results for these two infections mean that the true burden of infection is likely overestimated, and as a consequence, revised case definitions were implemented from 1 January 2016. There were 151 notifications of imported chikungunya virus infection. There were 74 notifications of dengue virus infection acquired in Australia and 1,592 cases acquired overseas, with an additional 34 cases for which the place of acquisition was unknown. Imported cases of dengue were most frequently acquired in Indonesia (66%). There were 7 notifications of Zika virus infection. No cases of locally-acquired malaria were notified during the 2014-15 season, though there were 259 notifications of overseas-acquired malaria and one notification for which no information on the place of acquisition was supplied. Imported cases of malaria were most frequently acquired in southern and eastern Africa (23%) and Pacific Island countries (20%). In 2014-15, arbovirus and mosquito surveillance programs were conducted in most of the states and territories. Surveillance for exotic mosquitoes at international ports of entry continues to be a vital part of preventing the establishment of vectors of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue to new areas of Australia. In 2014-15, there was a sharp increase in the number of exotic mosquitoes detected at the Australian border, with 36 separate exotic mosquito detections made, representing a 280% increase from the 2013-14 period where there were 13 exotic mosquito detections.

TI  - Estimating monthly average temperature by remote sensing in China
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature is an important parameter affecting biosphere processes, air quality, regional climate, and human health, but is difficult to estimate, especially on a nationwide scale. Remote sensing provides high spatial resolution data that influence air temperature and can help overcome this problem in spatially heterogeneous environments. Generally, the simple linear relationships between air temperature, land surface temperature (LST), and auxiliary data, seldom consider the complex spatial variations in air temperature. The random forest (RF) regression model can characterize the complex temperature distribution by establishing the non-linear relationships among them. The main purpose of this paper is to present an RF regression method to estimate monthly average temperatures in China, using MODIS LST, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), night-time light, and a digital elevation model (DEM). Results based on cross-validation show that mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) at national level in different months ranged from 1.15 to 1.44 degrees C (mean +/- standard deviation: 1.30 +/- 0.10 degrees C) and from 1.57 to 1.99 degrees C (1.79 f 0.13 degrees C), respectively. Potential sources of error and uncertainty were analyzed and investigated. Results show that regression model performs better in eastern (MAE: 0.68 +/- 0.79 degrees C; RMSE: 0.75 +/- 0.81 degrees C) and central China (MAE: 0.68 +/- 0.41 degrees C; RMSE: 0.74 +/- 0.41 degrees C). The model performance was strongly dependent on elevation, slope, land cover, and satellite data quality. In addition, the percentage increase in mean squared error from RF regression model was used to quantify the importance of variables. Positive importance scores indicated an improvement in accuracy with the assistance of NDVI, night-time lights, and the DEM. LST, and more auxiliary data sources, when integrated into an RF regression model, may be ways in which to improve the modeling of air temperature variations in the future. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

TI  - Regional air quality impact of northern South America biomass burning emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning emissions have a substantial impact on regional air quality and climate. The region of Amazonia in South America has long been identified as one of the largest contributors to short lived pollutants globally. However, massive natural wildfires and agricultural burns also occur every year in the grassland plains of Northern South America during the dry season (November to April). The regional-scale air quality impact of these biomass burning emissions has not been studied in depth and is analyzed in this study. We used PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from three large urban areas: Bogota, Medellin, and Bucaramanga, for the period 2006-2016. Carbon monoxide data was only available for the city of Bogota for the analysis period. These cities are located hundreds of kilometers westward of the emission areas. The spatio-temporal distribution of fires was obtained from MODIS Active Fire Data. The back-trajectories of air masses reaching the receptor sites were computed with two different meteorological datasets. Radiosonde data, available only for Bogota, was used to account for local meteorological factors impacting pollution dispersion. A novel analysis algorithm was developed to combine active fire data with back-trajectory locations to select those active fires in the vicinity of the air masses arriving at each city. This analysis allows the selection of only those upwind fires that can be related to the air quality in the selected locations. We show that anomalously high PM and CO levels occurred when air masses originated from the Orinoco grasslands during the times when the largest number of fires in the region were active. The correlation between number of fires and PM10 concentration was found to decrease with increasing distance from the sources, ranging from 0.6 to 0.25. Our results are insensitive to the meteorological dataset used to generate back-trajectories. For Bogota it was found that mixing height variations can explain an important fraction of the observed seasonal variations in PM10, PM2.5, and CO concentration. The number of upwind fires can explain 11%+/- 5% of the seasonal variability in CO concentrations. Estimates of the seasonal variability of PM10 and PM2.5 explained by fires are 45%+/- 7% and 39%+/- 8% respectively. However, covariance between occurrence of fires and non-combustion local sources of PM imply that the latter estimates are likely an overestimation of the actual contribution. Our findings support the possibility that fires in the Orinoco river basin deteriorate air quality in highly populated urban centers hundreds of kilometers away from the sources.

TI  - Optimal satellite orbit configuration for global ocean color product coverage
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a methodology to evaluate the current orbital configuration of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership (SNPP) and NOAA-20 satellites and to study various orbital configurations for the next VIIRS in the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) series from the perspective of maximizing the global daily ocean color retrievals. We focus on the coverage losses due to high sensor-zenith angle and high sun glint contamination and find that two sensors cannot avoid gaps in daily coverage. If JPSS-2 shares the same orbit with SNPP and NOAA-20, then phase shift of around 90 degrees relative to SNPP and NOAA-20 would maximize daily ocean color retrievals.

TI  - Systematic preparation and processing of interferometric synthetic aperture radar data for monitoring linear transportation infrastructure
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a methodology for the systematic preparation and processing of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data for monitoring linear transportation infrastructure subject to geohazards. The methodology is applied to two RADARSAT-2 Spotlight synthetic aperture radar datasets, and three case studies in Cornwall, Eastern Ontario, Canada, are examined. An InSAR processing sequence was established and 19 SLA24 and 15 SLA74 images were used to create time-series deformation maps spanning from March 2015 to September 2016. The noise floors were +/- 1.5 and +/- 1.0 cm, for the SLA24 and SLA74 datasets, respectively. Phase unwrapping errors, atmospheric path delay, and the limited number of images were identified as the largest contributors to measurement uncertainty, which was of the same order as the ground deformation field. To improve coherence and utility of the radar images for monitoring the effects of geohazards on infrastructure, it is recommended that imagery acquisitions consider the use of small incidence angles with moderate image resolution and 6- to 12-day revisit periods.

TI  - Precursor effect of March 11, 2011 off the coast of Tohoku earthquake on high and low latitude ionospheres and its possible disturbing mechanism
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ionosphere disturbance which was seen prior to an earthquake which occurred on 11 March 2011 off the coast of Tohoku was studied. Ionosphere data which were used are: O+ density acquired with US satellite DMSP, and NmF2, h'F, and fmin obtained by ionosondes. Global Ionosphere Model (GIM) is used as side evidence to compliment findings from DMSP data and ground- based data.Although magnetic disturbance is strong during the earthquake preparation period, global survey of ground based NmF2 shows that special disturbance is limited to earthquake area. Satellite data (DMSP and GIM) analysis shows four important findings before the occurrence of the earthquake; (1) Over geomagnetic equator enhancement of O+ is found, (2) midlatitude trough (MLT) is formed before the earthquake and it moves toward lower latitude as EQ day approaches, (3) O+ enhancement at the equator side edge of the MLT, and (4) no clear difference of O+ behavior between east and west of the epicenter is identified. These four features are connected each other. Night time NmF2 at high latitude ionosonde stations such as Khabarovsk shows 2 days oscillation from 5 March and disappears on 12 March. As the latitude of the station is lower, 2 days oscillation becomes unclear, and the duration of the appearance is shorter.In order to explain both ground - based and satellite data consistently, enhanced east (west) ward dynamo electric field during daytime (nighttime) are proposed. Our speculation is that internal gravity waves of extremely small amplitude due to the ground motion interact with planetary scales waves below 10 km and is amplified. The amplified IGW propagates to the dynamo region, modifies the wind system, or conductivity, which modifies the electric field. Several observational facts which are favor to the generation of IGW are described. Finally, we stress the need of satellite constellation in order to obtain the global morphology of ionosphere disturbance and to identify the mechanism, which at least provides us the material to judge applicability to future earthquake prediction.

TI  - Seasonal and vertical distributions of aerosol type extinction coefficients with an emphasis on the impact of dust aerosol on the microphysical properties of cirrus over the Taklimakan Desert in Northwest China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the seasonal and vertical distributions of key aerosol types and its extinction coefficient (EC) are investigated with an emphasis on the impact of desert dust aerosols on the microphysical properties of cirrus. For this, we obtained near-simultaneous and collocated datasets retrieved from the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations), CloudSat, and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Taklimakan Desert (TMD) area situated in Northwest China during 2006-2011. We found that the main aerosol types prevalent over the TMD region are desert dust (DD), polluted dust (PD), and polluted continental/elevated smoke (PC/SE) which accounted for similar to 88.38%, similar to 10.81%, and similar to 0.47%, respectively. The DD type was the most dominant aerosol type during the total observational period due to the nature of the desert underlying surface, and the frequent dust activities occurred over the region. Further, the concentrations of PD and PC/SE were observed larger in winter compared to the other seasons contributing similar to 25.66% and 1.42%, respectively. This is likely attributed to increased burning of fossil fuels used for combustion processes in the cold season over Northwest China. On the other hand, the latitudinal distribution total aerosol loading of EC presented the south-to-north gradient with a declined tendency in all seasons due to enhanced amount of dust aerosols transported from the TMD area. Further, the seasonal mean values of total EC over TMD showed a maximum of 0.021 km(-1) appeared in spring, with a minimum (0.017 km(-1)) in autumn. In addition, we also investigated the impact of dust aerosols on the cirrus micro physical properties namely, ice water content (IWC), ice water path (IWP), ice cloud effective radius (IER), ice number concentration (INC), and ice distribution width (IDW). The results showed that dust aerosol can possibly change the microphysical properties of cirrus over the study domain.

TI  - Recent advancement on estimation of blue carbon biomass using satellite-based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - History revealed that people had been discharging a large proportion of carbon into the atmosphere through fossil fuel consumption and the marine environment. These have prompted atmospheric carbon fixations that have proved to be larger than at any other point throughout the human survival. Due to the critical role of blue carbon in the ocean carbon cycle, it is essential to pay extra attention to these habitats (mangrove, seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and coral reefs). Hence, this article reviews the recent developments in blue carbon biomass estimation using a geospatial approach and highlighted the blue carbon components achievements and gaps. Biomass and soil carbon estimation, using change detection analysis, were reviewed. Analysis of the carbon conversion factors, used in converting biomass to carbon, was demonstrated. The review shall act as support for the realization of the target 14.2 and 14.5 of the 14(th) sustainable development goal established by the United Nations, to fast track the achievement of the 2020 agenda.

TI  - Upsurge of Enterovirus D68 and Circulation of the New Subclade D3 and Subclade B3 in Beijing, China, 2016
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a surveillance among acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) cases to define the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and genetic variations of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in Beijing, China from 2015 to 2017. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected from 30 sentinel hospitals in Beijing and subjected to EV and EV-D68 detection by real-time PCR. The VP1 gene region and complete genome sequences of EV-D68 positive cases were analyzed. Of 21816 ARTI cases, 619 (2.84%) were EV positive and 42 cases were EV-D68 positive. The detection rates of EV-D68 were 0 (0/6644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7650) in 2017, respectively. Two peaks of EV-D68 infections occurred in late summer and early-winter. Ten cases (23.81%) with upper respiratory tract infection and 32 cases (76.19%) presented with pneumonia, including 3 cases with severe pneumonia. The phylogenetic analysis suggested 15 subclade D3 strains and 27 subclade B3 strains of EV-D68 were circulated in China from 2016 to 2017. A total of 52 amino acid polymorphisms were identified between subclades D1 and D3. These data suggest an upsurge of EV-D68 occurred in Beijing in 2016, the new subclade D3 emerged in 2016 and co-circulated with subclade B3 between 2016 and 2017.

TI  - Definition and measurement of tree cover: A comparative analysis of field-, lidar- and landsat-based tree cover estimations in the Sierra national forests, USA
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of mapping forest extent from satellite imagery largely depends on both semantic definition and estimation quality of tree cover at the pixel level. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of different tree cover data sets, derived from field sample, terrestrial and airborne lidar scans, and Landsat imagery, to investigate factors affecting tree cover estimation in a western mountainous conifer forest in the United States. We found that satellite-based tree cover maps, even those derived from the same sensor, tended to have lower agreements over sparsely vegetated areas, due to both definitional discrepancies and estimation errors in establishing tree cover. When compared with tree cover measurements from ground-based hemispherical photography and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), both airborne waveform lidar and discrete return lidar (DRL) provided consistently more accurate tree cover estimates (r(2) ranging from 0.61 to 0.91, RMSE approximate to 15% and bias < 5%) than three of the existing Landsat-based tree cover products ( r(2) ranging from 0.64 to 0.78, RMSE 20% and bias varying from 3% to 10%). The agreement between the two lidar-based tree cover data sets was high ( r(2) approximate to 0.8, RMSE approximate to 10% and bias < 5%), and their differences were mainly due to different definitions of tree cover (in particular, as to whether within-crown gaps were included or not). In contrast, there were only moderate agreements among the Landsat products ( r(2) = 0.66 (similar to)0.76, RMSE = 16% (similar to)30%, bias = 10%(similar to) 24%), caused by both definitional differences and estimation errors. Because of the capability to simultaneously derive tree cover and tree height at a high accuracy, and the increasing availability of lidar data, we recommend incorporating lidar data as a complement or an alternative to ultra-fine resolution images in training Landsat-class images (e.g. Sentinel-2AB) for more precise mapping of forest extent.

TI  - The 2016 Mw 6.0 Hutubi earthquake: A blind thrust event along the northern Tian Shan front Cheek
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tian Shan Range, which trends E-W along the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, is one of the longest and most active intracontinental orogenic belts in central Asia. On 8 December 2016 (05:15:04 UTC), a Mw 6.0 earthquake ruptured the northern Tian Shan front. Here, we use Sentinel-1 radar imagery to investigate the deformation and source parameters related to this event. The co-seismic surface deformation was predominated by uplift without surface rupture. Ascending and descending interferograms indicate that the event triggered small co-seismic deformations with maximum line-of-sight displacements of 22 mm and 24 mm, respectively. Although the north-dipping and south-dipping plane solutions can both fit the observations well, the north-dipping solution with a dip of 58 degrees is preferred in consideration of the relocated aftershocks and regional geological structure. Significant slip is located between depths of 12 km and 17 km, suggesting that the event was caused by a completely blind thrust fault. This blind rupture is characterized largely by a compact thrusting patch with a peak slip of 56 cm at a depth of 13 km. The source model generates a geodetic moment of 6.678 x 10(17) N m corresponding to a Mw 5.85 event. Both the interferometric synthetic aperture radar modeling and the aftershock locations indicate that the rupture plane is linked to the Huoerguosi-Manas-Tugulu fault at a depth of similar to 16 km, a typical locking depth in the Tian Shan. We suggest that the 2016 Hutubi earthquake more likely occurred on a back-thrust of the Huoerguosi-Manas-Tugulu fault, and the back-thrust is interpreted to represent a preexisting normal fault beneath the Qigu anticline belt that was tectonically inverted during the Cenozoic.

TI  - Use of remote sensing to predict the optimal harvest date of corn
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of optimal harvest date (OHD) is important to maximize the yield of corn as it approaches maturity. Yield loss occurs if harvest occurs in advance of, or is delayed past, OHD; both scenarios are undesirable. If corn is harvested prematurely, high residual moisture makes it prone to mildew during storage, which produces aflatoxin. The grain quality then deteriorates, leading to a serious decrease in yield. If corn is harvested too late, the crop quality declines severely. Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of three corn kernel indicators (kernel moisture, milk line, black layer) in predicting corn harvest date; however, these indicators do not satisfy the demand of modern agriculture. Therefore, in this study, remote sensing techniques, which have proven useful in the application of Precision Agriculture, were used for timely estimation of OHD for large-area crops. We proposed a new method for predicting corn OHD in fields using remote sensing by assessing corn kernel moisture (CKM) and identifying an effective biochemical indicator to relate OHD and remote sensing data. We estimated CKM using canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), a significant biochemical parameter that can be estimated from remote sensing images using PROSAIL, a popular used radiative transfer model. Since CKM decreases at a regular rate after entering the maturity period, OHD can be predicted based on the estimated CKM using a baseline assumption that OHD occurs when CKM drops to 30%. The prediction method was evaluated by analyzing measured CKM, and the temporal variation in one hundred-grain weight and yield. The results of this study enabled us to successfully and accurately estimate CKM using a non-linear model (R-2 = 0.92) and predict CKM (R-2 = 0.64) and corn OHD. This study provides new avenues for predicting crop OHD using remote sensing multispectral imagery and suggests that remote sensing techniques are effective for accurately predicting corn OHD across large areas.

TI  - Predicting soil organic carbon content in croplands using crop rotation and Fourier transform decomposed variables
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies on soil organic carbon content or stock mapping mostly use natural environmental covariates and do not consider the soil management practice factor. However, human activities have become an important influencing factor for soil organic carbon, especially for agricultural soils. Crop species/crop rotations and management practices significantly affect the amount and spatial variation of soil organic carbon in croplands, but have not been considered for mapping soil organic carbon. In this study, we used direct crop rotation information and variables generated using Fourier transform on HJ-1A/1B NDVI time series data to capture the periodic effect of crop rotation, and explored the effectiveness of incorporating such information in predicting topsoil organic carbon content in cropland. A case study applied such method in a largely agricultural area in Anhui province, China. Crop rotation information was obtained through field investigation. Various combinations of predictive environmental variables were experimented for mapping soil organic carbon. The results were validated using field samples. Results showed that the combination of natural environment variables with both crop rotation type and variables derived through Fourier transform yielded the highest accuracy. In addition, only using the Fourier decomposed variables and crop rotation information were able to achieve a similar accuracy with using only soil formative natural environmental variables. This indicates that crop rotation information has comparable predictive power of soil organic carbon as natural environment variables. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of including agricultural practice information in digital soil mapping in agricultural landscapes with differences in crop rotation.

TI  - Accuracy of swirl sign for predicting hematoma enlargement in intracerebral hemorrhage: a meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hematoma enlargement happens in about 30% patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, which is reported to be closely correlated with poor prognosis. Swirl sign has been reported to have correlation with hematoma enlargement. This meta-analysis analyzed the accuracy of swirl sign for predicting hematoma enlargement in intracerebral hemorrhage.Methods: Five databases were searched for potentially eligible literature. Studies were included if they were about the predictive properties of swirl sign for hematoma enlargement in intracerebral hemorrhage. Sensitivity and specificity of swirl sign for hematoma enlargement prediction were pooled. Pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were also calculated.Results: Six studies with 2647 patients were finally included in meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of swirl sign were 0.45 (95%CI 0.32-0.59) and 0.79 (95%Cl 0.73-0.84), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of swirl sign was 2.2 (95%CI 1.8-2.5). In contrast, the pooled negative likelihood ratio of swirl sign was 0.69 (95%CI 0.57-0.84).Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that swirl sign has the relatively high specificity for hematoma enlargement prediction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

TI  - High-resolution daily AOD estimated to full coverage using the random forest model approach in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an effective means of observing and detecting global aerosol distribution and changes over time, which impact human health and climate change. However, aerosol optical depth (AOD) always has low spatial coverage, which not only affects the analysis of AOD but also harms many relevant applications of the data, such as utilization to estimate PM2.5. In our study, we utilize the random forest model, which is an effective ensemble learning method, to estimate the gaps of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD data with a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees in a typical contaminated region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei during 2010-2016. Our model performs accurately in that the results of R-2 testing exceed 0.9 and the final estimated AOD coverage achieves 100%. The average value of the AOD is 0.44 (0.41-0.47 by year) over the study period. The simulation values of AOD have an obvious seasonal distribution, with the highest AOD in summer. The AOD estimations in the southern region are higher than those in the northern region. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD observations are compared with MODIS AOD (R-2 = 0.44) and AOD estimations (R-2 = 0.36). We analyze and screen each of the variables to compute their contributions. Specifically, the elevation and 2-m dew point are the most important in modeling the AOD, while road data, snowfall depth and snowfall have the least impact on modeling the AOD. Practical applications of AOD data include estimating the various impacts of PMPM2.5 concentrations on health based on the AOD observations in China's typically polluted areas that have cloud influence. We compare two measurement ranges that will most accurately model and fill the AOD data missing in areas. After careful consideration, we determine that our preferred range is 0-2.

TI  - Automated SWIR based empirical sun glint correction of Landsat 8-OLI data over coastal turbid water
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The optimal exploitation of the oceanic information provided by recent high spatial resolution sensors such as Landsat 8-OLI is strongly conditioned by the quality of the water reflectance signal retrieval. One main issue stands in the ability to correct water pixels for the contamination of the sun glint, which might induce a seasonal or permanent loss of data according to the latitude. The SWIR information now provided for the most recent high spatial resolution sensors was used for evaluating the sun glint level and correcting the radiative signal for its effect. This has been performed transposing historical empirical formalisms based on the NIR signal. An automated SWIR-based sun glint correction procedure was then developed using a 4-year OLI archive gathered over very turbid waters of French Guiana (227 scenes). This procedure allows the practical limitations associated with past similar empirical methods (sensitivity to water turbidity and manual image per image correction) to be overcome. While a satisfactory preservation of the information over sun glint free pixels was observed, comparison exercises based on in situ Rrs data gathered in sun glint affected areas emphasize the relevance of the proposed methodology (correction by a factor of 14 of the averaged bias in the Rrs values after removing sun glint effects). Current limitations in the applicability of this SWIR-based empirical automated method are mainly associated with the presence of high cloud coverage, thin clouds in the OLI scene or highly spatially variable marine or atmospheric signal (around 47%, 42% and 11%, respectively, of the total of 12% of failure over French Guiana OLI archive). The potential large applicability of the procedure developed in this work was eventually demonstrated over contrasted coastal environments.

TI  - Precision surgical approach with lymph-node dissection in early gastric cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The gravest prognostic factor in early gastric cancer is lymph-node metastasis, with an incidence of about 10% overall. About two-thirds of early gastric cancer patients can be diagnosed as node-negative prior to treatment based on clinic-pathological data. Thus, the tumor can be resected by endoscopic submucosal dissection. In the remaining third, surgical resection is necessary because of the possibility of nodal metastasis. Nevertheless, almost all patients can be cured by gastrectomy with D1+ lymph-node dissection. Laparoscopic or robotic gastrectomy has become widespread in East Asia because perioperative and oncological safety are similar to open surgery. However, after D1+ gastrectomy, functional symptoms may still result. Physicians must strive to minimize post-gastrectomy symptoms and optimize long-term quality of life after this operation. Depending on the location and size of the primary lesion, preservation of the pylorus or cardia should be considered. In addition, the extent of lymph-node dissection can be individualized, and significant gastric-volume preservation can be achieved if sentinel node biopsy is used to distinguish node-negative patients. Though the surgical treatment for early gastric cancer may be less radical than in the past, the operative method itself seems to be still in transition.

TI  - Unsupervised change detection of VHR remote sensing images based on multi-resolution Markov Random Field in wavelet domain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an unsupervised change detection method for very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images based on multi-resolution Markov random field (MRF) model in wavelet domain. Firstly, the wavelet transform is performed on the difference image achieved by the change vector analysis (CVA) method, and the wavelet coefficients at each scale are obtained. Then, MRF model is constructed based on the wavelet coefficients. The wavelet high-frequency coefficients establish a feature field model that describes the feature attributes of each pixel location at each scale. The initial change map (changed and unchanged) at the coarse scale are generated through applying the k-means method to the wavelet low-frequency coefficients, and a label field model describing the region of the variation results is established. The label and feature field, at the same scale, got the optimized change map under the Bayesian criterion. Finally, the results of the low-resolution scale change map are directly projected as the adjacent higher-scale initial change map. The more accurate change map is obtained successively from the coarse scale to the original resolution scale, and the detection result of the original resolution is obtained at last. Experiments on Quick Bird, SPOT-5, and IKONOS optical images have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the method has better regional consistency and strong robustness.

TI  - Modelling land cover changes in the tropical dry forest surrounding the Chamela-Cuixmala biosphere reserve, Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change is one of the main threats to biodiversity conservation in tropical landscapes and natural protected areas are particularly threatened because of the transformation occurring at their neighbouring environments. We analysed the 'land-cover' change (LCC) occurring in the areas surrounding the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve (CCBR) in the Pacific coast of Jalisco, Mexico, during the last 40 years (split in two periods, 1970-1993/94 and 1993/94-2011/12). Supervised classifications were generated by applying a multi-temporal approach on Landsat Thematic Mapper (1993/94) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre SPOT (2011/12) imagery. The base line (t(0)) consisted of an historical 1:50,000 scale map of land-use/land-cover (LULC) made in 1970. In addition to LCC predictions for the next four decades, this study generated a variety of indicators identifying the location and intensity of LCC occurring in the CCBR's surrounding landscapes. The main vegetation formations, tropical dry forest (TDF), and semi-deciduous tropical forest (SDTF), decreased in area 25% and 50%, respectively, during the 1970-1993/94 period. However, annual rates of change (ARC) showed a deacceleration in the reduction of main vegetation formations, for the period 1993/94-2011/12. This study generated indicators identifying the location and intensity of 'land-cover' changes occurring in the CCBR's surrounding landscapes. Potential transition models made evident the CCBR's key role as a reservoir of the region's biodiversity associated to main vegetation types such as the tropical deciduous forest and the semi-deciduous forest.

TI  - Automated mapping of rice fields using multi-year training sample normalization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice agriculture is of great ecological, environmental, and socioeconomic importance in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, as its distribution and size heavily impact food production and a number of ecosystem services. Long-term rice mapping is challenging as a result of insufficient training data - both in spatial amount and in temporal coverage, the high cost of powerful geospatial data processing platforms, and incomplete image coverage during the critical window to capture the unique rice signals. Here, we developed a simple yet effective method for rice field extraction without heavy reliance on the complete profiles of Landsat time series or repeated training data. The core is a multiple-year training sample normalization that extends the samples obtained in one year for classification in another year. Pseudo-invariant objects and a set of linear regressions were used to predict what the given vegetation index values of training samples would be if they had been acquired under the same conditions in a different mapping year. The generated pseudo training samples were further utilized to classify the mapping image. We experimented with four years' Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager data and achieved comparable accuracies as the single-year classification. Because of its simplicity and low computational requirements, it can be efficiently implemented on cloud computing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine platform. This technique provides an affordable and effective solution to derive crop distribution information on a large-scale basis.

TI  - Land tessellation effects in mapping agricultural areas by remote sensing at field level
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While mapping agricultural areas by remote sensing, it is quite common to operate at cadastral parcel level. Unfortunately, this land tessellation is merely administrative: a single parcel can, in fact, be made of differently managed parts whose spectral properties can be significantly different, being often different their content. In this situation, approaches that aggregate spectral signals of pixels belonging to the same parcel to investigate their average behaviour can generate misleading results. In this work, we evaluated how different field tessellation schemes can condition the interpretation of the spectral behaviour of crops with special concern on time series of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and NDWI (normalized difference water index) spectral indices, which are assumed as proxies of plant vigour and crop/soil water content, respectively. The study relies on Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 data imaging a rice-cultivated area sited in Piemonte (NW Italy). Two reference land tessellation geometries were taken into account: (a) the local cadastral map (purely administrative land division criterion) and (b) a map obtained by image segmentation of the NDVI time series (purely spectral land division criterion). After signal aggregation, some statistics were therefore computed to test differences both in time (within the same parcel along its temporal profile) and in space (within the same image at different positions at the same time). Results obtained exploring the rice growing season 2016 showed that (a) in 23% (70% at 1 sigma) and 27% (70% at 1 sigma) of segments (respectively for NDVI and NDWI) spectral differences, averagely along the year, are significant, possibly leading to wrong interpretation of occurring dynamics in the area; (b) in rice-cultivated fields, spectral differences suffer from seasonality with a higher incidence in Spring, when rice agronomic phases are more dynamic and, in the meantime, critical for management.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping by remote sensing and geomorphological data: case studies on the Sorrentina Peninsula (Southern Italy)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sorrentina Peninsula is a densely populated area with high touristic impact. It is located in a morphologically complex zone of Southern Italy frequently affected by dangerous and calamitous landslides. This work contributes to the prevention of such natural disasters by applying a GIS-based interdisciplinary approach aimed to map the areas more potentially prone to trigger slope instability phenomena. We have developed the Landslide Susceptibility Index (LSI) combining five weighted and ranked susceptibility parameters on a GIS platform. These parameters are recognized in the literature as the main predisposing factors for triggering landslides. This work combines analyses conducted on Remote Sensing, Geo-Lithology and Morphometry data and it is organized in the following logical steps: i) Multi-temporal InSAR technique was applied to Envisat-ASAR (2003-2010) and COSMO-SkyMed (2013-2015) datasets to obtain the ground displacement time series and the relative mean ground velocity maps. InSAR allowed the detection of the areas that are subjected to ground deformation and the main affected municipalities; ii) Such deformation areas were investigated through airborne photo interpretation to identify the presence of geomorphological peculiarities connected to potential slope instability. Subsequently, some of these peculiarities were checked on the field; iii) In these deformation areas the susceptibility parameters were mapped in the entire territory of Amalfi and Conca dei Marini and then investigated with a multivariate analysis to derive the classes and the respective weights used in the LSI calculation. The resulting LSI map classifies the two municipalities with high spatial resolution (2m) according to five classes of instability. The map highlights that the high/very high susceptibility zones cover 6% of the investigated territory and correspond to potential landslide source areas characterized by 25 degrees-70 degrees slope angles. A spatial analysis between the map of the historical landslides and the areas classified according to susceptibility allowed testing of the reliability of the LSI Index, resulting in 85% prediction accuracy.

TI  - Factors associated with risk of HIV-infection among pregnant women in Cameroon: Evidence from the 2016 national sentinel surveillance survey of HIV and syphilis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHuman Immunodeficiency Virus infection (HIV) remains a public health concern in Cameroon that requires regular surveillance for informed policy-making to guide programmatic interventions. Using data from the 2016 HIV national sentinel survey in Cameroon, we ascertained HIV prevalence and factors associated with risk of infection among pregnant womenMethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted throughout 2016 in the 10 regions of Cameroon, targeting 7000 first antenatal care (ANC-1) attendees (4000 from urban and 3000 from rural areas) in 60 sentinel health facilities. HIV serological test was performed using the national serial algorithm at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL). Prevalence was determined, and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess determinants of HIV infection, with p-value<0.05 considered statistically significant.ResultsOf the 7000 targeted participants, a total of 6859 first ANC-1 attendees were enrolled (98.0% sampling coverage). Median age was 26 [IQR: 21-30] years and 47,40% had a secondary school level of education. The national prevalence of HIV was 5.70% (95% CI: 4.93-6.40) and range from 9.7% in East region to 2.6% in North region. The prevalence was 5.58% (95% CI: 95%: 4.88-6.35) in urban and 5.87% (95% CI: 5.04-6.78) in rural settings.Factors that were associated with HIV infection included marital status, women who were married or living with their partner are less likely to be infected than singles women (aOR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.46-0.78), multiparity [aOR = 1.5(95% CI: 1.0-2.2)] and been living in the Centre, East, North-west and South-west regions. HIV infection was also significantly associated with age, with the risk of being infected increasing with age.ConclusionPregnant women in Cameroon are still disproportionately infected with HIV compared with the general population (prevalence 4.3%). Preventive actions to curb the epidemic amongst pregnant women should prioritize interventions targeting single pregnant women, who are older, and residing particularly in the Centre, East, North West and South West regions of the country.

TI  - Langerin<SUP>+</SUP>CD8<SUP>+</SUP> Dendritic Cells in the Splenic Marginal Zone: Not So Marginal After All
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) fulfill an essential sentinel function within the immune system, acting at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. The DC family, both in mouse and man, shows high functional heterogeneity in order to orchestrate immune responses toward the immense variety of pathogens and other immunological threats. In this review, we focus on the Langerin(+)CD8(+) DC subpopulation in the spleen. Langerin(+)CD8(+) DC exhibit a high ability to take up apoptotic/dying cells, and therefore they are essential to prime and shape CD8(+) T cell responses. Next to the induction of immunity toward blood-borne pathogens, i.e., viruses, these DC are important for the regulation of tolerance toward cell-associated self-antigens. The ontogeny and differentiation pathways of CD8(+)CD103(+) DC should be further explored to better understand the immunological role of these cells as a prerequisite of their therapeutic application.

TI  - A simple distributed water balance model for an urbanized river basin using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Across most urban centres, adequate supply of water becomes essential for the urban poor. Attempts at ensuring water availability has been formulated using standard water models. This study developed a water balance model using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques during periods of water surplus and deficit across pre-millennium (1996 - 2000) and the post-millennium (2010 - 2014) periods within an urbanized Sub-Saharan city. Digital Elevation Model of the basin was prepared to generate flow direction and to delimit the watershed using ArcHydro tools in ArcGIS 10.3. Supervised classification was used to delineate the landuse classes from Landsat imageries. The result revealed that 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2010 and 2013 were periods of water deficit, while 1999, 2011, 2012 and 2014 were periods of water surplus. This study affirmed the need to reactivate institutional frameworks that are responsible for assessment, conservation, management and planning of water resources for sustainable utilization.

TI  - Community members trusted by African American parents for vaccine advice
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to pro-vaccination messages from nonmedical peers and others perceived to share a similar value system for society (referred to as worldview outlook) improves vaccination attitudes. Nonetheless, a minority of African American parents have friends and family members who provide them with vaccine advice. The aims of the current study were to identify the presumed worldview outlook of eight types of community figures as perceived by African American parents, and determine parents' trust in these figures for vaccine advice, and whether trust varied according to the figures' racial concordance. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 110 African American parents in 2015. Parents perceived the community figures to represent a spectrum of worldview outlooks. Although levels of trust in the community figures differed overall (p < .001), it was high in the school nurse, pediatrician, mother, father, disease survivor, and vaccine scientist. All trusted figures except the father were perceived to hold a communitarian outlook. Parents shown race-concordant figures had higher levels of trust in them than those who were shown race-discordant equivalents (p < .01). These findings suggest that vaccination campaigns geared toward African American parents may be strengthened by including other nonmedical, African American spokespersons who convey their community contributions in messages.

TI  - Estimations of global shortwave direct aerosol radiative effects above opaque water clouds using a combination of A-Train satellite sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - All-sky direct aerosol radiative effects (DARE) play a significant yet still uncertain role in climate. This is partly due to poorly quantified radiative properties of aerosol above clouds (AAC). We compute global estimates of short-wave top-of-atmosphere DARE over opaque water clouds (OWCs), DARE(OWC), using observation-based aerosol and cloud radiative properties from a combination of A-Train satellite sensors and a radiative transfer model. There are three major differences between our DARE(OWC) calculations and previous studies: (1) we use the depolarization ratio method (DR) on CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) Level 1 measurements to compute the AAC frequencies of occurrence and the AAC aerosol optical depths (AODs), thus introducing fewer uncertainties compared to using the CALIOP standard product; (2) we apply our calculations globally, instead of focusing exclusively on regional AAC "hotspots" such as the southeast Atlantic; and (3) instead of the traditional look-up table approach, we use a combination of satellite-based sensors to obtain AAC intensive radiative properties. Our results agree with previous findings on the dominant locations of AAC (south and northeast Pacific, tropical and southeast Atlantic, northern Indian Ocean and northwest Pacific), the season of maximum occurrence and aerosol optical depths (a majority in the 0.01-0.02 range and that can exceed 0.2 at 532 nm) across the globe. We find positive averages of global seasonal DARE(OWC) between 0.13 and 0.26W m(-2) (i.e., a warming effect on climate). Regional seasonal DARE(OWC) values range from -0.06 W m(-2) in the Indian Ocean offshore from western Australia (in March-April-May) to 2.87 W m(-2) in the southeast Atlantic (in September-October-November). High positive values are usually paired with high aerosol optical depths (>0.1) and low single scattering albedos (< 0.94), representative of, for example, biomass burning aerosols. Because we use different spatial domains, temporal periods, satellite sensors, detection methods and/or associated uncertainties, the DARE(OWC) estimates in this study are not directly comparable to previous peer-reviewed results. Despite these differences, we emphasize that the DARE(OWC) estimates derived in this study are generally higher than previously reported. The primary reasons for our higher estimates are (i) the possible underestimate of the number of dust-dominated AAC cases in our study; (ii) our use of Level 1 CALIOP products (instead of CALIOP Level 2 products in previous studies) for the detection and quantification of AAC aerosol optical depths, which leads to larger estimates of AOD above OWC; and (iii) our use of gridded 4 degrees similar to 5 degrees seasonal means of aerosol and cloud properties in our DARE(OWC) calculations instead of simultaneously derived aerosol and cloud properties from a combination of A-Train satellite sensors. Each of these areas is explored in depth with detailed discussions that explain both the rationale for our specific approach and the subsequent ramifications for our DARE calculations.

TI  - Simulation of the transport, vertical distribution, optical properties and radiative impact of smoke aerosols with the ALADIN regional climate model during the ORACLES-2016 and LASIC experiments
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of the direct radiative effect (DRE) from absorbing smoke aerosols over the southeast Atlantic Ocean (SAO) require simulation of the microphysical and optical properties of stratocumulus clouds as well as of the altitude and shortwave (SW) optical properties of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs). In this study, we take advantage of the large number of observations acquired during the ObseRvations of Aerosols above Clouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES-2016) and Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds (LASIC) projects during September 2016 and compare them with datasets from the ALADIN-Climate (Aire Limitee Adaptation dynamique Developpement InterNational) regional model. The model provides a good representation of the liquid water path but the low cloud fraction is underestimated compared to satellite data. The modeled total-column smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) and above-cloud AOD are consistent (similar to 0.7 over continental sources and similar to 0.3 over the SAO at 550 nm) with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The simulations indicate smoke transport over the SAO occurs mainly between 2 and 4 km, consistent with surface and aircraft lidar observations. The BBA single scattering albedo is slightly overestimated compared to the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and more significantly when compared to Ascension Island surface observations. The difference could be due to the absence of internal mixing treatment in the ALADIN-Climate model. The SSA overestimate leads to an underestimation of the simulated SW radiative heating compared to ORACLES data. ALADIN-Climate simulates a positive (monthly mean) SW DRE of about +6Wm(-2) over the SAO (20 degrees S-10 degrees N and 10 degrees W-20 degrees E) at the top of the atmosphere and in all-sky conditions. Over the continent, the presence of BBA is shown to significantly decrease the net surface SW flux, through direct and semi-direct effects, which is compensated by a decrease (monthly mean) in sensible heat fluxes (- 25 W m(-2)) and surface land temperature (-15 degrees C) over Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, notably. The surface cooling and the lower tropospheric heating decrease the continental planetary boundary layer height by about similar to 200 m.

TI  - Assessment of contemporary satellite sea ice thickness products for Arctic sea ice
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in remote sensing of sea ice over the past two decades have resulted in a wide variety of satellite-derived sea ice thickness data products becoming publicly available. Selecting the most appropriate product is challenging given end user objectives range from incorporating satellite-derived thickness information in operational activities, including sea ice forecasting, routing of maritime traffic and search and rescue, to climate change analysis, longer-term modelling, prediction and future planning. Depending on the use case, selecting the most suitable satellite data product can depend on the region of interest, data latency, and whether the data are provided routinely, for example via a climate or maritime service provider. Here we examine a suite of current sea ice thickness data products, collating key details of primary interest to end users. We assess 8 years of sea ice thickness observations derived from sensors on board the CryoSat-2 (CS2), Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites. We evaluate the satellite-only observations with independent ice draft and thickness measurements obtained from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (BGEP) upward looking sonar (ULS) instruments and Operation IceBridge (OIB), respectively. We find a number of key differences among data products but find that products utilizing CS2-only measurements are reliable for sea ice thickness, particularly between similar to 0.5 and 4 m. Among data compared, a blended CS2-SMOS product was the most reliable for thin ice. Ice thickness distributions at the end of winter appeared realistic when compared with independent ice draft measurements, with the exception of those derived from AVHRR. There is disagreement among the products in terms of the magnitude of the mean thickness trends, especially in spring 2017. Regional comparisons reveal noticeable differences in ice thickness between products, particularly in the marginal seas in areas of considerable ship traffic.

TI  - Satellite-derived sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption (Iceland)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 6-month-long 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption was the largest in Iceland for 200 years, emitting huge quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the troposphere, at times overwhelming European anthropogenic emissions. Weather, terrain and latitude made continuous ground-based or UV satellite sensor measurements challenging. Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) data are used to derive the first time series of daily SO2 mass present in the atmosphere and its vertical distribution over the entire eruption period. A new optimal estimation scheme is used to calculate daily SO2 fluxes and average e-folding time every 12 h. For the 6 months studied, the SO2 flux was observed to be up to 200 kt day(-1) and the minimum total SO2 erupted mass was 4.4 +/- 0.8 Tg. The average SO2 e-folding time was 2.4 +/- 0.6 days. Where comparisons are possible, these results broadly agree with ground-based near-source measurements, independent remote-sensing data and values obtained from model simulations from a previous paper. The results highlight the importance of using high-resolution time series data to accurately estimate volcanic SO2 emissions. The SO2 mass missed due to thermal contrast is estimated to be of the order of 3% of the total emission when compared to measurements by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument. A statistical correction for cloud based on the AVHRR cloud-CCI data set suggested that the SO2 mass missed due to cloud cover could be significant, up to a factor of 2 for the plume within the first kilometre from the vent. Applying this correction results in a total erupted mass of 6.7 +/- 0.4 Tg and little change in average e-folding time. The data set derived can be used for comparisons to other ground- and satellite-based measurements and to petrological estimates of the SO2 flux. It could also be used to initialise climate model simulations, helping to better quantify the environmental and climatic impacts of future Icelandic fissure eruptions and simulations of past large-scale flood lava eruptions.

TI  - Development and evaluation of lateral flow assay for sero-diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis in swine
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne zoonotic flaviviral disease. Swine sero-convert 2-3 weeks before infection occurs in humans and thus serves as a suitable sentinel for JE surveillance and outbreak prediction in human population. The present study was conducted with the objective of developing a lateral flow assay (LFA) for detecting JEV antibodies in swine sera. Three different formats were tried using recombinant NS1 protein as antigen in order to select the best format. In format I, gold nanoparticles were conjugated with antigen followed by spotting of antigen on NCM as test line and anti-antigen IgG on NCM as control line. In format II, gold nanoparticles were conjugated with antigen followed by spotting of staphylococcal protein A as test line and anti-antigen IgG as control line. Format III used gold nanoparticles conjugated with goat anti-pig IgG followed by spotting of antigen as test line and pig IgG as control line. Amongst the three formats, format II was found to be superior with 100% relative diagnostic sensitivity and 100% relative diagnostic specificity during monsoon and post-monsoon period. A panel of 500 field swine serum samples was tested using format II which revealed sero-positivity of 15.6%, and the format was found suitable to screen swine serum samples during monsoon and post-monsoon period.

TI  - Intercultural missional leadership: Theological foundation and biblical narratives
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the concept and practice of the missional leadership from three perspectives: the biblical worldview, cultural mandate and narratives of biblical examples. The research explores two elements of missional leadership, which is comparable to the leadership theory as it delves into the concept of 'missional'. This research also unearths understanding the relationship between missional leadership in intercultural environments to the biblical worldview that is based on biblical theology. Furthermore, the exploration seeks to find a relationship between the intercultural missional leadership and the cultural mandate endowed by the triune God to mankind as God's image. In addition, the research also carefully looks into the following biblical models that exemplify intercultural missional leadership: Moses, Jesus Christ and the apostle Paul. Narratives of the Bible show that God reveals his leadership through his providence to accomplish his goal according to his pleasing will, as God is the only resource to intercultural missional leadership. This study seeks to demonstrate how missional leadership in missiology coincides with theological common concepts of the biblical worldview and the cultural mandate in the biblical theology, which will be exemplified through biblical narratives. Both have the same goal to accomplish God's kingdom according to the timeline of the historical phases in biblical worldview: creation, fall, redemption and restoration. It investigates present-time applicable principles through three biblical narratives, providing a reasonable basis of correlation between culture and the gospel.

A1  - RotaNet-Italy Study Grp
TI  - Group A rotavirus surveillance before vaccine introduction in Italy, September 2014 to August 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young children, causing ca 250,000 deaths worldwide, mainly in low-income countries. Two proteins, VP7 (glycoprotein, G genotype) and VP4 (protease-sensitive protein, P genotype), are the basis for the binary RVA nomenclature. Although 36 G types and 51 P types are presently known, most RVA infections in humans worldwide are related to five G/P combinations: G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8]. Aim: This study aimed to characterise the RVA strains circulating in Italy in the pre-vaccination era, to define the trends of circulation of genotypes in the Italian paediatric population. Methods: Between September 2014 and August 2017, after routine screening in hospital by commercial antigen detection kit, 2,202 rotavirus-positive samples were collected in Italy from children hospitalised with AGE; the viruses were genotyped following standard European protocols. Results: This 3-year study revealed an overall predominance of the G12P[8] genotype (544 of 2,202 cases; 24.70%), followed by G9P[8] (535/2,202; 24.30%), G1P[8] (459/2,202; 20.84%) and G4P[8] (371/2,202; 16.85%). G2P[4] and G3P[8] genotypes were detected at low rates (3.32% and 3.09%, respectively). Mixed infections accounted for 6.49% of cases (143/2,202), uncommon RVA strains for 0.41% of cases (9/2,202). Conclusions: The emergence of G12P[8] rotavirus in Italy, as in other countries, marks this genotype as the sixth most common human genotype. Continuous surveillance of RVA strains and monitoring of circulating genotypes are important for a better understanding of rotavirus evolution and genotype distribution, particularly regarding strains that may emerge from reassortment events.

TI  - Catchment characterization to support water monitoring and management decisions using remote sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study implements remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system techniques in deriving physical and spectral characteristics of a catchment to aid in water quality monitoring. This approach is conducted by utilizing RS datasets like digital elevation model (DEM), satellite images, and on-site spectral measurements. A Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM was used for extracting physical profiles while Landsat Operational Land Imager was utilized to extract land cover information. This method was tested in a 22,000-ha catchment with dominant agricultural lands where large-scale mining companies are also operating actively. The land cover classification has an overall accuracy of 97.66%. Forest (50%) and cropland (32%) are the most dominant land cover within the catchment. The spectral signature of waters at designated sampling points was measured to evaluate its correlation to water quality data like pH and dissolved oxygen (DO). The correlation between the level of pH and reflectance implies a positive relationship (R-2 of 0.548) while that of DO and reflectance gives a negative correlation (R-2 of 0.634). Results of this study demonstrate the practical advantage of exploiting remotely-sensed data in profiling and characterizing a catchment as it provides valuable information in understanding and mitigating contamination in an area. Through these RS-derived catchment profiles, insights on the contaminant's concentration and possible sources can be identified. The graphical and statistical analysis of the spectral data prove its potential in developing water quality models and maps.

TI  - Changing epidemiology of meticillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in 42 hospitals in the Dutch-German border region, 2012 to 2016: results of the search-and-follow-policy
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections. Aim: We describe MRSA colonisation/infection and bacteraemia rate trends in Dutch-German border region hospitals (NL-DE-BRH) in 2012-16. Methods: All 42 NL-DE BRH (8 NL-BRH, 34 DE-BRH) within the cross-border network EurSafety Health-net provided surveillance data (on average ca 620,000 annual hospital admissions, of these 68.0% in Germany). Guidelines defining risk for MRSA colonisation/infection were reviewed. MRSA-related parameters and healthcare utilisation indicators were derived. Medians over the study period were compared between NL- and DE-BRH. Results: Measures for MRSA cases were similar in both countries, however defining patients at risk for MRSA differed. The rate of nasopharyngeal MRSA screening swabs was 14 times higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (42.3 vs 3.0/100 inpatients; p < 0.0001). The MRSA incidence was over seven times higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (1.04 vs 0.14/100 inpatients; p < 0.0001). The nosocomial MRSA incidence-density was higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (0.09 vs 0.03/1,000 patient days; p = 0.0002) and decreased significantly in DE-BRH (p = 0.0184) during the study. The rate of MRSA isolates from blood per 100,000 patient days was almost six times higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (1.55 vs 0.26; p = 0.0041). The patients had longer hospital stays in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (6.8 vs 4.9; p < 0.0001). DE-BRH catchment area inhabitants appeared to be more frequently hospitalised than their Dutch counterparts. Conclusions: Ongoing IPC efforts allowed MRSA reduction in DE-BRH. Besides IPC, other local factors, including healthcare systems, could influence MRSA epidemiology.

TI  - Mine landslide susceptibility assessment using IVM, ANN and SVM models considering the contribution of affecting factors
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The fragile ecological environment near mines provide advantageous conditions for the development of landslides. Mine landslide susceptibility mapping is of great importance for mine geo-environment control and restoration planning. In this paper, a total of 493 landslides in Shangli County, China were collected through historical landslide inventory. 16 spectral, geomorphic and hydrological predictive factors, mainly derived from Landsat 8 imagery and Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), were prepared initially for landslide susceptibility assessment. Predictive capability of these factors was evaluated by using the value of variance inflation factor and information gain ratio. Three models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and information value model (IVM), were applied to assess the mine landslide sensitivity. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and rank probability score were used to validate and compare the comprehensive predictive capabilities of three models involving uncertainty. Results showed that ANN model achieved higher prediction capability, proving its advantage of solve nonlinear and complex problems. Comparing the estimated landslide susceptibility map with the ground-truth one, the high-prone area tends to be located in the middle area with multiple fault distributions and the steeply sloped hill.

TI  - Seasonal drought prediction for semiarid northeast Brazil: what is the added value of a process-based hydrological model?
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The semiarid northeast of Brazil is one of the most densely populated dryland regions in the world and recurrently affected by severe droughts. Thus, reliable seasonal forecasts of streamflow and reservoir storage are of high value for water managers. Such forecasts can be generated by applying either hydrological models representing underlying processes or statistical relationships exploiting correlations among meteorological and hydrological variables. This work evaluates and compares the performances of seasonal reservoir storage forecasts derived by a process-based hydrological model and a statistical approach.Driven by observations, both models achieve similar simulation accuracies. In a hindcast experiment, however, the accuracy of estimating regional reservoir storages was considerably lower using the process-based hydrological model, whereas the resolution and reliability of drought event predictions were similar by both approaches. Further investigations regarding the deficiencies of the process-based model revealed a significant influence of antecedent wetness conditions and a higher sensitivity of model prediction performance to rainfall forecast quality.Within the scope of this study, the statistical model proved to be the more straightforward approach for predictions of reservoir level and drought events at regionally and monthly aggregated scales. However, for forecasts at finer scales of space and time or for the investigation of underlying processes, the costly initialisation and application of a process-based model can be worthwhile. Furthermore, the application of innovative data products, such as remote sensing data, and operational model correction methods, like data assimilation, may allow for an enhanced exploitation of the advanced capabilities of process-based hydrological models.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Knowledge of where, when, and how much paddy rice is planted is crucial information for understating of regional food security, freshwater use, climate change, and transmission of avian influenza virus. We developed seasonal paddy rice maps at high resolution (10 m) for Bangladesh and Northeast India, typical cloud-prone regions in South Asia, using cloud-free Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1 satellite, the Random Forest classifier, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The maps were provided for all the three distinct rice growing seasons of the region: Boro, Aus and Aman. The paddy rice maps were evaluated against the independent validation samples, and compared with the existing products from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The generated paddy rice maps were spatially consistent with the compared maps and had a satisfactory accuracy over 90%. This study showed the potential of Sentinel-1 data and GEE on large scale paddy rice mapping in cloud-prone regions like tropical Asia.

TI  - Children under 10 years of age were more affected by the 2018/19 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 epidemic in Canada: possible cohort effect following the 2009 influenza pandemic
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Findings from the community-based Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) suggest children were more affected by the 2018/19 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic. Aim: To compare the age distribution of A(H1N1) pdm09 cases in 2018/19 to prior seasonal influenza epidemics in Canada. Methods: The age distribution of unvaccinated influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 cases and test-negative controls were compared across A(H1N1)pdm09-dominant epidemics in 2018/19, 2015/16 and 2013/14 and with the general population of SPSN provinces. Similar comparisons were undertaken for influenza A(H3N2)-dominant epidemics. Results: In 2018/19, more influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 cases were under 10 years old than controls (29% vs 16%; p < 0.001). In particular, children aged 5-9 years comprised 14% of cases, greater than their contribution to controls (4%) or the general population (5%) and at least twice their contribution in 2015/16 (7%; p < 0.001) or 2013/14 (5%; p < 0.001). Conversely, children aged 10-19 years (11% of the population) were under-represented among A(H1N1) pdm09 cases versus controls in 2018/19 (7% vs 12%; p < 0.001), 2015/16 (7% vs 13%; p < 0.001) and 2013/14 (9% vs 12%; p = 0.12). Conclusion: Children under 10 years old contributed more to outpatient A(H1N1) pdm09 medical visits in 2018/19 than prior seasonal epidemics in Canada. In 2018/19, all children under 10 years old were born after the 2009 A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic and therefore lacked pandemic-induced immunity. In addition, more than half those born after 2009 now attend school (i.e. 5-9-year-olds), a socio-behavioural context that may enhance transmission and did not apply during prior A(H1N1) pdm09 epidemics.

TI  - Shinnyo-en and the formulation of a new esoteric iconography
T2  - MATERIAL RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1936, Ito Shinjo established the modern lay esoteric Buddhist group known today as Shinnyo-en, The Garden of Truth. This article surveys the ways in which Ito used image and text to reimagine Japanese esoteric Buddhism throughout the twentieth century. It examines not only Ito's iconographic innovations, but also his own autobiographical account called The Path to Oneness (Inchinyo no michi) in order to chart the major institutional, ritual, and doctrinal developments of Shinnyo-en. Specifically, this article argues that Ito's veneration of the King of Immovable Wisdom, Fudo Myoo, from 1935-1936 onwards, as well as Fudo's two acolytes (ryodoji), helped him to make doctrinal sense and personal meaning out of the tragic death of his own two sons. It also argues that his addition of gendered dharma protectors and the Diamond and Womb World mandalas further expanded Ito's personalized worldview, and that his addition of the Buddha in Nirvana in 1957 and the Eleven-Headed Kannon Bodhisattva of Compassion in 1979 further filled out the so-called three wheel bodies of esoteric Buddhism. These images, and the institutional and ritual developments associated with them, reinforced Ito's remarkable doctrinal claim that Shinnyo-en represents the third culminating sect of esoteric Buddhism in Japan. This case study thus provides rare insight into the use of image and text to imagine, illustrate, and shape the major contours of a "new" religious movement in the modern period.

TI  - Weighted residual fusion with multi-modality features for high-resolution aerial scene classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In scene-level classification of remote sensing, fusion of multi-feature can significantly boost the performance. However, most methods directly fuse the features of different modalities without considering the importance of each feature modality. Based on the above considerations, in this work, multi-modality features weighted residual fusion method is proposed. First, the extracted high-level and low-level features of the scene image are encoded into a unified feature representation. Then the reconstruction residuals of each modality of each scene class are calculated based on two representation-based classification, i.e. sparse representation (SR) and collaborative representation (CR). After fusing the weighted reconstruction residuals of these two modalities with SR and CR, the class label is assigned to the category with the smallest residual. We make extensive evaluations on two challenging remote sensing data sets. The comparison with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI  - The potential for modelling peatland habitat condition in Scotland using long-term MODIS data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, peatlands provide an important sink of carbon in their near natural state but potentially act as a source of gaseous and dissolved carbon emission if not in good condition. There is a pressing need to remotely identify peatland sites requiring improvement and to monitor progress following restoration. A medium resolution model was developed based on a training dataset of peatland habitat condition and environmental covariates, such as morphological features, against information derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), covering Scotland (UK). The initial, unrestricted, model provided the probability of a site being in favourable condition. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves for restricted training data, limited to those located on a peat soil map, resulted in an accuracy of 0.915. The kappa statistic was 0.8151, suggesting good model fit. The derived map of predicted peatland condition at the suggested 0.56 threshold was corroborated by data from other sources, including known restoration sites, areas under known non-peatland land cover and previous vegetation survey data mapped onto inferred condition categories. The resulting locations of the areas of peatland modelled to be in favourable ecological condition were largely confined to the North and West of the country, which not only coincides with prior land use intensity but with published predictions of future retraction of the bioclimatic space for peatlands. The model is limited by a lack of spatially appropriate ground observations, and a lack of verification of peat depth at training site locations, hence future efforts to remotely assess peatland condition will require more appropriate ground-based monitoring. If appropriate ground-based observations could be collected, using remote sensing could be considered a cost-efficient means to provide data on changes in peatland habitat condition.

TI  - Grizzly bear response to fine spatial and temporal scale spring snow cover in Western Alberta
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow dynamics influence seasonal behaviors of wildlife, such as denning patterns and habitat selection related to the availability of food resources. Under a changing climate, characteristics of the temporal and spatial patterns of snow are predicted to change, and as a result, there is a need to better understand how species interact with snow dynamics. This study examines grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) spring habitat selection and use across western Alberta, Canada. Made possible by newly available fine-scale snow cover data, this research tests a hypothesis that grizzly bears select for locations with less snow cover and areas where snow melts sooner during spring (den emergence to May 31st). Using Integrated Step Selection Analysis, a series of models were built to examine whether snow cover information such as fractional snow covered area and date of snow melt improved models constructed based on previous knowledge of grizzly bear selection during the spring. Comparing four different models fit to 62 individual bear-years, we found that the inclusion of fractional snow covered area improved model fit 60% of the time based on Akaike Information Criterion tallies. Probability of use was then used to evaluate grizzly bear habitat use in response to snow and environmental attributes, including fractional snow covered area, date since snow melt, elevation, and distance to road. Results indicate grizzly bears select for lower elevation, snow-free locations during spring, which has important implications for management of threatened grizzly bear populations in consideration of changing climatic conditions. This study is an example of how fine spatial and temporal scale remote sensing data can be used to improve our understanding of wildlife habitat selection and use in relation to key environmental attributes.

TI  - Examining post-fire vegetation recovery with Landsat time series analysis in three western North American forest types
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Few studies have examined post-fire vegetation recovery in temperate forest ecosystems with Landsat time series analysis. We analyzed time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation fitting to examine post-fire NBR recovery for several wildfires that occurred in three different coniferous forest types in western North America during the years 2000 to 2007. We summarized NBR recovery trends, and investigated the influence of burn severity, post-fire climate, and topography on post-fire vegetation recovery via random forest (RF) analysis.Results: NBR recovery across forest types averaged 30 to 44% five years post fire, 47 to 72% ten years post fire, and 54 to 77% 13 years post fire, and varied by time since fire, severity, and forest type. Recovery rates were generally greatest for several years following fire. Recovery in terms of percent NBR was often greater for higher-severity patches. Recovery rates varied between forest types, with conifer-oak-chaparral showing the greatest NBR recovery rates, mixed conifer showing intermediate rates, and ponderosa pine showing slowest rates. Between 1 and 28% of patches had recovered to pre-fire NBR levels 9 to 16 years after fire, with greater percentages of low-severity patches showing full NBR recovery.Precipitation decreased and temperatures generally remained the same or increased post fire. Pre-fire NBR and burn severity were important predictors of NBR recovery for all forest types, and explained 2 to 6% of the variation in post-fire NBR recovery. Post-fire climate anomalies were also important predictors of NBR recovery and explained an additional 30 to 41% of the variation in post-fire NBR recovery.Conclusions: Landsat time series analysis was a useful means of describing and analyzing post-fire vegetation recovery across mixed-severity wildfire extents. We demonstrated that a relationship exists between post-fire vegetation recovery and climate in temperate ecosystems of western North America. Our methods could be applied to other burned landscapes for which spatially explicit measurements of post-fire vegetation recovery are needed.

TI  - Monitoring changes in the impervious surfaces of urban functional zones using multisource remote sensing data: a case study of Tianjin, China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research on urban impervious surface monitoring has ignored the differences, spatial patterns, and driving factors of impervious surfaces among the various functional zones in cities. In this paper, we extracted the impervious surface coverage of Tianjin in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 based on the Classification and Regression Tree model. Then, using the methods of quantitative geography, we systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of impervious surface coverage among the functional zones in Tianjin from 1990 to 2015. Additionally, the driving mechanisms of impervious surface growths among different functional zones were investigated. The results showed that (1) the growth of impervious surfaces shows two spatially separate core areas of growth. The core functional zone (CFZ) had the highest impervious surface coverage, and the ecological conservation zone (ECZ) had the lowest impervious surface coverage. (2) High-high aggregation regions of impervious surface coverage were mainly located in CFZ, while low-low aggregation regions of impervious surface coverage area were mainly located in ECZ. (3) Influences of social-economic factors on area growths of impervious surface are stronger in urban function expanded zone, coastal city key development zone, Beijing-Tianjin coordinated development zone, and urban-rural coordinated development zone than those in CFZ. Our results can provide a point of reference for decision-making regarding urban planning management.

TI  - Macro- and micro-level studies using Urban Heat Islands to simulate effects of greening, building materials and other mitigating factors in Mumbai city
T2  - ARCHITECTURAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A problem common to cities around the world is the formation and intensification of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) [Weng, Dengsheng, and Schubring 2004. "Estimation of Land Surface Temperature - Vegetation Abundance Relationship for Urban." Remote Sensing of Environment 89: 467-483]. Heat Islands are present in almost every city [Sobrino and Leonardo. 2004. "Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from LANDSAT TM 5." Remote Sensing of Environment 90: 434-440]. Urbanization leads to replacement of forest and vegetative regions with the impervious materials like concrete, asphalt, bricks, etc. [Rizwan, Dennis, and Liu 2008. "A Review on the Generation, Determination and Mitigation of Urban Heat Island." Journal of Environmental Sciences 20 (1): 120-128; Turner, 2016. "Land System Architecture for Urban Sustainability: New Directions for Land System Science Illustrated by Application to the Urban Heat Island Problem." Journal of Land Use Science 11 (6): 689-697]. A large amount of land cover is transformed into the concrete and asphalted surface [Akbari, Pomerantz, and Taha 2001. "Cool Surfaces and Shade Trees to Reduce Energy Use and Improve Air Quality in Urban Areas." Solar Energy 70 (3): 295-310]. The study analyses UHIs at two different levels, macro-level and micro-level. Macro-level study is carried out on whole Mumbai city to find out the hotspots on different landuse/landcover. The main reasons for differences in temperatures in these areas were studied. Land surface temperature in the areas like Airport in Mumbai increased by 6.5% from January 1999 to January 2013 and around 12% from April 1999 to 2013. In the micro-level, two areas were selected, one barren and other green to analyse the impact of land cover on the heat in the city.

TI  - Evaluation of CESM1 (WACCM) free-running and specified dynamics atmospheric composition simulations using global multispecies satellite data records
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have analyzed near-global stratospheric data (and mesospheric data as well for H2O) in terms of absolute abundances, variability, and trends for O-3, H2O, HCl, N2O, and HNO3, based on Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data, as well as longer-term series from the Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS). While we emphasize the evaluation of stratospheric models via data comparisons through 2014 to free-running (FR-WACCM) and specified dynamics (SD-WACCM) versions of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), we also highlight observed stratospheric changes, using the most recent data from MLS.Regarding highlights from the satellite data, we have used multiple linear regression to derive trends based on zonal mean time series from Aura MLS data alone, between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N. In the upper stratosphere, MLS O-3 shows increases over 2005-2018 at similar to 0.1-0.3% yr(-1) (depending on altitude and latitude) with 2 sigma errors of similar to 0.2% yr(-1). For the lower stratosphere (LS), GOZCARDS O-3 data for 1998-2014 point to small decreases between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N, but the trends are more positive if the starting year is 2005. Southern midlatitudes (30-60 degrees S) exhibit near-zero or slightly positive LS trends for 1998-2018. The LS O-3 trends based on 2005-2018 MLS data are most positive (0.1-0.2% yr(-1)) at these southern midlatitudes, although marginally statistically significant, in contrast to slightly negative or near-zero trends for 2005-2014. Given the high variability in LS O-3, and the high sensitivity of trends to the choice of years used, especially for short periods, further studies are required for a robust longer-term LS trend result. For H2O, upper-stratospheric and mesospheric trends from GOZCARDS 1992-2010 data are near zero (within similar to 0.2% yr(-1)) and significantly smaller than trends (within similar to 0.4-0.7% yr(-1)) from MLS for 2005-2014 or 2005-2018. The latter short-term positive H2O trends are larger than expected from changes resulting from long-term increases in methane. We note that the very shallow solar flux maximum of solar cycle 24 has contributed to fairly large shortterm mesospheric and upper-stratospheric H2O trends since 2005. However, given known drifts in the MLS H2O time series, MLS H2O trend results, especially after 2010, should be viewed as upper limits. The MLS data also show regions and periods of small HCl increases in the lower stratosphere, within the context of the longer-term stratospheric decrease in HCl, as well as interhemispheric-latitudinal differences in short-term HCl tendencies. We observe similarities in such short-term tendencies, and interhemispheric asymmetries therein, for lower-stratospheric HCl and HNO3, while N2O trend profiles exhibit anti-correlated patterns.In terms of the model evaluation, climatological averages for 2005-2014 from both FR-WACCM and SD-WACCM for O3, H2O, HCl, N2O, and HNO3 compare favorably with Aura MLS data averages over this period. However, the models at mid-to high latitudes overestimate mean MLS LS O-3 values and seasonal amplitudes by as much as 50 %-60 %; such differences appear to implicate, in part, a transport-related model issue. At lower-stratospheric high southern latitudes, variations in polar winter and spring composition observed by MLS are well matched by SD-WACCM, with the main exception being for the early winter rate of decrease in HCl, which is too slow in the model. In general, we find that the latitude-pressure distributions of annual and semiannual oscillation amplitudes derived from MLS data are properly captured by the model amplitudes. In terms of closeness of fit diagnostics for model-data anomaly series, not surprisingly, SD-WACCM (driven by realistic dynamics) generally matches the observations better than FR-WACCM does. We also use root mean square variability as a more valuable metric to evaluate model-data differences. We find, most notably, that FR-WACCM underestimates observed interannual variability for H2O; this has implications for the time period needed to detect small trends, based on model predictions.The WACCM O-3 trends generally agree (within 2 sigma uncertainties) with the MLS data trends, although LS trends are typically not statistically different from zero. The MLS O3 trend dependence on latitude and pressure is matched quite well by the SD-WACCM results. For H2O, MLS and SD-WACCM positive trends agree fairly well, but FRWACCM shows significantly smaller increases; this discrepancy for FR-WACCM is even more pronounced for longerterm GOZCARDS H2O records. The larger discrepancies for FR-WACCM likely arise from its poorer correlations with cold point temperatures and with quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) variability. For HCl, while some expected decreases in the global LS are seen in the observations, there are interhemispheric differences in the trends, and increasing tendencies are suggested in tropical MLS data at 68 hPa, where there is only a slight positive trend in SD-WACCM. Although the vertical gradients in MLS HCl trends are well duplicated by SD-WACCM, the model trends are always somewhat more negative; this deserves further investigation. The original MLS N2O product time series yield small positive LS tropical trends (2005-2012), consistent with models and with rates of increase in tropospheric N2O. However, longerterm series from the more current MLS N2O standard product are affected by instrument-related drifts that have also impacted MLS H2O. The LS short-term trend profiles from MLS N2O and HNO3 at midlatitudes in the two hemispheres have different signs; these patterns are well matched by SD-WACCM trends for these species.These model-data comparisons provide a reminder that the QBO and other dynamical factors affect decadal variability in a major way, notably in the lower stratosphere, and can thus significantly hinder the goals of robustly extracting (and explaining) small underlying long-term trends. The data sets and tools discussed here for model evaluation could be expanded to comparisons of species or regions not included here, as well as to comparisons between a variety of chemistry-climate models.

TI  - Global solar radiation prediction by ANN integrated with European Centre for medium range weather forecast fields in solar rich cities of Queensland Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To support alternative forms of energy resources, the prediction of global incident solar radiation (Irad) is critical to establish the efficacy of solar energy resources as a free and clean energy, and to identify and screen solar powered sites. Solar radiation data for construction of energy feasibility studies are not available in many locations due to the absence of meteorological stations, especially in remote or regional sites. To surmount the challenge in solar energy site identification, the universally gridded data integrated into predictive models used to generate reliable Irad forecasts can be considered as a viable medium for future energy utilization. The objective of this paper is to review, develop and evaluate a suite of machine learning (ML) models based on the artificial neural network (ANN) versus several other kinds of data-driven models such as support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process machine learning (GPML) and genetic programming (GP) models for the prediction of daily Irad generated through the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis fields. The performance of the ML models are benchmarked against several statistical tools: auto regressive moving integrated average (ARIMA), Temperature Model (TM), Time series and Fourier Series (TSFS) models. To train these models, 87 different predictor variables from the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset (01-January-1979 to 31 December -2015) were extracted for 5 solar-rich metropolitan sites (i.e., Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Ipswich and Toowoomba, Australia) targeted against surface level Irad available from the measured Scientific Information for Land Owners dataset. For daily forecast models, a total of the 20 most important predictors related to the Irad dataset were screened with nearest component analysis: "fsrnca" feature selection, and partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%) and testing (15%) sets for model design. To benchmark the ANN, TSFS and TM models were developed with Fourier series and regression analysis, respectively and the statistical performance was benchmarked with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS), Willmott's Index (WI), Mean Bias error (MBE), Legates and McCabe Index (El), and relative MAE, RMSE and diagnostic plots. The performance of ANN was significantly better than the other models (SVR, GPML, GP, TM), resulting in lower RMSE (1.715 2.27 MJM-2/day relative to 2.14-5.90 MJrn-2/day), relative RMSE (9.07-12.47 vs 10.98-29.15), relative RMAE (7.97-11.74 vs 9.27-33.96) and larger WI, ENS and E1 (0.938-0.967 vs. 0.462-0.955, 0.935-0.872 vs. 0.355-0.915, 0.672-0.783 vs. 0.252-0.740). Additionally, models assessed with predictors grouped into El Nino, La Nina and the positive, negative and neutral periods of Indian Ocean Dipole, affirmed the merits of ANN model (RRMSE < 11%). Seasonal analysis showed that ANN was an elite tool over SVR. GPML and GP for Irad prediction. The study concludes that an ANN approach integrated with ECMWF fields, incorporating physical interactions of Ira with atmospheric data, is an efficacious alternative to forecast solar energy and assist with energy modelling for solar-rich sites that have diverse climatic conditions to further support clean energy utilization.

TI  - Characterization of species diversity and forest health using AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral remote sensing data
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Species diversity and vegetation health are two critical components to be monitored for sustainable forest management and conservation of biodiversity. The present study characterizes species dominance and alpha-diversity of a forest for the selected region in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary (MWS), Western Ghats, which represents one of the most economically important forest types in India - the tropical dry deciduous forest. NASA's Next-Generation Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) data at spectral resolution of 5 nm and spatial resolution of 5 m were used to analyse the forest matrix. Biodiversity (alpha-diversity) map thus generated from airborne platform over 14.5 sq. km area mostly represents the forest tree species diversity. Dominant tree species in the study area were also mapped using AVIRIS data for 21.7 sq. km. Canopy emergent dominant species, viz. Anogeissus latifolia, Tectona grandis, Terminalia alata, Grewia tiliifolia, Syzygium cumini and Shorea roxburghii were classified using spectral angle mapper technique and image-based spectra in the MWS study site. The study shows that nearly 40% area is dominated by A. latifolia and 27.5% by T. grandis in the study site. This study concludes that AVIRIS data can be used in the delineation of species and alpha-diversity mapping at community level; however, the accuracy achieved for species classification is moderate (60%) due to intermixing of species in the study area. For the Shimoga study site in Karnataka, the field spectra were collected using a spectroradiometer and used for the classification for the three dominant tree species using absorption peak decomposition technique. Field-collected pure spectra were analysed and species-wise absorption peaks (Gaussian) with central wavelength, peak amplitude and dispersion were used as the endmembers for classification. AVIRIS-NG data over Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS) study site used for fuel load estimation with narrow band indices calculated from AVIRIS-NG datasets. AVIRIS-NG data for MWS and Shimoga study site were collected during 2 and 5 January 2016, while for SWS site data were collected on 8 February 2016.

TI  - Hydrodynamic investigation of surface hydrological connectivity and its effects on the water quality of seasonal lakes: Insights from a complex floodplain setting (Poyang Lake, China)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Small, seasonal lakes that exist in floodplains are rarely investigated, and yet they play an important role in the protection of biodiversity and are highly susceptible to modification due to human activities. This study presents a first attempt to combine hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods to investigate hydrological connectivity and its relationship with the water quality of nine seasonal lakes within the floodplains of Poyang Lake (China). The hydrodynamic model reproduced reasonably well the hydrological regime of the lake and surrounding floodplains, based on field measurements and remote sensing data. Floodplain lakes exhibit similar water-level dynamics to the main lake during connected periods of flooding, while they decouple from the main lake during recession periods. Geostatistical results reveal that although the north-south hydrological connectivity extends over a longer pathway than the west-east connectivity, the rapid reduction in the west-east connectivity indicates a more sensitive response. The west-east connectivity tends to play a dominant role in affecting the interactions between the main lake and floodplains, as expected. Statistical methods indicate that surface hydrological connectivity across the floodplain results in an enhanced spatial similarity in the water quality of the floodplain lakes, in terms of a multitude of water quality parameters (TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3--N, NO2--N, PO43-, CODMn, and Chl alpha), while surface hydrological isolation was observed to increase the water quality differences between the seasonal lakes. Additionally, enhanced hydrological connectivity may lead to improved water quality of the seasonal lakes from low connectivity to high connectivity condition. Hydrological connectivity may be a key factor controlling the dynamics in water quality between seasonal lakes. The findings of this study support the management of both Poyang Lake and the floodplain wetlands by providing important information on both water resource and water quality, and proposals to better manage the impacts of intensive human activities.

TI  - Significance of the goby <i>Zosterisessor ophiocephalus</i> as a sentinel species for Venice Lagoon contamination: Combining biomarker responses and bioaccumulation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Venice Lagoon is an interesting example of an ecosystem suffering for a considerable anthropogenic impact, resulting in high concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in lagoon sediments and seafood. In this context, biomonitoring is a crucially important task.The present study aimed at evaluating the validity of a multiple biomarker approach in a benthic fish species. A total of 567 Zosterisessor ophiocephalus (Gobiidae) fish were collected in spring and autumn from three areas of Venice Lagoon (Porto Marghera, Val di Brenta, and Ca Roman) showing high, intermediate and low amounts of POPs, respectively. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) mRNA levels, CYP1A protein amount and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD) were measured in pooled liver and gills (mRNA levels only). Such biological data were then compared with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) residues, measured in grass goby muscle by gas chromatography.Aryl hydrocarbon receptor and CYP1A mRNAs, protein and EROD were upregulated in accordance with PCB amounts measured in Z. ophiocephalus muscles. In fact, the highest AHR and CYP1A induction was observed in fish sampled in close proximity of the industrial area of Porto Marghera.Overall, the present study confirm the grass goby as a reliable sentinel species for Venice Lagoon, and AHR/CYP1A/ EROD as a sensitive set of biomarkers of exposure for AHR ligands.

TI  - Absence of p21<SUP>(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1)</SUP> protects against osteopenia and minimizes bone loss after ovariectomy in a mouse model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - p21((WAF1/CIP1/SDI1)) is a critical sentinel of the cell cycle that plays an important role in determining cell fate with respect to proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibition/loss of p21 promotes osteo-chondro differentiation in progenitor/stem cells, and that p21 knockout (p21(-/-)) mice demonstrate enhanced bone regeneration compared to wild-type controls after a non-critical size defect. It was therefore hypothesized that the absence of p21 may also protect against bone loss through enhancing bone formation, tilting the balance away from bone resorption, in an ovariectomy-induced osteopenia mouse model, investigated via microCT imaging. While p21(-/-) mice demonstrated significantly less bone loss after ovariectomy compared to wild-type controls, no increase in the number osteoclasts or osteoblasts in the bone or bone marrow was observed, nor was there an increase in osteoclast activity. Therefore, while the absence of p21 protected mice against estrogen mediated bone loss, the mechanisms/pathways responsible remained elusive. This study demonstrates that p21 may play a significant role in bone remodeling, and a better understanding of how the p21 pathway regulates bone anabolism and catabolism could lead to novel therapies for osteoporosis in the future.

TI  - Rice Yield Estimation Using Parcel-Level Relative Spectra Variables From UAV-Based Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series Vegetation Indices (VIs) are usually used for estimating grain yield. However, multi-temporal VIs may be affected by different background, illumination, and atmospheric conditions, so the absolute differences among time-series VIs may include the effects induced from external conditions in addition to vegetation changes, which will pose a negative effect on the accuracy of crop yield estimation. Therefore, in this study, the parcel-based relative vegetation index (Delta VI) and the parcel-based relative yield are proposed and further used to estimate rice yield. Hyperspectral images at key growth stages, including tillering stage, jointing stage, booting stage, heading stage, filling stage, and ripening stage, as well as rice yield, were obtained with Rikola hyperspectral imager mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in 2017 growing season. Three types of parcel-level relative vegetation indices, including Relative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RNDVI), Relative Ratio Vegetation Index (RRVI), and Relative Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI) are created by using all possible two-band combinations of discrete channels from 500 to 900 nm. The optimal VI type and its band combinations at different growth stages are identified for rice yield estimation. Furthermore, the optimal combinations of different growth stages for yield estimation are determined by F-test and validated using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method. The comparison results show that, for the single-growth-stage model, RNDVI[880,712] at booting stage has the best correlation with rice yield with a R-2-value of 0.75. For the multiple-growth-stage model, RNDVI[808,744] at jointing stage, RNDVI[880,712] at booting stage and RNDVI[808,744] at filling stage gain a higher R-2-value of 0.83 with the mean absolute percentage error of estimated rice yield of 3%. The study demonstrates that the proposed method with parcel-level relative vegetation indices and relative yield can achieve higher yield estimation accuracy because it can make full use of the advantage that remote sensing can monitor relative changes accurately. The new method will further enrich the technology system for crop yield estimation based on remotely sensed data.

TI  - Understanding urban expansion combining macro patterns and micro dynamics in three Southeast Asian megacities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization accelerates urban expansion, especially in populous areas, such as Southeast Asia. The urban forms and changes at the macro level and the dynamics at the patch level are interrelated. Considering its spatiotemporal interdependences and global-local interactions, we propose a framework to quantify urban expansion by combining macro patterns and micro dynamics. Taking three Southeast Asian megacities, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and Manila, as examples, we calculate the urban land densities in concentric rings (macro pattern) and the proximity expansion index (PEI) of new urban patches (micro dynamic) to compare the urban form changes and expansion patterns based on Landsat imagery in 1990, 2000, and 2014. The results show that the urban form changes have close relationships with the local urban patch dynamics. The macro- and micro-level results in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City are interrelated and consistent and the explainable inconsistent results in Manila further reveal the necessity of combination of two scopes. The three megacities developed in different manners, thereby resulting in diverse urban forms and changes. Other methods and technologies combining macro and micro perspectives are encouraged to better understand urban expansion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of climate change and human activities on grassland vegetation variation in the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China initiated the "Grain for Green Project" in 1999 to mitigate soil erosion. The vegetation cover of the Chinese Loess Plateau, one of the most erosive regions in the world, has been greatly increased. However, studies on quantitatively investigating the climate change and human activities on vegetation coverage change were rare. In this study, spatio-temporal changes in vegetation coverage were investigated using MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data over 2000-2016. And a new method was introduced using Net Primary Productivity (NPP) model and relationship between NPP and NDVI to quantitatively and spatially distinguish the NDVI affected by climate change and human activities. Results showed that mean NDVI value over 2009-2016 were 14.46% greater than that over 2000-2007. In order to quantify the contribution of climate change and human activities to vegetation change, an NPP model suitable for the grassland of the Chinese Loess Plateau was identified using biomass observations from field survey and literature. The NDVI affected by climate change (NDVIclimate) was estimated by the NPP model and the relationship between NPP and NDVI. And the NDVI affected by human activities (NDVIhuman) was calculated by actual NDVI minus NDVIclimate. Comparison of the two stages showed that human activities and climate change contributed 42.35% and 57.65% respectively to the Delta NDVI on grassland in the Loess Plateau. After analysis of numerous NDVIhuman related factors, the slopes restored by the "Grain for Green Project" was considered the main influence factor of human activities.

TI  - Observing Sea States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Sea state information is needed for many applications, ranging from safety at sea and on the coast, for which real time data are essential, to planning and design needs for infrastructure that require long time series. The definition of the wave climate and its possible evolution requires high resolution data, and knowledge on possible drift in the observing system. Sea state is also an important climate variable that enters in air-sea fluxes parameterizations. Finally, sea state patterns can reveal the intensity of storms and associated climate patterns at large scales, and the intensity of currents at small scales. A synthesis of user requirements leads to requests for spatial resolution at kilometer scales, and estimations of trends of a few centimeters per decade. Such requirements cannot be met by observations alone in the foreseeable future, and numerical wave models can be combined with in situ and remote sensing data to achieve the required resolution. As today's models are far from perfect, observations are critical in providing forcing data, namely winds, currents and ice, and validation data, in particular for frequency and direction information, and extreme wave heights. In situ and satellite observations are particularly critical for the correction and calibration of significant wave heights to ensure the stability of model time series. A number of developments are underway for extending the capabilities of satellites and in situ observing systems. These include the generalization of directional measurements, an easier exchange of moored buoy data, the measurement of waves on drifting buoys, the evolution of satellite altimeter technology, and the measurement of directional wave spectra from satellite radar instruments. For each of these observing systems, the stability of the data is a very important issue. The combination of the different data sources, including numerical models, can help better fulfill the needs of users.

TI  - CCAAT-displacement protein/cut homeobox transcription factor (CUX1) represses estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in triple-negative breast cancer cells and can be antagonized by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Triple-Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) are the most difficult to treat subtype of breast cancer and are often associated with high nuclear expression of Snail and Cathepsin L (Cat L) protease. We have previously shown that Snail can increase Cat L expression/activity in prostate and breast cancer cells. This study investigated the role of CUX1 (a downstream substrate of Cat L) in TNBC. We showed that Cat L and CUX1 were highly expressed in TNBC patient tissue/cell lines, as compared to ER-positive samples, using cBioportal data and western blot/zymography analyses. Additionally, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that CUX1 directly bound to estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) promoter in MDA-MB-468, a representative TNBC cell line, and that CUX1 siRNA could restore ER-alpha transcription and protein expression. Furthermore, Snail and CUX1 expression in various TNBC cell lines was inhibited by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE, a natural grape product rich in anthocyanins) or Cat L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO) leading to decreased cell invasion and migration. MSKE decreased cell viability and increased expression of apoptotic markers in MDA-MB-468 cells, with no effect on non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. MSKE also decreased CUX1 binding to ER-alpha promoter and restored ER-a expression in TNBC cells, while both MSKE and CUX1 siRNA restored sensitivity to estradiol and 4-hydoxytamoxifen as shown by increased cell viability. Therefore, CUX1 activated by Snail-Cat L signaling may contribute to TNBC via ER-alpha repression, and may be a viable target for TNBC using natural products such as MSKE that targets cancer and not normal cells.

AB  - Objective: To explore the preoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in early breast cancer patients and the involved disturbing factors. Methods: Eighty-three female early breast cancer patients who underwent concurrent surgery in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University between January 2017 and May 2018 were enrolled. CEUS was used to seek SLN and determine lymph node metastasis after signature of preoperative informed consent. Rapid pathological examination was used to determine whether metastasis existed in SLN. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, the differences between CEUS and pathological results, and the involved disturbing factors were evaluated. Results: A total of 212 SLNs were detected by CEUS and SLN biopsy with an average of 2.6 SLNs detected per patient, including 39 SLNs with cancer metastasis (18.4%) and 173 SLNs without cancer metastasis (81.6%). Among the 83 patients, 29 patients were predicted SLN-positive preoperatively utilizing CEUS (including 21 cases with SLN pathological metastasis and 8 cases with non-metastasis), 54 patients were predicted SLN-negative (including 5 cases with SLN pathological metastasis and 49 cases with non-metastasis). The preoperative evaluation of SLN utilizing CEUS were performed with a sensitivity of 80.8% (21/26), specificity of 86.0% (49/57), positive predictive value of 72.4% (21/29), and negative predictive value of 90.7% (49/54), positive likelihood ratio of 5.75, negative likelihood ratio of 0.22, and the accuracy of 84.3% (70/83), respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.834 (95% CI: 0.736-0.906). The primary tumor mean size of SLN-negative group predicted preoperatively utilizing CEUS was (1.78±0.14) cm, and that of the SLN positive group was (2.64±0.19) cm. The difference between the two groups was (0.86±0.24) cm with statistical significance (P=0.000 6). The SLN mean size of SLN-negative group (141 SLNs) was (1.41±0.05) cm and that of SLN-positive group (71 SLNs) was (1.69±0.07) cm. The difference between the two groups was (0.28±0.09) cm with statistical significance (P=0.002 8). Conclusions: Preoperative CEUS possesses the predictive value for SLN metastasis in early breast cancer. The predicted results may be influenced by the primary tumor size and the SLN size.

TI  - Pre-crop Values From Satellite Images for Various Previous and Subsequent Crop Combinations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monocultural land use challenges sustainability of agriculture. Pre-crop value indicates the benefits of a previous crop for a subsequent crop in crop sequencing and facilitates diversification of agricultural systems. Traditional field experiments are resource intensive and evaluate pre-crop values only for a limited number of previous and subsequent crops. We developed a dynamic method based on Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values to estimate pre-crop values on a field parcel scale. The NDVI-values were compared to the region specific 90th percentile of each crop and year and thereby, an NDVI-gap was determined. The NDVI-gaps for each subsequent crop in the case of monocultural crop sequencing were compared to that for other previous crops in rotation and thereby, pre-crop values for a high number of previous and subsequent crop combinations were estimated. The pre-crop values ranged from +16% to -16%. Especially grain legumes and rapeseed were valuable as pre-crops, which is well in line with results from field experiments. Such data on pre-crop values can be updated and expanded every year. For the first time, a high number of previous and following crop combinations, originating from farmer's fields, is available to support diversification of currently monocultural crop sequencing patterns in agriculture.

TI  - Association of HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis With Incidence of Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Individuals at High Risk of HIV Infection
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Emerging evidence suggests that risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) increases among gay and bisexual men following initiation of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).OBJECTIVE To describe STI incidence and behavioral risk factors among a cohort of predominantly gay and bisexual men who use PrEP, and to explore changes in STI incidence following PrEP commencement.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Expanded (PrEPX) Study, a multisite, open-label intervention study, was nested within the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) clinic network. A total of 4275 participants were enrolled (July 26, 2016-April 1, 2018) in Victoria, Australia. Of these, 2981 enrolled at 5 ACCESS clinics (3 primary care, 1 sexual health, and 1 community-based HIV rapid testing service), had at least 1 follow-up visit, and were monitored until April 30, 2018.EXPOSURES Upon enrollment, participants received daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumurate and emtricitabine for HIV PrEP, quarterly HIV and STI testing, and clinical monitoring.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was incidence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis. Incidence rates and hazard ratios describing behavioral risk factors of STI diagnosis were calculated. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs), adjusted for change in testing frequency, described changes in STI incidence from 1-year preenrollment to study follow-up among participants with preenrollment testing data (n = 1378).RESULTS Among the 2981 individuals (median age, 34 years [interquartile range, 28-42]), 98.5% identified as gay or bisexual males, 29% used PrEP prior to enrollment, 89 (3%) withdrew and were censored at date of withdrawal, leaving 2892 (97.0%) enrolled at final follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 1.1 years (3185.0 person-years), 2928 STIs were diagnosed among 1427 (48%) participants (1434 chlamydia, 1242 gonorrhea, 252 syphilis). STI incidence was 91.9 per 100 person-years, with 736 participants (25%) accounting for 2237 (76%) of all STIs. Among 2058 participants with complete data for multivariable analysis, younger age, greater partner number, and group sex were associated with greater STI risk, but condom use was not. Among 1378 participants with preenrollment testing data, STI incidence increased from 69.5 per 100 person-years prior to enrollment to 98.4 per 100 person-years during follow-up (IRR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.29-1.56]). After adjusting for testing frequency, the increase in incidence from 1 year preenrollment to follow-up was significant for any STI (adjusted IRR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]) and for chlamydia (adjusted IRR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.04-1.33]).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among gay and bisexual men using PrEP, STIs were highly concentrated among a subset, and receipt of PrEP after study enrollment was associated with an increased incidence of STIs compared with preenrollment. These findings highlight the importance of frequent STI testing among gay and bisexual men using PrEP.

TI  - Lack of Evidence of Sylvatic Transmission of Dengue Viruses in the Amazon Rainforest Near Iquitos, Peru
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are currently responsible for more human morbidity and mortality than any other known arbovirus, and all four DENV are known to exist in sylvatic cycles that might allow these viruses to persist if the urban (Aedes aegypti) cycle could be controlled. To determine whether DENV were being maintained in a sylvatic cycle in a forested area about 14 km southwest of Iquitos, Peru, a city in which all 4 serotypes of DENV circulate, we placed 20 DENV seronegative Aotus monkeys in cages either in the canopy or near ground level for a total of 125.6 months. Despite capturing >66,000 mosquitoes in traps that collected some of the mosquitoes attracted to these monkeys, blood samples obtained once a month from each animal were tested and found to be negative by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM and IgG antibodies to dengue, yellow fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Oropouche, and Mayaro viruses. Although all four DENV serotypes were endemic in nearby Iquitos, the findings of this study did not support a DENV sylvatic maintenance and transmission cycle in a selected area of the Amazon rainforest in northeastern Peru.

TI  - Cloud detection on small satellites based on lightweight U-net and image compression
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective onboard cloud detection method in small satellites will greatly improve the downlink data transmission efficiency and reduce the platform memory cost. A methodology combining a convolutional neural network and wavelet image compression is proposed to explore the possibility of onboard cloud detection. A lightweight neural network based on U-net architecture is established and evaluated. The red, green, blue, and infrared waveband images from the Landsat-8 dataset are trained and tested to estimate the performance of the mythology. Then a LeGall-5/3 wavelet transform is applied on the dataset to accelerate the neural network and improve the feasibility of the onboard implementation. The experiment results on advanced RISC machines-based embedded platform illustrate that by taking advantage of a mature image compression system in small satellites; the time cost and peak memory cost required by the neural network will be reduced significantly while the segment accuracy is only slightly decreased. The proposed method provides a good possibility of onboard cloud detection for small satellites. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - A new description of probability density distributions of polar mesospheric clouds
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we present a new description of statistical probability density functions (pdfs) of polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs). The analysis is based on observations of maximum backscatter, ice mass density, ice particle radius, and number density of ice particles measured by the ALOMAR Rayleigh-Mie-Raman lidar for all PMC seasons from 2002 to 2016. From this data set we derive a new class of pdfs that describe the statistics of PMC events that is different from previous statistical methods using the approach of an exponential distribution commonly named the g distribution. The new analysis describes successfully the probability distributions of ALOMAR lidar data. It turns out that the former g-function description is a special case of our new approach. In general the new statistical function can be applied to many kinds of different PMC parameters, e.g., maximum backscatter, integrated backscatter, ice mass density, ice water content, ice particle radius, ice particle number density, or albedo measured by satellites. As a main advantage the new method allows us to connect different observational PMC distributions of lidar and satellite data, and also to compare with distributions from ice model studies. In particular, the statistical distributions of different ice parameters can be compared with each other on the basis of a common assessment that facilitates, for example, trend analysis of PMC.

TI  - Sampling bias adjustment for sparsely sampled satellite measurements applied to ACE-FTS carbonyl sulfide observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - When computing climatological averages of atmospheric trace-gas mixing ratios obtained from satellite-based measurements, sampling biases arise if data coverage is not uniform in space and time. Homogeneous spatiotemporal coverage is essentially impossible to achieve. Solar occultation measurements, by virtue of satellite orbit and the requirement of direct observation of the sun through the atmosphere, result in particularly sparse spatial coverage. In this proof-of-concept study, a method is presented to adjust for such sampling biases when calculating climatological means. The method is demonstrated using carbonyl sulfide (OCS) measurements at 16 km altitude from the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer). At this altitude, OCS mixing ratios show a steep gradient between the poles and Equator. ACE-FTS measurements, which are provided as vertically resolved profiles, and integrated stratospheric OCS columns are used in this study. The bias adjustment procedure requires no additional information other than the satellite data product itself. In particular, the method does not rely on atmospheric models with potentially unreliable transport or chemistry parameterizations, and the results can be used uncompromised to test and validate such models. It is expected to be generally applicable when constructing climatologies of long-lived tracers from sparsely and heterogeneously sampled satellite measurements. In the first step of the adjustment procedure, a regression model is used to fit a 2-D surface to all available ACE-FTS OCS measurements as a function of day-of-year and latitude. The regression model fit is used to calculate an adjustment factor that is then used to adjust each measurement individually. The mean of the adjusted measurement points of a chosen latitude range and season is then used as the bias-free climatological value. When applying the adjustment factor to seasonal averages in 30 degrees zones, the maximum spatiotemporal sampling bias adjustment was 11 % for OCS mixing ratios at 16 km and 5 % for the stratospheric OCS column. The adjustments were validated against the much denser and more homogeneous OCS data product from the limb-sounding MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) instrument, and both the direction and magnitude of the adjustments were in agreement with the adjustment of the ACE-FTS data.

TI  - Investigating the effect of the physical scattering mechanism of the dual-polarization sentinel-1 data on the temporal coherence optimization results
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) is an effective technique for increasing the number and phase quality of selected persistent scatterer (PS) pixels. In this technique, multitemporal polarimetric data is used to find the dominant scattering mechanism of targets in a stack of SAR data by polarimetric optimization and to improve the performance of PSI methods for deformation studies. The main goal of polarimetric optimization is to find the optimum scattering mechanism to generate interferograms with better quality. In this paper, we investigated the effect of the physical scattering mechanism on the temporal coherence optimization results. In this framework, we only optimized the physical scattering mechanism. This optimization is based on maximizing the temporal coherency criterion by changing the type of scattering mechanism to increase the number of PS with good phase quality. The proposed method is tested using a dataset of 17 dual-pol SAR data (VV/VH) acquired by Sentinel1-A satellite. This paper concludes that the phase quality of PS pixels can be improved by optimization of physical scattering mechanism. Also, the results show an overall increase of PS pixels density in different areas with respect to the conventional channel of VV.

TI  - Abnormal disappearance of Duoqing Co lake between November 2015 and April 2016, due to far-field aseismic creeping of the southern Yadong-Gulu rift of Tibet, triggered by the 2015 Ms 8.1 Nepal earthquake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Duoqing Co is a 60 km(2) outflow lake in the N-trending Pagri graben, located at the southern end of the Yadong-Gulu rift in Tibet. The water in this lake suddenly disappeared between November 2015 and April 2016, closely following the Ms 8.1 (Mw 7.8) Nepal earthquake in April 2015. Both, geomorphological and remote sensing data indicate the existence of blind faults striking NNE along the east boundary of Duoqing Co lake. There were also several nearly NE-trending extensional cracks preserved in the dried lakebed, apparently formed in response to creeping deformation of the underlying rock. Based on field studies and analysis of meteorological and remote sensing data, it is suggested that this phenomenon cannot be explained by evaporation linked to climate change nor can it be related to human activity. Instead, it is considered that the lake water drained through the extensional cracks formed in the lakebed as it responded to the far-field effects of the 2015 Nepal earthquake. It is proposed that a shift in regional tectonics occurred as a result of the Nepal earthquake, causing a sharp increase in stress accumulation along the seismically locked Bhutan-Sikkim zone on the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) fault, which was accommodated by the extension of the Pagri graben in the southern Yadong-Gulu rift. It is believed that the crust may have reached a critical stress-state that resulted in strain hardening and brittle failure throughout the region along the Bhutan-Sikkim segment of the MHT. If so, considering the high potential for tectonic activity along the segment of the MHT, it may be worth paying attention to deformational changes and potential geomorphological precursors that might appear in the seismically locked Bhutan-Sikkim gap to predict future earthquakes.

TI  - Climbing up the hills: expansion of agriculture around the Ruma National Park, Kenya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A major factor driving changes in land use and land cover (LULC) is the human population growth associated with an expanded agricultural production. In the Lambwe valley in Homabay County, Kenya, the most important reason for accelerated population growth in the last decades was the control of the tsetse fly, the biological vector of trypanosomiasis. The goal of our study is to quantify the changes of LULC in the Lambwe valley in the last 30 years, giving special attention to the Ruma National Park. We classified three Landsat images of the Lambwe valley from 1984, 2002, and 2014 by Random Forests. The Ruma National Park itself showed a diverse composition probably supported by frequent fires that lead to a short-term reduction of savanna. Nevertheless, the national park is well protected, and no profound changes could be observed. Outside the national park, agricultural area increased by about 12%, savanna and the dense forest, that used to grow at higher altitudes, decreased by about 8% and 6%, respectively. In particular, agriculture expands towards higher altitudes with steeper slopes thus leading to a larger risk of soil erosion.

Generally, all these measurements exhibit sharp peaks over and near the three nearby inhabited continents: South America, Africa, and Australia. This pattern indicates the large emission effect of anthropogenic activities and biomass burning processes. High AOD is also found over the Southern Atlantic Ocean, probably because of the sea salt production driven by strong winds. Since the pristine Antarctic atmosphere can be polluted by transport of air pollutants from the mid-latitudes, we analyze the 10-day back trajectories that arrive at Antarctic ground stations in consideration of the spatial distribution of mid-latitudinal AOD, CO, NO2, and HCHO. We find that the influence of mid-latitudinal emission differs across Antarctic regions: western Antarctic regions show relatively more back trajectories from the mid-latitudes, while the eastern Antarctic regions do not show large intrusions of mid-latitudinal air masses. Finally, we estimate the long-term trends in AOD, CO, NO2, and HCHO during the past decade (2005-2016). While CO shows a significant negative trend, the others show overall positive trends. Seasonal and regional differences in trends are also discussed.

TI  - Exceptional red-tide of fish-killing dinoflagellate <i>Karenia mikimotoi</i> promoted by typhoon-induced upwelling
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An exceptionally extensive bloom of the dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi caused mass mortality of aquaculture fishes leading the severe economic loss in 2017 in Imari Bay, Japan, Development of the 2017 bloom completely differed from other recent blooms (in 2012 and 2014). Bloom dynamics and its controlling factors were examined by field survey, numerical modeling and satellite data analysis. The bloom initially developed in the eastern area of Imari Bay as in the 2012 and 2014 blooms. Subsequently, the bloom broadly expanded to the western area and cell density increased to over 10,000 cells ml(-1). Horizontal expansion of the bloom resulted in mass mortality of aquaculture fishes. Horizontal expansion and increase of cell density occurred accompanying a temperature decrease and nutrient increase in the mid and lower layers of the central area. Results of the numerical model indicated two factors related to the passage of a typhoon that promoted the bloom; horizontal bloom expansion induced by the wind-driven current and nutrient supply from the typhoon-induced coastal upwelling. This implies that the effect of the typhoon differentiated the 2017 bloom from previous blooms. The risk of harmful blooms as in the 2017 Karenia bloom in Imari Bay potentially will increase due to the effects of global warming.

TI  - Spatio-statistical optimization of image segmentation process for building footprint extraction using very high-resolution WorldView 3 satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Segmentation process in building footprint extraction using object-based image analysis is crucial due to several factors, such as the spatial and spectral resolution of remote sensing images and the complexity of geo-objects. Consequently, the selection of suitable parameters to ensure the best segmentation quality remains a challenge. To overcome this issue, a spatio-statistical optimization technique that combines the Taguchi statistical method and a spatial plateau objective function (POF) was developed to extract building footprint from high-resolution Worldview 3 (WV3) satellite data. Initially, the Taguchi statistical method was used to design the orthogonal array of 25 experiments with three segmentation parameters, namely, scale, shape, and compactness, each having five varying values that directly affect the quality of segmentation. Asserted that, the scale factor was classified into small and large scales to avoid over-segmentation and under-segmentation problems. Afterwards, the POF, which is also a spatial optimization approach for evaluating segmentation quality, was computed for each experiment using their respective level combinations. Next, the combination of factor level in the orthogonal array and the calculated POF was merged to produce main effects and interaction plots for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), whereby the smaller-is-better and larger-is-better options of the Taguchi's SNR were tested on each parameter to maximize their effects. After that, the segmentation quality obtained from the proposed method was assessed by comparing with the benchmark method introduced by Dragut and result indicates that the proposed method was better than the benchmark method. Subsequently, the final optimal parameters were used for segmentation process in eCognition and the image object was classified into five land cover classes (building, road, water, trees, and grass) by using a supervised non-parametric statistical learning technique, support vector machine classifier. Finally, the building features was extracted, and the detection accuracy was evaluated based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Result shows the area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.804 with p < 0.0001 at 95% confidence level. This verifies that the proposed method is effective for building detection with high accuracy and the integration of Taguchi and objective function managed to determine the optimal segmentation parameters. Optimization segmentation parameters can later be applied to distinguish roof materials and conditions.

TI  - Effect of the eQuality Health Bwindi Scheme on Utilization of Health Services at Bwindi Community Hospital in Uganda
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: eQuality Health Bwindi (eQHB), a Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme was launched in March 2010 with the aim of generating income to maintain high quality care as well as increasing access to and utilization of health services at Bwindi Community Hospital (BCH). The main objective of this study was to explore evidence showing that eQHB scheme affected access and utilization of health services at BCH. The evidence generated would be used to inform decision making, policy and scale up of the scheme.Methods and Materials: This study applied qualitative and quantitative research methods. It involved a review of hospital records for the period July 2009-June 2014, a survey of 272 households, four focus group discussions, and six key informant interviews. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques were applied for the analysis.Results: Outpatient attendance, inpatient admissions, and deliveries at the hospital increased by 65, 73, and 27%, respectively between FY 2009/10 and FY 2012/13. Utilization of health services by sick children from insured participants was greater than that of the uninsured members of the community (p -value = 0.0038). BCH services became more affordable. However, opting out of the scheme at a later stage in the review period was attributed to rising unaffordable premiums and co-payments. Failure to afford scheme membership, residing far from BCH and limited understanding of health insurance led to reduced BCH service utilization.Conclusions: eQHB has potential to increase access and utilization of health services at BCH. The challenges are; limited understanding of the concept of health insurance and unaffordable premiums and co-payments set to enable provision of high quality services.Recommendations: Based on these findings, intensified community sensitization on health insurance, establishment of satellite health facilities by BCH to bring services closer to members and transformation of eQHB to a savings/credit society in order to grow savings and subsequently reduce premiums are recommended. Government of Uganda should engage CBHIs countrywide to discuss achievement of UHC and establishment of a national health insurance scheme. A further study to guide setting of affordable premiums and copayments for eQHB is also recommended.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of fog and low clouds in the Namib unveiled with ground- and space-based observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog is an essential component of Namib-region ecosystems. Current knowledge on Namib-region fog patterns and processes is limited by a lack of coherent observations in space and time. In this study, data from multiple satellite platforms and station measurements paint a coherent picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fog and low cloud (FLC) distribution. It is found that observed seasonal FLC patterns derived from satellite observations differ from fog measurements at coastal station locations, whereas they agree further inland. This is linked to an observed seasonal cycle in the vertical structure of FLCs that determines the probability of low-level clouds touching the ground. For the first time, these observations are complemented by spatially coherent statistics concerning the diurnal cycle of FLCs using geostationary satellite data. The average timing of the start of the diurnal FLC cycle is found to strongly depend on the distance to the coastline (correlation approximate to 0.85 north of 25 degrees S), a clear indication of dominant advective processes. In the central Namib, FLCs typically occur 2-4h later than in other coastal regions, possibly due to local advection patterns. The findings lead to a new conceptual model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fog and low clouds in the Namib.

TI  - A new microdispersed albumin derivative potentially useful for radio-guided surgery of occult breast cancer lesions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a new nuclear imaging agent, 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyI)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid of human albumin (HAC), potentially suitable for application in the Radio-guided Occult Lesion Localization (ROLL) of non-palpable mammalian cancerous lesions, as a tool to overtake the short radio-signal half-life of the technetium-99m based radiopharmaceutical currently used. This conjugate is a microsized powder aggregate, water-insoluble between pH 3 and 8.5, obtained by conjugating the protein with the macrocyclic chelating agent DOTA through a one-pot reaction in aqueous medium. The product has been fully characterized and is stable to the thermal conditions adopted for labeling; after radiolabeling with longer half-life radionuclides such as(177)Lu or(111)In, it has shown radiochemical purity (RCP) >90% and resulted stable when stored in saline or plasma for 6 days at 37 degrees C. A mu PET/CT study, performed in vivo on adult female rats, showed that the radioactivity of HAC labeled with Cu-64 remained located in the mammary glands for at least 40 h, without diffusion or drainage in healthy tissues or in the lymphatic circulation. This new imaging agent might make the ROLL procedure more accessible, safe and flexible, promoting a significant time and cost reduction of this intervention. Moreover, HAC might also be used in other radio-guided surgical procedures in oncology.

TI  - Outbreak of hepatitis A virus infection in Taiwan, June 2015 to September 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were notified of increasing acute hepatitis A (AHA) in June 2015. Serum and/or stool from AHA patients and sewage samples were tested for hepatitis A virus (HAV). We defined outbreak cases as AHA patients with illness onset after June 2015 and with an HAV sequence less than 0.5% different from that of the TA -15 outbreak strain. We analysed characteristics and food exposures between outbreak and non-outbreak cases between January 2014 (start of enhanced surveillance) and February 2016. From June 2015 to September 2017, there were 1,563 AHA patients with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range (IQR): 26-38); the male-tofemale ratio was 8.8 and 585 (37%) had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. TA -15 was detected in 82% (852/1,033) of AHA patients, and 14% (74/540) of sewage samples tested since July 2015. Infection with the TA -15 strain was associated with having HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), recent oral-anal sex and men who have sex with men (MSM). The Taiwan CDC implemented an HAV vaccine campaign starting from October 2016 where 62% (15,487/24,879) of people at risk were vaccinated against HAV. We recommend HAV vaccination for at-risk populations and continuous surveillance to monitor control measures.

TI  - Advanced Lake Shoreline Extraction Approach by Integration of SAR Image and LIDAR Data
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Noise and an abnormal distributed-image histogram is the main challenge of using SAR data. From this point of view, this study's authors motivated the non-use of user-defined input parameters. To achieve this purpose, a fuzzy approach was proposed to extract shoreline from SENTINEL-1A data. The parameters in the processing of the SENTINEL-1A image were generated automatically with LIDAR-intensity-derived object-based segmentation results. The LIDAR-intensity image was segmented with the Mean-shift method. The corresponding result was used to estimate the input parameters for fuzzy clustering of the SENTINEL-1A image. Fuzzy segmentation was proposed, due to the expected large number of values regarding water and land classes except for the pixels along the shoreline. The memberships for land and water classes were separately computed. In the proposed approach, the results from LIDAR and SENTINEL-1A dataset are promising, with differences below 1 pixel (10 m) by evaluation with the used reference vector data.

TI  - Performance of SSEBop model for estimating wheat actual evapotranspiration in the Brazilian Savannah region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a scenario where supplying the increasing demand for food depends highly on irrigation, understanding the temporal and spatial variation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is essential for water resources management. In the last decades, several models for mapping and monitoring ETa using remote sensing data were developed and studied. In this work, the Simplified Surface Energy Balance for Operational Application (SSEBop) model was applied to estimate actual evapotranspiration of irrigated wheat in the Cerrado (Brazilian Savannahs) region, using ETM+/Landsat 7 and OLI-TIRS/Landsat 8 images. The results were compared with evapotranspiration calculated by the Bowen ratio method. Considering the data referring to satellites overpasses days, SSEBop overestimated ETa by an average of 13.6%, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) equal to 0.82 and root mean square error (RMSE) equal to 0.89 mm d(-1). Considering the daily data for the entire period, including the extrapolation for the days between the satellites overpasses, SSEBop overestimated ETa by an average of 5.5%, with R-2 equal to 0.66 and RMSE equal to 0.95 mm d(-1). The results obtained demonstrated a reliable performance of the SSEBop for estimating actual evapotranspiration of irrigated wheat in the Cerrado, which can contribute to improve the irrigation efficiency and reduce water use conflicts. Considering the simplicity of the modeling concept and operational implementation, it can also be beneficial for water agencies on water resources planning, management and regulation in the region.

TI  - Mortality attributable to seasonal influenza in Greece, 2013 to 2017: variation by type/subtype and age, and a possible harvesting effect
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Estimating the contribution of influenza to excess mortality in the population presents substantial methodological challenges. Aim: In a modelling study we combined environmental, epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data to estimate influenza-attributable mortality in Greece, over four seasons (2013/14 to 2016/17), specifically addressing the lag dimension and the confounding effect of temperature. Methods: Associations of influenza type/subtype-specific incidence proxies and of daily mean temperature with mortality were estimated with a distributed-lag nonlinear model with 30 days of maximum lag, separately by age group (all ages, 15-64 and >= 65 years old). Total and weekly deaths attributable to influenza and cold temperatures were calculated. Results: Overall influenza-attributable mortality was 23.6 deaths per 100,000 population per year (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.8 to 29.2), and varied greatly between seasons, by influenza type/subtype and by age group, with the vast majority occurring in persons aged >= 65 years. Most deaths were attributable to A(H3N2), followed by influenza B. During periods of A(H1N1)pdmo9 circulation, weekly attributable mortality to this subtype among people >= 65 years old increased rapidly at first, but then fell to zero and even negative, suggesting a mortality displacement (harvesting) effect. Mortality attributable to cold temperatures was much higher than that attributable to influenza. Conclusions: Studies of influenza-attributable mortality need to consider distributed-lag effects, stratify by age group and adjust both for circulating influenza virus types/subtypes and daily mean temperatures, in order to produce reliable estimates. Our approach addresses these issues, is readily applicable in the context of influenza surveillance, and can be useful for other countries.

TI  - Midwinter melts in the Canadian prairies: energy balance and hydrological effects
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowpack accumulation and depletion are important elements of the hydrological cycle in the Canadian prairies. The surface runoff generated during snowmelt is transformed into streamflow or fills numerous depressions driving the focussed recharge of groundwater in this dry setting. The snowpack in the prairies can undergo several cycles of accumulation and depletion in a winter. The timing of the melt affects the mechanisms of snowpack depletion and their hydrological implications. The effects of midwinter melts were investigated at four instrumented sites in the Canadian prairies. Unlike net radiation-driven snowmelt during spring melt, turbulent sensible heat fluxes were the dominant source of energy inputs for midwinter melt occurring in the period with low solar radiation inputs. Midwinter melt events affect several aspects of hydrological cycle with lower runoff ratios than subsequent spring melt events, due to their role in the timing of the focussed recharge. Remote sensing data have shown that midwinter melt events regularly occur under the present climate throughout the Canadian prairies, indicating applicability of the study findings throughout the region.

TI  - Dust Aerosol Detection by the Modified CO₂ Slicing Method.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Dust aerosols, which have diverse and strong influences on the environment, must be monitored. Satellite data are effective for monitoring atmospheric conditions globally. In this work, the modified CO₂ slicing method, a cloud detection technique using thermal infrared data from space, was applied to GOSAT data to detect the dust aerosol layer height. The results were compared using lidar measurements. Comparison of horizontal distributions found for northern Africa during summer revealed that both the relative frequencies of the low level aerosol layer from the slicing method and the dust frequencies of CALIPSO are high in northern coastal areas. Comparisons of detected layer top heights using collocated data with CALIPSO and ground-based lidar consistently showed high detection frequencies of the lower level aerosol layer, although the slicing method sometimes produces overestimates. This tendency is significant over land. The main causes of this tendency might be uncertainty of the surface skin temperature and a temperature inversion layer in the atmosphere. The results revealed that obtaining the detailed behavior of dust aerosols using the modified slicing method alone is difficult.

TI  - Seasonal trend analysis (STA) of MODIS vegetation index time series for the mangrove canopy of the Teacapan-Agua Brava lagoon system, Mexico
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly time series, from 2001 to 2016, of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MOD13Q1 products were analyzed with Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA), assessing seasonal and long-term changes in the mangrove canopy of the Teacapan-Agua Brava lagoon system, the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Mexican Pacific coast. Profiles from both vegetation indices described similar phenological trends, but the EVI was more sensitive in detecting intra-annual changes. We identified a seasonal cycle dominated by Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle mixed patches, with the more closed canopy occurring in the early autumn, and the maximum opening in the dry season. Mangrove patches dominated by Avicennia germinans displayed seasonal peaks in the winter. Curves fitted for the seasonal vegetation indices were better correlated with accumulated precipitation and solar radiation among the assessed climate variables (Pearson's correlation coefficients, estimated for most of the variables, were r >= 0.58 p < 0.0001), driving seasonality for tidal basins with mangroves dominated by L. racemosa and R. mangle. For tidal basins dominated by A. germinans, the maximum and minimum temperatures and monthly precipitation fit better seasonally with the vegetation indices (r >= 0.58, p < 0.0001). Significant mangrove canopy reductions were identified in all the analyzed tidal basins (z values for the Mann-Kendall test <= -1.96), but positive change trends were recorded in four of the basins, while most of the mangrove canopy (approximately 87%) displayed only seasonal canopy changes or canopy recovery (z > -1.96). The most resilient mangrove forests were distributed in tidal basins dominated by L. racemosa and R. mangle (Mann-Kendal Tau t >= 0.4, p <= 0.03), while basins dominated by A. germinans showed the most evidence of disturbance.

TI  - Advancing Transformative Eco-social Change: Shifting from Modernist to Holistic Foundations
T2  - AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a reconciliatory, integrative, and transformative way forward for addressing philosophical incongruities between the emerging foundations of eco-social work and inherent modernist assumptions underpinning conventional social work practice. Although modernity has enabled the profession to pursue certain freedoms, such as individual empowerment and self-determination, a modernist worldview is today critiqued for philosophical assumptions associated with the unsustainable use of Earth's natural resources. By advancing transformative eco-social change, opportunities to broaden the profession's conventional philosophical base to include holism and interdependence with the natural world will be explored. Implications centre on the need to incorporate perspective transformation and critical reflexivity, and to revise the framing of fundamental documents, such as codes of ethics, practice standards, and education requirements. By integrating transformative eco-social change, social work can improve the capacity to develop a coherent and ethical response to ecological and social problems.

TI  - Mechanisms how mucosal innate immunity affects progression of allergic airway disease
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Activation of antigen-independent inflammation (a.k.a. the 'innate' immune response (IIR)) plays a complex role in allergic asthma (AA). Although activation of the pulmonary IIR by aerosolized bacterial lipopolysaccharide early in life may be protective of AA, respiratory viral infections promote AA. The mechanisms how the mucosal IIR promotes allergic sensitization, remodeling, and altered epithelial signaling are not understood. Areas covered: This manuscript overviews: 1. Mechanistic studies identifying how allergens and viral patterns activate the mucosal IIR; 2. Research that reveals a major role played by specialized epithelial cells in the bronchiolar-alveolar junction in triggering inflammation and remodeling; 3. Reports linking the mucosal IIR with epithelial cell-state change and barrier disruption; and, 4. Observations relating mesenchymal transition with the expansion of the myofibroblast population. Expert commentary: Luminal allergens and viruses activate TLR signaling in key sentinel cells producing epithelial cell state transition, disrupting epithelial barrier function, and expanding the pulmonary myofibroblast population. These signals are transduced through a common NF kappa B/RelA -bromodomain containing four (BRD4) pathway, an epigenetic remodeling complex reprogramming the genome. Through this pathway, the mucosal IIR is a major modifier of adaptive immunity, AA and acute exacerbation-induced remodeling.

TI  - Mosquito biodiversity and mosquito-borne viruses in the United Arab Emirates
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last 50 years, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has experienced rapid population growth and urbanization. Urbanization is known to influence biodiversity, and there appears to be a link between the emergence of arboviruses and urban growth. Very little is known about the UAE mosquito species richness and dominant vectors. We performed a mosquito survey comparing peri-urban sites in Dubai and Al Ain to a protected, natural site in Fujairah emirate. We measured mosquito biodiversity and species composition, and screened mosquito pools for common arboviruses to measure arbovirus activity in the region.We report ten species of mosquitoes from the UAE, with highest species diversity in the natural site, a protected wadi near the eastern coast. The predominant mosquito was Culex perexiguus, and was associated with peri-urban habitats. The site with lowest mosquito species diversity but relatively high species richness was the peri-urban site of Al Ain Zoo, where we identified Bagaza virus and Barkedji virus, two flaviviruses, in pools of Cx. perexiguus.Decreased mosquito biodiversity was associated with increased levels of urbanization. The predominance of two species at peri-urban sites was related to the availability of their larval habitats. Arboviruses were associated with the presence of a single predominant mosquito species, Cx. perexiguus.

TI  - On Simmel's Relativism and the Foundations of a Relational Approach
T2  - GERMANIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This text elaborates on the idea that Simmel's relational approach was born within his sociological works, and later on became crucial for his whole oeuvre, thus becoming his worldview, his cosmovision and metaphysical principle. His relational approach structured his three interrelated programmatic texts for the field of sociology: the essay 'The Problem of Sociology' ([1894] GSG5,1992:52-61), Sociology's first chapter 'The Problem of Sociology' ([1908] GSG11,1992:13-62), and Fundamental Questions of Sociology's first chapter 'The Area of Sociology' ([1917] GSG16,1999:62-87). A critical comparison of these three texts will allow us to trace the continuities and changes of Simmel's relational approach, which had consequences far beyond his sociological thinking.

TI  - Quantifying the discriminatory power of remote sensing technologies for benthic habitat mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When mapping benthic habitats using remotely sensed data, the ability to discriminate between pairs of habitats is a key measure of the usefulness of a set of one or more input covariates. In the case where some input data is already available, but a superior map is sought, map-makers would like to know which additional remote sensing data would make the greatest improvement to the quality of their maps. Depending on the purpose of the map, this could be measured by the extent to which a selected pair of habitats is discriminated. This study exploits an existing data-rich study site in order to provide guidance for the use of remote sensing technology in regions where such data do not exist already. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) reflectivity, multibeam backscatter, World View 2 (WV2) bands 1-4, multibeam bathymetry, and depth-derived variables are analysed to determine the extent to which they enable benthic habitats of interest to be discriminated from one another in a statistical sense. Ground truth is employed in the form of towed video. Quantitative results are tabulated for each of the six pairs of four key habitat classes: macroalgae, seagrass, sand, and reef. The technique of Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is used to calculate ratios of between-class to within-class variation and cross-validated error rate estimates are calculated for the best combination of N variables, where N varies from 1 to 8. It is found that: Reef and Macroalgae classes cannot be statistically distinguished with the technologies and training methods studied here; WV2 augmented with depth provides good discrimination between the separable classes; multibeam echosounder depth and backscatter data both provide good information for mapping cover types, but in general are not as useful as optical data if it is available. LiDAR reflectivity is a very useful covariate, which has comparable discriminatory power to any one of the first three WV2 bands, with the added potential to penetrate to greater depths than the passive satellite sensors.

TI  - Automated global delineation of human settlements from 40 years of Landsat satellite data archives
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This paper presents the analysis of Earth Observation data records collected between 1975 and 2014 for assessing the extent and temporal evolution of the built-up surface in the frame of the Global Human Settlement Layer project. The scale of the information produced by the study enables the assessment of the whole continuum of human settlements from rural hamlets to megacities. The study applies enhanced processing methods as compared to the first production of the GHSL baseline data. The major improvements include the use of a more refined learning set on built-up areas derived from Sentinel-1 data which allowed testing the added-value of incremental learning in big data analytics. Herein, the new features of the GHSL built-up grids and the methods are described and compared with the previous ones using a reference set of building footprints for 277 areas of interest. The results show a gradual improvement in the accuracy measures with a gain of 3.6% in the balanced accuracy, between the first production of the GHSL baseline and the latest GHSL multitemporal built-up grids. A validation of the multitemporal component is also conducted at the global scale establishing the reliability of the built-up layer across time.

TI  - Are We Cutting Enough? A Five-Year Audit of Melanoma Excision Margins in the South East of Ireland
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Malignant melanoma is the fifth commonest invasive cancer in Ireland. The British Association of Dermatology (BAD) guidelines are currently the recognized standard for melanoma related surgery. The aim was to examine adherence to BAD guidelines and establish contributing factors resulting in non-adherence to guidelines in a group of melanoma patients in the South East Region of Ireland. Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained melanoma registry of all patients undergoing surgery in the South East Region of Ireland from January 2011 to 2016 was performed. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. Univariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to examine factors associated with not meeting the BAD margin excision guidelines Data with a p < 0.05 was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: 459 patients underwent surgery for invasive cutaneous melanoma. 314 (68.4%) surgeries had excision margins adequately recorded and of these 234(74.5%) fulfilled the BAD guidelines. 267(58.2%) patients (2011-2016 inclusive) qualified for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) with a cancer staging of pT1b or higher. Of these patients 100(37%) agreed to proceed to a SNLB following informed discussion. 33 had a positive sentinel node. On multivariate analysis inadequate margins were independently associated with tumor thickness 2.01-4.00 mm (p = 0.0001) and >4.00 mm (p = 0.0001) and head and neck location (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Adherence to BAD guidelines in the South East is good but requires optimization since centralization of melanoma treatment in 2013 to a single specialized center. It is important that Clinicians are fully aware of the implications of not achieving adequate excision margins in surgery. Improvements in melanoma data management is needed to fully evaluate current practices in Ireland.

TI  - Predicting seasonal ocean variability around New Zealand using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a first assessment of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and 300m Heat Content (HC) ensemble mean skill of the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator-Seasonal v1.0 (ACCESS-S1) around New Zealand on seasonal timescales, using a set of retrospective ensemble forecasts for 1990-2012. This was verified against Reynolds AVHRR analysis and Bluelink ReANalysis 3.5 (BRAN3.5). For inshore areas with depth <300m, the model shows skill forecasting for summer at a lead time of 0 months, with 66% and 65% of model grid cells having correlation coefficients exceeding 0.6 for SST and 300m HC respectively. Regions of lower skill seem to be associated with the model representation of the complex and variable frontal systems around New Zealand, and an overly-strong response to the El Nino Southern-Oscillation (ENSO). Nevertheless, the skill of ACCESS-S1 around New Zealand suggests there is potential for the development of useful seasonal forecast products for the region.

TI  - Terror in time: extending culturomics to address basic terror management mechanisms
T2  - COGNITION & EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Building on Google's efforts to scan millions of books, this article introduces methodology using a database of annual word frequencies of the 40,000 most frequently occurring words in the American literature between 1800 and 2009. The current paper uses this methodology to replicate and identify terror management processes in historical context. Variation in frequencies of word usage of constructs relevant to terror management theory (e.g. death, worldview, self-esteem, relationships) are investigated over a time period of 209 years. Study 1 corroborated previous TMT findings and demonstrated that word use of constructs related to death and of constructs related to patriotism and romantic relationships significantly co-vary over time. Study 2 showed that the use of the word "death" most strongly co-varies over time with the use of medical constructs, but also co-varies with the use of constructs related to violence, relationships, religion, positive sentiment, and negative sentiment. Study 3 found that a change in the use of death related words is associated with an increase in the use of fear related words, but not in anxiety related words. Results indicate that the described methodology generates valuable insights regarding terror management theory and provide new perspectives for theoretical advances.

TI  - Volume estimation in a <i>Eucalyptus</i> plantation using multi-source remote sensing and digital terrain data: a case study in Minas Gerais State, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we tested the effectiveness of stand age, multispectral optical imagery obtained from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by the Sentinel-1B satellite, and digital terrain attributes extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM), in estimating forest volume in 351 plots in a 1,498 ha Eucalyptus plantation in northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. A Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was used following the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of various data combinations, including multispectr al and SAR texture variables and DEM-based geomorphometric derivatives. Using multispectral, SAR or DEM variables alone (i.e. Experiments (ii)-(iv)) did not provide accurate estimates of volume (RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) > 32.00 m(3) ha(-1)) compared to predictions based on age since planting of Eucalyptus stands (Experiment (i)). However, when these datasets were individually combined with stand age (i.e. Experiments (v)-(vii)), the RF models resulted in better volume estimates than those obtained when using the individual multispectral, SAR and DEM datasets (RMSE < 28.00 m(3) ha(-1)). Furthermore, a model that integrated the selected variables of these data with stand age (Experiment (viii)) improved volume estimation significantly (RMSE = 22.33 m(3) ha(-1)). The large and increasing area of Eucalyptus forest plantations in Brazil and elsewhere suggests that this new approach to volume estimation has the potential to support Eucalyptus plantation monitoring and forest management practices.

TI  - Urban aloha 'aina: Kaka'ako and a decolonized right to the city
T2  - SETTLER COLONIAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay critically examines the relationship between capitalism, development, and settler colonialism using KakaModified Letter Turned Commaako, an urban district of Honolulu, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, as a case study. Given that KakaModified Letter Turned Commaako's luxury development boom is occurring in conjunction with a severe cost-of-living crisis, I argue that the corporate-driven renewal of KakaModified Letter Turned Commaako constitutes a settler colonial project of erasure and accumulation through Indigenous dispossession. Crucially, the participation of Indigenous landowning entities in KakaModified Letter Turned Commaako's redevelopment highlights the need to understand how capitalist exploitation can operate across the settler-native binary through the deployment of a worldview that renders land a commodity. In contrast, the Kanaka Maoli worldview understands land as Modified Letter Turned Commaaina - that which feeds. This understanding undergirds calls for aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina, a relationship of responsibility and respect between the land and its people. In rural spaces, aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina has been enacted as resistance against colonialism and development, but settler spatial regimes have largely been successful in framing Honolulu as 'settled' space. I argue that when exercised in the city, aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina provides a historically situated, place-based, and radical framework for urban spatial justice.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of four cloud-free snow cover products over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Four up-to-date daily cloud-free snow products - IMS (Interactive Multisensor Snow products), MOD-SSM/I (combination of the MODIS and SSM/I snow products), MOD-B (Blending method basing on the MODIS snow cover products) and TAI (Terra-Aqua-IMS) - with high-resolutions over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) were comprehensively assessed. Comparisons of the IMS, MOD-SSM/I, MOD-B and TAI cloud-free snow products against meteorological stations observations over 10 snow seasons (2004-2013) over the QTP indicated overall accuracies of 76.0%, 89.3%, 92.0% and 92.0%, respectively. The K-hat values of the IMS, MOD-SSM/I, MOD-B and TAI products were 0.084, 0.463, 0.428 and 0.526, respectively. The TAI products appear to have the best cloud-removal ability among the four snow products over the QTP. Based on the assessment, an I-TAI (Improvement of Terra-Aqua-IMS) snow product was proposed, which can improve the accuracy to some extent. However, the algorithms of the MODIS series products show instability when identifying wet snow and snow under forest cover over the QTP. The snow misclassification is an important limitation of MODIS snow cover products and requires additional improvements.

TI  - Estimating winter wheat area based on an SVM and the variable fuzzy set method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposed a method of extracting the winter wheat area by combining support vector machine (SVM) with variable fuzzy sets. This method mainly aims to deal with mixed pixels in remote sensing images. The SVM classifier can accurately identify pure winter wheat pixels with training samples. However, winter wheat area information in mixed pixels cannot be directly obtained because they contain multiple types of features. In order to estimate the winter wheat area information of mixed pixels in Landsat8 data, this paper introduced the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the variable fuzzy set method. Finally, this paper reasonably estimated the area of winter wheat from the mixed pixels in Landsat8 images. The accuracy assessment showed that the proposed method could extract winter wheat area information more accurately.

TI  - Radiometric homogenisation of aerial images by calibrating with satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of very high resolution (VHR) aerial imagery for quantitative remote sensing has been limited by unwanted radiometric variation over temporal and spatial extents. In this paper we propose a simple yet effective technique for the radiometric homogenisation of the digital numbers of aerial images. The technique requires a collocated and concurrent, well-calibrated satellite image as surface reflectance reference to which the aerial images are calibrated. The bands of the reference satellite sensor should be spectrally similar to those of the aerial sensor. Using radiative transfer theory, we show that a spatially varying local linear model can be used to approximate the relationship between the surface reflectance of the reference image and the digital numbers of the aerial images. The model parameters for each satellite pixel location are estimated using least squares regression inside a small sliding window. The technique was applied to a set of aerial images captured over multiple days with an Intergraph Digital Mapping Camera (DMC) system. A near-concurrent Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adjusted reflectance image was used as the reflectance reference dataset. The resulting DMC mosaic was compared to a near-concurrent Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 5 reflectance image of a portion of the same area, omitting the blue channel from the DMC mosaic due to its absence in the SPOT 5 data. The mean absolute reflectance difference was found to be 3.43% and the mean coefficient of determination (R-2) over the bands was 0.84. The technique allows the production of seamless mosaics corrected for coarse scale atmospheric and BRDF effects and does not require the manual acquisition (or provision) of ground reflectance references. The accuracy of corrections is limited by the resolution of the reference image, which is generally significantly coarser than VHR imagery. The method cannot correct for small scale BRDF or other variations not captured at the reference resolution. Nevertheless, results show a significant improvement in homogeneity and correlation with SPOT 5 reflectance.

TI  - Atheist primes reduce religiosity and subjective wellbeing
T2  - RELIGION BRAIN & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, atheism has grown in popularity, partly inspired by the rise to prominence of a group of public intellectuals called the "New Atheists" who argue against religion in public fora. What are the social consequences of this development? We test in a laboratory study in Kenya whether exposure to atheist arguments affects self-reported and implicit religiosity, subjective wellbeing, and self-reported tolerance of different social groups. We find a significant negative effect of emotional arguments against religion on both self-reported and implicit measures of religiosity, especially among men, but no effect of scientific appeals. Subjective wellbeing is strongly reduced after emotional atheist messages, again especially among men, suggesting that emotional atheist arguments may have a wellbeing cost. We find no effects of atheism messages on self-reported tolerance. Together, these results suggest that emotional atheist arguments reduce religiosity and subjective wellbeing, especially among men.

TI  - Evaluating multiple classifier system for the reduction of salt-and-pepper noise in the classification of very-high-resolution satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the spatial resolution of satellite data has improved with advancements in satellite technology, and acquisition of even more detailed information on the surface of the earth can be expected in the future. Various complications, however, are still associated with retrieval and classification of ground surface information from very-high-resolution satellite data. One important issue is the occurrence of isolated pixels with high local spatial heterogeneity between neighbouring pixels in the classification result. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of two Multiple Classifier System (MCS), which combine the results from different supervised classifiers, as a means for reducing isolated pixels when using high-spatial resolution satellite imagery. The research was conducted in the Tohoku region, where the Great East Japan Earthquake of 11 March 2011 and subsequent tsunami have greatly changed the regional land use and land cover. Multiple input features (five RapidEye spectral channels, five spectral indices, digital elevation model, and slope) were prepared from satellite data and used for the machine learning and validation. Ground truth data belonging to six major land cover classes (forest, shrub/grassland, cropland, urban area, waterbody, bare ground) were collected. Six machine learning classifiers; Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest Neighbours (KNN), XGBoost, Bagging, and Neural Network (NNET), were individually tested for classification accuracy and generation of isolated pixels, and the results were compared with those of the MCS combinations. The XGBoost provided the highest overall accuracy (0.987) and kappa coefficient (0.985) of the individual classifiers, but suffered from a large number of isolated pixels. The MCS by combination weighing the kappa coefficients (MCS kappa), however, produced equivalent overall accuracy (0.989) and kappa coefficient (0.987), but at the same time was able to significantly reduce the number of isolated pixels. This reduction amounted to 30% for all land cover classes. In particular, the number of isolated pixels in the forest class was reduced by 50%. These results clearly show that the MCS kappa is capable of reducing isolated pixels in the classification of very-high-resolution land cover information, without sacrificing classification accuracy. The authors hope that this system will prove effective for monitoring fine-scale changes in land cover, and contribute to conserving landscapes and ecosystem services in the region impacted by the earthquake and tsunami.

TI  - Spatial and temporal intercomparison of four global burned area products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterize the agreement and disagreement of four publically available burned products (Fire CCI, Copernicus Burnt Area, MODIS MCD45A1, and MODIS MCD64A1) at a finer spatial and temporal scale than previous assessments using a grid of three-dimensional cells defined both in space and in time. Our analysis, conducted using seven years of data (2005-2011), shows that estimates of burned area vary greatly between products in terms of total area burned, the location of burning, and the timing of the burning. We use regional and monthly units for analysis to provide insight into the variation between products that can be lost when considering products yearly and/or globally. Comparison with independent, contemporaneous MODIS active fire observations provides one indication of which products most reasonably capture the burning regime. Our results have implications for the use of global burned area products in fire ecology, management and emissions applications.

TI  - Examining the impacts of urbanization on surface radiation using Landsat imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Metropolitan Beijing is facing many environmental problems such as haze and urban heat island due to the rapid urbanization. Surface shortwave, longwave, and net radiations are key components of the surface-atmosphere radiation budget. Since megacities are affected by the thermal radiation of complex landscape structures and atmospheric environments, quantitative and spatially explicit retrieval from remotely sensed data remains a challenge. We collected the surface radiation fluxes from seven fixed sites representing different land-use types to calibrate the local parameters for remotely sensed retrieval of net radiation. We proposed a remote sensing-based surface radiation retrieval method by embedding the underlying land covers and integrating the observational data. The improved method is feasible to accurately retrieve surface radiation and delineate spatial characteristics in metropolitan areas. The accuracy evaluation indicated that the difference between remotely sensed and in situ observed net radiation ranged within 0 similar to +/- 40 W center dot m(-2). The root mean squared error of the estimated net surface radiation was 32.71 W center dot m(-2). The strongly spatial heterogeneity of surface radiation components in metropolitan Beijing was closely related to land-cover patterns from urban area to outskirts. We also found that the surface net radiation had a decreasing trend from 1984 to 2014, and the net radiation in the urban area was lower than that in the outskirts. According to the surface radiation budgets, urbanization resulted in the cooling effect in net radiation flux in the daytime, which was stemmed from low atmospheric transmittances from massive aerosol concentration and high surface albedo from light building materials.

TI  - Use of Landsat multi-temporal imagery to assess secondary growth Miombo woodlands in Luanshya, Zambia
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Miombo woodlands are the most extensive natural forest type in subtropical Africa, supporting the livelihood of over 100 million urban and rural settlers. These forests continue to experience extensive deforestation and land degradation due to land use land cover (LULC) changes. The aim of this study is to use remotely sensed images from the Landsat archive to provide the baseline for the spatial extent of Miombo woodlands in Luanshya district of the Copperbelt Province, Zambia. It also assesses the implications of spatial-temporal changes for the conservation of these woodlands. A hybrid classification method involving ISODATA and Support Vector Machine classifiers was used to generate LULC maps for 1986, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2011 and 2016, with an overall accuracy of 82.0%-99.6% and kappa coefficient of 0.80-0.99. Unlike previous studies that have mainly focused on comparison between two or three time periods, a longitudinal analysis over the 20-year periods of this study shows that there are complex net and gross changes in different LULC types over different scales. Landscape change metrics indicate that woodlands have been declining in extent, but are partly offset by regeneration. Rates of deforestation (regeneration) for the periods 1986-1998, 1998-2001, 2001-2004, 2004-2011 and 2011-2016 are 10% (1%), 38% (30%), 15% (7%), 11% (8%) and 9% (2%) per annum, respectively. These results suggest that over 68% of Miombo woodlands present in 2016 are second-growth forests. Restoration strategies such as assisted natural regeneration are necessary in order to accelerate the recovery of natural forests. Targeting under-used and degraded land for assisted natural regeneration and empowering local communities in sustainable environmental stewardship are crucial in remediating against continued forest degradation.

TI  - Landscape pattern changes over 25 years across a hotspot zone in southern Brazil
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation caused by human activities has many implications for natural landscapes, such as habitat reduction and the loss of biodiversity. This study investigated the temporal fragmentation process of forest remnants in a strongly agro-industrialised region in southern Brazil over 25 years. The studied watershed area hosts two important typologies of the Atlantic Forest biome as well as Quaternary remnants of the Brazilian Savanna biome, which are considered hotspots of biodiversity and reflect the intense process of forest fragmentation caused by Brazilian urban and agro-industrial development. Thus, studies encompassing multitemporal scales are paramount to understanding changes in forest patterns and are fundamental for trend predictions of landscape dynamics. To perform the calculation of the mean normalised difference vegetation index, Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2016 were processed using SPRING (R) software. Subsequently, FRAGSTATS (R) software was used to calculate landscape metrics. A reduction in the number of forest fragments since 1991 was observed, with a maximum amount of 5 243 fragments in 1993 that declined to 4 015 fragments in 2016. Although the number of fragments in the watershed decreased, the mean area increased by 72.9% and the mean of the shape index increased from 1.3 in 1991 to 1.5 in 2016. In addition, there was a 64.7% increase in the edge density and a reduction of 35.6 m in the isolation between the nearest neighbours. The degree of isolation of the fragments underwent a process of expansion and reduction when compared to 1991, presenting results that support the hypothesis that the Atlantic Forest is in a process of stabilisation and forest restoration.

TI  - Time series analysis of vegetation-cover response to environmental factors and residential development in a dryland region
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use changes as a result of residential development often lead to degradation and alter vegetation cover (VC). Although these are worldwide phenomena, sufficient knowledge about anthropogenic effects caused by various populated areas in dryland ecosystems is lacking. This study explored anthropogenic development in rural areas and its effects on the conservation of protected areas in drylands, focusing on the change in VC, the reasons, extent, and the drivers of change. We propose a novel framework for exploring VC change (VCC) as a function of environmental and human-driven factors including different types of populated areas in drylands. As a case study, we used a 30-year time series of Landsat satellite images over the arid region of Israel to analyze spatiotemporal VCC. The temporal analysis involved the Contextual Mann-Kendall significance test and spatial analysis to model clustering of VCC. A Gradient Boosted Regression machine learning algorithm was applied to study the relative influence of environmental and human-driven factors on VCC. In addition, we used ANOVA to examine differences between the effects of three types of populated areas on the spatiotemporal trends of VC. The results show that the most influential environmental variable on VCC was elevation (relative contribution of 17%), followed by slope (14.8%) and distance from populated areas (14.6%). Moreover, different types of populated areas affected VC differently with varying distances from residential centroids. The nature reserves increased VC positively and significantly, while livestock settlements had a negative effect. Change in vegetation was mostly confined to the stream network and occurred in lower elevations. The study demonstrates how different land-use practices alter the landscape in terms of VC and differ in their extents, patterns, and effects. With the expected growth in population and residential development worldwide, the proposed framework may assist conservation managements and policy makers in minimizing environmental degradation in drylands.

TI  - MODIS-based Daily Lake Ice Extent and Coverage dataset for Tibetan Plateau
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau houses numerous lakes, the phenology and duration of lake ice in this region are sensitive to regional and global climate change, and as such are used as key indicators in climate change research, particularly in environment change comparison studies for the Earth three poles. However, due to its harsh natural environment and sparse population, there is a lack of conventional in situ measurement on lake ice phenology. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) data, which can be traced back 20 years with a 500 m spatial resolution, were used to monitor lake ice for filling the observation gaps. Daily lake ice extent and coverage under clear-sky conditions was examined by employing the conventional SNOWMAP algorithm, and those under cloud cover conditions were re-determined using the temporal and spatial continuity of lake surface conditions through a series of steps. Through time series analysis of every single lake with size greater than 3 km(2) in size, 308 lakes within the Tibetan Plateau were identified as the effective records of lake ice extent and coverage to form the Daily Lake Ice Extent and Coverage dataset, including 216 lakes that can be further retrieved with four determinable lake ice parameters: Freeze-up Start (FUS), Freeze-up End (FUE), Break-up Start (BUS), and Break-up End (BUE), and 92 lakes with two parameters, FUS and BUE. Six lakes of different sizes and locations were selected for verification against the published datasets by passive microwave remote sensing. The lake ice phenology information obtained in this paper was highly consistent with that from passive microwave data at an average correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an RMSE value varying from 0.07 to 0.13. The present dataset is more effective at detecting lake ice parameters for smaller lakes than the coarse resolution passive microwave remote sensing observations. The published data are available in and .

TI  - Influence of structural lineaments on drainage morphometry in Qorveh-Dehgolan basin, Kurdistan, Iran
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - In the current study, a combination of automated lineament extraction from Landsat 8 satellite imagery and 3D interactive visual interpretation (using DEM) alongside image processing techniques (Gram-Schmidt pan-sharpening, convolution directional filter) was carried out to investigate expression and influence of tectonic activity on drainage morphometry within Qorveh-Dehgolan basin. The watersheds, derived from burned DEM using SWAT, were categorized into high and low-altitude watersheds depending on the associated relief. Analysis of spatial relationship of lineament density with drainage density and basin slope revealed that structural lineaments have a decisive control over drainage density distribution particularly at higher basin slopes of certain watersheds. These high-altitude watersheds, associated with more-resistant lithology, were also found to cover higher percentage of total lineaments compared to the lower-altitude watersheds associated with less-resistant lithology. The analysis presented significant insights into the influence of tectonic activity on drainage network in a relatively unexplored area and provided vital baseline information for future investigations.

TI  - Scope for growth of Texas Bay scallop <i>Argopecten irradians amplicostatus</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bivalves have exceptional potential as sentinel organisms because their sedentary benthic lifestyle and ability to pump large volumes of water in short periods of time results in bioaccumulation of pollutants and toxins present in the water column. Scope for Growth (SFG) is an instantaneous measure of production that ranges from maximum positive values under optimal conditions to negative valves when the organism is stressed and utilizing its body reserves for maintenance. We determined baseline SFG for the Texas bay scallop Argopecten irradians amplicostatus so that this species might be used to determine sublethal effects of toxins, contaminants, or other environmental stressors in light of recent harmful algal bloom events in the Gulf of Mexico. We also quantified the effects of different diets (phytoplankton, zooplankton, mixed phytoplankton/zooplankton) on Texas bay scallop SFG. SFG of starved animals was negative, indicating that body reserves were used for maintenance. SFG varied significantly (P<0.001) by diet, with rotifers yielding the highest value (mean=14.88 Joules hr(-1)g dry weight, SE=0.72). We determined that the Texas bay scallop has presently unrecognized potential as sentinel organisms to define effects of various environmental and anthropogenic perturbations.

TI  - High-resolution image registration based on improved SURF detector and localized GTM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution image registration is an important task in remote sensing image processing. In this paper, an automatic and robust local feature-based image registration approach is proposed for high-resolution remote sensing images. The proposed method consists of four main steps. In the first step, an integrated local feature-based matching method based on an improved speeded-up robust features (SURF) detector and an adaptive binning scale-invariant feature transform (AB-SIFT) descriptor is developed for fast, dense and robust tie-point extraction. In the second step, a localized graph transformation matching (LGTM) method is developed for reliable mismatch elimination. In the third step, an advanced oriented least square matching (OLSM) method is applied to improve the positional accuracy of the refined tie-points. Finally, the input image is warped using an appropriate transformation model. To investigate the impact of the transformation function, the capability of some models, including, polynomials of degrees 2 to 4, piecewise linear (PL), weighted mean (WM) and multiquadric (MQ) are compared. The proposed method has been evaluated with five pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images from IRS-P5, SPOT 5, SPOT 6, IKONOS, Geoeye, Quickbird, and Worldview sensors, and the registration results demonstrate its robustness and capability. The MATLAB code of the proposed method can be downloaded from .

TI  - Permissible Epistemic Trade-Offs
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent rejections of epistemic consequentialism, like those from Firth, Jenkins, Berker, and Greaves, have argued that consequentialism is committed to objectionable trade-offs and suggest that consequentialism's propensity for trade-offs hints at a larger problem. Here I argue that sanctioning trade-offs isn't a fault of a theory of epistemic normativity, because there are permissible epistemic trade-offs. I give examples of permissible epistemic trade-offs in pedagogy, in changes of worldview, and in indirect epistemic decisions. I also show that views that sanction trade-offs have an easier time than their rivals in explaining both why we ought to be open-minded and how arguments with suppositions get their argumentative force. These considerations don't eliminate the consequentialist's burden to respond to the objectionable cases, but they do undermine the idea that no correct theory of epistemic normativity properly sanctions trade-offs.

TI  - Satellite data reveal a common combustion emission pathway for major cities in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive fossil fuel combustion in rapidly developing cities severely affects air quality and public health. We report observational evidence of decadal changes in the efficiency and cleanness of bulk combustion over large cities in mainland China. In order to estimate the trends in enhancement ratios of CO and SO2 to NO2 (Delta CO/Delta NO2 and Delta SO2/Delta NO2) and infer emergent bulk combustion properties over these cities, we combine air quality retrievals from widely used satellite instruments across 2005-2014. We present results for four Chinese cities (Shenyang, Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen) representing four levels of urban development. Our results show a robust coherent progression of declining to growing Delta CO/Delta NO2 relative to 2005 (-5.4 +/- 0.7 to +8.3 +/- 3.1 % yr(-1)) and slowly declining Delta SO2/Delta NO2 (-6.0 +/- 1.0 to -3.4 +/- 1.0 % yr(-1)) across the four cities. The coherent progression we find is not evident in the trends of emission ratios reported in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) inventory. This progression is likely due to a shift towards cleaner combustion from industrial and residential sectors in Shanghai and Shenzhen that is not yet seen in Shenyang and Beijing. This overall trend is presently obfuscated by China's still relatively higher dependence on coal. Such progression is well-correlated with economic development and traces a common emission pathway that resembles evolution of air pollution in more developed cities. Our results highlight the utility of augmenting observing and modeling capabilities by exploiting enhancement ratios in constraining the time variation in emission ratios in current inventories. As cities and/or countries continue to socioeconomically develop, the ability to monitor combustion efficiency and effectiveness of pollution control becomes increasingly important in assessing sustainable control strategies.

TI  - Urbanisation and Indigenous dispossession: rethinking the spatio-legal imaginary in Chile vis-a-vis the Mapuche nation
T2  - SETTLER COLONIAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article highlights the place of the spatio-legal imaginary in theorising urbanisation and Indigenous dispossession in Chile. Focusing on the Mapuche nation, we argue that we are witnessing another period of their historical struggles against territorial dispossession, which is shaped by polarised conceptions of urban, non-urban, and Indigenous spaces. We argue that internal colonisation is inseparable from processes of urbanisation that divorce Indigenous subjects from their territory based on two colonial principles, terra nullius and the supremacy of a Western worldview. These principles clash with Mapuche resistance that subverts these dichotomous categories. Viewing urban, non-urban, and Indigenous categorisations as co-constitutive and spatially continuous better reflects these ongoing struggles for territorial control in Chile.

TI  - Benchmark seasonal prediction skill estimates based on regional indices
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Basic statistical metrics such as autocorrelations and across-region lag correlations of sea ice variations provide benchmarks for the assessments of forecast skill achieved by other methods such as more sophisticated statistical formulations, numerical models, and heuristic approaches. In this study we use observational data to evaluate the contribution of the trend to the skill of persistence-based statistical forecasts of monthly and seasonal ice extent on the pan-Arctic and regional scales. We focus on the Beaufort Sea for which the Barnett Severity Index provides a metric of historical variations in ice conditions over the summer shipping season. The variance about the trend line differs little among various methods of detrending (piecewise linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential). Application of the piecewise linear trend calculation indicates an acceleration of the winter and summer trends during the 1990s. Persistence-based statistical forecasts of the Barnett Severity Index as well as September pan-Arctic ice extent show significant statistical skill out to several seasons when the data include the trend. However, this apparent skill largely vanishes when the data are detrended. In only a few regions does September ice extent correlate significantly with antecedent ice anomalies in the same region more than 2 months earlier. The springtime "predictability barrier" in regional forecasts based on persistence of ice extent anomalies is not reduced by the inclusion of several decades of pre-satellite data. No region shows significant correlation with the detrended September pan-Arctic ice extent at lead times greater than a month or two; the con-current correlations are strongest with the East Siberian Sea. The Beaufort Sea's ice extent as far back as July explains about 20 % of the variance of the Barnett Severity Index, which is primarily a September metric. The Chukchi Sea is the only other region showing a significant association with the Barnett Severity Index, although only at a lead time of a month or two.

TI  - Geospatial data mining for digital raster mapping
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - We performed an in-depth literature survey to identify the most popular data mining approaches that have been applied for raster mapping of ecological parameters through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data. Popular data mining approaches included decision trees or "data mining" trees which consist of regression and classification trees, random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines. The advantages of each data mining approach as well as approaches to avoid overfitting are subsequently discussed. We also provide suggestions and examples for the mapping of problematic variables or classes, future or historical projections, and avoidance of model bias. Finally, we address the separate issues of parallel processing, error mapping, and incorporation of "no data" values into modeling processes. Given the improved availability of digital spatial products and remote sensing products, data mining approaches combined with parallel processing potentials should greatly improve the quality and extent of ecological datasets.

TI  - How up-scaling of remote-sensing images affects land-cover classification by comparison with multiscale satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover classification provides the crucial data component for related Earth-science research. Currently, although multiscale remote-sensing images are the main source of data for classifying land-cover, the response of multi-resolution images to land-cover classification remains highly uncertain. In addition, because of the scarcity of time-synchronous multiscale satellite images of certain regions, up-scaling algorithms are generally used to generate and apply multiscale images. However, when using resolution-resampling images, it remains uncertain to what extent spectral loss or information distortion is responsible for the underlying differences in the accuracy of land-cover classification of various landscapes. To clarify this situation, we study the Hetian basin of Changting County in Fujian Province, south-east China by using quasi-synchronous multiple-resolution satellite observations (seven spatial resolution levels: 1 m, 2 m, 4 m, 8 m, 16 m, 30 m, and 50 m) to investigate possible correlations between spatial resolution and the land-cover classification. The classification is obtained by applying a support vector machine spectral classifier to random recordings made in 1875 sample plots. We also explore the effect of using lower-resolution images by comparing the classification results obtained by using several common up-scaling algorithms, such as nearest neighbour (NN), bilinear (BI), cubic convolution (CC), and pixel aggregation (PA). The results indicate that classification accuracy is significantly influenced by the spatial resolution of images (p < 0.05), with the accuracy increasing as the spatial resolution goes from 1 m to 4 m, then decreasing as the spatial resolution decreases beyond 4 m. In addition, for a resolution of 1 m to 30 m, almost all the up-scaled images provide a classification accuracy that differs from that obtained by using the native remote-sensing images of each resolution (p < 0.05), and the difference increases as the spatial-resolution ratio or up-scaling amplification factor increases. According to an analysis of the spatial scale of images using, e.g., multiband spectral reflectance and vegetation index, the up-scaling algorithms are less sensitive to spatial resolution and represent poorly the actual image characteristics. This result is attributed to the strong dependence of the spectral information in up-scaled images on the original images, which leads to discrepancies with respect to actual observations at the given scale. These results indicate that the effects of resolution cannot be ignored and that resampling data may not be adequate for multi-spatial-scale classification compared with the native satellite images. It is thus urgent to obtain an effective up-scaling algorithm that sharply reduces the problems caused by spatial heterogeneity.

TI  - Inference for Errors-in-Variables Models in the Presence of Systematic Errors with an Application to a Satellite Remote Sensing Campaign
T2  - TECHNOMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivated by a satellite remote sensing mission, this article proposes a multivariable errors-in-variables (EIV) regression model with heteroscedastic errors for relating the satellite data products to similar products from a well-characterized but globally sparse ground-based dataset. In the remote sensing setting, the regression model is used to estimate the global divisor for the satellite data. The error structure of the proposed EIV model comprises two components: A random-error component whose variance is inversely proportional to sample size of underlying individual observations which are aggregated to obtain the regression data, and a systematic-error component whose variance remains the same as the underlying sample size increases. In this article, we discuss parameter identifiability for the proposed model and obtain estimates from two-stage parameter estimation. We illustrate our proposed procedure through both simulation studies and an application to validating measurements of atmospheric column-averaged CO2 from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. The validation uses coincident target-mode OCO-2 data that are temporally and spatially sparse and ground-based measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) that are spatially sparse but more accurate. Supplementary materials for the article are available online.

TI  - Spatial Monitoring of Urban Expansion Using Satellite Remote Sensing Images: A Case Study of Amman City, Jordan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amman, the capital city of Jordan, faces urbanization challenges and lacks reliable data for urban planning. This study is aimed at assessing, monitoring, and mapping urban land cover using multitemporal Landsat satellite images. Four different land use/cover maps were produced; periods of over ten years between 1987 and 2017 (i.e., in 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017) were used to evaluate and analyze urban expansion visually and quantitatively. Supervised classification technique followed by the post classification comparison change detection approach was used to analyze images. Over the past three decades, the urban area has increased rapidly in Amman. It increased by 90.78 km(2), from 149.08 km(2) in 1987 to 237.86 km(2) in 2017, with an average annual rate of increase of 2.03%. Urban area increases were significantly higher in the first 10 years of the study period (i.e., from 1987 to 1997), during which the average annual rate of increase reached 3.33%, while it was 2.04% for the last two decades of the study period (i.e., from 1997 to 2017). Urban growth in Amman generally occurred along transport routes away from the core of Amman, and as a result, this growth led to the expansion of urban areas into other types of land use/cover classes, particularly vegetation areas. The spatial analysis of urban expansion and trends of urban growth in Amman could provide the required input data for the urban modeling of the city.

TI  - Evidence of Instability in Previously-Mapped Landslides as Measured Using GPS, Optical, and SAR Data between 2007 and 2017: A Case Study in the Portuguese Bend Landslide Complex, California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Velocity dictates the destructive potential of a landslide. A combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical, and GPS data were used to maximize spatial and temporal coverage to monitor continuously-moving portions of the Portuguese Bend landslide complex on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Southern California. Forty SAR images from the COSMO-SkyMed satellite, acquired between 19 July 2012 and 27 September 2014, were processed using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI). Eight optical images from the WorldView-2 satellite, acquired between 20 February 2011 and 16 February 2016, were processed using the Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) technique. Displacement measurements were taken at GPS monuments between September 2007 and May 2017. Incremental and average deformations across the landslide complex were measured using all three techniques. Velocity measured within the landslide complex ranges from slow (> 1.6 m/year) to extremely slow (< 16 mm/year). COSI-Corr and GPS provide detailed coverage of m/year-scale deformation while PSI can measure extremely slow deformation rates (mm/year-scale), which COSI-Corr and GPS cannot do reliably. This case study demonstrates the applicability of SAR, optical, and GPS data synthesis as a complimentary approach to repeat field monitoring and mapping to changes in landslide activity through time.

TI  - Determination of Bathing Water Quality Using Thermal Images Landsat 8 on the West Coast of Tangier: Preliminary Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathing water quality has been monitored in the west coast of Tangier, Morocco due to increased urban and industrial discharge through the Boukhalef river, using in-situ bacteriological measurements which demand high economical and temporal costs. In this study, Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) images were used as an alternative to the classical method, for determining bathing water quality to help decision makers obtain up-to-date and cost-effective information for coastal environment protection. For this purpose, during spring and summer 2017, seven sampling points were examined in terms of bacteriological parameters: Total Coliforms (TC), Faecal Coliforms (FC), Intestinal Enterococci (IE) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Also, a spatial-temporal analysis was performed in this temporal window to detect temperature anomalies and their spatial distribution along the coastal bathing area. In addition, a relationship between in-situ bacteriological parameter measurements and temperature from satellite images was analyzed. The results of the water temperature distribution showed the highest values next to the Boukhalef river mouth, as well as the poorest water quality according to in-situ measurements, while lower values and better water quality status were observed moving away from the Boukhalef river mouth. The relationship between water temperature and bacterial concentration showed a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.85). Consequently, the model development approaches used may be useful in estimating bacterial concentration in coastal bathing areas and can serve to create a monitoring system to support decision makers in the protection actions of the coast.

TI  - Intersection of Physical and Anthropogenic Effects on Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes in Coastal China of Jiangsu Province
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - China is experiencing substantial land-use and land-cover change (LUCC), especially in coastal regions, and these changes have caused many ecological problems. This study selected a typical region of Jiangsu Province and completed a comprehensive and detailed spatial-temporal analysis regarding LUCC and the driving forces. The results show that the rate of land-use change has been accelerating, with land-use experiencing the most substantial changes from 2005 to 2010 for most land-use types and the period from 2010 to 2015 showing a reversed changing trend. Built-up land that occupies cropland was the main characteristic of land-use type change. Southern Jiangsu and the coastline region presented more obvious land-use changes. Social-economic development was the main factor driving increased built-up land expansion and cropland reduction. In addition, land-use policy can significantly affect land-use type changes. For land-cover changes, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the land area without land-use type changes increased by 0.005 per year overall. Areas with increasing trends accounted for 82.43% of the total area. Both precipitation and temperature displayed more areas that were positively correlated with NDVI, especially for temperature. Temperature correlated more strongly with NDVI change than precipitation for most vegetation types. Our study can be used as a reference for land-use managers to ensure sustainable and ecological land-use and coastal management.

TI  - Impact of Landscape Structure on the Variation of Land Surface Temperature in Sub-Saharan Region: A Case Study of Addis Ababa using Landsat Data (1986-2016)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has bloomed across Asia and Africa of late, while two centuries ago, it was confined to developed regions in the largest urban agglomerations. The changing urban landscape can cause irretrievable changes to the biophysical environment, including changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of the land surface temperature (LST). Understanding these variations in the LST will help us introduce appropriate mitigation techniques to overcome negative impacts. The research objective was to assess the impact of landscape structure on the variation in LST in the African region as a geospatial approach in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 1986-2016 with fifteen-year intervals. Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping and LST were derived by using pre-processed Landsat data (Level 2). Gradient analysis was computed for the pattern of the LST from the city center to the rural area, while intensity calculation was facilitated to analyze the magnitude of LST. Directional variation of the LST was not covered by the gradient analysis. Hence, multidirectional and multitemporal LST profiles were employed over the orthogonal and diagonal directions. The result illustrated that Addis Ababa had undergone rapid expansion. In 2016, the impervious surface (IS) had dominated 33.8% of the total lands. The IS fraction ratio of the first zone (URZ(1)) has improved to 66.2%, 83.7%, and 87.5%, and the mean LST of URZ(1) has improved to 25.2 degrees C, 26.6 degrees C, and 29.6 degrees C in 1986, 2001, and 2016, respectively. The IS fraction has gradually been declining from the city center to the rural area. The behavior of the LST is not continually aligning with a pattern of IS similar to other cities along the URZs. After the specific URZs (zone 17, 37, and 41 in 1986, 2001, and 2016, respectively), the mean LST shows an increasing trend because of a fraction of bare land. This trend is different from those of other cities even in the tropical regions. The findings of this study are useful for decision makers to introduce sustainable landscape and urban planning to create livable urban environments in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

TI  - Urbanization and Its Impacts on Land Surface Temperature in Colombo Metropolitan Area, Sri Lanka, from 1988 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has become one of the most important human activities modifying the Earth's land surfaces; and its impacts on tropical and subtropical cities (e.g., in South/Southeast Asia) are not fully understood. Colombo; the capital of Sri Lanka; has been urbanized for about 2000 years; due to its strategic position on the east-west sea trade routes. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of urban expansion and its impacts on land surface temperature in Colombo from 1988 to 2016; using a time-series of Landsat images. Urban land cover changes (ULCC) were derived from time-series satellite images with the assistance of machine learning methods. Urban density was selected as a measure of urbanization; derived from both the multi-buffer ring method and a gravity model; which were comparatively adopted to evaluate the impacts of ULCC on the changes in land surface temperature (LST) over the study period. The experimental results indicate that: (1) the urban land cover classification during the study period was conducted with satisfactory accuracy; with more than 80% for the overall accuracy and over 0.73 for the Kappa coefficient; (2) the Colombo Metropolitan Area exhibits a diffusion pattern of urban growth; especially along the west coastal line; from both the multi-buffer ring approach and the gravity model; (3) urban density was identified as having a positive relationship with LST through time; (4) there was a noticeable increase in the mean LST; of 5.24 degrees C for water surfaces; 5.92 degrees C for vegetation; 8.62 degrees C for bare land; and 8.94 degrees C for urban areas. The results provide a scientific reference for policy makers and urban planners working towards a healthy and sustainable Colombo Metropolitan Area.

TI  - Assessment of Physical Water Scarcity in Africa Using GRACE and TRMM Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The critical role of water in enabling or constraining human well-being and socioeconomic activities has led to an interest in quantitatively establishing the status of water (in)sufficiency over space and time. Falkenmark introduced the first widely accepted measure of water status, the Water Scarcity Index (WSI), which expressed the status of the availability of water resources in terms of vulnerability, stress, and scarcity. Since then, numerous indicators have been introduced, but nearly all adopt the same basic formulation; water status is a function of available water resourceby the demand or use. However, the accurate assessment of available water is difficult, especially in data-scarce regions, such as Africa. In this paper, therefore, we introduce a satellite-based Potential Available Water Storage indicator, PAWS. The method integrates GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite Total Water Storage (TWS) measurements with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation estimates between 2002 and 2016. First, we derived the countries' Internal Water Storage (IWS) using GRACE and TRMM precipitation data. Then, the IWS was divided by the population density to derive the PAWS per capita. Following the Falkenmark thresholds, 54% of countries are classified in the same water vulnerability status as the AQUASTAT Internal Renewable Water Resources (IRWR) method. Of the remaining countries, PAWS index leads to one or two categories shift (left or right) of water status. The PAWS index shows that 14% (similar to 160 million people) of Africa's population currently live under water scarcity status. With respect to future projections, PAWS index suggests that a 10% decrease in future water resources would affect similar to 37% of Africa's 2025 population (similar to 600 million people), and 57% for 2050 projections (similar to 1.4-billion people). The proposed approach largely overcomes the constraints related to the data needed to rapidly and robustly estimate available water resources by incorporating all stocks of water within the country, as well as underscores the recent water storage dynamics. However, the estimates obtained concern potential available water resources, which may not be utilizable for practical, economic, and technological issues.

TI  - Atmospheric Retrievals and Assessment for Microwave Observations from Chinese FY-3C Satellite during Hurricane Matthew
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution process of hurricane Matthew (NO. 8, 2016) was simulated using the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at temporal resolution of 5 min and spatial resolution of 15 km. The atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles were retrieved accordingly for diagnostic analysis of the short-term heavy rainstorm. The satellite-based microwave observations from Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) instrument on board the FY-3C polar-orbiting satellite were matched with the WRF grid points. In particular, the in-orbit calibration and data quality control are detailed, and an innovative method combining artificial neural network (ANN) and 1-D variational approach is presented to derive the high-performance retrieval profiles. Results show that the root-mean-square errors of the retrieved temperature and water vapor density profiles are 0.75 K and 0.41 g/m(3), respectively. In addition, this study used both the retrievals and radiance from MWHTS as input to the WRF Data Assimilation (WRFDA) model to forecast the track and intensity of hurricane Matthew. The forecast results were cross-compared with the best track to verify the radiance quality and performance of the retrievals, especially for the 118 GHz channel, which was firstly used in meteorological satellite.

TI  - Mapping Forest Type and Tree Species on a Regional Scale Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are a limited number of studies addressing the forest status, its extent, location, type and composition over a larger area at the regional or national levels. The dense time series and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 data are a good basis for forest mapping and tree species identification over a large area. This study presents the results of the classification of the forest/non-forest cover, forest type (broadleaf and coniferous) and the identification of eight tree species (beech, oak, alder, birch, spruce, pine, fir, and larch) using the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in combination with topographic information. The study was conducted over the large mountain area located in southern Poland. The Random Forest classifier was used to first derive a forest/non-forest map. Second, the forest was classified into broadleaf and coniferous. Finally, the tree species classification was carried out following two approaches: (i) Non-stratified, where all species were classified together within the forest mask and (ii) stratified, where the broadleaf and coniferous tree species were classified separately within the forest type masks. The overall accuracy for the forest/non-forest cover reached 98.3% and declined slightly to 94.8% for the classification of the forest type. The use of the topographic information did not increase the accuracy of either result. The role of the topographic variables increased significantly in the process of tree species delineation. By combining the topographic information (in particular, digital elevation model) with the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, the classification of eight tree species improved from 75.6% to 81.7% (approach 1). A further increase in accuracy to 89.5% for broadleaf and 82% for coniferous species was observed following the stratified approach number 2. The highest overall accuracy (above 85%) was obtained for beech, oak, birch, alder, and larch. The study confirmed the potential of the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data for accurate delineation of the forest cover, forest type, and tree species at the regional scale.

TI  - Deriving Regional Snow Line Dynamics during the Ablation Seasons 1984-2018 in European Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt in the mid-latitude European mountains is undergoing significant spatiotemporal changes. Regional snow line elevation (RSLE) is an appropriate indicator for assessing snow cover variations in mountain areas. To derive regional snow line dynamics during the ablation seasons 1984-2018, the present study unprecedentedly introduced a readily applicable framework. The framework constitutes four steps: atmospheric and topographic correction, snow classification, RSLE retrieval, and regional snow line retreat curve (RSLRC) derivation. The developed framework has been successfully applied to 8641 satellite images acquired by Landsat, ASTER, and Sentinel-2. The results of the intra-annual regional snow line variations show that: (1) regional snow lines in the Alpine catchments preserve the longest; (2) RSLEs are lower in the northern Pyrenees than in the southern part; (3) regional snow lines persist the shortest in the Carpathian catchments; and (4) during the end of the ablation season 2018, intermediate snowfall events in the catchments Adda, Tagliamento, and Uzh are observed. In terms of the long-term inter-annual variations, significantly accelerating snow line recession is detected in the northern Pyrenean catchment Ariege. In the Alpine catchment Alpenrhein and Drac, RSLRCs are shifting towards lower accumulated air-temperature (AT) significantly, with the magnitude of -3.77 degrees Ca-1 (Alpenrhein) and -3.99 degrees Ca-1 (Drac).

TI  - Urban Residential Land Suitability Analysis Combining Remote Sensing and Social Sensing Data: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the degradation of the environment and the acceleration of urbanization, urban residential land has been undergoing rapid changes and has attracted great attention worldwide. Meanwhile, the quantitative evaluation of the suitability of urban residential land is essential for a better and more powerful understanding of urban residential land planning and improvement. Most urban land suitability studies rely solely on remote sensing data and GIS data to evaluate natural suitability, and few studies have focused on urban land suitability from a socioeconomic perspective. Consequently, this paper integrates remote sensing data (GaoFen-2 satellite image) and social sensing data (Tencent User Density data, Point-of-interest data and OpenStreetMap data) to establish an evaluation framework for analyzing the suitability of urban residential land in the Haidian District, Beijing, China, in which, ecological comfortability, locational livability and overall suitability were evaluated according to five attributes extracted from urban residential land via the factor analysis method. The evaluation results of this case study show that, compared with the suburban area in the northwest, the urban area tends to have lower ecological comfortability and higher locational livability. The overall suitability increases from southeast to northwest, consistent with the spatial distribution of ecological comfortability. This framework can potentially assist with the sustainable development of residential lands and urban land use planning.

TI  - Impact of Soil Reflectance Variation Correction on Woody Cover Estimation in Kruger National Park Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series of imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has previously been used to estimate woody and herbaceous vegetation cover in savannas. However, this is challenging due to the mixture of woody and herbaceous plant functional types with specific contributions to the phenological signal and variations in soil background reflectance signatures observed from satellite. These factors cause variations in the accuracy and precision of woody cover estimates from different modelling approaches and datasets. Here, woody cover is estimated over Kruger National Park (KNP) from the MODIS 16-day composite time-series data using dry season NDVI/SAVI images and applying NDVIsoil determination methods. The woody cover estimates when NDVIsoil was ignored had R-2 = 0.40, p < 0.01, slope = 1.01, RMSE (root mean square error) = 15.26% and R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.03, slope = 0.79, RMSE = 16.39% for NDVIpixel and SAVI(pixel), respectively, when compared to field plot data of plant functional type fractional cover. The woody cover estimated from the soil determination methods had a slope closer to 1 for both NDVI and SAVI but also a slightly higher RMSE. For a soil-invariant method, RMSE = 19.04% and RMSE = 17.34% were observed for NDVI and SAVI respectively, while for a soil-variant method, RMSE = 18.28% and RMSE = 19.17% were found for NDVI and SAVI. The woody cover estimated from all models had a high correlation and significant relationship with LiDAR/SAR based estimates and a woody cover map produced by Bucini. Woody cover maps are required for vegetation succession monitoring, grazing impact assessment, climate change mitigation and adaptation research and dynamic vegetation model validation.

TI  - Increasing Precision for French Forest Inventory Estimates using the k-NN Technique with Optical and Photogrammetric Data and Model-Assisted Estimators
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource forest inventory methods were developed to improve the precision of national forest inventory estimates. These methods rely on the combination of inventory data and auxiliary information correlated with forest attributes of interest. As these methods have been predominantly tested over coniferous forests, the present study used this approach for heterogeneous and complex deciduous forests in the center of France. The auxiliary data considered included a forest type map, Landsat 8 spectral bands and derived vegetation indexes, and 3D variables derived from photogrammetric canopy height models. On a subset area, changes in canopy height estimated from two successive photogrammetric models were also used. A model-assisted inference framework, using a k nearest-neighbors approach, was used to predict 11 field inventory variables simultaneously. The results showed that among the auxiliary variables tested, 3D metrics improved the precision of dendrometric estimates more than other auxiliary variables. Relative efficiencies (RE) varying from 2.15 for volume to 1.04 for stand density were obtained using all auxiliary variables. Canopy height changes also increased RE from 3% to 26%. Our results confirmed the importance of 3D metrics as auxiliary variables and demonstrated the value of canopy change variables for increasing the precision of estimates of forest structural attributes such as density and quadratic mean diameter.

TI  - Integration of Corner Reflectors for the Monitoring of Mountain Glacier Areas with Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier flow and slope instabilities in Alpine mountain areas represent a hazard issue. Sentinel-1 satellites provide regular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions that are potentially useful to monitor these areas, but they can be affected by temporal decorrelation due to rapid changes in the surface. The application of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) therefore seems difficult due to loss of coherence. On the other hand, Corner Reflectors (CR) can be used as coherent targets in SAR images for accurate displacement measurement thanks to their strong backscattering property and temporal stability. The use of CRs in multi-temporal InSAR analysis in Alpine mountain areas can thus be beneficial. In this study, we present a comparison between triangular and rectangular CRs, based on Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber and on long-term experiments over the Argentiere glacier and the surrounding slopes and moraine. The visibility in both summer and winter of 10 CRs installed on the test site was investigated. As this area is exposed to heavy precipitation including snow falls, two perforated CRs were tested. The amplitude stability and the phase error of each CR were estimated. A precise tracking of two CRs installed at the glacier surface was also able to measure the displacement of the Argentiere glacier, giving results close to previous GPS measurements. Furthermore, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) study was conducted, using the most stable CR as reference point to estimate slope instabilities, which led to the identification of an area corresponding to a tectonic fault called Faille de l'angle. The precise absolute locations of the CRs were successfully estimated and PS heights were compared with a LiDAR-based (Light Detection And Ranging) digital elevation model (DEM) and GPS measurements.

TI  - Quantification and Analysis of Impervious Surface Area in the Metropolitan Region of SAo Paulo, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing intensity of impervious surface area (ISA) is one of the most striking effects of urban growth. The expansion of ISA gives rise to a set of changes on the physical environment, impacting the quality of life of the human population as well as the dynamics of fauna and flora. Hence, due to its importance, the present study aimed to examine the ISA distribution in the Metropolitan Region of SAo Paulo (MRSP), Brazil, using satellite imagery from the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) instrument. In contrast to other investigations that primarily focus on the accuracy of the estimate, the proposal of this study isbesides generating a robust estimateto perform an integrated analysis of the impervious-surface distribution at pixel scale with the variability present in different territorial units, namely municipalities, sub-prefecture and districts. The importance of this study is that it strengthens the use of information related to impervious cover in the territorial planning, providing elements for a better understanding and connection with other spatial attributes. Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset (visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands) by Karhune-Loeve analysis, the first three principal components (PCs) contained more than 99% of the information present in the original bands. Projecting PC1, PC2 and PC3 onto a series of two-dimensional (2D) scatterplots, four endmembersLow Albedo (Dark), High Albedo (Substrate), Green Vegetation (GV) and Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV)were visually selected to produce the unmixing estimates. The selected endmembers fitted the model well, as the propagated error was consistently low (root-mean-square error = 0.005) and the fraction estimates at pixel scale were found to be in accordance with the physical structures of the landscape. The impervious surface fraction (ISF) was calculated by adding the Dark and Substrate fraction imagery. Reconciling the ISF with reference samples revealed the estimates to be reliable (R-2 = 0.97), regardless of an underestimation error (similar to 8% on average) having been found, mostly over areas with higher imperviousness rates. Intra-pixel variability was combined with the territorial units of analysis through a modification of the Lorenz curve, which permitted a straightforward comparison of ISF values at different reference scales. Good adherence was observed when the original 30-m ISF was compared to a resampled 300-m ISF, but with some differences, suggesting a systematic behavior with the degradation of pixel resolution tending to underestimate lower fractions and overestimate higher ones; furthermore, discrepancies were bridged with the increase of scale analysis. The analysis of the IFS model also revealed that, in the context of the MRSP, gross domestic product (GDP) has little potential for explaining the distribution of impervious areas on the municipality scale. Finally, the ISF model was found to be more sensitive in describing impervious surface response than other well-known indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI).

TI  - Capture of Single Silver Nanoparticles in Nanopore Arrays Detected by Simultaneous Amperometry and Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The attoliter volumes and confinement abilities of zero dimensional nanopore-electrode arrays (NEAs) hold considerable promise for examining the behavior of single nanoparticles. In this work, we use surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in tandem with amperometry in order to monitor single Ag Raman-sentinel nanoparticles transported to and captured in single nanopores. To that end, highly ordered solid-state NEAs were fabricated to contain periodic arrays of nanopores, each housing a single recessed Au-ring electrode. These were used to electrostatically capture and trap single silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) functionalized with the electrochemically stable Raman reporter, 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene (bis-MSB). Transport and capture of the bis-MSB-tagged AgNPs in the nanopores was followed by simultaneous amperometry and SERS signals characteristic of AgNP oxidation and enhanced Raman scattering by bis-MSB at silver gold hot spots, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of oxidation-current spikes increased with stepwise increases in DC voltage, and characteristic bis-MSB SERS spectra were observed. Under AC excitation, on the other hand, two distinctly different types of SERS signals were observed, independent of frequency and amplitude: (1) strong, transient (<10 s) spectra and (2) slow (>100 s) monotonically diminishing spectra. We hypothesize that the former behavior results from AgNP aggregates, whereas the latter occurs as a result of multiple incomplete AgNP-oxidation events in succession. These results show that attoliter-volume NEAs are competent for acquiring concurrent SERS spectra and for amperometry of single nanoparticles and that together these measurements can illuminate the collision dynamics of nanoparticles in confined environments.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI Imagery for Monitoring Selective Logging in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Imagery from medium resolution satellites, such as Landsat, have long been used to map forest disturbances in the tropics. However, the Landsat spatial resolution (30 m) has often been considered too coarse for reliably mapping small-scale selective logging. Imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-2 sensor, with a resampled 10 m spatial resolution, may improve the detection of forest disturbances. This study compared the performance of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for the detection of selective logging in an area located in the Brazilian Amazon. Logging impacts in seven areas, which had governmental authorization for harvesting timber, were mapped by calculating the difference of a self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) index over corresponding time periods (2016-2017) for imagery of both satellite sensors. A robust reference dataset was built using both high- and very-high-resolution imagery. It was used to define optimum rNBR thresholds for forest disturbance maps, via a bootstrapping procedure, and for estimating accuracies and areas. A further assessment of our approach was also performed in three unlogged areas. Additionally, field data regarding logging infrastructure were collected in the seven study sites where logging occurred. Both satellites showed the same performance in terms of accuracy, with area-adjusted overall accuracies of 96.7% and 95.7% for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, respectively. However, Landsat 8 mapped 36.9% more area of selective logging compared to Sentinel-2 data. Logging infrastructure was better detected from Sentinel-2 (43.2%) than Landsat 8 (35.5%) data, confirming its potential for mapping small-scale logging. We assessed the impacted area by selective logging with a regular 300 m x 300 m grid over the pixel-based results, leading to 1143 ha and 1197 ha of disturbed forest on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, respectively. No substantial differences in terms of accuracy were found by adding three unlogged areas to the original seven study sites.

TI  - Change Detection of Mangrove Forests in Coastal Guangdong during the Past Three Decades Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth and mainly grow at tropical and subtropical latitudes. They provide many important ecological and societal functions. However, rapid spatiotemporal variations in mangroves have been observed worldwide, especially in the coastal zones of developing areas, and the integrity of mangroves has been significantly affected by anthropogenic activities in recent decades. The goal of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of mangrove distribution over the past 30 years in Guangdong Province. This goal was achieved by classifying multi-temporal Landsat images using a decision tree method based on Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm. The driving forces resulting in these spatiotemporal variations of mangroves were then discussed. Our analysis revealed that the classification method used in this study yielded good accuracy, with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of higher than 90% and 0.8, respectively. In Guangdong province, the mangrove forests covered areas of 9305, 9556, 6793, and 9700 ha in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, respectively, with remarkable inter-annual changes. Mangrove forests are mainly located in Western Guangdong, and few are located in Eastern Guangdong. The distribution of mangrove patches became more fragmented from 1985 to 2005 and less fragmented from 2005 to 2015, and the distribution pattern in 2015 showed stronger connectivity than that in 1985. Natural factors, such as temperature, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and the length of the coastline, have macroscopic effects on the distribution of mangrove forests. Anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation, urbanization, and aquaculture development, have negative effects on the distribution of mangroves. On the other hand, the establishment of nature reserves has positive effects on the distribution of mangroves. The findings of this study provide a reference for the management and protection of mangroves, which is of great practical significance.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations in Impervious Surface Patterns during Urban Expansion in a Coastal City: Xiamen, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces (IS) coverage is a quantifiable environmental indicator for understanding urban sprawl and its potential impacts on sustainability of urban ecological environments. Numerous studies have previously demonstrated global and regional IS variation, but little attention has been paid to the different internal and external patterns of IS development as urbanization progresses. This study estimates IS coverage in a subtropical coastal area of Xiamen, southeastern China, from Landsat TM/OLI images obtained in 1994, 2000, 2004, 2010, and 2015, and quantifies its spatio-temporal variations using IS change trajectories and radar graphs. During the study period, IS gradually expanded along the shoreline in a pattern resembling the shape of the bay. The land surfaces are classified into four zones: IS1 and IS2, dominated by cultivated land and forest; IS3, complex land use/coverage; and IS4, built-up areas. The progression and transformations of these zones highlight the main trends in IS changes in the study area. The trajectories of the zones form a layered structure in which the urban centers of each district progressively gain IS4, and transformations into IS3 and IS2 extend successively beyond the centers. The orientation of IS expansion in each of the six districts of Xiamen is revealed by radar graphs. The areas containing intermediate and high percentages IS each expanded in generally consistent directions throughout the study period, except in Tong'an district, which showed a change in the direction of expansion of its area of intermediate and high IS.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-1 and 2 Time Series for Land Cover Classification of Forest-Agriculture Mosaics in Temperate and Tropical Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest-agriculture mosaics is crucial for understanding landscape heterogeneity and managing biodiversity. Mapping these mosaics from remotely sensed imagery remains challenging, since ecological gradients from forested to agricultural areas make characterizing vegetation more difficult. The recent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) time series provide a great opportunity to monitor forest-agriculture mosaics due to their high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, while a few studies have used the temporal resolution of S-2 time series alone to map land cover and land use in cropland and/or forested areas, S-1 time series have not yet been investigated alone for this purpose. The combined use of S-1 & S-2 time series has been assessed for only one or a few land cover classes. In this study, we assessed the potential of S-1 data alone, S-2 data alone, and their combined use for mapping forest-agriculture mosaics over two study areas: a temperate mountainous landscape in the Cantabrian Range (Spain) and a tropical forested landscape in Paragominas (Brazil). Satellite images were classified using an incremental procedure based on an importance rank of the input features. The classifications obtained with S-2 data alone (mean kappa index = 0.59-0.83) were more accurate than those obtained with S-1 data alone (mean kappa index = 0.28-0.72). Accuracy increased when combining S-1 and 2 data (mean kappa index = 0.55-0.85). The method enables defining the number and type of features that discriminate land cover classes in an optimal manner according to the type of landscape considered. The best configuration for the Spanish and Brazilian study areas included 5 and 10 features, respectively, for S-2 data alone and 10 and 20 features, respectively, for S-1 data alone. Short-wave infrared and VV and VH polarizations were key features of S-2 and S-1 data, respectively. In addition, the method enables defining key periods that discriminate land cover classes according to the type of images used. For example, in the Cantabrian Range, winter and summer were key for S-2 time series, while spring and winter were key for S-1 time series.

TI  - Multispectral Approach for Identifying Invasive Plant Species Based on Flowering Phenology Characteristics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant species (IPS) are the second biggest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss. Since the spatial extent of IPS is essential for managing the invaded ecosystem, the current study aims at identifying and mapping the aggressive IPS of Acacia salicina and Acacia saligna, to understand better the key factors influencing their distribution in the coastal plain of Israel. This goal was achieved by integrating airborne-derived hyperspectral imaging and multispectral earth observation for creating species distribution maps. Hyperspectral data, in conjunction with high spatial resolution species distribution maps, were used to train the multispectral images at the species level. We incorporated a series of statistical models to classify the IPS location and to recognize their distribution and density. We took advantage of the phenological flowering stages of Acacia trees, as obtained by the multispectral images, for the support vector machine classification procedure. The classification yielded an overall Kappa coefficient accuracy of 0.89. We studied the effect of various environmental and human factors on IPS density by using a random forest machine learning model, to understand the mechanisms underlying successful invasions, and to assess where IPS have a higher likelihood of occurring. This algorithm revealed that the high density of Acacia most closely related to elevation, temperature pattern, and distances from rivers, settlements, and roads. Our results demonstrate how the integration of remote-sensing data with different data sources can assist in determining IPS proliferation and provide detailed geographic information for conservation and management efforts to prevent their future spread.

TI  - An Improved GrabCut Method Based on a Visual Attention Model for Rare-Earth Ore Mining Area Recognition with High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved GrabCut method based on a visual attention model is proposed to extract rare-earth ore mining area information using high-resolution remote sensing images. The proposed method makes use of advantages of both the visual attention model and GrabCut method, and the visual attention model was referenced to generate a saliency map as the initial of the GrabCut method instead of manual initialization. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was designed as a bound term added into the Energy Function of GrabCut to further improve the accuracy of the segmentation result. The proposed approach was employed to extract rare-earth ore mining areas in Dingnan County and Xunwu County, China, using GF-1 (GaoFen No.1 satellite launched by China) and ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite) high-resolution remotely-sensed satellite data, and experimental results showed that FPR (False Positive Rate) and FNR (False Negative Rate) were, respectively, lower than 12.5% and 6.5%, and PA (Pixel Accuracy), MPA (Mean Pixel Accuracy), MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union), and FWIoU (frequency weighted intersection over union) all reached up to 90% in four experiments. Comparison results with traditional classification methods (such as Object-oriented CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Object-oriented SVM (Support Vector Machine)) indicated the proposed method performed better for object boundary identification. The proposed method could be useful for accurate and automatic information extraction for rare-earth ore mining areas.

TI  - Monitoring Extreme Agricultural Drought over the Horn of Africa (HOA) Using Remote Sensing Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Horn of Africa ((HOA), including Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia) has been slammed by extreme drought within the past years, and has become one of the most food-insecure regions in the world. Millions of people in the HOA are undernourished and are at risk of famine. Meanwhile, global climate change continues to cause more extreme weather and climate events, such as drought and heat waves, which have significant impacts on crop production and food security. This study aimed to investigate extreme drought in the Horn of Africa region, using satellite remote sensing data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), a key instrument onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellites Terra and Aqua, as well as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data products. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) data from 2000 to 2017 were derived from the MODIS measurements and analyzed for assessments of the temporal trend of vegetation health and the impacts of extreme drought events. The results demonstrated the severity of vegetation stress and extreme drought during the past decades. From 1998 to 2017, monthly precipitation over major crop growth seasons decreased significantly. From 2001 to 2017, the mean VHI anomaly of HOA cropland decreased significantly, at a trend of -0.2364 +/- 0.1446/year, and the mean TCI anomaly decreased at a trend of -0.2315 +/- 0.2009/year. This indicated a deterioration of cropland due to drought conditions in the HOA. During most of the crop growth seasons in 2015 and 2016, the VHI values were below the 10-year (2001-2010) average: This was caused by extreme drought during the 2015-2016 El Nino event, one of the strongest El Nino events in recorded history. In addition, monthly VHI anomalies demonstrated a high correlation with monthly rainfall anomalies in July and August (the growth season of major crops in the HOA), and the trough points of the monthly rainfall and VHI anomaly time series of July and August were consistent with the timing of drought events and El Nino events.

TI  - Heat and Drought Stress Advanced Global Wheat Harvest Timing from 1981-2014
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying wheat phenology can greatly enhance our understanding of how wheat growth responds to climate change, and guide us to reasonably confront its influence. However, comprehensive global-scale wheat phenology-climate analysis is still lacking. In this study, we extracted the wheat harvest date (WHD) from 1981-2014 from satellite data using threshold-, logistic-, and shape-based methods. Then, we analyzed the effects of heat and drought stress on WHD based on gridded daily temperature and monthly drought data (the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)) over global wheat-growing areas. The results show that WHD was generally delayed from the low to mid latitudes. With respect to variation trends, we detected a significant advancement of WHD in 32.1% of the world's wheat-growing areas since 1981, with an average changing rate of -0.25 days/yr. A significant negative correlation was identified between WHD and the prior three months' normal-growing-degree-days across 50.4% of the study region, which implies that greater preseason effective temperature accumulation may cause WHD to occur earlier. Meanwhile, WHD was also found to be significantly and negatively correlated with the prior three months' extreme-growing-degree-days across only 9.6% of the study region (mainly located in northern South Asia and north Central-West Asia). The effects of extreme heat stress were weaker than those of normal thermal conditions. When extreme drought (measured by PDSI/SPEI) occurred in the current month, in the month prior to WHD, and in the second month prior to WHD, it forced WHD to advance by about 9.0/8.1 days, 13.8/12.2 days, and 10.8/5.3 days compared to normal conditions, respectively. In conclusion, we highlight the effects that heat and drought stress have on advancing wheat harvest timing, which should be a research focus under future climate change.

TI  - Comparison of Leaf Area Index, Surface Temperature, and Actual Evapotranspiration Estimated Using the METRIC Model and In Situ Measurements
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The verification of remotely sensed estimates of surface variables is essential for any remote sensing study. The objective of this study was to compare leaf area index (LAI), surface temperature (Ts), and actual evapotranspiration (ETa), estimated using the remote sensing-based METRIC model and in situ measurements collected at the satellite overpass time. The study was carried out at a commercial corn field in eastern South Dakota. Six clear-sky images from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 (Path 29, Row 29) were processed and used for the assessment. LAI and Ts were measured in situ, and ETa was estimated using an atmometer and independent crop coefficients. The results revealed good agreement between the variables measured in situ and estimated by the METRIC model. LAI showed r(2) = 0.76, and RMSE = 0.59 m(2) m(-2), the Ts comparison had an agreement of r(2) = 0.87 and RMSE 1.24 degrees C, and ETa presented r(2) = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.71 mm day(-1).

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth over the Arctic Snow-Covered Regions Derived from Dual-Viewing Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol properties over the Arctic snow-covered regions are sparsely provided by temporal and spatially limited in situ measurements or active Lidar observations. This introduces large uncertainties for the understanding of aerosol effects on Arctic climate change. In this paper, aerosol optical depth (AOD) is derived using the advanced along-track scanning radiometer (AATSR) instrument. The basic idea is to utilize the dual-viewing observation capability of AATSR to reduce the impacts of AOD uncertainties introduced by the absolute wavelength-dependent error on surface reflectance estimation. AOD is derived assuming that the satellite observed surface reflectance ratio can be well characterized by a snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model with a certain correction direct from satellite top of the atmosphere (TOA) observation. The aerosol types include an Arctic haze aerosol obtained from campaign measurement and Arctic background aerosol (maritime aerosol) types. The proper aerosol type is selected during the iteration step based on the minimization residual. The algorithm has been used over Spitsbergen for the spring period (April-May) and the AOD spatial distribution indicates that the retrieval AOD can capture the Arctic haze event. The comparison with AERONET observations shows promising results, with a correlation coefficient R = 0.70. The time series analysis shows no systematical biases between AATSR retrieved AOD and AERONET observed ones.

TI  - Multiple Flights or Single Flight Instrument Fusion of Hyperspectral and ALS Data? A Comparison of their Performance for Vegetation Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusion of remote sensing data often improves vegetation mapping, compared to using data from only a single source. The effectiveness of this fusion is subject to many factors, including the type of data, collection method, and purpose of the analysis. In this study, we compare the usefulness of hyperspectral (HS) and Airborne Laser System (ALS) data fusion acquired in separate flights, Multiple Flights Data Fusion (MFDF), and during a single flight through Instrument Fusion (IF) for the classification of non-forest vegetation. An area of 6.75 km(2) was selected, where hyperspectral and ALS data was collected during two flights in 2015 and one flight in 2017. This data was used to classify three non-forest Natura 2000 habitats i.e., Xeric sand calcareous grasslands (code 6120), alluvial meadows of river valleys of the Cnidion dubii (code 6440), species-rich Nardus grasslands (code 6230) using a Random Forest classifier. Our findings show that it is not possible to determine which sensor, HS, or ALS used independently leads to a higher classification accuracy for investigated Natura 2000 habitats. Concurrently, increased stability and consistency of classification results was confirmed, regardless of the type of fusion used; IF, MFDF and varied information relevance of single sensor data. The research shows that the manner of data collection, using MFDF or IF, does not determine the level of relevance of ALS or HS data. The analysis of fusion effectiveness, gauged as the accuracy of the classification result and time consumed for data collection, has shown a superiority of IF over MFDF. IF delivered classification results that are more accurate compared to MFDF. IF is always cheaper than MFDF and the difference in effectiveness of both methods becomes more pronounced when the area of aerial data collection becomes larger.

TI  - Mangrove Phenology and Environmental Drivers Derived from Remote Sensing in Southern Thailand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is the annual cycle timing of vegetation growth. Mangrove phenology is a vital component to assess mangrove viability and includes start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), peak of season (POS), and length of season (LOS). Potential environmental drivers include air temperature (Ta), surface temperature (Ts), sea surface temperature (SST), rainfall, sea surface salinity (SSS), and radiation flux (Ra). The Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, MOD13Q1) data over five study sites between 2003 and 2012. Four of the mangrove study sites were located on the Malay Peninsula on the Andaman Sea and one site located on the Gulf of Thailand. The goals of this study were to characterize phenology patterns across equatorial Thailand Indo-Malay mangrove forests, identify climatic and aquatic drivers of mangrove seasonality, and compare mangrove phenologies with surrounding upland tropical forests. Our results show the seasonality of mangrove growth was distinctly different from the surrounding land-based tropical forests. The mangrove growth season was approximately 8-9 months duration, starting in April to June, peaking in August to October and ending in January to February of the following year. The 10-year trend analysis revealed significant delaying trends in SOS, POS, and EOS for the Andaman Sea sites but only for EOS at the Gulf of Thailand site. The cumulative rainfall is likely to be the main factor driving later mangrove phenologies.

TI  - Evaluation of the Potential of Convolutional Neural Networks and Random Forests for Multi-Class Segmentation of Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivated by the increasing availability of open and free Earth observation data through the Copernicus Sentinel missions, this study investigates the capacity of advanced computational models to automatically generate thematic layers, which in turn contribute to and facilitate the creation of land cover products. In concrete terms, we assess the practical and computational aspects of multi-class Sentinel-2 image segmentation based on a convolutional neural network and random forest approaches. The annotated learning set derives from data that is made available as result of the implementation of European Union's INSPIRE Directive. Since this network of data sets remains incomplete in regard to some geographic areas, another objective of this work was to provide consistent and reproducible ways for machine-driven mapping of these gaps and a potential update of the existing ones. Finally, the performance analysis identifies the most important hyper-parameters, and provides hints on the models' deployment and their transferability.

TI  - A Novel Spatio-Temporal FCN-LSTM Network for Recognizing Various Crop Types Using Multi-Temporal Radar Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, analyzing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has turned into one of the challenging and interesting topics in remote sensing. Radar sensors are capable of imaging Earth's surface independently of the weather conditions, local time of day, penetrating of waves through clouds, and containing spatial information on agricultural crop types. Based on these characteristics, the main goal sought in this research is to reveal the SAR imaging data capability in recognizing various agricultural crops in the main growth season in a more clarified and detailed way by using a deep-learning-based method. In the present research, the multi-temporal C-band Sentinel 1 images were used to classify 14 major classes of agricultural crops plus background in Denmark. By considering the capability of a deep learning method in analyzing satellite images, a novel, optimal, and lightweight network structure was developed and implemented based on a combination of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network. The average pixel-based accuracy and Intersection over Union obtained from the proposed network were 86% and 0.64, respectively. Winter rapeseed, winter barley, winter wheat, spring barley, and sugar beet had the highest pixel-based accuracies of 95%, 94%, 93%, 90%, and 90%; respectively. The pixel-based accuracies for eight crop types and the background class were more than 84%. The network prediction showed that in field borders the classification confidence was lower than the center regions of the fields. However, the proposed structure has been able to identify different crops in multi-temporal Sentinel 1 data of a large area of around 254 thousand hectares with high performance.

TI  - A Review of Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Blue Carbon Ecosystems: Mangroves, Seagrasses and Salt Marshes during 2010-2018
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems are an important coastal resource, as they provide a range of goods and services to the environment. They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.

TI  - Wet and Dry Snow Detection Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data for Mountainous Areas with a Machine Learning Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional studies on mapping wet snow cover extent (SCE) often feature limitations, especially in vegetated and mountainous areas. The aim of this study is to propose a new total and wet SCE mapping strategy based on freely accessible spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The approach is transferable on a global scale as well as for different land cover types (including densely vegetated forest and agricultural regions), and is based on the use of backscattering coefficient, interferometric SAR coherence, and polarimetric parameters. Furthermore, four topographical factors were included in the simple tuning of random forest-based land cover type-dependent classification strategy. Results showed the classification accuracy was above 0.75, with an F-measure higher than 0.70, in all five selected regions of interest located around globally distributed mountain ranges. Whilst excluding forest-type land cover classes, the accuracy and F-measure increases to 0.80 and 0.75. In cross-location model set, the accuracy can also be maintained at 0.80 with non-forest accuracy up to 0.85. It has been found that the elevation and polarimetric parameters are the most critical factors, and that the quality of land cover information would also affect the subsequent mapping reliability. In conclusion, through comprehensive validation using optical satellite and in-situ data, our land cover-dependent total SCE mapping approach has been confirmed to be robustly applicable, and the holistic SCE map for different months were eventually derived.

TI  - Influence of Straw Burning on Urban Air Pollutant Concentrations in Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeast China is China's primary grain production base. A large amount of crop straw is incinerated every spring and autumn, which greatly impacts air quality. To study the degree of influence of straw burning on urban pollutant concentrations, this study used The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer/Terra Thermal Anomalies & Fire Daily L3 Global 1 km V006 (MOD14A1) and The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer/Aqua Thermal Anomalies and Fire Daily L3 Global 1 km V006 (MYD14A1) data from 2015 to 2017 to extract fire spot data on arable land burning and to study the spatial distribution characteristics of straw burning on urban pollutant concentrations, temporal variation characteristics and impact thresholds. The results show that straw burning in Northeast China is concentrated in spring and autumn; the seasonal spatial distributions of PM2.5, PM10 andAir Quality Index (AQI) in 41 cities or regions in Northeast China correspond to the seasonal variation of fire spots; and pollutants appear in the peak periods of fire spots. In areas where the concentration coefficient of rice or corn is greater than 1, the number of fire spots has a strong correlation with the urban pollution index. The correlation coefficient R between the number of burned fire spots and the pollutant concentration has a certain relationship with the urban distribution. Cities are aggregated in geospatial space with different R values.

M3  - Article
AB  - Launched on 15 November 2017, China's FengYun-3D (FY-3D) has taken over prime operational weather service from the aging FengYun-3B (FY-3B). Rather than directly implementing an FY-3B operational snow depth retrieval algorithm on FY-3D, we investigated this and four other well-known snow depth algorithms with respect to regional uncertainties in China. Applicable to various passive microwave sensors, these four snow depth algorithms are the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Centre of Western China (WESTDC) algorithm, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) algorithm, the Chang algorithm, and the Foster algorithm. Among these algorithms, validation results indicate that FY-3B and WESTDC perform better than the others. However, these two algorithms often result in considerable underestimation for deep snowpack (greater than 20 cm), while the other three persistently overestimate snow depth, probably because of their poor representation of snowpack characteristics in China. To overcome the retrieval errors that occur under deep snowpack conditions without sacrificing performance under relatively thin snowpack conditions, we developed an empirical snow depth retrieval algorithm suite for the FY-3D satellite. Independent evaluation using weather station observations in 2014 and 2015 demonstrates that the FY-3D snow depth algorithm's root mean square error (RMSE) and bias are 6.6 cm and 0.2 cm, respectively, and it has advantages over other similar algorithms.

TI  - Change Analysis in Urban Areas Based on Statistical Features and Temporal Clustering Using TerraSAR-X Time-Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing unsupervised multitemporal change detection approaches for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images based on the pixel level usually suffer from the serious influence of speckle noise, and the classification accuracy of temporal change patterns is liable to be affected by the generation method of similarity matrices and the pre-specified cluster number. To address these issues, a novel time-series change detection method with high efficiency is proposed in this paper. Firstly, spatial feature extraction using local statistical information on patches is conducted to reduce the noise and for subsequent temporal grouping. Secondly, a density-based clustering method is adopted to categorize the pixel series in the temporal dimension, in view of its efficiency and robustness. Change detection and classification results are then obtained by a fast differential strategy in the final step. The experimental results and analysis of synthetic and realistic time-series SAR images acquired by TerraSAR-X in urban areas demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms other approaches in terms of both qualitative results and quantitative indices of macro F1-scores and micro F1-scores. Furthermore, we make the case that more temporal change information for buildings can be obtained, which includes when the first and last detected change occurred and the frequency of changes.

TI  - Coastal Wetland Mapping with Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery Based on Gravitational Optimized Multilayer Perceptron and Morphological Attribute Profiles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland mapping plays an essential role in monitoring climate change, the hydrological cycle, and water resources. In this study, a novel classification framework based on the gravitational optimized multilayer perceptron classifier and extended multi-attribute profiles (EMAPs) is presented for coastal wetland mapping using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) imagery. In the proposed method, the morphological attribute profiles (APs) are firstly extracted using four attribute filters based on the characteristics of wetlands in each band from Sentinel-2 imagery. These APs form a set of EMAPs which comprehensively represent the irregular wetland objects in multiscale and multilevel. The EMAPs and original spectral features are then classified with a new multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier whose parameters are optimized by a stability-constrained adaptive alpha for a gravitational search algorithm. The performance of the proposed method was investigated using Sentinel-2 MSI images of two coastal wetlands, i.e., the Jiaozhou Bay and the Yellow River Delta in Shandong province of eastern China. Comparisons with four other classifiers through visual inspection and quantitative evaluation verified the superiority of the proposed method. Furthermore, the effectiveness of different APs in EMAPs were also validated. By combining the developed EMAPs features and novel MLP classifier, complicated wetland types with high within-class variability and low between-class disparity were effectively discriminated. The superior performance of the proposed framework makes it available and preferable for the mapping of complicated coastal wetlands using Sentinel-2 data and other similar optical imagery.

T2  - LANGMUIR
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th Pacific Polymer Conference (PPC)
CL  - Xiamen, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Precise incorporation of functional residues into sequences allows for tailoring the noncovalent interactions between peptides to guide their self-assembly into well-defined nanostructures, thus facilitating creation of artificial functional materials resembling natural systems. Here, we report on the self-assembly of dipeptides consisting of one fluorinated phenylalanine unit (Z residue) and one natural aromatic residue into laminated nanofibers predominately driven by polar-pi interactions. On the basis of characterizations using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thioflavin T binding assay, we found that the face-centered stacking pattern of the dipeptides FZ, ZF, and ZY stabilized by the polar-pi interactions and antiparallel beta-sheet H-bonding interactions led to lamination of nanofibers and formation of ribbonlike nanostructures. Our findings demonstrate that incorporation of fluorinated aromatic units into short peptides not only promotes of polar-pi interactions as alternative self-assembling driving forces but also governs the organizing pattern of peptides, thus benefiting creation of well-defined peptide nanostructures.

TI  - Mapping Tidal Flats with Landsat 8 Images and Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of the China's Eastern Coastal Zone circa 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date tidal flat mapping is of much importance to learning how coastal ecosystems work in a time of anthropogenic disturbances and rising sea levels, which will provide scientific instruction for sustainable management and ecological assessments. For large-scale and high spatial-resolution mapping of tidal flats, it is difficult to obtain accurate tidal flat maps without multi-temporal observation data. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential and advantages of the freely accessible Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery archive and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for accurate tidal flats mapping. A novel approach was proposed, including multi-temporal feature extraction, machine learning classification using GEE and morphological post-processing. The 50 km buffer of the coastline from Hangzhou Bay to Yalu River in China's eastern coastal zone was taken as the study area. From the perspective of natural attributes and unexploited status of tidal flats, we delineated a broader extent comprising intertidal flats, supratidal barren flats and vegetated flats, since intertidal flats are major component of the tidal flats. The overall accuracy of the resultant map was about 94.4% from a confusion matrix for accuracy assessment. The results showed that the use of time-series images can greatly eliminate the effects of tidal level, and improve the mapping accuracy. This study also proved the potential and advantage of combining the GEE platform with time-series Landsat images, due to its powerful cloud computing platform, especially for large scale and longtime tidal flats mapping.

TI  - An experimental study on the characteristic pattern of internal solitary waves in optical remote-sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the mechanism of different imaging characteristics is necessary for image interpretation and information extraction of internal solitary waves (ISWs). In this article, the experimental method is used to reveal the mechanism of different bright and dark patterns in optical remote-sensing images. It provides a scientific method to interpret the imaging characteristics of ISWs in optical remote-sensing images. The results prove that there are two critical angles which are important for optical remote-sensing image interpretation. The critical angle is related to the zenith angle of the light source, sensor, and the wave slope modulated by ISWs. When the zenith angle of the light source is fixed and the zenith angle of the sensor is located between two critical angles, the ISWs appear as dark-bright pattern in optical remote-sensing images. Otherwise, the ISWs appear as bright-dark pattern. This method has been applied to the images acquired around the Dongsha Islands in the South China Sea, and similar results are obtained which indicate that the method is effective and applicable.

TI  - An Analysis of Land Surface Temperature Trends in the Central Himalayan Region Based on MODIS Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scientific community has widely reported the impacts of climate change on the Central Himalaya. To qualify and quantify these effects, long-term land surface temperature observations in both the daytime and nighttime, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer from 2000 to 2017, were used in this study to investigate the spatiotemporal variations and their changing mechanism. Two periodic parameters, the mean annual surface temperature (MAST) and the annual maximum temperature (MAXT), were derived based on an annual temperature cycle model to reduce the influences from the cloud cover and were used to analyze their trend during the period. The general thermal environment represented by the average MAST indicated a significant spatial distribution pattern along with the elevation gradient. Behind the clear differences in the daytime and nighttime temperatures at different physiographical regions, the trend test conducted with the Mann-Kendall (MK) method showed that most of the areas with significant changes showed an increasing trend, and the nighttime temperatures exhibited a more significant increasing trend than the daytime temperatures, for both the MAST and MAXT, according to the changing areas. The nighttime changing areas were more widely distributed (more than 28%) than the daytime changing areas (around 10%). The average change rates of the MAST and MAXT in the daytime are 0.102 degrees C/yr and 0.190 degrees C/yr, and they are generally faster than those in the nighttime (0.048 degrees C/yr and 0.091 degrees C/yr, respectively). The driving force analysis suggested that urban expansion, shifts in the courses of lowland rivers, and the retreat of both the snow and glacier cover presented strong effects on the local thermal environment, in addition to the climatic warming effect. Moreover, the strong topographic gradient greatly influenced the change rate and evidenced a significant elevation-dependent warming effect, especially for the nighttime LST. Generally, this study suggested that the nighttime temperature was more sensitive to climate change than the daytime temperature, and this general warming trend clearly observed in the central Himalayan region could have important influences on local geophysical, hydrological, and ecological processes.

TI  - Monitoring the Extent of Reclamation of Small Scale Mining Areas Using Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Small scale mining is mainly widespread in developing and underdeveloped countries. Although it is a source of livelihood for several people, it causes environmental degradation. Reclamation is needed to restore mined areas to an acceptable condition. This study uses ANN to monitor reclamation activities in small scale mining area. Landsat satellite images of study area (2007, 2011 and 2016), ground truth data and ESRI shapefile of the study area were used for the analyses. Two ANN classification methods, Unsupervised Self - Organized Mapping (SOM) and Supervised Multilayer Perception (MLP), were used for the classification of the satellite images. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) change maps were generated in order to help confirm where actual change had occurred and to what extent it had occurred. The results show disturbance and revegetation in the study area between 2007 and 2016. The Barelands/mined areas class increased by 60.4% and a decrease in the vegetation class by 18.7% from 2007 to 2011. There was revegetation from 2011 to 2016 with the Barelands/Mined Area decreasing by 51.7% and the vegetation increasing by 3.9%. The study shows an increase in the settlement class by 87.3%. The research concludes that the application of ANN be strongly encouraged for image classification and mine reclamation monitoring in the country due to the size and quality of training data, network architecture, and training parameters as well as the ability to improve the accuracy and fine tune information obtained from individual classes as compared to other classification methods.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Land Use/Land Cover Change in the Heterogeneous Coastal Region of Bangladesh between 1990 and 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although a detailed analysis of land use and land cover (LULC) change is essential in providing a greater understanding of increased human-environment interactions across the coastal region of Bangladesh, substantial challenges still exist for accurately classifying coastal LULC. This is due to the existence of high-level landscape heterogeneity and unavailability of good quality remotely sensed data. This study, the first of a kind, implemented a unique methodological approach to this challenge. Using freely available Landsat imagery, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-based informative feature selection and Random Forest classification is used to elucidate spatio-temporal patterns of LULC across coastal areas over a 28-year period (1990-2017). We show that the XGBoost feature selection approach effectively addresses the issue of high landscape heterogeneity and spectral complexities in the image data, successfully augmenting the RF model performance (providing a mean user's accuracy > 0.82). Multi-temporal LULC maps reveal that Bangladesh's coastal areas experienced a net increase in agricultural land (5.44%), built-up (4.91%) and river (4.52%) areas over the past 28 years. While vegetation cover experienced a net decrease (8.26%), an increasing vegetation trend was observed in the years since 2000, primarily due to the Bangladesh government's afforestation initiatives across the southern coastal belts. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of coastal LULC patterns, which will be useful for policy makers and resource managers to incorporate into coastal land use and environmental management practices. This work also provides useful methodological insights for future research to effectively address the spatial and spectral complexities of remotely sensed data used in classifying the LULC of a heterogeneous landscape.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of new land development in Bangladesh coast and its potential uses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the land has direct links with food security, economic growth, and overall development. The demand for land is increasing, but the amount of available land is diminishing every year due to population pressure. This situation is an immediate reality in smaller countries like Bangladesh where land scarcity is a critical problem due to high population density. The only way to create new land is to develop land on the coast, restore eroded land, and enhance the new-land development process through accretion in the delta. We analyzed Landsat satellite images (1996, 2006 and 2015) to quantify the spatiotemporal change in the land area in the coastal Bangladesh. Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms were used to classify coastal area into two classes, land and water.The results indicate that the net gain of land was 39.67, 39.12 and 78.79 km(2) during 1996-2006, 2006-2015 and 1996-2015, respectively. This approach revealed the dynamics of land gain and loss in the Bangladesh coast, where spatial information on coastal land are sparse. If this new land brought under cultivation, it would fulfill a growing demand for cultivable land and would produce 41,898 tons of cereal, supporting an additional 210,543 people per year. Alternately, the same amount of land would produce 285,061 Mg ha(-1) forest biomass under afforestation. These results can serve as a baseline for policy and planning in Bangladesh regarding new land development, restoration, and future use.

TI  - Towards improved remote sensing based monitoring of dryland ecosystem functioning using sequential linear regression slopes (SeRGS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method for remote sensing based monitoring of changes in dryland ecosystem functioning based on the assumption that an altered vegetation rainfall relationship (VRR) indicates changes in vegetation biophysical processes, potentially leading to changes in ecosystem functioning. We describe the VRR through a linear regression between integrated rainfall and vegetation productivity (using NDVI as a proxy) within a combined spatio-temporal window, sequentially moved over the study area and along the temporal axis of a time series. The trend in the slope values derived from such a sequential linear regression, termed SeRGS, thus represents a measure of change in the VRR. Scenarios of land degradation, defined here as a reduction in biological productivity, which may be caused by either climatic or anthropogenic factors are simulated for the period 1970-2016 from CRU rainfall and modelled NDVI data to test and evaluate the performance of the SeRGS method in detecting degradation, and compare it against the well-known RESTREND method. We found that SeRGS showed (1) overall more pronounced trends and higher significance levels (p <= 0.01) in detecting degradation events and (2) an improved statistical basis for the calculation of trends in the VRR (expressed by high coefficients of determination throughout the period of analysis), which was found to increase the validity of the results produced. Through the implementation of the temporal moving window the effect of inter-annual rainfall variability on vegetation productivity was effectively reduced, thereby enabling a more exact and reliable identification of the timing of degradation events (e.g. start, maximum and end of degradation) by using a time series breakpoint analysis (BFAST). Finally, the SeRGS method was applied using real data for Senegal (seasonally integrated MODIS NDVI and CHIRPS rainfall data 2000-2016) and we discuss patterns and trends. This study provides the theoretical basis for an improved assessment of changes in dryland ecosystem functioning, which is of relevance to land degradation monitoring targeting loss of vegetation productivity.

TI  - Groundwater dynamics in fossil fractured carbonate aquifers in Eastern Arabian Peninsula: A preliminary investigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern Arabian Peninsula represents the main natural groundwater discharge area of the Arabian platform fossil aquifer system. In such settings, connections between aquifers could strongly affect the flow dynamics, water quality and availability as well as karst formation and landscape evolution. Geological structures such as folds and faults are central to aquifer connectivity, yet their role on groundwater flow is poorly understood. Herein, we perform mapping of exposed and buried structural features in the Qatar Peninsula using Landsat, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PaISAR scenes, correlated with field, GPR and isotopic data to assess their role in aquifer connections and groundwater dynamics. Our results suggest that ENE-WSW oriented fold-related faults act as vertical conduits along which artesian upward leakages from the deep Aruma aquifer take place into the shallower main aquifer unit (i.e. Umm er Radhuma and Rus) in southern Qatar Peninsula. On the other hand, downward leakage from the freshwater lens in the Dammam aquifer take place in northern Qatar Peninsula. The deep, brackish, and gaseous-rich waters ascending along faults in south Qatar Peninsula, in addition to degrading the water quality in the main aquifer unit, enhance dissolution of carbonates and evaporites leading to strong karstification that produces abundant collapse features. Our findings suggest that structure controls can add significant complexity to recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics in fossil aquifers. Future large-scale radar subsurface mapping will be essential to resolve the variability of the water heads in such areas and its correlation to structural discontinuities.

TI  - Trap Tree and Interception Trap Techniques for Management of Ambrosia Beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) in Nursery Production
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of wood-boring ambrosia beetles are strongly attracted to ethanol, a behavior which could be exploited for management within ornamental nurseries. A series of experiments was conducted to determine if ethanol-based interception techniques could reduce ambrosia beetle pest pressure. In two experiments, trap trees injected with a high dose of ethanol were positioned either adjacent or 1015 m from trees injected with a low dose of ethanol (simulating a mildly stressed tree) to determine if the high-dose trap trees could draw beetle attacks away from immediately adjacent stressed nursery trees. The high-ethanol-dose trees sustained considerably higher attacks than the low-dose trees; however, distance between the low- and high-dose trees did not significantly alter attack rates on the low-dose trees. In a third experiment, 60-m length trap lines with varying densities of ethanol-baited traps were deployed along a forest edge to determine if immigrating beetles could be intercepted before reaching sentinel traps or artificially stressed sentinel trees located 10 m further in-field. Intercept trap densities of 2 or 4 traps per trap line were associated with fewer attacks on sentinel trees compared to no traps, but 7 or 13 traps had no impact. None of the tested intercept trap densities resulted in significantly fewer beetles reaching the sentinel traps. The evaluated ethanol-based interception techniques showed limited promise for reducing ambrosia beetle pressure on nursery trees. An interception effect might be enhanced by applying a repellent compound to nursery trees in a pushpull strategy.

TI  - Multi-Source Data Fusion Based on Ensemble Learning for Rapid Building Damage Mapping during the 2018 Sulawesi Earthquake and Tsunami in Palu, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a detailed analysis of building damage recognition, employing multi-source data fusion and ensemble learning algorithms for rapid damage mapping tasks. A damage classification framework is introduced and tested to categorize the building damage following the recent 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami. Three robust ensemble learning classifiers were investigated for recognizing building damage from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing datasets and their derived features. The contribution of each feature dataset was also explored, considering different combinations of sensors as well as their temporal information. SAR scenes acquired by the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 sensors were used. The optical Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope sensors were also included in this study. A non-local filter in the preprocessing phase was used to enhance the SAR features. Our results demonstrated that the canonical correlation forests classifier performs better in comparison to the other classifiers. In the data fusion analysis, Digital Elevation Model (DEM)- and SAR-derived features contributed the most in the overall damage classification. Our proposed mapping framework successfully classifies four levels of building damage (with overall accuracy >90%, average accuracy >67%). The proposed framework learned the damage patterns from a limited available human-interpreted building damage annotation and expands this information to map a larger affected area. This process including pre- and post-processing phases were completed in about 3 h after acquiring all raw datasets.

TI  - Prevalence of Syphilis and Related Risk Behaviors Among Women in 5 Distinct Indigenous Populations in Paraguay
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of syphilis among women of reproductive age from 5 distinct indigenous populations in Paraguay. We also sought to identify the demographic profile and behaviors of women with elevated prevalence of syphilis.Methods: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional survey among women aged 15 to 49 years from 5 distinct language families in Paraguay in 2016. The 5 language families were Guarani, Maskoy, Mataco, Guaicuru, and Zamuco, sampled through a probability-based, multistage cluster design. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographic characteristics and risk-related behavior. Blood samples were drawn for rapid testing for syphilis with confirmation and titers. Participants provided written informed consent; minors had written parental consent and provided their own assent.Results: A total of 1732 indigenous women were enrolled. Overall syphilis prevalence was 6.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-8.0). Syphilis prevalence varied by language family/ethnic group (P = 0.010), with Mataco having the highest prevalence (8.2%; 95% CI, 5.3-11.9) and Maskoy having the lowest (2.5%; 95% CI, 1.1-4.7). Women reporting multiple partners (11.3%; 95% CI, 6.9-17.1; P = 0.031) and transactional sex in the last year (18.7%; 95% CI, 7.2-36.4; P = 0.010) had higher prevalence of syphilis.Conclusions: Our survey found high prevalence of syphilis in indigenous women in Paraguay, in association with transactional sex and multiple partners. Interventions to reduce sexual behaviors associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in indigenous women must be carried out with programs aimed at addressing transactional sex, appropriately framed to respect interculturality and an indigenous worldview.

TI  - Use of the earth and growth of the population in the east of the state of Mexico
T2  - TECNOLOGIA EN MARCHA
M3  - Article
AB  - The east of the state of Mexico in recent years has had a large growth of urban centers, changing the use of natural resources. The objective is to characterize the use of the land and relate it to the population growth, to diagnose the impact of the population in the microbasin of the Coatepec and El Manzano rivers. For the above, eight uses of the land were characterized. Being the agricultural use the most representative of the basin. Through digital orthophotos and images from Landsat 7 satellites, maps of land use were generated for the years 1999 and 2015. The results obtained were the reduction of hectares destined for use: agricultural, vegetation less dense and, wasteland; while hectares were increased for urban use, mine and scrub. The changes in land use are related to the population growth of the municipalities present in the east of the state of Mexico: Chicoloapan, Ixtapaluca and Texcoco, with a growth rate in percent of 10.87, 4.4 and 1.2 respectively. It is recommended to diversify the crops, implement a controlled grazing system in scrub areas, as well as a management plan for 800 hectares of forest. Establish containment works for the control of runoff and reduction of trawls in the Manzano and Coatepec rivers

TI  - Secure communication and archiving of low altitude remote sensing data using high capacity fragile data hiding
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragile data hiding has been extensively used for secure transmission of the sensitive data using cover images, audios and videos. In the past decade, increasingly the remote sensing applications require transmission and archiving of large number of aerial images and videos. Storage and processing of remote sensing data in the public cloud computing and storage platforms, with servers outside the control of the data owners, requires sufficient attention to persevering the privacy of the data. Furthermore, in the past few years the applications of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles demand algorithms designed especially for low altitude remote sensing data. In this paper, a novel fragile data hiding algorithm for secure transmission and archiving of sensitive data in low altitude aerial videos is presented. The proposed method incorporates Integer-to-Integer discrete wavelet transform and lattice vector quantization to present a high capacity data hiding algorithm. The fragility of the proposed algorithm results in the loss of the embedded authentication credential by any tampering attempt. The experimental results show that the proposed fragile data hiding algorithm is capable of hiding significantly higher amount of data in the aerial videos compared to other existing algorithms while keeping the perceptual quality of the cover media in an acceptable range.

TI  - Assessment and inter-comparison of recently developed/reprocessed microwave satellite soil moisture products using ISMN ground-based measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in understanding the climate system through its control on the land surface energy, water budget partitioning, and the carbon cycle. Monitoring SM at regional scale has become possible thanks to microwave remote sensing. In the past two decades, several satellites were launched carrying on board either radiometer (passive) or radar (active) or both sensors in different frequency bands with various spatial and temporal resolutions. Soil moisture algorithms are in rapid development and their improvements/revisions are ongoing. The latest SM retrieval products and versions of products that have been recently released are not yet, to our knowledge, comprehensively evaluated and inter-compared over different ecoregions and climate conditions. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the most recent microwave-based SM retrieval products available from NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite, ESA's led mission (European Space Agency) SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite, ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) sensor on board the meteorological operational (Metop) platforms Metop-A and Metop-B, and the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) blended long-term SM time series. More specifically, in this study we compared SMAPL3 V4, SMOSL3 V300, SMOSL2 V650, ASCAT H111, and CCI V04.2 and the new SMOS-IC (V105) SM product. This evaluation was achieved using four statistical scores: Pearson correlation (considering both original observations and anomalies), RMSE, unbiased RMSE, and Bias between remotely-sensed SM retrievals and ground-based measurements from > 1000 stations from 17 monitoring networks, spread over the globe, disseminated through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The analysis reveals that the performance of the remotely-sensed SM retrievals generally varies depending on ecoregions, land cover types, climate conditions, and between the monitoring networks. It also reveals that temporal sampling of the data, the frequency of data in time and the spatial coverage, affect the performance metrics. Overall, the performance of SMAP and SMOS-IC products compared slightly better with respect to the ISMN in situ observations than the other remotely-sensed products.

TI  - Analysis of vegetation dynamics, drought in relation with climate over South Asia from 1990 to 2011
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is the most complex climate-related disaster issue in South Asia, because of the various land-cover changes, vegetation dynamics, and climates. The aims of the current research work were to analyze the performance of AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and spatiotemporal differences in vegetation dynamics on a seasonal basis by correlating the results with NASA's MERRA precipitation and air temperature for monitoring vegetation dynamics and drought over South Asia. Our approach is based on the use of AVHRR NDVI data and NASA's MERRA rainfall and air temperature data (1990-2011). Due to the low vegetation and dryness, the NDVI is more helpful in describing the drought condition in South Asia. There were rapid increases in NDVI, VHI, and VCI from April to October. Monthly NDVI, VHI, and VCI stabilize in September and improved once more in October and then show a declining trend in December. The monthly PCI, TCI, VHI, and VCI values showed that the South Asia goes through an extreme drought in 2000, which continues up to 2002, which lead the highest water stress. Spatial correlation maps among NDVI, precipitation, air temperature, VHI, and VCI on a seasonal basis. The correlation between NDVI and precipitation showed a significantly higher correlation value in JJA and SON seasons; the spatial correlation between NDVI and air temperature showed significant high values in DJF, JJA, and SON periods, while the correlation between VHI and TCI showed a significantly higher values in MAM and SON seasons, which indicated a good sign for dryness monitoring, mainly for farming regions during these seasons in South Asia. It was confirmed that these indexes are a comprehensive drought monitoring indicator and a step to monitoring the climate change in South Asia, which will play a relevant role ongoing studies on vegetation types, monitoring climate change, and drought over South Asia.

AB  - Human activities impact the ecological conditions of the environment. To understand those impacts and achieve sustainable management; studying, detecting and monitoring land use/land cover (LULC) are required. This study's goal is to monitor the change in LULC in Fayoum governorate, Egypt, using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Landsat satellite images of 1984, 2001, and 2016 were utilized to determine the changes in LULC in the study area (3077 km(2)). Ground truth points were collected in 2016 and employed to perform the accuracy assessment for the classified maps. Four LULC classes were determined based on MLC; agricultural land, urban area, barren land, and water class. Based on NDVI, two classes were categorized; vegetated and non-vegetated. The results showed that the MLC accurately identified the LULC classes with an overall accuracy of 96%. Thus, this technique is recommended for classifying the satellite images in such areas.

TI  - Ocean acidification impacts on coral reefs: From sciences to solutions
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Coral reefs distinctly illustrate the close relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services. They are rich marine ecosystems, hosting extensive biological diversity, and yet that diversity and the ecosystem services provided are among the most endangered because of global changes. By reducing and altering coral reef biodiversity, global changes are endangering the lives of hundreds of millions of people. It was therefore appropriate that the ongoing workshop series "Bridging the gap between Ocean Acidification and Economic Valuation" dedicated, during the International Year of Coral Reefs, its 4thedition in search of solutions inspired by the most recent data of the Natural, Economic and Social Sciences. This article summarizes the ecological and human importance of coral reefs, the reasons for their sensitivity to global changes, and presents the major conclusions of the workshop as well as policy options (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rethinking the Ethical Challenge in the Climate Deadlock: Anthropocentrism, Ideological Denial and Animal Liberation
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
M3  - Review
AB  - As critical research has revealed, climate change scepticism and inaction are not about science but ideas, and specifically the ideas that conform our worldview. Drawing on key theoretical approaches to climate change denial from the social sciences and humanities, this paper discusses the ideological dimension and, more especially, the anthropocentric denial underlying our failure to respond to climate change. We argue that the speciesist anthropocentrism inherent in the current dominant ethics is what prevents humanity from reacting to the main human-induced drivers of global warming. Encouraged to do so by current mainstream ethics, humans overpopulate the planet, grow at the expense of other species, and indulge in cruel, unhealthy and unsustainable practices. We counterpose this ethics against the egalitarian, non-speciesist approach of the animal ethics movement, positing that it represents the next radical reflexive movement and could be used to break the climate deadlock. Animal ethics allows links with inegalitarianism and privilege that may help address climate contrarianism and climate inaction much more effectively.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrocarbon is a powerful contributor to development. The present study makes an attempt to use remote sensing data coupled with geophysical and geological data that has been integrated into Arc GIS to delineate favorable zones for hydrocarbon potential in the Masila oil field. Lineaments have been extracted using satellite data and geological data by their surface spectral signatures, whereas the subsurface lineaments have been inferred using geophysical data. Digital image processing of satellite image using ERDAS IMAGINE-14 have been carried out, sequentially using various techniques (Sobal, Laplacian filters and band composite), lineament digitized as layers, layers were converted to raster (grid) format, classified, analyzed, integrated and visualized using Arc GIS. The resulting lineaments obtained from each data, suggests that most of the lineaments are trended in NW-SE which coincides and are in conformity with the existing trend of the study area. The output potential map was classified into five zones of hydrocarbon potentiality, namely very high, high, moderate, low and very low potential zones. The hydrocarbon evaluation results of the present study reveal that 6.9% of the total area falls under very high potential, 14.2% highly potential, 21.3% moderately potential, 25.7% low potential and 31.9% falls under very low potential zones. The zones were verified with oil fields and existing wells in the area which shows a positive correlation. Such studies are significant for hydrocarbon potential resource planning and management. Further, the methodology used for this study can be, replicated in another similar geological setup elsewhere for mapping hydrocarbon potential zones.

TI  - Canadian Wetland Inventory using Google Earth Engine: The First Map and Preliminary Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although wetlands provide valuable services to humans and the environment and cover a large portion of Canada, there is currently no Canada-wide wetland inventory based on the specifications defined by the Canadian Wetland Classification System (CWCS). The most practical approach for creating the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI) is to develop a remote sensing method feasible for large areas with the potential to be updated within certain time intervals to monitor dynamic wetland landscapes. Thus, this study aimed to create the first Canada-wide wetland inventory using Landsat-8 imagery and innovative image processing techniques available within Google Earth Engine (GEE). For this purpose, a large amount of field samples and approximately 30,000 Landsat-8 surface reflectance images were initially processed using several advanced algorithms within GEE. Then, the random forest (RF) algorithm was applied to classify the entire country. The final step was an original CWI map considering the five wetland classes defined by the CWCS (i.e., bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow water) and providing updated and comprehensive information regarding the location and spatial extent of wetlands in Canada. The map had reasonable accuracy in terms of both visual and statistical analyses considering the large area of country that was classified (9.985 million km(2)). The overall classification accuracy and the average producer and user accuracies for wetland classes exclusively were 71%, 66%, and 63%, respectively. Additionally, based on the final classification map, it was estimated that 36% of Canada is covered by wetlands.

TI  - Including Sentinel-1 radar data to improve the disaggregation of MODIS land surface temperature data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of land surface temperature (LST) for monitoring the consumption and water status of crops requires data at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Unfortunately, the current spaceborne thermal sensors provide data at either high temporal (e.g. MODIS: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) or high spatial (e.g. Landsat) resolution separately. Disaggregating low spatial resolution (LR) LST data using ancillary data available at high spatio-temporal resolution could compensate for the lack of high spatial resolution (HR) LST observations. Existing LST downscaling approaches generally rely on the fractional green vegetation cover (f(gv)) derived from HR reflectances but they do not take into account the soil water availability to explain the spatial variability in LST at HR. In this context, a new method is developed to disaggregate kilometric MODIS LST at 100 m resolution by including the Sentinel-1 (S-1) backscatter, which is indirectly linked to surface soil moisture, in addition to the Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 (L-7 & L-8) reflectances. The approach is tested over two different sites-an 8 km by 8 km irrigated crop area named "R3" and a 12 km by 12 km rainfed area named "Sidi Rahal" in central Morocco (Marrakech) on the seven dates when S-1, and L-7 or L-8 acquisitions coincide with a one-day precision during the 2015-2016 growing season. The downscaling methods are applied to the 1 km resolution MODIS-Terra LST data, and their performance is assessed by comparing the 100 m disaggregated LST to Landsat LST in three cases: no disaggregation, disaggregation using Landsat f(gv) only, disaggregation using both Landsat f(gv) and S-1 backscatter. When including f(gv), only in the disaggregation procedure, the mean root mean square error in LST decreases from 4.20 to 3.60 degrees C and the mean correlation coefficient (R) increases from 0.45 to 0.69 compared to the non-disaggregated case within R3. The new methodology including the S-1 backscatter as input to the disaggregation is found to be systematically more accurate on the available dates with a disaggregation mean error decreasing to 3.35 degrees C and a mean R increasing to 0.75.

TI  - Going to Any Lengths: Solving for Fault Size and Fractal Slip for the 2016, <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> 6.2 Central Tottori Earthquake, Japan, Using a Transdimensional Inversion Scheme
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many earthquake properties, including slip, show self-similar (fractal) features. We can incorporate self-similarity into Bayesian slip inversions via von Karman correlation, so that the regularization applied is representative of observed fault features. In von Karman regularization, each slip patch has a relationship to every other patch. This means that von Karman regularization only has meaning when applied to patches that actually slipped; if applied to nonslipping patches, spurious slip can be added to meet the von Karman correlation criteria. Additionally, the fault size, usually chosen in advance, also affects the von Karman correlation lengths meaning that the final slip solution may be biased by initial geometry choices. Here we present a method for solving for the size of the fault plane during the slip inversion process, as well as slip, rake, and a hyperparameter controlling slip variance. We use a transdimensional Bayesian inversion scheme constrained by geodetic surface displacements and regularized using von Karman correlation. We use circular harmonics to solve for the size of the slipping area, to allow for a complex shape that is connected and continuous across the fault. We apply this method to the 2016 M-w 6.2 Central Tottori earthquake, Japan, constrained by interferometric synthetic aperture radar InSAR (Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2) and Global Navigation Satellite System data (GNSS). We find an area of slip extending from approximately 2- to 10-km depth, with the slipping area elongated in the downdip direction. In contrast to some seismic studies, we find slip ruptured most of the seismogenic layer.

TI  - An assessment of semi-analytical models based on the absorption coefficient in retrieving the chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration from a reservoir
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in inland waters is crucial for water quality management, since Chl-a is a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and, thus, for ecological health of a water environment. Chl-a concentration can be retrieved through the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of a water system, which, in turn, can be remotely sensed obtained. Quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA), originally developed for ocean waters, can also retrieve IOPs for inland waters after re-parameterizations. This study is aimed at assessing the performance of sixteen schemes composed by QAA original and re-parameterized versions followed by models that use absorption coefficients as inputs for estimating Chl-a concentration in Ibitinga reservoir, located at Tiete River cascading system, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. It was verified that only QAA(v5) based schemes were able to obtain reasonable estimates for image data and that by four models tested presented similar and acceptable results for QAA(v5) outputs. The best model were applied to a Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) image. Light absorption in the reservoir showed to be dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and wide spatial and temporal variability of optical and water quality properties was observed.

TI  - Native SAG1 in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> lysates is superior to recombinant SAG1 for serodiagnosis of <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i> infections in chickens
T2  - PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii can infect almost all mammals and birds, including chickens. The aim of this study was to identify an appropriate immunogenic antigen for serodiagnosis of T. gondii infections in chickens. We examined serum samples from chickens that were intravenously or intraperitoneally infected with 10(6)-10(8) tachyzoites of T. gondii strains PLK, RH, CTG, ME49 or TgCatJpGil/TaJ using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), latex agglutination tests (LATs) and western blotting. Regardless of parasite strain or infection dose and route, the commercial LAT was positive for almost all sera collected 1 week post-infection. However, at 2 weeks post-infection, LATs were negative in the same birds. ELISAs using the Escherichia con-produced recombinant T. gondii antigens SAG1 and GRA7 showed strong signals at 1-2 weeks post infection, but thereafter diminished for the majority of serum samples. In contrast, western blotting against crude tachyzoite antigens showed a persistent band up to 4 weeks post-infection. Sera from these chickens reacted much more strongly with SAG1 from crude tachyzoite antigens than with recombinant SAG1. Even in experimentally-infected birds whose parasite burdens in tissue were undetectable, sera still reacted with native SAG1. We tested sera from free-range chickens on a small farm in Ghana, Africa, using western blotting and found that the serum of one bird reacted with a single band of approximately 27 kDa, the putative molecular weight of SAG1. Thus we conclude that native SAG1, but not E. coll-produced recombinant SAG1, is suitable for serodiagnosis of T. gondii infections in chickens.

TI  - Coastline change and offshore suspended sediment dynamics in a naturally developing delta (Parnaiba Delta, NE Brazil)
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous coastal erosion has been observed on the shoreline of major river deltas worldwide as a result of relative sea level rise and anthropogenic impacts. However, the relative contribution of sea-level rise on deltaic coastline retreat (i.e. separately from anthropogenic interference) has not been clearly defined, due to a lack of research on naturally developing deltas.The Parnaiba River Delta, located on the NE Brazilian coast is one of the few examples of a river delta that is still developing in almost natural conditions in contrast to many heavily impacted deltas worldwide. The wave and tide-dominated delta is subjected to delta switching processes with two active distributaries in the east and remnant tidal channels in the west. To address the decadal evolution of the delta in terms of suspended sediment transport and shoreline changes remote sensing techniques applied on orbital sensors were used. Satellite images from LANDSAT missions 2 to 8 were used to assess shoreline change between 1972 and 2016. Moreover, maps of suspended sediment concentration calculated from water leaving reflectance revealed the importance of Parnaiba River as major sediment supplier for the adjacent coast.Sufficient sediment supply from the Parnaiba River (PR) maintains shoreline stability and progradation of the delta in the region of the distributaries despite of a reservoir located 700 km upstream, which is supplied by only 25% of the drainage basin. Westward longshore drift of the sediment yielded by the Parnaiba River is an important transporting agent distributing river sediment along the coast. During ebb-phase, the PR discharge pushes the suspended sediment plume as far as 10 km offshore and the runoff forms a hydrodynamic barrier preventing alongshore transport of sediment from the east to the west part of the delta shoreline. During flood phase and high tide, the river sediment plume is pushed shoreward by tidal forces and westward by longshore currents. A high turbidity zone extends from the river-mouth plume of the main distributary to the western tidal channels. Turbid water enters the tidal channels during flood-phase and leaves during ebb-phase. Coastal accretion or stability characterizes the eastern active part of the delta while moderate erosion prevails in the western abandoned part damped by the westward directed longshore sediment transport from the PR mouth.

M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove serves as a protector for coastal abrasion, spawning ground, and natural habitats of species of terrestrial and marine biota. It is widely used for producing woods, tourist areas and conservation areas. The change of its functions above will therefore affect to altering its area cover that is impacted to an imbalance of aquatic ecosystems. This study aimed to analyze the changes of mangrove extent using the Landsat images with data acquisition (2005-2017) with interval 4 years. The data used in this study were Landsat 5 (2005, 2009) and Landsat 8 (2013 and 2017) at 3 villages (Berakit, Bintan Buyu and Teluk Sesah). The data were analyzed by using algorithms of Maximum Likelihood (MLH) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 4 kernels. The change of mangrove cover was then analyzed according to Total Suspended Solid (TSS). The results showed that mangroves, settlements and plantations had increase in the 3 villages. The land cover classification showed that SVM algorithm with kernel Radial Basis Function (RBF) gave high accuracy of 70.42% with coefficient kappa 0.61 while significance test showed no significant difference with SVM Sigmoid kernel type. Based on 2005-2017, changes in land use change have an impact on MPT concentration because it has a high correlation and has an effect on shoreline changes namely abrasion (Berakit) and accretion (Bintan Buyu and Teluk Sesah).

TI  - Solar radiation estimation at high latitudes: Assessment of the CMSAF databases, ASR and ERA5
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing demand for the estimation of solar energy potential at high latitude locations. This study compares four datasets; Cloud, Albedo, Radiation dataset Edition 2 (CLARA), Surface Solar Radiation dataset - Heliosat Edition 2 (SARAH), ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERAS) and Arctic System Reanalysis v2 (ASR) on high latitude locations. Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) from these datasets is compared with in-situ ground-measurements over multiple locations in Norway. The first two datasets are mainly based on satellite estimation of solar radiation, while the latter two are based on a combination of a weather-prediction model, satellite data, and other observations. The datasets are evaluated against quality-controlled in-situ measurements of solar radiation from pyranometers. Overall, CLARA, SARAH, and ERAS show moderate errors, while those of ASR are considerably larger. Monthly averages of global horizontal irradiance have mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 5.6 Wm(-2), 5.0 Win(-2), 6.8 Wm(-2), and 16.1 Wm(-2) for CLARA, SARAH, ERAS, and ASR, respectively. Seasonal error analysis of these datasets reveals that CLARA and SARAH have low errors in all seasons. The datasets are classified into clear-sky, intermediate-cloudiness, and overcast categories, by using two thresholds of cloudiness based on the ratio of radiation at ground to its corresponding clear-sky value (clear-sky index). The categories obtained from satellite and reanalysis data are then compared against estimates based on corresponding in-situ observations; this analysis shows that both CLARA and SARAH perform better than ERAS and ASR for these categories. SARAH and CLARA perform similarly in all types of conditions, but a gradual increase in errors for an increase of cloudiness is observed for ERAS and ASR. Yearly energy analysis shows that CLARA performs better than other datasets for locations above latitude 65 degrees N, and SARAH performs better in locations below 65 degrees N. A further analysis is performed to assess the cloud sensing abilities of ERAS. On a shorter time scale, there are errors due to inaccurate representation of clouds, however on longer time scales Le. months and years, these errors are considerably reduced. ERAS is observed to overestimate TCWC (the total cloud water content defined as the mass of water and ice in a cloud) in clear-sky and intermediate-cloudy categories, while in overcast category it is underestimated. Generally, an overestimation of solar radiation is observed in reanalysis and an underestimation is observed in satellite methods.

TI  - Assessing the oscillation of channel geometry and meander migration cardinality of Bhagirathi River, West Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lateral migration of the Bhagirathi River temporally creates unavoidable geomorphic hazards in West Bengal, India. The Bhagirathi River flows SW for 67.30 km between the confluence point of Ajay and Jalangi rivers in East Burdwan and Nadia districts of West Bengal. The course of Bhagirathi is notably migration prone and cultivates problematic changes along its course over time. In the study, we have looked into its migration tendency and unpredictability for past 238 years and then predicted the lateral shifting of river centerline using temporal satellite imageries Landsat-5 (TM) of 1987 (8, December), 1995 (28, January), 2005 (7, January) and LISS-IV satellite imagery (2017, 5 January);SOI Toposheet 1968-1969 (79A/2, 79A/3, 79A/6 and 79A/7) and Rennell's map of 1779. Other highlights are the quest of fluvial features, oxbow lakes, mid-channel bars, channel migration rate, meander geometry, channel sinuosity in different parts of river course and the parts that experience intensive bank erosion. The entire river course has been subdivided into three segments; viz. reaches A, B and C. Investigation displays that degree of sinuosity decreases from its anterior course (1968) to the existing course (2017). Reach-specific outputs display that reach B is highly sinuous (SI value 1.94 in 2017) and SI increases temporarily, whereas for reaches A and C it decreases with time. The rate of migration is higher in reach B than that in reaches C and A. The study displays a notably decreasing trend of migration in comparison with its previous lateral migration and shows that the migration nature over time is intensively inconsistent and unpredictable except very few portions of the river course. The nature of deposition within the river channel shows an unstable behavior during the entire period of the study. Meander geometry depicts a rapid change of river course innate to meander bends and shows a higher rate of migration by meander loop cut-off rather than lateral migration that reflects the inconsistency, erosion vulnerability and unpredictable nature of migration. The present work offers a valuable source to comprehend channel changes in Bhagirathi River and serve as an efficacious base for river-bank migration and erosion hazard planning and management.

TI  - Experimental evaluation of the lubrication performances of different nanofluids for minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) in milling Ti-6Al-4V
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to experimentally evaluate the lubrication performances of different nanofluids in milling titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. Six types of nanofluids, namely, Al2O3, SiO2, MoS2, CNTs, SiC, and graphite, were selected. Cottonseed oil was used as the base oil. The lubrication performance was investigated in terms of milling force, surface roughness, and morphology of workpiece surface. Experimental results demonstrated that the Al2O3 nanoparticle obtained the minimal milling force (F-x=277.5N, F-y=88.3N), followed by the SiO2 nanoparticle (F-x=283.6N, F-y=86.5N). The surface roughness obtained by the Al2O3 nanofluid was the minimum (R-a=0.594m), whereas it was the maximum by using minimum quantity lubrication (R-a=1.772m). The surface roughness of the six nanofluids was described by the following order: Al2O3<SiO2<MoS2<CNTs<graphite<SiC. The workpiece surface morphology was the best for Al2O3 and SiO2. The viscosity of the nanofluids was also analyzed. Spherical Al2O3 and SiO2 nanoparticles improved the lubrication effect of base oil mostly and were more suitable as environment-friendly additives for the base oil compared with the others.

TI  - The Image of a Bird in the Works of the Sami Writer Nadezhda Bolshakova
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the literature of the Kola (Eastern or Russian) Sami, one of the leading features of which is the myth-folk basis. The aim of the work is to determine the role of the bird image in the works of the Sami writer Nadezhda Bolshakova. Bolshakova's works have not been studied earlier in the framework of the stated topic, which determines the novelty and relevance of the material presented in the article. Material for the study was the collection of tales A Gift of the Seagull and two novels of the writer: Alkhalalalay and Letters in School Notebooks. The leading methods of this study are cultural-historical, hermeneutic and mythopoetics; their combination allows to reflect the relationship of folklore and literary elements in the work, primitive meanings and meanings in the Sami folklore and literature, to determine the author's individual interpretation of folklore material. The study analyzed the semantics of the image of the bird and its functioning in the fairy-tale and non-fairy-tale prose of the Sami writer; traced the transformation of mythological ideas in Bolshakova's works; considered the origins of her worldview, features of the artistic picture of the world and style. In addition, the role and importance of the image of the bird in the culture and mythology of the Sami, in the ritual and non-ritual folklore of the Northern people, some pagan representations of the ancient Sami were described. The analysis of the material showed that birds play an important role in Bolshakova's fairy-tale and non-fairy-tale prose. In fairy-tale prose, they help to recreate the picture of the world of the ancient Sami, perform a plot-forming function, being an instrument of the literary organization of the material, reveal the author's view of the world and the person in it. The basis of the folk image of the bird are ethno-cultural ideas about it, especially mythological ones. In Bolshakova's non-fairy-tale prose, the image of the bird helps to reveal the essence of the female psyche, reinforces the psychology that reconstructs the internal state of primarily female characters, emphasizes the tragic fate of female characters. At the same time, the image of the bird is used for the external characteristics of male characters. In the context of Bolshakova's works, the bird is not just an image, but a mythologem consciously taken from mythology. The idea of the soul in the form of a bird is common among all peoples of the globe; however, Bolshakova rethinks the mythology of the bird in accordance with her literary world and the Sami pagan idea of it. Bolshakova uses mythology consciously. The combination of folk and literary traditions is a feature of the national writer's style.

TI  - Predictive factors of severe perioperative morbidity of radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy in early-stage cervical cancer: A French prospective multicentric cohort of 248 patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the postoperative morbidity after radical hysterectomy (RH) for early-stage cervical cancer and to determine risk factors of severe perioperative morbidity.Methods: Data of two prospective trials on sentinel node biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I & II) were analysed. Patients having a radical hysterectomy were included between 2005 and 2012 from 25 French oncologic centers. Postoperative complications were prospectively recorded in a pre-specified analysis.Results: 248 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 44.5 years [25-85]. 88.7% of patients had a stage 1131 disease. There were 71.4% epidermoid carcinomas and 25% adenocarcinomas. 125 patients (50.4%) had a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal RH, 88 patients (35.5%) had a total laparoscopic RH, 26 patients (10.5%) had an open RH and 9 patients (3.6%) had a robotic-assisted RH. Sixteen patients (6.4%) had intraoperative complications. On a multivariate analysis, intraoperative complications were significantly associated with BMI >30 kg/m(2). The urinary, lymphovascular and neurologic complications rates were respectively 34.3%, 20.6% and 19.8%. 31 patients (12.5%) had severe postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo > 3 or CTCAE > 3). On multivariate analysis, severe postoperative complications were associated with parametrial involvement, preoperative brachytherapy and inclusion in low surgical skills center.Conclusions: This study based on prospective data showed that RH has low severe postoperative complications. The main complications were urinary infections and lower limb lymphedema. Patients with early-stage cervical cancer should be referred to expert center to ensure best surgical outcomes.

TI  - <sub>How Much Water Is Evaporated Across California? A Multiyear Assessment Using a Biophysical Model Forced With Satellite Sensing Data</sub>
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - California is expected to experience great spatial/temporal variations evaporation. These variations arise from strong north-south, east-west gradients in rainfall and vegetation, strong interannual variability in rainfall (+/- 30%) and strong seasonal variability in the supply and demand for moisture. We used the Breathing Earth System Simulator to evaluate the rates and sums of evaporation across California, over the 2001-2017 period. Breathing Earth System Simulator is a bottom-up, biophysical model that couples subroutines that calculate the surface energy balance, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance. The model is forced with high-resolution remote sensing data (1 km).The questions we address are as follows: How much water is evaporated across the natural and managed ecosystems of California? How much does evaporation vary during the booms and busts in annual rainfall? and Is evaporation increasing with time due to a warming climate? Mean annual evaporation, averaged over the 2001-2017 period, was relatively steady (393 +/- 21 mm/year) given the high interannual variation in precipitation (519 +/- 140 mm/year). No significant trend in evaporation at the statewide level was detected over this time period, despite a background of a warming climate. Irrigated agricultural crops and orchards, at 1-km scale, use less water than inferred estimates for individual fields. This leaves the potential for sharing water, a scarce resource, more equitably among competing stakeholders, for example, farms, fish, people, and ecosystems.Plain Language Summary Many stakeholders are contending for the limited water budget that is available to California, the world's fifth largest economy. Yet the amount of water used by natural and managed ecosystems across the state is not well known. We produced a new, process-oriented estimate of statewide water use by natural and managed ecosystems using a biophysical model forced with satellite remote sensing. Despite the booms and busts in rainfall over the 2001 to 2017 period, we find that statewide water use is conservative, compared to the annual variability in rainfall. Nor do we detect that statewide evaporation is increasing as the climate has warmed over this period. We find that crops use less water than conventional wisdom because a subset of fields across a 1-km pixel are fallow and are at peak leaf area and maximum evaporation potential for a relatively short period. Forests, on the other hand, use more water than conventional wisdom because they have a long growing season and absorb more energy than crops. Our intent is to provide water managers with new information on water use to better share water among the various stakeholders, for example, agricultural, cities, fish, ground water reservoirs, and water quality.

T2  - SEMIGROUP FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - In the paper we present various characterizations of chain-compact and chain-finite topological semilattices. A topological semilattice X is called chain-compact (resp. chain-finite) if each closed chain in X is compact (finite). In particular, we prove that a (Hausdorff) T1-topological semilattice X is chain-finite (chain-compact) if and only if for any closed subsemilattice Z< subset of>X and any continuous homomorphism h:ZY to a (Hausdorff) T1-topological semilattice Y the image h(Z) is closed in Y.

TI  - Tetrastischus howardi density and dispersal toward augmentation biological control of sugarcane borer
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of Tetrastischus howardi (Olliff) females to be released and their dispersion should be known, that way, used D. saccharalis pupae as sentinel host to measure parasitism as function of the release density of the parasitoid and its location in the field. Two sets of trials were run aiming first to define the number of parasitoids to be released and the dispersal of the parasitoid using plots in sugarcane commercial fields, respectively. Pieces of sugarcane stalk holding sentinel pupae were taken to the field and exposed to parasitism in both trials. The parasitoid was released at the rate of 20, 40, 80, and 160 females per sentinel pupa, except for the control plot without releasing. The parasitism rate was calculated based on the recovered pupae after 96h of exposure time from releasing the parasitoids. The models estimated the best parasitism rate by releasing 102 parasitoids per pupa. In the second trial, sentinel pupae were arranged in five subsequent circles corresponding 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20m around the central parasitoid releasing point at rate of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 18 pupae per circle. The mean estimated dispersal distance was 7.64m, with a covering area of 80.07m(2). Based on these findings, release of T. howardi is recommended in 125 points per hectare of sugarcane at rate of 102 females per pupa of the pest aiming to achieve homogeneous distribution and parasitism.

TI  - Mechanisms of sleep and circadian ontogeny through the lens of neurodevelopmental disorders
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sleep is a mysterious, developmentally regulated behavior fundamental for cognition in both adults and developing animals. A large number of studies offer a substantive body of evidence that demonstrates that the ontogeny of sleep architecture parallels brain development. Sleep deprivation impairs the consolidation of learned tasks into long-term memories and likely links sleep to the neural mechanisms underlying memory and its physiological roots in brain plasticity. Consistent with this notion is the alarming frequency of sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunction in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While the mechanisms underlying sleep dysfunction in most NDDs still remains poorly understood, here we will review several sentinel examples of monogenetic NDDs with both well-established connections to synaptic dysfunction and evidence of sleep or circadian dysfunction: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, Fragile X Syndrome, and Angelman Syndrome. We suggest that the coincident maturation of sleep with synaptic physiology is one of the core reasons for the commonplace disruption of sleep in NDDs and argue that disorders with well-defined molecular genetics can provide a unique lens for understanding and unraveling the molecular correlates that link the development of sleep and circadian rhythms to health and disease.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice Using Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series in Camargue, France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an effective method to map rice crops using the Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) time series over the Camargue region, Southern France. First, the temporal behavior of the SAR backscattering coefficient over 832 plots containing different crop types was analyzed. Through this analysis, the rice cultivation was identified using metrics derived from the Gaussian profile of the VV/VH time series (3 metrics), the variance of the VV/VH time series (one metric), and the slope of the linear regression of the VH time series (one metric). Using the derived metrics, rice plots were mapped through two different approaches: decision tree and Random Forest (RF). To validate the accuracy of each approach, the classified rice map was compared to the available national data. Similar high overall accuracy was obtained using both approaches. The overall accuracy obtained using a simple decision tree reached 96.3%, whereas an overall accuracy of 96.6% was obtained using the RF classifier. The approach, therefore, provides a simple yet precise and powerful tool to map paddy rice areas.

TI  - Identifying historic river ice breakup timing using MODIS and Google Earth Engine in support of operational flood monitoring in Northern Ontario
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice breakup and resulting flood risk is a nearly annual concern for communities along the five major rivers draining to the James and Hudson Bay Coasts in Ontario (Moose, Albany, Attawapiskat, Winisk and Severn Rivers). Ice breakup within this region has historically been monitored using flight reconnaissance supplemented by assessment of hydrometric data. More recently, remote sensed imagery have been used to monitor near real-time ice breakup and flood risk. However, the near real-time remotely sensed breakup information was found to have limited utility in the absence of a broader spatial and temporal understanding of breakup progression. The primary purpose of this study was to develop a method for generating a dataset of breakup dates. A secondary objective was to calculate statistics from this dataset that can be used to provide context to operational near real-time imagery analysis and improve understanding of ice processes in the study area. An automated method for detecting river ice breakup dates from 2000 to 2017 using MODIS imagery was developed. This method uses a threshold-based technique that aims to maximize river coverage and minimize effects of cloud obstruction. Image processing was completed in the high-performance Google Earth Engine application which enabled iterative classification and model calibration. The breakup date dataset was used to calculate statistics on breakup timing, duration, annual variability and breakup order. An assessment of patterns within these data is discussed, relationships between breakup timing, duration and highwater years is explored and the operational utility of these statistics is described. The classification compared well with Water Survey of Canada derived breakup dates with mean bias ranging from -2.0 days to 6.7 days and mean absolute error of 3.4 days to 6.9 days across the rivers. Latitude and distance upstream were found to be primary controls on breakup timing with drainage network configuration and reach morphology also having an influence. No relationships between highwater years and calculated breakup statistics were found. It is recommended that future studies use the dataset developed in this study in combination with hydrometric and remotely sensed data to improve prediction of highwater and understanding of breakup processes within these rivers.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Image Fusion in Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, we discuss spatiotemporal data fusion methods in remote sensing. These methods fuse temporally sparse fine-resolution images with temporally dense coarse-resolution images. This review reveals that existing spatiotemporal data fusion methods are mainly dedicated to blending optical images. There is a limited number of studies focusing on fusing microwave data, or on fusing microwave and optical images in order to address the problem of gaps in the optical data caused by the presence of clouds. Therefore, future efforts are required to develop spatiotemporal data fusion methods flexible enough to accomplish different data fusion tasks under different environmental conditions and using different sensors data as input. The review shows that additional investigations are required to account for temporal changes occurring during the observation period when predicting spectral reflectance values at a fine scale in space and time. More sophisticated machine learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) represent a promising solution for spatiotemporal fusion, especially due to their capability to fuse images with different spectral values.

TI  - Prevalence and Demographics of CKD in Canadian Primary Care Practices: A Cross-sectional Study
T2  - KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Surveillance systems enable optimal care delivery and appropriate resource allocation, yet Canada lacks a dedicated surveillance system for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Using data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), a national chronic disease surveillance system, this study describes the geographic, sociodemographic, and clinical variations in CKD prevalence in the Canadian primary care context.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 559,745 adults in primary care in 5 provinces across Canada from 2010 through 2015. Data were analyzed by geographic (urbanor rural residence), sociodemographic (age, sex, deprivation index), and clinical (medications prescribed, comorbid conditions) factors, using data from CPCSSN and the Canadian Deprivation Index. CKD stage 3 or higher was defined as 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) more than 90 days apart as of January 1, 2015.Results: Prevalence of CKD was 71.9 per 1000 individuals and varied by geography, with the highest prevalence in rural settings compared with urban settings (86.2 vs. 68.4 per 1000). CKD was highly prevalent among individuals with 3 or more other chronic diseases (281.7 per 1000). Period prevalence of CKD indicated a slight decline over the study duration, from 53.4 per 1000 in 2010 to 46.5 per 1000 in 2014.Conclusion: This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of CKD in primary care in Canada at a national level. Results may facilitate further research, prioritization of care, and quality improvement activities to identify gaps and improvement in CKD care.

TI  - Assessment of aerosol-cloud-radiation correlations in satellite observations, climate models and reanalysis
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Representing large-scale co-variability between variables related to aerosols, clouds and radiation is one of many aspects of agreement with observations desirable for a climate model. In this study such relations are investigated in terms of temporal correlations on monthly mean scale, to identify points of agreement and disagreement with observations. Ten regions with different meteorological characteristics and aerosol signatures are studied and correlation matrices for the selected regions offer an overview of model ability to represent present day climate variability. Global climate models with different levels of detail and sophistication in their representation of aerosols and clouds are compared with satellite observations and reanalysis assimilating meteorological fields as well as aerosol optical depth from observations. One example of how the correlation comparison can guide model evaluation and development is the often studied relation between cloud droplet number and water content. Reanalysis, with no parameterized aerosol-cloud coupling, shows weaker correlations than observations, indicating that microphysical couplings between cloud droplet number and water content are not negligible for the co-variations emerging on larger scale. These observed correlations are, however, not in agreement with those expected from dominance of the underlying microphysical aerosol-cloud couplings. For instance, negative correlations in subtropical stratocumulus regions show that suppression of precipitation and subsequent increase in water content due to aerosol is not a dominating process on this scale. Only in one of the studied models are cloud dynamics able to overcome the parameterized dependence of rain formation on droplet number concentration, and negative correlations in the stratocumulus regions are reproduced.

TI  - A Novel Fully Automated Mapping of the Flood Extent on SAR Images Using a Supervised Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When a populated area is inundated, the availability of a flood extent map becomes vital to assist the local authorities to plan rescue operations and evacuate the premises promptly. This paper proposes a novel automatic way to rapidly map the flood extent using a supervised classifier. The methodology described in this paper is fully automated since the training of the supervised classifier is made starting from water and land masks derived from the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and without any intervention from the human operator. Both a pre-event Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image and an optical Sentinel-2 image are needed to train the supervised classifier to identify the inundation on the flooded SAR image. The entire flood mapping process, which consists of preprocessing the images, the extraction of the training dataset, and finally the classification, was assessed on flood events which occurred in Tewkesbury (England) in 2007 and in Myanmar in 2015, and were captured by TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1, respectively. This algorithm was found to offer overall a good compromise between computation time and precision of the classification, making it suitable for emergency situations. In fact, the inundation maps produced for the previous two flood events were in agreement with the ground truths for over 90% of the pixels in the SAR images. Besides, the latter process took less than 5 min to finish the flood mapping from a SAR image of more than 41 million pixels for the dataset capturing the flood in Tewkesbury, and around 2 min and 40 s for an image of 19 million pixels of the flood in Myanmar.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of erosion and accretion (1975-2017) using DSAS - A study on Indian Sundarbans
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sundarbans, world's largest mangrove forest is now struggling to maintain its existence in the face of severe erosion. Any management process to protect this vulnerable ecosystem and to rescue millions of people living here, require place specific erosion measurement. This paper attempted to assess point specific erosion/accretion rate between 1975-2017 using LANDSAT Images. Permanent waterline was demarcated from the rectified images using the algorithm Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) > Normalize Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI). 178 inhabited Mouzas (smallest revenue unit) and 48 islands located along the major estuaries from Hooghly to Raimangal are taken for predicting shore/bank movement using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). 7723 transects along the main river and 855 along the coast are generated at an interval of 100m for calculating End Point Rate (EPR), Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and Land net Loss/Land Gain (LL/LG). From the EPR we found 62% and 85% transects are eroding along the estuarine channels and coast respectively. Multiplying mean EPR and transect interval (100m) between two transect, inter transects net land loss or gain were calculated. Among the channels intensive erosion were observed along the eastern bank of Muriganga in all successive years. Accretion increases landward from the coast in almost all channels. A sharp difference of erosion/accretion observed between reclaimed mouzas and islands covered by dense mangrove swamp. 54% mouza having embankments are retreating at an average rate of 6.14 metre/year, contrary to this only 35% mangrove islands are moving landward at a much slower rate (4.78 m/yr.) in comparison to habitat areas. Process of new land formation is also very steady in mangrove areas (4.78 hec./yr.) than habited areas (6.84 hec./yr.) which indicates channel stability and erosion resistance provided by Mangrove. Mangrove plantation can be a useful option for erosion management. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vegetation indices for the leaf area index estimation in clonal plantations of <i>Eucalyptus saligna</i> Smith
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the ground Leaf area index (LAI(g)) from clonal plantations of Eucalyptus saligna Smith and three different vegetation indices (VI): Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio Index (SRI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) was evaluated in order to select the best IV to estimate the IAF by remote sensing (LAI(RS)), and obtaining the spatial distribution of LAI in the stands. LAI(g) was measured using LAI-2000 and its behavior was examined at different ages. The vegetation indices were obtained from a Landsat 8/OLI through the arithmetic of the bands 4 and 5. The linear regression analysis was used to adjust the model LAIRS (LAIRSi= beta(0) + beta(1) . IVi + epsilon(i)), and the criteria for selecting the best equation were the statistics R2adj%, Syx% and residual analysis. The results showed that the best vegetation index to estimate IAF(SR) was SRI (LAI(RS) =-5.6159 + 0.9716. SRI), resulting R-adj(2)%=67.0 and S-yx =12.5%. The results of all adjusted models tended towards overestimation of LAI in values lower than two and underestimation in values above 3.5 (NDVI e SRI) and above three for SAVI. The equations for different ages produced no improvement in LAI(RS).

AB  - Objective To revise FIGO staging of carcinoma of the cervix uteri, allowing incorporation of imaging and/or pathological findings, and clinical assessment of tumor size and disease extent. Methods Review of literature and consensus view of the FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee and related societies and organizations. Results In stage I, revision of the definition of microinvasion and lesion size as follows. Stage IA: lateral extension measurement is removed; stage IB has three subgroups-stage IB1: invasive carcinomas >= 5 mm and IB2: tumors 2-4 cm; stage IB3: tumors >= 4 cm. Imaging or pathology findings may be used to assess retroperitoneal lymph nodes; if metastatic, the case is assigned stage IIIC; if only pelvic lymph nodes, the case is assigned stage IIIC1; if para-aortic nodes are involved, the case is assigned stage IIIC2. Notations 'r' and 'p' will indicate the method used to derive the stage-i.e., imaging or pathology, respectively-and should be recorded. Routine investigations and other methods (e.g., examination under anesthesia, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, etc.) are not mandatory and are to be recommended based on clinical findings and standard of care. Conclusion The revised cervical cancer staging is applicable to all resource levels. Data collection and publication will inform future revisions.

TI  - Land Covers Change Assessment After Small Dam's Construction Based on the Satellite Data
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The small dams were constructed in the study area for storing the rainwater. The present study was conducted to assess the impact of small dams on the LCC (Land Cover Change) in Nangarparkar, Pakistan based on the satellite data. The ENVI (Environment for Visualizing Images) software was used for classification of the four year's images and three classes viz. water, vegetation, and soil were taken for detection of LCC. The MLH (Maximum Likelihood) supervised method was used to classify the multispectral satellite images. The classified results of the classes were found different each year before and after dam construction. Average results of the two years before dam's construction revealed that water availability, vegetation cover and soil cover was 3.02%, 18.52%, and 32.30% respectively. However, after the dam construction, the water availability, vegetation cover and soil cover was 8.49%, 34.33%, and 17.15% respectively. Overall results revealed that water availability and vegetation cover were increased by 5.47 % and 15.18% respectively while soil cover decreased 15.15% after the construction of dams. Hence, based on the results, it is confirmed that the constructions of small dams have a direct and indirect positive impact on the land cover changes and it can play an important role in the resettlement of the communities of the arid areas.

TI  - Time to reconsider the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trials indicate that there are no overall or melanoma-specific survival advantages to performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) followed by immediate completion lymph node dissection compared with wide excision and observation for patients with positive sentinel nodes. These results make SLNB solely a staging procedure. The role of SLNB in the management of patients with melanoma deserves reappraisal. The potential marginal benefit of SLNB beyond the clinical and pathologic features of the melanoma has not been well studied. The use of sentinel lymph node status alone to accept and stratify patients into trials or to receive adjuvant treatment is not rational.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility modeling using Reduced Error Pruning Trees and different ensemble techniques: Hybrid machine learning approaches
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, a number of machine learning prediction methods are being applied in the field of landslide susceptibility modeling of the large area especially in the difficult hilly terrain. In the present study, hybrid machine learning approaches of Reduced Error Pruning Trees (REPT) and different ensemble techniques were used for the construction of four novel hybrid models namely Bagging based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (BREPT), MultiBoost based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (MBREPT), Rotation Forest-based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (RFREPT), Random Subspace-based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (RSREPT) for landslide susceptibility assessment and prediction. In total, ten topographical and geo-environmental landslide conditioning factors were considered for analyzing their spatial relationship with landslide occurrences. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Statistical Indexes, and Root Mean Square Error methods were used to validate performance of these models. Analysis of model results indicate that the BREPT is the best model for landslide susceptibility assessment in comparison to other models.

TI  - Developing a standard approach for assessing the hydromorphology of lakes in Europe
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for assessing the hydrology and morphology of lakes ('hydromorphology') are needed for reporting under national and international legislation, as well as to assist in lake management and restoration. Despite this, no consistent approaches have been developed around Europe for monitoring lake hydromorphology. To address this need, representatives from 12 countries met at a series of workshops to develop two protocols for monitoring, published under the auspices of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). The first standard (EN 16039) describes six categories for assessing lake hydromorphology: hydraulics, morphometry, bedforms/landforms and substrate, connectivity and continuity, and land cover. The second standard (EN 16870) sets out a scoring system for assessing the degree of modification of lake hydromorphology, which was designed, tested and refined using data from 127 lakes in seven European countries. The CEN standards focus on four lake zones-riparian, shore, littoral, and open water-but recognize the importance of considering lakes within their wider catchment context. The field techniques described are based largely on Lake Habitat Survey but also rely on existing databases, maps and remote-sensing data. These standards are aimed at scientists, conservation bodies and environmental regulators, and are relevant not only for monitoring lakes under the Water Framework Directive, but also for contributing to programmes of lake conservation. For example, in the UK, parts of the CEN standards have been incorporated within the methods used for monitoring and reporting on the condition of Special Areas of Conservation (under the Habitats Directive) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest under national legislation. It is hoped that this pan-European approach will improve the ability to compare data across many countries, and ultimately ensure that the results of monitoring are translated into measures for improving the hydromorphological condition of lakes and the biological communities they contain.

TI  - Enhancing the prognostic role of melanoma sentinel lymph nodes through microscopic tumour burden characterization: clinical usefulness in patients who do not undergo complete lymph node dissection
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the sentinel lymph node (SLN) tumour burden to predict the non-SLN positivity rate and the survival of melanoma patients to evaluate whether SLN microstaging could predict the prognosis, similar to what is currently performed by examining the lymph nodes excised by complete lymph node dissection. Of 1130 consecutive melanoma patients who underwent SLN biopsy, 226 were tumour-positive and 204 were included in this study. SLN metastases were classified on the basis of dimensional (Rotterdam) and topographic (Dewar) criteria either separately or combined. SLN metastases more than 1 mm in diameter had the highest non-SLN positivity rate (31%) compared with metastases 0.1-1 mm (10%) and less than 0.1 mm (4%). The non-SLN positivity rate was 45% for extensive metastases, 5% for subcapsular metastases and 23-29% for parenchymal, combined and multifocal classes, therefore suggesting a simplification of the parenchymal SLN metastases into only two classes: extensive and 'not extensive'. The dimension of the metastasis was correlated with a different non-SLN positivity rate only when the metastasis was in the parenchyma (20-36%) and not when it was in the subcapsular location (4-7%). Interestingly, the 5-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was 89% for patients with subcapsular less than 0.1 mm metastases and 45% for patients with nonsubcapsular more than 1 mm metastases (P=0.017). In the parenchyma, larger metastases (>1 mm) were related to a lower 5-year MSS (46%) than smaller (<1 mm) metastases (MSS 77%). SLN tumour burden characterization can be simplified and it can provide prognostic information on non-SLN positivity and survival, which is especially useful in patients who do not undergo complete lymph node dissection.

TI  - Beyond Site Detection: The Role of Satellite Remote Sensing in Analysing Archaeological Problems. A Case Study in Lithic Resource Procurement in the Atacama Desert, Northern Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing archaeology in recent years has emphasized the use of high-precision and high-accuracy tools to achieve the detailed documentation of archaeological elements (drones, LIDAR, etc.). Satellite remote sensing has also benefited from an increase in the spatial and spectral resolution of the sensors, which is enabling the discovery and documentation of new archaeological features and sites worldwide. While there can be no doubt that a great deal is being gained via such site detection approaches, there still remains the possibility of further exploring remote sensing methods to analyse archaeological problems. In this paper, this issue is discussed by focusing on one common archaeological topic: the mapping of environmental resources used in the past and, in particular, the procurement of lithic raw material by hunter-gatherer groups. This is illustrated by showing how the combined use of Landsat 8 images and ground-truthing via focused field studies has allowed the identification of a number of potential chert sources, the major lithic resource used by coastal groups between 11,500-1,500 cal. BP, in a vast area of the Atacama Desert covering 22,500 km(2). Besides discussing the case study, the strength of remote sensing techniques in addressing archaeological questions comprising large spatial scales is highlighted, stressing the key role they can play in the detection and study of specific environmental resources within challenging physical settings.

TI  - Evaluation of evapotranspiration variations as a function of relief and terrain exposure through multivariate statistical analysis
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the variation of the water consumption of a crop or vegetation can help to avoid damages caused by the lack of water, besides allowing a better knowledge of the environment around. Thus, variations in evapotranspiration in sugarcane, planted forest, and native forest were examined as a function of relief variations and terrain exposure in the northeast sector of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil (20 degrees 43'55.2 '' S-22 degrees 36'28.8 '' S, 46 degrees 37'48.0 '' W-48 degrees 50'16.8 '' W). These areas, covering a total of 2232 km(2), were studied using monthly Landsat 8 satellite data (Path 220 and Row 75) collected over 24 months from April 2013 to March 2015. Thus, this study aimed to use a hybrid Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB), adjusted to convert hourly ET to monthly and annually data, in obtaining ET for two years to areas with sugarcane, planted and native forests and evaluate how this evapotranspiration behaves spatially for some parameters, as altitude, slope, exposure faces of the terrain and biomes, using multivariate analysis. The results identified three evapotranspiration groups: highest evapotranspiration in the highest altitudes and topographic slope; medium evapotranspiration in medium altitudes and slopes; and low evapotranspiration at low altitudes and slopes. The highest rates of evaporation occurred in summer and fall, when temperatures were highest. (C) 2018 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Introduction > The systematic second opinion review in cancer centers after breast cancer detection is currently under development. The purposes were the evaluation of review's consequences, in particularly of the axillary staging and the evolution of the delays.Methods > A retrospective study was conducted on patients who consulted a clinician at Cancer Center of Lorraine in Nancy from January 1st, 2016 to December 31th, 2016. We analyzed from their medical charts: the outside exams, the initial therapeutic plan, the second opinion review, the additional exams, the multidisciplinary consultation conclusions, the first treatment, the multidisciplinary consultation after surgery.Results > In all, 251 patients were analyzed. Second opinion review discrepancies were seen in 72.5%. As a result, 43.4% of all patients had new breast-axillary biopsies. New malignancies lesions were identified in 19.9% of patients. Modifications in therapeutic plan were recommended in 19.9% of patients (including patients with and without new malignancies lesions diagnosed). Before o second opinion review, 9.8% of axillary ultrasound lead to a positive fine-needle biopsy. The additional exams identified 9.6% additional lesions. After a positive sentinel lymph node excision biopsy, the multidisciplinary consultation recommended a revision surgery of axillary lymph node dissection for 27% of patients with axillary ultrasound performed in our cancer center, and for 70% of patients without ultrasound (P = 0.023).Discussion > The systematic second opinion at cancer center allows the detection of new malignancies lesions and significant modifications in the therapeutic plan. A systematic evaluation of axillary ultrasound in cancer center could be considered.

TI  - Human-environmental drivers and impacts of the globally extreme 2017 Chilean fires
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - In January 2017, hundreds of fires in Mediterranean Chile burnt more than 5000km(2), an area nearly 14 times the 40-year mean. We contextualize these fires in terms of estimates of global fire intensity using MODIS satellite record, and provide an overview of the climatic factors and recent changes in land use that led to the active fire season and estimate the impact of fire emissions to human health. The primary fire activity in late January coincided with extreme fire weather conditions including all-time (1979-2017) daily records for the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and maximum temperature, producing some of the most energetically intense fire events on Earth in the last 15-years. Fire activity was further enabled by a warm moist growing season in 2016 that interrupted an intense drought that started in 2010. The land cover in this region had been extensively modified, with less than 20% of the original native vegetation remaining, and extensive plantations of highly flammable exotic Pinus and Eucalyptus species established since the 1970s. These plantations were disproportionally burnt (44% of the burned area) in 2017, and associated with the highest fire severities, as part of an increasing trend of fire extent in plantations over the past three decades. Smoke from the fires exposed over 9.5 million people to increased concentrations of particulate air pollution, causing an estimated 76 premature deaths and 209 additional admissions to hospital for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. This study highlights that Mediterranean biogeographic regions with expansive Pinus and Eucalyptus plantations and associated rural depopulation are vulnerable to intense wildfires with wide ranging social, economic, and environmental impacts, which are likely to become more frequent due to longer and more extreme wildfire seasons.

TI  - Combining MODIS and National Land Resource Products to Model Land Cover-Dependent Surface Albedo for Norway
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is an important physical attribute of the climate system and satellite retrievals are useful for understanding how it varies in time and space. Surface albedo is sensitive to land cover and structure, which can vary considerably within the area comprising the effective spatial resolution of the satellite-based retrieval. This is particularly true for MODIS products and for topographically complex regions, such as Norway, which makes it difficult to separate the environmental drivers (e.g., temperature and snow) from those related to land cover and vegetation structure. In the present study, we employ high resolution datasets of Norwegian land cover and structure to spectrally unmix MODIS surface albedo retrievals (MCD43A3 v6) to study how surface albedo varies with land cover and structure. Such insights are useful for constraining land cover-dependent albedo parameterizations in models employed for regional climate or hydrological research and for developing new empirical models. At the scale of individual land cover types, we found that the monthly surface albedo can be predicted at a high accuracy when given additional information about forest structure, snow cover, and near surface air temperature. Such predictions can provide useful empirical benchmarks for climate model predictions made at the land cover level, which is critical for instilling greater confidence in the albedo-related climate impacts of anthropogenic land use/land cover change (LULCC).

TI  - Enhanced recovery after liver surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISCERAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: In a majority of cases, enhanced recovery after surgery program (ERP) leads to a reduced rate of postoperative complications and shortened hospital stays following digestive surgery. The program's preoperative, perioperative and postoperative measures are implemented by the members of a motivated multidisciplinary team. Having shown its merits in digestive surgery, ERP would be particularly useful in liver surgery due to the elevated rates of morbidity and mortality this type of operation continues to entail. The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of ERP in liver surgery.Method: This is a systematic narrative review of the literature on the efficacy of ERP in liver surgery by laparotomy or laparoscopy.Results: Notwithstanding a number of studies (n = 30: 5 randomized trials, 14 cohort studies and 11 meta-analyses) less sizable than with regard to digestive surgery in general and colorectal surgery in particular, analysis of the literature confirms that in liver surgery, ERP is associated with an overall decrease in complications by 30 to 60%, but without improvement in the rates of hospital readmission and postoperative mortality. All of the studies report a reduction in average length of stay (ALOS) by 2.3 days and in functional recovery, a more objective indicator than ALOS, by 2.5 days. As of now, the economic impact of the ERP programs in liver surgery is neither positive nor negative, the above-mentioned savings being counterbalanced by heightened costs for material and equipment. Laparoscopic surgery is independently associated with better outcomes in terms of complications, functional recovery and ALOS; that is why it is important to incorporate this surgical approach in ERP as often as possible. Given a lack of robust evidence, Prehabilitation, which is a preoperative optimization process leading to improved functional reserve, has yet to be assigned a place in ERP programs pertaining to liver surgery. Possible roadblocks to application of an ERP program can be overcome through coordination by a team leader, a motivated multidisciplinary team, training courses and dedicated teaching sessions.Conclusion: ERP is a care improvement process that has a major play to play in organization of liver surgery, and its large-scale application is to be recommended.

TI  - Detection of Carbonates in Martian Weathering Profiles
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Noachian surfaces on Mars exhibit vertical assemblages of weathering horizons termed as weathering profiles; this indicates that surface water caused alteration of the rocks that required a different, warmer climate than today. Evidence of this early Martian climate with CO2 vapor as the main component causing greenhouse warming has been challenged by the lack of carbonate in these profiles. Here we report the analysis of Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars L-detector data leading to the detections of carbonates using a spectral signature exclusively attributed to them. The carbonates are collocated with hydroxylated minerals in weathering profiles over the Martian surface. The origin of CO2 for the formation of carbonates could be the atmosphere. The widespread distribution of weathering profiles with carbonates over the surface of the planet suggest global interactions between fluids containing carbonate/bicarbonate ions with the surface of Mars in the presence of atmospheric water until around 3.7 billion years ago.Plain Language Summary The oldest surface of Mars witnessed an impact of dense and humid atmosphere leading to the formation of hydrated minerals. The analysis of remote sensing data allows identifying carbonates mixed with the hydrated minerals. These associations of carbonates and hydrated minerals are widespread on the surface of the planet. This indicates a planetary-scale process of formation involving the presence of fluids containing inorganic carbon. This finding allows a better understanding of the environment of Mars during the period suspected to be the most likely to have host habitable environment on the planet.

TI  - A Sensitivity Analysis of the Standard Deviation of the Copolarized Phase Difference for Sea Oil Slick Observation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a time series of 33 TerraSAR-X copolarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected in Stripmap mode over the Gulf of Mexico in a wide range of incidence angles and sea-state condition is exploited, together with a theoretical framework based on the X-Bragg scattering model, to analyze the effects of noise, angle of incidence, (AOI) and wind speed on the standard deviation of the copolarized phase difference (sigma(phi c)) evaluated over sea surface with and without oil slicks. This large data set represents an unprecedented opportunity to analyze, for the first time, the influence of both SAR acquisition and surface parameters on the broadening of the copolarized phase difference probability density function (pdf), p(phi c)(phi(c)). Experimental results show that the X-Bragg scattering model, here adopted to predict the sea surface p(phi c)(phi(c)), gives an understanding of the increasing trend of sigma(phi c), with respect to AOI. It is shown that the noise significantly contributes to broaden p(phi c)(phi(c)) over both slick-free and slick-covered sea surface, while the effects of low-to-moderate wind regimes are negligible. In addition, sigma(phi c) exhibits a larger sensitivity to the scene variability, if compared to single-polarization intensity channels, over both slick-free and oil-covered sea surface. This sensitivity is more pronounced at lower AOIs due to the higher noise equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) that affects larger AOIs.

TI  - Remnants of the Snake Cult Among the Khakas (Late 19th to Mid 20th Century)
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGY ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF EURASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of folklore and ethnographic data, some of which are introduced in this article, the Khakass mytho-ritual complex relating to the snake is reconstructed. It is demonstrated that these beliefs were central to the traditional Khakass worldview, and the snake was endowed with elaborate symbolic meanings. It was a sacred animal, associated with ideas of life and death. It played a key role in mystical initiation practices, including those related to shamanism, and it was perceived as a patron spirit. Among the Khakass traditional beliefs was the idea that the elect could many snakes, which turned into beautiful girls. Such a union, short-lived as it was, brought wealth and luck. Also, the snake was associated with elements and landscape features, such as water and mountains, linked to the ideas of sacred center, fertility, and the ancestor cult, which were central in the Khakass worldview. This reptile was often believed to be a mountain spirit, a mystical patron, and donator of magical capacities. Thereby beliefs about snakes were part qf Khakass folk medicine and domestic magic.

TI  - Operational Flood Detection Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data over Large Areas
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsupervised flood detection in large areas using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data always faces the challenge of automatic thresholding, because the histograms of large-scale images are unimodal, which thus makes it difficult to determine the threshold. In this paper, an iteratively multi-scale chessboard segmentation-based tiles selection method is introduced. This method includes a robust search procedure for tiles which obey bimodal Gaussian distribution, and a non-parametric histogram-based thresholding algorithm for thresholds identifying water areas. Then, the thresholds are integrated into the region-growing algorithm to obtain a consistent flood map. In addition, a classification refinement technique using multiresolution segmentation is proposed to address the omission in a heterogeneous flood area caused by water surface roughening due to weather factors (e.g., wind or rain). Experiments on the flooded area of Jialing River on July 2018 using Sentinel-1 images show a high classification accuracy of 99.05% through the validation of Landsat-8 data, indicating the validity of the proposed method.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Urban Land Use Change in Typical Cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) has experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization. However, few studies have paid attention to urban land use dynamics, especially spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansion and land use change, in this region. This research aimed to conduct a comprehensive study of urban land use change in Xishuangbanna, Yangon, Vientiane, Phnom Penh, Bangkok, and Ho Chi Minh City, from 1990 to 2015. The analysis was based on land use maps derived from Landsat satellite products and employed urban expansion intensity, sector analysis, gradient-direction analysis, and landscape metrics. The results show Xishuangbanna, Yangon, Vientiane, Phnom Penh, Bangkok, and Ho Chi Minh City all experienced dramatic urban expansion and land use change since 1990, with urban expansion intensities of 15.01, 5.26, 9.15, 1.56, 11.88 and 11.91, respectively. The landscape metrics analysis indicated that urban areas were always aggregated and self-connected, while other land use types showed trends of disaggregation and fragmentation. In the process of urban expansion, paddy and natural land use types were commonly transformed to built up area. The results further reveal several common issues in urban land use, e.g., land fragmentation and loss of natural land use types. Finally, the discussion on the relationship between government policy and land use change for these cities shows land reform and attitude toward foreign direct investments played important roles in urban land use change in GMS.

TI  - The Lymphatic Drainage Pattern of Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Node Identified by Small Particle Radiotracer (<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Dextran 40) in Breast
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study was to detect the lymphatic drainage pattern of internal mammary area and verify the concept of internal mammary sentinel lymph node (IM-SLN) in breast.Materials and MethodsA small particle radiotracer (Tc-99m-Dextran 40) was prepared and tested. Tc-99m-Dextran 40 was injected into intraparenchyma at the sound breast by a modified radiotracer injection technique. Subsequently, dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), computed tomography (CT), and SPECT/CT combination images were performed to identify the radioactive lymph vessels and internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs). The direction of lymph drainage and the location of the IMLNs were identified in the SPECT/CT imaging.ResultsThe radiochemical purity of Tc-99m-Dextran 40 was > 95%. Tc-99m-Dextran 40 could drainage into first, second, and third lymph node and the radioactive lymph node could be detected by the. detector in the animal experiment. After Tc-99m-Dextran 40 injecting into intraparenchyma, 50.0% cases (15/30) were identified the drainage lymphatic vessels and radioactive IMLNs by SPECT. The drainage lymphatic vessel was found from injection point to the first IMLN (IM-SLN) after 10.5 +/- 0.35 minutes radiotracer injection, and then Tc-99m-Dextran 40 was accumulated into the IM-SLN. The combination imaging of SPECT/CT showed the second IMLN received the lymph drainage from the IM-SLN. The lymphatic drainage was step by step in the internal mammary area.ConclusionThe lymph was identified to drain from different regions of the breast to IM-SLN, and then outward from IM-SLN to other IMLN consecutively. It demonstrated the concept of the IM-SLN and provided more evidences for the application of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Modeling of the monthly distribution of soil erosion and sediment yield in the Tucutunemo Basin, Venezuela
T2  - INGENIERIA UC
M3  - Article
AB  - This research deals with the modeling of the monthly distribution of soil erosion and sediment yield in the Tucutunemo basin for the year 2015. The remote sensing technics on Landsat satellite images and ASTER global digital elevation model of a spatial resolution of 30 meters are adapted to use USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) and Langebein-Schumm models to estimate the erosion. The monthly precipitation is estimated using the statistical spatial prediction models based on the Ordinary Krigging using the records of 23 precipitation gauges. The J-Bessel model is the best adjustment to the precipitation of 30 minutes. It has been found that the soil erosion and yield sediment occur in the high and middle part of the basin. According the location, the precipitation of 30 minutes occurs in a magnitude from high moderately to high during the rainy season. The applied method contributes to detect the specific areas of sediment accumulation into the basin

TI  - Fire and burn severity assessment: Calibration of Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) with field data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of burn severity is highly important in order to describe and measure the effects of fire on vegetation, wildlife habitat and soils. The estimation of burn severity based on remote sensing is a powerful tool that, to be useful, needs to be related and validated with field data. The present paper explores the relationships between field accessible variables and Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) index by using linear mixed-effects models and boosted regression trees, based on data from 28 large fires and 668 field measurements across three countries in southern Europe. The RdNBR clearly reflected the mean height of charred stem and loss of ligneous, living shrub and tree cover during the fire. The paper confirms that remote sensing indices provide an acceptable assessment of fire induced impact on forest vegetation but also highlights there are important between-fire variations due to specific contexts that modify these relationships. These variations can be effectively assessed and should be taken into account in future predictive efforts.

TI  - Remote sensing data in lithium (Li) exploration: A new approach for the detection of Li-bearing pegmatites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has proved to be a powerful resource in geology capable of delineating target exploration areas for several deposit types. Only recently, these methodologies have been used for the detection of lithium (Li)-bearing pegmatites. This happened because of the growing importance and demand of Li for the construction of Li-ion batteries for electric cars. The objective of this study was to develop innovative and effective remote sensing methodologies capable of identifying Li-pegmatites through alteration mapping and through the direct identification of Li-bearing minerals. For that, cloud free Landsat-5, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and ASTER images with low vegetation coverage were used. The image processing methods included: RGB (red, green, blue) combinations, band ratios and selective principal component analysis (PCA). The study area of this work is the Fregeneda (Salamanca, Spain)-Almendra (Vila Nova de Foz Coa, Portugal) region, where different known types of Li-pegmatites have been mapped. This study proposes new RGB combinations, band ratios and subsets for selective PCA capable of differentiating the spectral signatures of the Li-bearing pegmatites from the spectral signatures of the host rocks. The potential and limitations of the methodologies proposed are discussed, but overall there is a great potential for the identification of Li-bearing pegmatites using remote sensing. The results obtained could be improved using sensors with a better spatial and spectral resolution.

TI  - Concentration Detection of the E. coli Bacteria in Drinking Water Treatment Plants through an E-Nose and a Volatiles Extraction System (VES)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality control remains an important topic of public health since some diseases, such as diarrhea, hepatitis, and cholera, are caused by its consumption. The microbiological quality of drinking water relies mainly on monitoring of Escherichia coli, a bacteria indicator which serves as an early sentinel of potential health hazards for the population. In this study, an electronic nose coupled to a volatile extraction system (was evaluated for the detection of the emitted compounds by E. coli in water samples where its capacity for the quantification of the bacteria was demonstrated). To achieve this purpose, the multisensory system was subjected to control samples for training. Later, it was tested with samples from drinking water treatment plants in two locations of Colombia. For the discrimination and classification of the water samples, the principal component analysis method was implemented obtaining a discrimination variance of 98.03% of the measurements to different concentrations. For the validation of the methodology, the membrane filtration technique was used. In addition, two classification methods were applied to the dataset where a success rate of 90% of classification was obtained using the discriminant function analysis and having a probabilistic neural network coupled to the cross-validation technique (leave-one-out) where a classification rate of 80% was obtained. The application of this methodology achieved an excellent classification of the samples, discriminating the free samples of E. coli from those that contained the bacteria. In the same way, it was observed that the system could correctly estimate the concentration of this bacteria in the samples. The proposed method in this study has a high potential to be applied in the determination of E. coli in drinking water since, in addition for estimating concentration ranges and having the necessary sensitivity, it significantly reduces the time of analysis compared to traditional methods.

TI  - Mesoclimate regulation induced by landscape restoration and water harvesting in agroecosystems of the horn of Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - When changes are made in a landscape, these changes may impact on the local climate. In arid and semi-arid agroecosystems, measures such as Landscape Restoration and Water Harvesting (LRWH) are implemented in order to revert land degradation and increase agricultural yields, by means of reducing runoff losses and increasing soil moisture. The present work analyses to what extent storing soil moisture, with adequate land and water management practices, can reduce temperatures in the hot months after the rainy season in a semi-arid climate. Since it is reported that Soil Moisture (SM) deficit can enhance heatwaves in diverse regions of the world because of Soil Moisture-Temperature Coupling (SMTC), it is hypothesized that increasing soil water availability, during the dry and hot periods, can mitigate hot temperatures. The analysis was carried for Enabered catchment, in Tigray Region, Ethiopia, where the rainy season runs from June to September. Here, large scale LRWH implementation ended in 2008. Using remote sensing data, the present study evaluates (1) to what extent LRWH implementation can enhance SM conservation at agroecosystem scale; (2) to what extent LRWH implementation can mitigate temperatures in the dry season at agroecosystem scale; and (3) the evidence of SMTC effects. Results show an increased capacity of the catchment to maintain SM accumulated in the rainy season and consequent reduced temperatures. Increase of SM was especially significant for September (P < 0.01), while temperature decrease was evident in October (P < 0.01) and November (P < 0.05), with decreases of Land Surface Temperatures (LST) up to 1.74 degrees C A simple, parsimonious linear regression model demonstrates that SMTC is evident at catchment scale and that the implementation of LRWH measures provides a climate regulation effect in the watershed. The present work can reinforce the call for an increased adoption of water harvesting, land restoration and green water management, in order to increase the resilience of agricultural ecosystem and food security in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Can Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) Be a Predictive Factor for Lymph Nodes Status in Both Early Stage and Locally Advanced Breast Cancer?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of axillary lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor in the outcome of breast cancer tumors. New trials changed the attitude towards axillary clearance. In the era of development of new immune therapies for breast cancer, it is important to identify a biomarker that can predict lymph node status. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a valuable indicator of the immune microenvironment that plays the central role in new anticancer drugs. Although the correlation between TILs and response to chemotherapy was established by previous studies, our retrospective study investigated the correlation between TILs and lymph node status. We analyzed data on 172 patients. According to stage, patients were divided in two groups: patients who underwent primary surgical treatment (breast-conserving or mastectomy and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy +/- axillary clearance in conformity with lymph node status) and patients who received chemotherapy prior to surgical treatment (breast-conserving or mastectomy + axillary clearance). We showed a good inverse correlation between TILs and lymph nodes status for both early stage and locally advanced breast cancers. Moreover, TILs are a predictor for positive lymph nodes in the axilla in patients undergoing axillary clearance after SLN biopsy, with no statistical difference between the intrinsic or histological subtype of breast cancers. We also obtained a significant correlation between TILs and response to chemotherapy with no significative difference according to histological subtype. Although further data have still to be gathered before meeting the criteria for clinical utility, this study demonstrates that TILs are one of the most accredited forthcoming biomarkers for breast cancer (BC) patients.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of the Precipitable Water Vapor over Peru through MODIS and ERA-Interim Time Series
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a meteorological variable that influences the main processes that occur in the atmosphere. It is not a homogeneous variable, but varies both temporally and spatially according to local conditions. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal variability of the PWV in Peru using MODIS satellite data (MOD05/MYD05 products) during the period 2000 to 2017. MODIS-derived PWV values were complemented with ERA-Interim reanalysis data to take the study period back to 1979. PWV values extracted from MODIS and ERA-Interim were compared against in situ values obtained from five radiosonde stations between the years of 2003 and 2016 (non-continuous data). The study was performed over nine sub-regions of the Peruvian territory: coastal, highland, and jungle sub-regions, which in turn were classified into northern, central and southern regions. The analysis of spatial variability was performed using monthly semivariograms and influencing parameters such as sill and range, whereas the temporal variation was examined by time series of monthly, seasonal, and multi-annual means. The Mann-Kendall test was also applied to determine the presence of trends. The spatial analysis evidenced the heterogeneity of the PWV over the study region, and in most of the sub-regions there was directional variability during the austral summer and austral winter, with the Northeast (NE) and East (E) directions having the greatest spatial variability. The omnidirectional analysis of the sill and range showed that there was a high spatial variability of PWV mainly over the northern and southern jungle, even exceeding the limit area of these sub-regions. The temporal analysis shows that this variability occurs more in the north and center of the jungle and in the north coast, where the content of PWV is higher in relation to other regions, while the central and southern highlands have the lowest values. In addition, the trend test determines that there is a slight increase in PWV for the coast and jungle regions of Peru. Validation analysis using the radiosonde data showed a similar performance of both datasets (MODIS and ERA), with better results for the case of the MODIS product (RMSE < 0.6 cm and R-2 = 0.71).

TI  - Cyanobacterial blooms in the central basin of Lake Erie: Potentials for cyanotoxins and environmental drivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Erie western basin (WB) cyanobacterial blooms are a yearly summer occurrence; however, blooms have also been reported in the offshore waters of the central basin (CB), and very little is known about what drives these blooms or their potential for cyanobacterial toxins. Cyanobacteria Index was quantified using MODIS and MERIS data for the CB between 2003 and 2017, and water samples were collected between 2013 and 2017. The goals were to 1) quantify cyanobacteria, 2) determine environmental drivers of CB blooms, and 3) determine the potential for cyanobacterial toxins in the CB. Dolichospermum (Anabaena) occurred in the CB during July before the onset of the WB bloom, and then in August and September, the cyanobacteria community shifted towards Microcystis. The largest Dolichospermum blooms (2003, 2012, 2013, and 2015) were associated with reduced water clarity (Secchi disk depth < 4 m), whereas large CB Microcystis blooms (2011 and 2015) were associated with large WB blooms. Dolichospermum blooms occurred in high nitrate concentrations (>20 mu mol/L) and high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios (>100), which indicate nutrient concentrations or ratios did not select for Dolichospermum. Additionally, the sxtA gene, but not mcyE or microcystins, were detected in the CB during July 2016 and 2017. The mcyE gene and microcystins were detected in the CB during August 2016 and 2017. The results indicate the CB's potential for cyanotoxins shifts from saxitoxins to microcystins throughout the summer. Continued monitoring of cyanobacteria and multiple cyanobacterial toxins is recommended to ensure safe drinking water for CB coastal communities.

TI  - Subungual Melanoma of the Hand
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe diagnosis of subungual melanoma (SUM) can be challenging and SUMs generally have a worse prognosis than melanomas arising elsewhere. Due to their rarity, the evidence to guide management is limited. This study sought to identify clinicopathological features predictive of outcome and to provide guidelines for management.MethodsFrom a large, single-institution database, 103 patients with in situ (n=9) or invasive (n=94) SUMs of the hand treated between 1953 and 2014 were identified and their features analyzed.ResultsThe most common site of handSUMs was the thumb (53%). Median tumor thickness was 3.1mm, and SUMs were commonly of the acral subtype (57%), ulcerated (58%), amelanotic (32%), and had mitoses (73%). Twenty-one patients reported prior trauma to the tumor site. Twenty-two patients were stage III at diagnosis; 7 underwent therapeutic lymph node dissection and 22 underwent elective lymph node dissection (5 positive), while 36 had sentinel node biopsy (SNB), 28% of which were positive. Forty percent of SNB-positive patients had involved non-sentinel nodes (SNs) in their completion lymph node dissection. Five-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 70% and 52%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, regional node metastasis and right-hand tumor location were significant predictors of shorter DFS and MSS, whereas mitoses negatively impacted DFS only and increasing Breslow thickness impacted MSS only.ConclusionsThis study confirms that SUMs on the hand usually present at an advanced stage. Distal amputation appearssafe for invasive SUMs, and SNB should be considered as these patients have a high risk of both SN and non-SN metastasis.

TI  - Computerized Seed and Range Selection Method for Flood Extent Extraction in SAR Image Using Iterative Region Growing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel method to capture the flood-affected area in SAR image. It initially locates a pixel in HH-polarized SAR image whose intensity value is equal or close to minimum intensity value in that image. This is adapted since SAR reflectance values of flooded area are less than the other regions due to the water surface smoothness that makes the flood surface a specular reflector with nearly no return to the sensor. Thereafter, the identified seed point is confirmed locally based on two parameters corresponding to intensities and percentage of occurrence of intensities around the seed. Densely populated range around the seed point is computed in the second step. Subsequently in the third step, from the seed point, regions are grown till the intensity value of that point is within the range. These three steps are continued till all flooded regions are captured in SAR image. The algorithm works with minimum human interaction. This method is validated by applying on RADARSAT-2 data and is found that the classification accuracy is 95%, in comparison with mean shift and LPQ.

TI  - Assessment of model-simulated upper ocean biogeochemical dynamics of the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of a physical-biogeochemical model configured using Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) in simulating upper ocean biogeochemical dynamics of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) is evaluated with available remote sensing and in situ observations. The accuracy of model-simulated and satellite (MODIS-Aqua) retrieved surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) are individually assessed against in situ data, measured in surface waters of the western BoB, from March 2008 to November 2015. Model-simulated chl-a showed better correlation (R-2 = 0.80) with the in situ observations as compared to that retrieved from satellite (R-2 = 0.72). Although, the model underestimates chl-a (slope = 0.84), significant correlation proves its capability to reproduce the in situ trend. The root mean square error (RMSE) between model simulated and satellite retrieved chl-a against measured chl-a are 0.33 and 0.36, respectively. Additionally, a comparison with remote sensing time series data indicates that the model realistically simulates the seasonal variability of chl-a. Further, temperature, salinity, nitrate, chl-a and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles obtained from two biogeochemical Argo floats deployed in the central BoB, are also compared with model-simulated profiles. In comparison, the model adequately simulates the observed subsurface variability of chl-a as well as persistent Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) at depths between 20 and 90 m having concentration 0.75-1.0 mg-m(-3) . The undulations in the subsurface spatial variability of chl-a are appreciably well captured by the model and comparable with the observations albeit the magnitude is overestimated in the model. It is noted that the temporal variability of the DCM and oxycline in the BoB is significantly influenced by the vertical movement of the thermocline.

TI  - Ship Detection Based on YOLOv2 for SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been used as a promising data source for monitoring maritime activities, and its application for oil and ship detection has been the focus of many previous research studies. Many object detection methods ranging from traditional to deep learning approaches have been proposed. However, majority of them are computationally intensive and have accuracy problems. The huge volume of the remote sensing data also brings a challenge for real time object detection. To mitigate this problem a high performance computing (HPC) method has been proposed to accelerate SAR imagery analysis, utilizing the GPU based computing methods. In this paper, we propose an enhanced GPU based deep learning method to detect ship from the SAR images. The You Only Look Once version 2 (YOLOv2) deep learning framework is proposed to model the architecture and training the model. YOLOv2 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system, which outperforms Faster Region-Based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) methods. Additionally, in order to reduce computational time with relatively competitive detection accuracy, we develop a new architecture with less number of layers called YOLOv2-reduced. In the experiment, we use two types of datasets: A SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) dataset and a Diversified SAR Ship Detection Dataset (DSSDD). These two datasets were used for training and testing purposes. YOLOv2 test results showed an increase in accuracy of ship detection as well as a noticeable reduction in computational time compared to Faster R-CNN. From the experimental results, the proposed YOLOv2 architecture achieves an accuracy of 90.05% and 89.13% on the SSDD and DSSDD datasets respectively. The proposed YOLOv2-reduced architecture has a similarly competent detection performance as YOLOv2, but with less computational time on a NVIDIA TITAN X GPU. The experimental results shows that the deep learning can make a big leap forward in improving the performance of SAR image ship detection.

TI  - Intra-Urban Change Analysis Using Sentinel-1 and Nighttime Light Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is devoted to detect and classify intra-urban changes by jointly exploiting Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR data and nighttime light data. By extracting urban extents and urban density maps from SAR data, changes in nighttime lights can be used to detect changes related to the level of activity in a specific portion of each urban areas. At the same time, changes in radar backscattering are prone to reveal changes in the two-and three-dimensional structures of the built-up. The combination of these multimodal datasets has already proved to be useful to discriminate urban change patterns at the city level. In this paper, instead, SAR datasets from S-1 are exploited, allowing the recognition of different intra-urban changes. Experimental results focus on fast growing (mega) cities in East Asia, allowing us to understand in a more detailed way how they are changing and evolving in all three dimensions. Examples for Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou (China), Saigon (Vietnam), and Vientiane (Laos) are discussed to prove this statement.

TI  - Backpacker Personal Development, Generalized Self-Efficacy, and Self-Esteem: Testing a Structural Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Guided by self-determination theory (SDT), this study aims to advance the theoretical understanding of backpacker personal development (BPD) by examining its relationships with two important social-psychological constructs, that is, generalized self-efficacy (GSE) and self-esteem (SE). Using two samples from different cultural groups (Chinese backpackers, n=230; Western backpackers, n=242) and applying the partial least squares structural equation modeling, the study found that among Chinese backpackers, skill development positively influenced GSE while worldview changes negatively influenced SE. For Western backpackers, capability development and emotional adjustment positively influenced their GSE. The positive effects of GSE on SE were confirmed in both samples. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI  - Global observed and modelled impacts of irrigation on surface temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural irrigation has significant potential for altering local climate by reducing soil albedo, increasing evapotranspiration, and enabling greater leaf area. Numerous studies using regional or global climate models have demonstrated the cooling effects of irrigation on mean and extreme temperature, especially over regions where irrigation is extensive. However, these model-based results have not been well validated due to the limitations of observational data sets. In this study, multiple satellite-based products, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data sets, are used to isolate and quantify the local impacts of irrigation on surface climate over irrigated regions, which are derived from the Global Map of Irrigation Areas (GMIA). The relationships among soil moisture, albedo, evapotranspiration, and surface temperature are explored. Strong evaporative cooling by irrigation lowers daytime surface temperature over arid and semi-arid regions, such as California's Central Valley, the Great Plains, central Asia, and northwestern India. However, the cooling effects are less evident in areas of eastern China and the Lower Mississippi River Basin despite extensive irrigation over these regions. Results are also compared with irrigation experiments using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to assess the model's ability to represent land-atmosphere interactions in regards to irrigation. CESM greatly underestimates the surface temperature response to irrigation. The comparison between the offline and coupled simulations suggests that the irrigation-induced cooling can be regulated by the interactions between land surface and atmosphere, and amplified signals are found over the hot spot regions. Meanwhile, model resolution can also influence the magnitude of the local cooling by irrigation.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Geostatistical, Machine Learning, and Hybrid Approaches for Mapping Topsoil Organic Carbon Content
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate digital soil mapping (DSM) of soil organic carbon (SOC) is still a challenging subject because of its spatial variability and dependency. This study is aimed at comparing six typical methods in three types of DSM techniques for SOC mapping in an area surrounding Changchun in Northeast China. The methods include ordinary kriging (OK) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) from geostatistics, support vector machines for regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) from machine learning, and geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK) and artificial neural networks kriging (ANNK) from hybrid approaches. The hybrid approaches, in particular, integrated the GWR from geostatistics and ANN from machine learning with the estimation of residuals by ordinary kriging, respectively. Environmental variables, including soil properties, climatic, topographic, and remote sensing data, were used for modeling. The mapping results of SOC content from different models were validated by independent testing data based on values of the mean error, root mean squared error and coefficient of determination. The prediction maps depicted spatial variation and patterns of SOC content of the study area. The results showed the accuracy ranking of the compared methods in decreasing order was ANNK, SVR, ANN, GWRK, OK, and GWR. Two-step hybrid approaches performed better than the corresponding individual models, and non-linear models performed better than the linear models. When considering the uncertainty and efficiency, ML and two-step approach are more suitable than geostatistics in regional landscapes with the high heterogeneity. The study concludes that ANNK is a promising approach for mapping SOC content at a local scale.

TI  - Histologic evidence that mast cells contribute to local tissue inflammation in peripheral spondyloarthritis by regulating interleukin-17A content
T2  - RHEUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Synovial mast cells contain IL-17A, a key driver of tissue inflammation in SpA. A recent in vitro study showed that tissue-derived mast cells can capture and release exogenous IL-17A. The present study aimed to investigate if this mechanism could contribute to tissue inflammation in SpA.Methods Potential activation of mast cells by IL-17A was assessed by gene expression analysis of the Laboratory of Allergic Diseases 2 (LAD2) mast cell line. The presence of IL-17A-positive mast cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry in synovial tissue obtained before and after secukinumab treatment, as well as in skin and gut tissues from SpA-related conditions.Results IL-17A did not induce a pro-inflammatory response in human LAD2 mast cells according to the canonical IL-17A signalling pathway. In SpA synovial tissue, the percentage of IL-17A-positive mast cells increased upon treatment with secukinumab. IL-17A-positive mast cells were also readily detectable in non-inflamed barrier tissues such as skin and gut. In non-inflamed dermis and gut submucosa, IL-17A-positive mast cells are the most prevalent IL-17A-positive cells in situ. Compared with non-inflamed tissues, both total mast cells and IL-17A-positive mast cells were increased in psoriatic skin dermis and in submucosa from inflammatory bowel disease gut. In contrast, the proportion of IL-17A-positive mast cells was strikingly lower in the inflamed compared with non-inflamed gut lamina propria.Conclusion IL-17A-positive mast cells are present across SpA target tissues and correlate inversely with inflammation, indicating that their IL-17A content can be regulated. Tissue-resident mast cells may act as IL-17A-loaded sentinel cells, which release IL-17A to amplify tissue inflammation.

TI  - Replacing the Red Band with the Red-SWIR Band (0.74<sub>red</sub>+0.26<sub>swir</sub>) Can Reduce the Sensitivity of Vegetation Indices to Soil Background
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most vegetation indices (VIs) of remote sensing were designed based on the concept of soil-line, which represents a linear correlation between bare soil reflectance at the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Unfortunately, the soil-line can only suppress brightness variation, not color differences of bare soil. Consequently, soil variation has a considerable impact on vegetation indices, although significant efforts have been devoted to this issue. In this study, a new soil-line is established in a new feature space of the NIR band and a virtual band that combines the red and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands (0.74(red)+0.26(swir)). Then, plus versions of vegetation indices (VI+), i.e., normalized difference vegetation index plus (NDVI+), enhanced vegetation index plus (EVI+), soil-adjusted vegetation index plus (SAVI(+)), and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index plus (MSAVI(+)), are proposed based on the new soil-line, which replaces the red band with the red-SWIR band in the vegetation indices. Soil spectral data from several spectral libraries confirm that bare soil has much less variation for VI+ than the original VI. Simulation experiments show that VI+ correlates better with fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and leaf area index (LAI) than original VI. Ground measured LAI data collected from BigFoot, VALERI, and other previous references also confirm that VI+ derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data correlates better with ground measured LAI than original VI. These data analyses suggest that replacing the red band with the red-SWIR band can reduce the sensitivity of VIs to soil background. We recommend employing the proposed NDVI+, EVI+, SAVI(+), and MSAVI(+) in applications of large area, sparse vegetation, or when soil color variation cannot be neglected, although sensitivity to soil moisture and clay content might cause slight side effects for the proposed VI+s.

TI  - Impacts of distribution patterns of cloud optical depth on the calculation of radiative forcing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The gridding process applied to satellite-retrieved cloud properties results in the loss of certain information. In this study, we analyzed the error associated with using gridded cloud optical depth (tau) in calculating radiative forcing from the perspective of the distribution pattern of tau. Utilizing the simulated results from SBDART (Santa Babara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer), we calculated this error in ideal probability distribution functions (PDFs) of tau while keeping the average tau constant, and then used the tau retrieved from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) pixel-level observations to simulate real case studies. The results from both the ideal experiments and real case studies indicate that there is a large dependence of the error caused by gridding process on the PDF of tau. The greatest relative error occurs in the cases when tau fits a two-point or uniform distribution, reaching 10-20%, while this error is below 5% when tau follows a binomial distribution. From the analysis of MODIS pixel-level data from June 2016, we found that the PDFs of tau within one grid point (1 degrees x 1 degrees) could not be simply described by a normal distribution. Although using the logarithmic mean of r controls the error effectively, the error can still be up to 4%. Our study suggests that using gridded data (especially the arithmetic mean) to calculate radiative forcing may result in uncertainty to a certain extent, which depends strongly on the distribution pattern of cloud properties within the grid point. The PDF of cloud properties should be comprehensively considered in the gridding process in the future.

TI  - Extreme gradient boosting model to estimate PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations with missing-filled satellite data in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have attempted to predict ground PM2.5 concentrations using satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. However, over 70%-90% of aerosol retrievals are non-random missing, which limits and biases the estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been well resolved to date.The aim of this study was to develop an interpolation technique to handle the missing data retrieval problem and to estimate the daily PM2.5 for a high coverage dataset with 3-km resolution in China by fitting the complex temporal and spatial variations.We developed a two-step interpolation method (i.e., the mixed-effect model and inverse distance weighting technology) to replace the missing values in AOD. Next, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) technique that includes a non-linear exposure-lag-response model (NELRM) was proposed and validated to estimate the daily levels of PM2.5 across China during 2014-2015.After two steps of interpolation, the missing value rate of daily AOD data was reduced from 87.91% to 13.83%. The cross-validation (CV) R-square, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage prediction error (MAPE) of the interpolation were 0.76, 0.10 and 21.41%, respectively. The cross-validation for the prediction of daily PM2.5 resulted in R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 14.98, and MAPE = 23.72%.The results of this study indicate that the two-step interpolation method can largely resolve the non-random missing data problem and that the combined XGBoost methods have a good ability to estimate fine particulate matter concentrations.

TI  - Mapping Global Urban Areas From 2000 to 2012 Using Time-Series Nighttime Light Data and MODIS Products
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping urban dynamics at the global scale becomes a pressing task with the increasing pace of urbanization and its important environmental and ecological impacts. In this study, we proposed a new approach to mapping global urban areas from 2000 to 2012 by applying a region-growing support vector machine classifier and a bidirectional Markov random field model to time-series nighttime light data. In this approach, both spectrum and spatial-temporal contextual information are employed for an improved urban area mapping. Our results indicate that at the global level, the urban area increased from 625,000 to 1,039,000 km(2) during 2000-2012. Most urban areas are concentrated in the region between 30 degrees N and 60 degrees N latitudes. The latitudinal distribution of urban areas from this study is consistent with three land-cover products, including European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover dataset, Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring Global Land Cover, and 30-m Global Land Cover dataset. We found that for several major cities, such as Shanghai, urban areas from our study contain some nonurban land-cover types with intensive human activities. The validation using Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery indicates that the overall accuracies of the mapped urban areas for 2000, 2005, 2008, and 2010 are 86.0%, 88.6%, 89.8%, and 88.7%, respectively, and the Kappa coefficients are 0.72, 0.77, 0.79, and 0.78, respectively. This study also demonstrates that the integration of the spatial-temporal contextual information and the use of bidirectional Markov random field model are effective in improving the accuracy and temporal consistency of urban area mapping using time-series nighttime light data.

TI  - Simulation of Sentinel-2 Product Using Airborne Hyperspectral Image and Analysis of TOA and BOA Reflectance for Evaluation of Sen2cor Atmosphere Correction: Focused on Agricultural Land
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument(MSI) launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) offered high spatial resolution optical products, enhanced temporal revisit of five days, and 13 spectral bands in the visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared wavelengths similar to Landsat mission. Landsat satellite imagery has been applied to various previous studies, but Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery has not been widely used. Currently, for global coverage, Sentinel-2 products are systematically processed and distributed to Level-1C (L1C) products which contain the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Furthermore, ESA plans a systematic global production of Level-2A(L2A) product including the atmospheric corrected Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance considered the aerosol optical thickness and the water vapor content. Therefore, the Sentinel-2 L2A products are expected to enhance the reliability of image quality for overall coverage in the Sentinel-2 mission with enhanced spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. The purpose of this work is a quantitative comparison Sentinel-2 L2A products and fully simulated image to evaluate the applicability of the Sentinel-2 dataset in cultivated land growing various kinds of crops in Korea. Reference image of Sentinel-2 L2A data was simulated by airborne hyperspectral data acquired from AISA Fenix sensor. The simulation imagery was compared with the reflectance of L1C TOA and that of L2A BOA data. The result of quantitative comparison shows that, for the atmospherically corrected L2A reflectance, the decrease in RMSE and the increase in correlation coefficient were found at the visible band and vegetation indices to be significant.

TI  - Recent Deforestation Pattern Changes (2000-2017) in the Central Carpathians: A Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix and Fractal Analysis Approach
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explores the distribution of tree cover and deforested areas in the Central Carpathians in the central-east part of Romania, in the context of the anthropogenic forest disturbances and sustainable forest management. The study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in deforested areas due to human pressure in the Carpathian Mountains, a sensitive biodiverse European ecosystem. We used an analysis of satellite imagery with Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat-7 ETM+) from the University of Maryland (UMD) Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset. The workflow started with the determination of tree cover and deforested areas from 2000-2017, with an overall accuracy of 97%. For the monitoring of forest dynamics, a Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix analysis (Entropy) and fractal analysis (Fractal Fragmentation-Compaction Index and Tug-of-War Lacunarity) were utilized. The increased fragmentation of tree cover (annually 2000-2017) was demonstrated by the highest values of the Fractal Fragmentation-Compaction Index, a measure of the degree of disorder (Entropy) and heterogeneity (Lacunarity). The principal outcome of the research reveals the dynamics of disturbance of tree cover and deforested areas expressed by the textural and fractal analysis. The results obtained can be used in the future development and adaptation of forestry management policies to ensure sustainable management of exploited forest areas.

TI  - Smart Decision Support Systems for Volcanic Applications
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The huge amount of information coming from remote sensors on satellites has allowed monitoring changes in the planetary environment from about 50 years. These instruments are widely adopted to observe extreme thermal events such as eruptive phenomena in volcanic areas. Although the availability of so many different infrared sensors makes these instruments suitable to observe different kind of thermal phenomena, choosing the right infrared sensor to monitor each thermal event is not straightforward. In fact, the decision should take into account both the main features of the phenomena under investigation, e.g., its size and temperatures, that are often not known a priori, and the instruments specifications, e.g., spatial resolution. Here, a smart decision support system (SDSS) is proposed to address this task. In particular, we used a SDSS to simulate remote sensors responses, collect data coming from three different classes of remote sensors, retrieve information about the main features of the observed thermal event and, consequently, select the most suitable infrared remote sensor for the specific observed phenomena. Results obtained for a real case of study at Etna volcano is shown.

TI  - Apex marine predators and ocean health: Proactive screening of halogenated organic contaminants reveals ecosystem indicator species
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite decades-long bans on the production and use of certain chemicals, many halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) are persistent and can bioaccumulate in the marine environment with the potential to cause physiological harm to marine fauna. Highly lipid-rich tissue (e.g., marine mammal blubber) functions as a reservoir for HOCs, and selecting ideal indicator species is a priority for retrospective and proactive screening efforts. We selected five marine mammal species as possible indicators for the Southern California Bight (SCB) and applied a non-targeted analytical method paired with an automated data reduction strategy to catalog a broad range of known, known but unexpected, and unknown compounds in their blubber. A total of 194 HOCs were detected across the study species (n = 25 individuals), 81% of which are not routinely monitored, including 30 halogenated natural products and 45 compounds of unknown structure and origin. The cetacean species (long-beaked common dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin, and Risso's dolphin) averaged 128 HOCs, whereas pinnipeds (California sea lion and Pacific harbor seal) averaged 47 HOCs. We suspect this disparity can be attributed to differences in life history, foraging strategies, and/or enzyme-mediated metabolism. Our results support proposing (1) the long- and short-beaked common dolphin as apex marine predator sentinels for future and retrospective biomonitoring of the SCB ecosystem and (2) the use of non-targeted contaminant analyses to identify and prioritize emerging contaminants. The use of a sentinel marine species together with the non-targeted analytical approach will enable a proactive approach to environmental contaminant monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Surveying native egg parasitoids and predators of the invasive <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> in Northern Italy
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive Halyomorpha halys (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) is a key pest of fruits in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. For the development of a sustainable management programme, knowledge of its native natural enemy community and its efficacy is essential. A three-year field survey was conducted exposing H. halys egg masses in different types of habitats to investigate the efficacy of native natural enemies in reducing the H. halys populations in the Emilia-Romagna region, where the stinkbug was first detected in 2012. Over the first year of the study, sentinel eggs from laboratory cultures were stapled to the underside of leaves in various host trees, whereas in following years H. halys adults were directly caged on branches in sleeve cages to allow natural oviposition. Over the examined years, low rates of parasitism (1%-3%) and predation (2%-5%) were observed. Parasitism was caused exclusively by the generalist parasitoid Anastatus bifasciatus.

TI  - A Preliminary Investigation of the Potential of Sentinel-1 Radar to Estimate Pasture Biomass in a Grazed Pasture Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of large pasture fields is invaluable as it assists graziers to set stocking rate. In this preliminary evaluation, we investigated the response of Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to biophysical variables (leaf area index, height and AGB) for native pasture grasses on a hilly, pastoral farm. The S1 polarimetric parameters such as backscattering coefficients, scattering entropy, scattering anisotropy, and mean scattering angle were regressed against the widely used morphological parameters of leaf area index (LAI) and height, as well as AGB of pasture grasses. We found S1 data to be more responsive to the pasture parameters when using a 1 m digital elevation model (DEM) to orthorectify the SAR image than when we employed the often-used Shuttle Radar Topography 30 m and 90 m Missions. With the 1m DEM analysis, a significant quadratic relationship was observed between AGB and VH cross-polarisation (R-2 = 0.71), and significant exponential relationships between polarimetric entropy and LAI and AGB (R-2 = 0.53 and 0.45, respectively). Similarly, the mean scattering angle showed a significant exponential relationship with LAI and AGB (R-2 = 0.58 and R-2 = 0.83, respectively). The study also found a significant quadratic relationship between the mean scattering angle and pasture height (R-2 = 0.72). Despite a relatively small dataset and single season, the mean scattering angle in conjunction with a generalised additive model (GAM) explained 73% of variance in the AGB estimates. The GAM model estimated AGB with a root mean square error of 392 kg/ha over a range in pasture AGB of 443 kg/ha to 2642 kg/ha with pasture LAI ranging from 0.27 to 1.87 and height 3.25 cm to 13.75 cm. These performance metrics, while indicative at best owing to the limited datasets used, are nonetheless encouraging in terms of the application of S1 data to evaluating pasture parameters under conditions which may preclude use of traditional optical remote sensing systems.

TI  - Variations in Surface Albedo Arising from Flooding and Desiccation Cycles on the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert playas, such as those in northern Utah, form a landscape often in stark contrast to surrounding mountain ranges due to their minimal topographic relief, lack of vegetation, and saline soils. Dry highly reflective halite surfaces, which make up many of the desert playas in northern Utah, are generally characterized by a surface albedo over 40%. However, their albedo can be reduced abruptly to less than 20% by flooding due to rainfall, runoff from surrounding higher terrain, or surface winds transporting shallow water across the playas. A weather station installed during September 2016 to study the Bonneville Salt Flats (BSF) in northern Utah provides estimates of surface albedo that can be related to cycles of flooding and desiccation of the halite surface. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from the MODIS MOD09A1 land surface reflectance product estimates the fractional coverage of surface water over the BSF. NDWI values computed over 8-day periods from 2000 to 2018 highlight year-to-year and seasonal variations in playa flooding events over the BSF. Periods of playa flooding were observed with both ground-based observations and NDWI with sharp reductions in albedo when the surface is flooded.

TI  - Whales from space: Four mysticete species described using new VHR satellite imagery
T2  - MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-bodied animals such as baleen whales can now be detected with very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, allowing for scientific studies of whales in remote and inaccessible areas where traditional survey methods are limited or impractical. Here we present the first study of baleen whales using the WorldView-3 satellite, which has a maximum spatial resolution of 31cm in the panchromatic band, the highest currently available to nonmilitary professionals. We manually detected, described, and counted four different mysticete species: fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the Ligurian Sea, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off Hawaii, southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) off Peninsula Valdes, and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in Laguna San Ignacio. Visual and spectral analyses were conducted for each species, their surrounding waters, and nonwhale objects (e.g., boats). We found that behavioral and morphological differences made some species more distinguishable than others. Fin and gray whales were the easiest to discern due to their contrasting body coloration with surrounding water, and their prone body position, which is proximal to the sea surface (i.e., body parallel to the sea surface). These results demonstrate the feasibility of using VHR satellite technology for monitoring the great whales.

TI  - Quantifying Canopy Tree Loss and Gap Recovery in Tropical Forests under Low-Intensity Logging Using VHR Satellite Imagery and Airborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Logging, including selective and illegal activities, is widespread, affecting the carbon cycle and the biodiversity of tropical forests. However, automated approaches using very high resolution (VHR) satellite data (1 m spatial resolution) to accurately track these small-scale human disturbances over large and remote areas are not readily available. The main constraint for performing this type of analysis is the lack of spatially accurate tree-scale validation data. In this study, we assessed the potential of VHR satellite imagery to detect canopy tree loss related to selective logging in closed-canopy tropical forests. To do this, we compared the tree loss detection capability of WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 satellites with airborne LiDAR, which acquired pre- and post-logging data at the Jamari National Forest in the Brazilian Amazon. We found that logging drove changes in canopy height ranging from -5.6 to -42.2 m, with a mean reduction of -23.5 m. A simple LiDAR height difference threshold of -10 m was enough to map 97% of the logged trees. Compared to LiDAR, tree losses can be detected using VHR satellite imagery and a random forest (RF) model with an average precision of 64%, while mapping 60% of the total tree loss. Tree losses associated with large gap openings or tall trees were more successfully detected. In general, the most important remote sensing metrics for the RF model were standard deviation statistics, especially those extracted from the reflectance of the visible bands (R, G, B), and the shadow fraction. While most small canopy gaps closed within similar to 2 years, larger gaps could still be observed over a longer time. Nevertheless, the use of annual imagery is advised to reach acceptable detectability. Our study shows that VHR satellite imagery has the potential for monitoring the logging in tropical forests and detecting hotspots of natural disturbance with a low cost at the regional scale.

TI  - Characterizing forest carbon dynamics using multi-temporal lidar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have seen a rapid surge in the use of remote sensing technologies for characterizing the structure, composition and function of forested landscapes. Yet with few exceptions these studies have only provided snapshots of the ecosystem at one point in time, thereby limiting our ability to understand how forests are responding to global change. New approaches for characterizing forest dynamics using multi-temporal remotely sensed data are therefore urgently needed if we are to integrate these new technologies into conservation and management decision making processes. By combining data from a network of forest plots with repeat airborne lidar, here we develop an approach to (i) map fine-scale variation in aboveground carbon density (ACD) and its change over time across the landscape, and (ii) link these changes in ACD to forest structural attributes, species composition, disturbance regimes and local topography. We tested this framework on a temperate forest in the Alps characterized by the presence of three dominant species: spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). We found that between 2007 and 2011 the majority of the landscape (61.0%) increased in ACD, with a much smaller fraction of the study area exhibiting evidence of small-scale natural disturbances (3.7%) or ACD loss as a result of logging activities (13.7%). On average, areas of the landscape that actively sequestered carbon did so at a rate of 3.6% per year. However, rates of ACD accumulation varied considerably across the landscape, being greatest in forest stands characterized by multi-layered heterogeneous canopies, in ones dominated by spruce and at lower elevations. We demonstrated the potential of repeat lidar for characterizing not only the structure, but also the composition and aboveground carbon dynamics of forests. In doing so we open the door to monitor forests across large and inaccessible landscapes in order to better understand how they are responding to rapid global change and refine how we manage and conserve these critical ecosystems.

TI  - Land-Use Change and Its Impact on Urban Flooding: A Case Study on Colombo District Flood on May 2016
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Colombo district has become an increasingly congested urban society. It has been reported that the frequent flooding in the Colombo district occurs due to the shrinking of open spaces, illegal constructions, and lack of suitable waste disposal facilities. Therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the impact of land-use change on the flood of Colombo district in May 2016 in comparison to the land-use during the flood in 1989. Accordingly, Landsat images were utilized to identify the land-use by using NDVI, NDBI, and NDWI indices. Out of the several techniques examined, SVM classification was chosen, and change detection techniques in conjunction with remote sensing and GIS environment were adopted. SVM classification showed the highest accuracy for land-use classification, which was 99.0% in 1989 and 99.9% in 2016. The comparison of land-use changes of 1989 and 2016 with similar flood extent of the Colombo district proved that the area of the Kelani river watershed changed into urban area, having a significant impact on flood inundation. The Kelani river watershed includes 23% of the total urban area of the Colombo district. Similarly, the entire area of land-use transformation covered 37.7% of the area within the watershed region of the Colombo district. Eventually, this research identified the significant impact of Colombo district floods in May 2016 on land-use changes.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to develop a paradigm for parcel level horticultural crop identification and web based geospatial information generation using high resolution satellite data and open source GIS software. Initially to get the spectral differences among the crops both visual as well as digital classifications were performed particularly a number band ratios were generated. Based on the obtained NDVI values the crop classes were categorized and then matched with the plot based GPS survey data including the farmers information. The achieved discrimination was cross checked with the statistical analysis of data (ANOVA) obtained from the same spectral regions of the image where the maximum discriminations were noticed. Then a web based information development application was designed and managed with the help of QuantumGIS and published on the web through web2 leaflet along with the basic function-alities such as advanced queries, overlay analysis of vector layers, PAN, Zoom etc., with a view to provide the users an easy access to GIS data as well as on the internet with a minimum technological knowhow. That published web information can be managed and updated in future as per requirement by the authorized administrator only. (C) 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Object-based image analysis: a review of developments and future directions of automated feature detection in landscape archaeology
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a method of assessing remote sensing data that uses morphometric and spectral parameters simultaneously to identify features in remote sensing imagery. Over the past 10-15 years, OBIA methods have been introduced to detect archaeological features. Improvements in accuracy have been attained by using a greater number of morphometric variables and multiple scales of analysis. This article highlights the developments that have occurred in the application of OBIA within archaeology and argues that OBIA is both a useful and necessary tool for archaeological research. Additionally, I discuss future research paths using this method. Some of the suggestions put forth here include: pushing for multifaceted research designs utilizing OBIA and manual interpretation, using OBIA methods for directly studying landscape settlement patterns, and increasing data sharing of methods between researchers.

TI  - Upper-Limb Morbidity in Patients Undergoing a Rehabilitation Program After Breast Cancer Surgery: A 10-Year Follow-up Study
T2  - REHABILITATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To identify long-term predictive factors for upper-limb morbidity in patients who completed an early rehabilitation program after breast cancer surgery. Material and Methods: Prospective cohort study. The study population comprised 659 female patients who were consecutively enrolled in a rehabilitation program shortly after breast cancer surgery between April 1999 and June 2010. The rehabilitation program comprised clinical evaluation, written information on hygiene measures, aerobic exercise, and physical therapy. Variables assessed for affected and contralateral limb included circumferential measurement for lymphedema, passive range of motion in the shoulder, pain intensity using a visual analog scale, and sensory loss by the pin-prick method and tactile sensitivity. Predictive variables covered age, body mass index, regular physical activity, previous shoulder pathology, type of breast surgery, side of surgery, postsurgical complications, sentinel lymph node biopsy/axillary lymph node dissection, tumor size and histology, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to control for confounding factors. Results: The mean follow-up period was 72 months. A total of 306 patients (64.4%) showed upper-limb symptoms at some point during the follow-up period. Sensory loss and pain were the most relevant impairments. Predictive factors for shoulder and arm morbidity were obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-5.08), previous shoulder pathology (OR = 6.05; 95% CI, 2.89-12.63), postsurgical complications (OR = 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05-4.43), and regional lymph node radiotherapy (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 2.07-5.63). Conclusions: Previous shoulder pathology, postsurgical events, obesity, and site of radiotherapy were significant risk factors for developing shoulder and arm morbidity.

TI  - Soil Water Content and High-Resolution Imagery for Precision Irrigation: Maize Yield
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvement in water use efficiency of crops is a key component in addressing the increasing global water demand. The time and depth of the soil water monitoring are essential when defining the amount of water to be applied to irrigated crops. Precision irrigation (PI) is a relatively new concept in agriculture, and it provides a vast potential for enhancing water use efficiency, while maintaining or increasing grain yield. Neutron probes (NPs) have consistently been used as a robust and accurate method to estimate soil water content (SWC). Remote sensing derived vegetation indices have been successfully used to estimate variability of Leaf Area Index and biomass, which are related to root water uptake. Crop yield has not been evaluated on a basis of SWC, as explained by NPs in time and at different depths. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the optimal time and depth of SWC and its relationship to maize grain yield (2) to determine if satellite-derived vegetation indices coupled with SWC could further improve the relationship between maize grain yield and SWC. Soil water and remote sensing data were collected throughout the crop season and analyzed. The results from the automated model selection of SWC readings, used to assess maize yield, consistently selected three dates spread around reproductive growth stages for most depths (p value < 0.05). SWC readings at the 90 cm depth had the highest correlation with maize yield, followed closely by the 120 cm. When coupled with remote sensing data, models improved by adding vegetation indices representing the crop health status at V9, right before tasseling. Thus, SWC monitoring at reproductive stages combined with vegetation indices could be a tool for improving maize irrigation management.

TI  - Volcanic Cloud Top Height Estimation Using the Plume Elevation Model Procedure Applied to Orthorectified Landsat 8 Data. Test Case: 26 October 2013 Mt. Etna Eruption
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present a method for extracting the volcanic cloud top height (VCTH) as a plume elevation model (PEM) from orthorectified Landsat 8 data (Level 1). A similar methodology was previously applied to raw Landsat-8 data (Level 0). But level 0 data are not the standard product provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/United States Geological Survey (USGS). Level 0 data are available only on demand and consist on 14 data stripes multiplied by the number of multispectral bands. The standard product for Landsat 8 is the ortho image, available free of charge for end-users. Therefore, there is the need to adapt our previous methodology to Level 1 Landsat data. The advantages of using the standard Landsat products instead of raw data mainly include the fast -ready to use- availability of the data and free access to registered users, which is of major importance during volcanic crises. In this study, we adapt the PEM methodology to the standard Landsat-8 products, with the aim of simplifying the procedure for routine monitoring, offering an opportunity to produce PEM maps. In this study, we present the method. Our approach is applied to the 26 October 2013 Mt. Etna episodes comparing results independent VCTH measures from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS).

TI  - Massive tree mortality from flood pulse disturbances in Amazonian floodplain forests: The collateral effects of hydropower production
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large dams built for hydroelectric power generation alter the hydrology of rivers, attenuating the flood pulse downstream of the dam and impacting riparian and floodplain ecosystems. The present work mapped blackwater floodplain forests (igapo) downstream of the Balbina Reservoir, which was created between 1983 and 1987 by damming the Uatuma River in the Central Amazon basin. We apply remote sensing methods to detect tree mortality resulting from hydrological changes, based on analysis of 56 ALOS/PALSAR synthetic aperture radar images acquired at different flood levels between 2006 and 2011. Our application of object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods and the random forests supervised classification algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.2%. A total of 9800 km(2) of igapo forests were mapped along the entire river downstream of the dam, but forest mortality was only observed below the first 49 km downstream, after the Morena rapids, along an 80-km river stretch. In total, 12% of the floodplain forest died within this stretch. We also detected that 29% of the remaining living igapo forest may be presently undergoing mortality. Furthermore, this large loss does not include the entirety of lost igapo forests downstream of the dam; areas which are now above current maximum flooding heights are no longer floodable and do not show on our mapping but will likely transition over time to upland forest species composition and dynamics, also characteristic of igapo loss. Our results show that floodplain forests are extremely sensitive to long-term downstream hydrological changes and disturbances resulting from the disruption of the natural flood pulse. Brazilian hydropower regulations should require that Amazon dam operations ensure the simulation of the natural flood-pulse, despite losses in energy production, to preserve the integrity of floodplain forest ecosystems and to mitigate impacts for the riverine populations.

TI  - Land use land cover dynamics, its drivers and environmental implications in Lake Hawassa Watershed of Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Hawassa watershed is characterized by decades of deterioration with mismanagement of natural resources. Hence, the current study was aimed at assessing the magnitude and transformation patterns of land use land cover categories over the last 45 years, the major drivers of land use land cover changes and the environmental implications of land use land cover dynamics in Lake Hawassa Watershed. The study triangulated data from Landsat images (1972, 1992 and 2017), focus group discussions, interviews and farmers' lived experiences through household survey to evaluate the change and examine the underlying factors and its implications. The land use land cover change detection results revealed significant conversion from shrubland, woodland, and forest to built-up, bare land cultivated land and agroforestry. The proportion of cultivated land and agroforestry increased from 24.2% of the watershed in 1972 to 62% in 2017. These two land uses have gained large parcel of land from naturally vegetated land covers. Overall, about 74.34% of the watershed experienced changes in land cover in 45 years. The changes were driven by proximate and underlying drivers. The identified drivers were expansion of agricultural activities, urban and infrastructure expansion, wood extraction, biophysical factors, demographic factors and land tenure policy. Consequently, the natural resource base of the watershed is degrading. We concluded that unmanaged conversions of land covers were affecting the natural vegetation base and hydrology of the watershed. Hence, it was suggested that integrated lake watershed planning and management has a paramount importance in maintaining economic and ecological benefits.

TI  - Risk assessment of frost damage to sugar beet simulated under cold and semi-arid environments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semi-arid climatic conditions, water shortage is a key factor to generate crop production. Planting in autumn and winter and using precipitation can help cope with the problem. But in the semi-arid areas with cold winter, frost is another limited factor affecting crop production. For this purpose, in the present study, a simple and universal crop growth simulator (SUCROS) model was used to estimate the potential yield of sugar beets and frost damage from 1993 to 2009 for four autumn sowing dates (2 October, 17 October, 1 November, and 16 November) and two spring dates (6 March and 6 May) in eight locations (Birjand, Bojnord, Ghaen, Mashhad, Torbat-e Heydarieh, Neyshabor, Torbat-e Jam, and Ghochan) of the Khorasan province in northeastern Iran as a semi-arid and cold area. There was a large variability between locations and years in terms of frost damage. The crop failure from frost for the autumn sowing dates ranged from 62.5 to 100% at Neyshabor and Ghochan, respectively. Although autumn sowing dates performed better than spring sowing dates in terms of fresh storage organ yield (similar to 109.9tha(-1) vs. similar to 78.4tha(-1)), the risk of frost stress under autumn sowing dates was high at all studied locations. To maximize potential yield and minimize frost risk, sugar beet farmers under semi-arid and frost-prone conditions in the world such as Khorasan province should choose optimum sowing dates outside the high frost risk period to avoid crop damage. The last frost day under these areas normally happened between the 15th and 28th of February, after which no frost events occurred. Accordingly, it is recommended to farmers to sow sugar beet after the period during which no frost risk for sugar beet occurred.

TI  - Linking seasonal drought product information to decision makers in a data-sparse region: A case study in the Greater Horn of Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a major natural hazard with impacts across many sectors in a society. The main goal of this study was to link users' and decision makers' requirements with scientific information for effective use of remotely sensed data in a data-scarce region. The specific objectives are to: 1) present preliminary results from drought forecast tool evaluations addressing users' requirements in the study region, and 2) present the participatory research approach followed, with gaps and challenges identified. In this research, we used a participatory system design methodology that uses dialogue between managers and scientists on how to enhance the use of models' outputs and prediction products and improve the delivery of this information to decision makers. In this participatory research approach, it was confirmed that the major barriers for the use of drought model products were lack of skill, lack of understanding, and lack of trust of the products. These information use barriers can be addressed by targeted decision makers' skill development training and use of the available public media for increasing the awareness level on the availability and benefits of drought forecast products. Future research may focus on data dissemination and concept implementation as well as data management and information usability (i.e., addressing users' requirements).

TI  - Land use/land cover classification using time series Landsat 8 images in a heavily urbanized area
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to timely, accurately, and effectively monitor land use/cover in city regions for the reasonable development and utilization of urban land resources. The remotely sensed dynamic monitoring of Land use/land cover (LULC) in rapidly developing city regions has increasingly depended on remote-sensing data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. However, due to the influence of revisiting periods and weather, it is difficult to acquire enough time-series images with high quality at both high temporal and spatial resolution from the same sensor. In this paper we used the temporal-spatial fusion model ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) to blend Landsat8 and MODIS data and obtain time-series Landsat8 images. Then, land cover information is extracted using an object-based classification method. In this study, the proposed method is validated by a case study of the Changsha City. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 94.38% and 0.88, respectively, and the user/producer accuracies of vegetation types were all over 85%. Our approach provides an accurate and efficient technical method for the effective extraction of land use/cover information in the highly heterogeneous regions. (C) 2018 COSPAR.

TI  - Universally deployable extreme learning machines integrated with remotely sensed MODIS satellite predictors over Australia to forecast global solar radiation: A new approach
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Global advocacy to mitigate climate change impacts on pristine environments, wildlife, ecology, and health has led scientists to design technologies that harness solar energy with remotely sensed, freely available data. This paper presents a study that designed a regionally adaptable and predictively efficient extreme learning machine (ELM) model to forecast long-term incident solar radiation (ISR) over Australia. The relevant satellite-based input data extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (i.e., normalized vegetation index, land-surface temperature, cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature, cloud effective emissivity, cloud height, ozone and near infrared-clear water vapour), enriched by geo-temporal input variables (i.e., periodicity, latitude, longitude and elevation) are applied for a total of 41 study sites distributed approximately uniformly and paired with ground-based ISR (target). Of the 41 sites, 26 are incorporated in an ELM algorithm for the design of a universal model, and the remainder are used for model cross-validation. A universally-trained ELM (with training data as a global input matrix) is constructed, and the spatially-deployable model is applied at 15 test sites. The optimal ELM model is attained by trial and error to optimize the hidden layer activation functions for feature extraction and is benchmarked with competitive artificial intelligence algorithms: random forest (RF), M5 Tree, and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS). Statistical metrics show that the universally-trained ELM model has very good accuracy and outperforms RF, M5 Tree, and MARS models. With a distinct geographic signature, the ELM model registers a Legates & McCabe's Index of 0.555-0.896 vs. 0.411-0.858 (RF), 0.434-0.811 (M5 Tree), and 0.113-0.868 (MARS). The relative root-mean-square (RMS) error of ELM is low, ranging from approximately 3.715-7.191% vs. 4.907-10.784% (RF), 7.111-11.169% (M5 Tree) and 4.591-18.344% (MARS). Taylor diagrams that illustrate model preciseness in terms of RMS centred difference, error analysis, and boxplots of forecasted vs. observed ISR also confirmed the versatility of the ELM in generating forecasts over heterogeneous, remote spatial sites. This study ascertains that the proposed methodology has practical implications for regional energy modelling, particularly at national scales by utilizing remotely-sensed satellite data, and thus, may be useful for energy feasibility studies at future solar-powered sites. The approach is also important for renewable energy exploration in data-sparse or remote regions with no established measurement infrastructure but with a rich and viable satellite footprint.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to assess the spatio-temporal growth of urban sub-centre of North 24 Parganas District of West Bengal, India during 1989-2016. Landsat TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data for 1989, 2006 and 2016 along with Shannon's entropy model and Principal component analysis were used to assess the spatial dispersion and consistency of urbanization. A concentric zone analysis was also applied to assess the trends of urban growth within the urban sub-centre of the district. Land use/land cover change analysis reveals that the built up areas have increased drastically over the study periods. The transformation of prime agricultural land and other lands (mostly barren) into built up areas indicates the growth of sprawl within the urban sub-centre. The overall result shows that urban growth of the study area is not compact in nature and it is an evidence of concentration of sprawl growth over the urban sub-centre. The study estimates that urban expansion has occurred mainly in Barrackpore I, Barrackpore II and Rajarhat area of the district. The integrated methodology involving Shannon's entropy model and Principal component analysis and use of remote sensing and GIS techniques has proved to be useful in analyzing urban expansion and trends of urban growth. The outcome of this study can best be utilized for effective urban planning and management. (C) 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Brazilian Mangrove Status: Three Decades of Satellite Data Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1980s, mangrove cover mapping has become a common scientific task. However, the systematic and continuous identification of vegetation cover, whether on a global or regional scale, demands large storage and processing capacities. This manuscript presents a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-managed pipeline to compute the annual status of Brazilian mangroves from 1985 to 2018, along with a new spectral index, the Modular Mangrove Recognition Index (MMRI), which has been specifically designed to better discriminate mangrove forests from the surrounding vegetation. If compared separately, the periods from 1985 to 1998 and 1999 to 2018 show distinct mangrove area trends. The first period, from 1985 to 1998, shows an upward trend, which seems to be related more to the uneven distribution of Landsat data than to a regeneration of Brazilian mangroves. In the second period, from 1999 to 2018, a trend of mangrove area loss was registered, reaching up to 2% of the mangrove forest. On a regional scale, similar to 85% of Brazil's mangrove cover is in the states of MaranhAo, Para, Amapa and Bahia. In terms of persistence, similar to 75% of the Brazilian mangroves remained unchanged for two decades or more.

TI  - Review of remotely sensed data products for disease mapping and epidemiology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - High resolution remotely sensed (RS) data products remain of interest in disease mapping studies. However, previous usage of such satellite-derived products had been limited by high costs. There is also unprecedented space activity characterized by prolific satellite launches for various purposes, the chief of which being land cover observation. Therefore, there is need for information availability on the type of data products obtainable from the captured satellite images in order to facilitate access and utilization. Clearly, the remote sensing landscape is changing with the advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle/drones and spatially explicit images being captured at relatively low costs. We conducted a review to find out which RS data products were accessible for disease mapping and epidemiology. Our aim was to document RS data products for disease mapping and to propose other such products that could be incorporated in disease mapping and epidemiology studies. In view of the fact that RS data products are rapidly evolving, image data of higher spatial and temporal resolutions in near-real time are already available to aid disease mapping. We presented a catalogue of indices from ecological studies that could be used as variables in disease mapping and epidemiology. Remotely sensed data products related to climate, meteorology, land use/cover, cartography and urban mapping are explored as potential indices for disease mapping. There remains a substantial amount of work to be conducted on the evaluation and validation of some of the indices presented in this study. Conversely, synergies between remote sensing experts and epidemiologists could be useful in the uptake and testing of some of the proposed RS data products presented in this work.

TI  - Diagnosis of degraded pastures using an improved NDVI-based remote sensing approach: An application to the Environmental Protection Area of Uberaba River Basin (Minas Gerais, Brazil)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasture degradation represents a global environmental problem that urges mitigation. A fundamental step towards restoration of degraded pastures is the identification and accurate mapping of these areas. In Brazil, the area of degraded pastures is immense and therefore remote sensing is a cost-effective way to map it. In this study, an improved method based on NDVI values extracted from satellite images is presented, and tested in the Environmental Protection Area of Uberaba River Basin (EPAURB) located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The EPAURB covers an area of approximately 528.1 km(2), 50.9% of which is pasture. The innovative features of this method comprise: 1) the mapping is preceded by the definition of NDVI fingerprints for healthy, smoothly degraded, moderately degraded and degraded pasture (called physiognomies), based on non linear relationships between NDVI values and time; 2) the mapping of physiognomies accounts for the influence of geology and weather seasonality on the NDVI values. In the EPAURB the physiognomic categories were set by visual inspection and evaluation of soil characteristics (e.g., organic matter, nutrients, resistance to penetration) in the so-called characterization ground truth sites also termed buffers. Resistance to penetration and several other soil parameters showed statistically different (p <= 0.05) values among physiognomies. The definition of fingerprints was based on a 4-year record (2013-2016) of NDVI 16-day composite (MOD13Q1) 250m time-series data. The map of degraded pastures was delineated on the basis of comparisons between the NDVI values of 23 satellite images covering the year of 2016 (termed NDVIpixel) and corresponding characteristic NDVI values of degraded pasture physiognomy extracted from the corresponding fingerprint (termed NDVIbuffer). Whenever NDVIbuffer,min <= NDVIpixel <= NDVIbuffer,max a repetition counter (n) increased one unit. For n >= 3 the pixel was classified as degraded pasture. The results exposed 160.1 km(2) of degraded pasture for 3 <= n <= 18, which represents 60% of all pasture land. The areas mapped as degraded pasture were subject to a field check in 38 so-called validation ground truth sites, using resistance to penetration as validation parameter, with 84.1% success. Given the serious environmental damage posed by pasture degradation, several mitigation measures were discussed including the protection of degraded soil through the "polluter pays principle".

TI  - From active imagination to active life: at the roots of Jungian social activism
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our traditional Western worldview is often unconsciously based on a polarized, dichotomous perspective. However, many of Jung's ideas hint at a deep interrelation between opposites, such as inside and outside, which are, as the principle of synchronicity shows, rooted in a conceptualization of psyche and matter conceived as intertwined. Another pair of philosophical concepts, traditionally considered as opposites, needs further investigation: that between imagination and reality. If we are lucky in our daily practice as analysts, we can use imagination as a powerful tool to help people discover themselves as individuals and to get in deeper, more lively and responsible touch with reality. This paper explores the difference that Jung outlined between active imagination' and passive fantasies', and the transformative power of taking an active part in what imaginatively happens - he called it active participation' - rather than being passively overwhelmed by invasive fantasies. It is argued that it makes a great difference whether we become the actors and not just the spectators of our lives, and this is linked with the core of the individuation process in which, if individuals discover their particular place and meaning in the universe, they can live an active life', playing a heartfelt and responsible role in the collective world to which they belong. These ideas are at the heart of Jung's work, and they represent one of the roots of Jungian social activism.

TI  - Modeling and Quantitative Analysis of Tropospheric Impact on Inclined Geosynchronous SAR Imaging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geosynchronous orbit synthetic aperture radar (GEO SAR) has a long integration time and a large imaging scene. Therefore, various nonideal factors are easily accumulated, introducing phase errors and degrading the imaging quality. Within the long integration time, tropospheric status changes with time and space, which will result in image shifts and defocusing. According to the characteristics of GEO SAR, the modeling, and quantitative analysis of background troposphere and turbulence are conducted. For background troposphere, the accurate GEO SAR signal spectrum, which takes into account the time-varying troposphere, is deduced. The influences of different rates of changing (ROC) of troposphere with time are analyzed. Finally, results are verified using the refractive index profile data from Fengyun (FY) 3C satellite and the tropospheric zenith delays data from international GNSS service (IGS). The time-space changes of troposphere can cause image shifts which only depend on the satellite beam-foot velocity and the linear ROC of troposphere. The image defocusing is related to the wavelength, resolution requirement, and the second and higher orders of ROC. The short-wavelength GEO SAR systems are more susceptible to impacts, while L-band GEO SAR will be affected when the integration time becomes longer. Tropospheric turbulence will cause the amplitude and phase random fluctuations resulting in image defocusing. However, in the natural environment, radio waves are very weakly affected by turbulence, and the medium-inclined GEO SAR of L- to C-band will not be affected, while the X-band will be influenced slightly.

TI  - Cloud Detection Method for High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Based on the Spectrum and Texture of Superpixels
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image cloud detection is an important part of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery (HSRI) information processing and analysis. The spectral threshold selection of image cloud detection and the influence of cloud-like ground objects are two vital factors in determining cloud detection results of HSRI. With respect to these two issues, a novel cloud detection method for HSRI based on the spectrum and texture of superpixels is proposed in the paper. First, the adaptive image cloud detection spectral threshold is obtained according to the image equalization histogram. Second, the initial cloud detection result is obtained based on spectral threshold of the cloud detection and spectral attributes of superpixels. Third, the initial cloud detection result is refined based on the gray value and angular second moment of the superpixels local binary patterns texture to eliminate the influence of cloud-like ground objects. Finally, the cloud detection result is processed using the region growing algorithm and expansion algorithm to obtain an accurate cloud detection result. The experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain good cloud detection results.

TI  - Forecasting mesoscale distribution of surface solar irradiation using a proposed hybrid approach combining satellite remote sensing and time series models
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - A new hybrid forecasting tool is developed in this study which makes use of satellite remote sensing data of surface solar irradiation coupled to a Double Exponential Smoothing time series model. The prediction capabilities of the Double Exponential Smoothing model are reported to be higher than the ARMA and NAR-Neural Network. The mean absolute percentage error of this hybrid system is revealed to be the lowest (4.89%) on average for 5 consecutive days-ahead forecasts over the years 2013-2015, with the smallest standard deviation reported throughout the year, characteristic of a highly stable and robust model (3.83 W/m(2)). Exploring the performance of the model for the best and worst case scenarios reveal that high prediction accuracies on both spatial and temporal scales are achievable with strong positive linear correlations of the orders of 0.928 and 0.894 respectively, averaged over the 5 days forecasts. The performance of the hybrid system is found to be higher as compared with benchmark accuracy reached by several other models employed in literature. Finally, the use of the hybrid forecasting tool developed in providing energy and grid management facilities for the island of Mauritius is also presented.

TI  - Goaf Locating Based on InSAR and Probability Integration Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining goafs can cause many hazards, such as burst water, spontaneous combustion of coal seams, surface collapse, etc. In this paper, a feature-points-based method for the efficient location of mining goafs is proposed. Different interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is used to monitor the subsidence basin caused by mining. Using the principles of the probability integral method (PIM), the inflection points and the boundary points of the basin monitored by DInSAR are determined and used as feature points to locate the goaf. In this paper, the necessity of locating goafs and the traditional methods used for this task are discussed first. Then, the results of verifying the proposed method by both a simulation experiment and real data experiment are presented. Six RADARSAT-2 images from 13th October 2015 to 5th March 2016 were used to acquire the subsidence basin caused by the 15235 working faces of the Jiulong mining area. The average relative errors of the simulation experiment and real data experiment were about 6.43% and 12.59%, respectively. The average absolute errors of the simulation experiment and real data experiment were about 28 m and 38 m, respectively. In the final part of this paper, the error sources are discussed to illustrate the factors that can affect the location result.

TI  - Smallholder Crop Area Mapped with a Semantic Segmentation Deep Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing population in China has led to an increasing importance of crop area (CA) protection. A powerful tool for acquiring accurate and up-to-date CA maps is automatic mapping using information extracted from high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) images. RS image information extraction includes feature classification, which is a long-standing research issue in the RS community. Emerging deep learning techniques, such as the deep semantic segmentation network technique, are effective methods to automatically discover relevant contextual features and get better image classification results. In this study, we exploited deep semantic segmentation networks to classify and extract CA from high-resolution RS images. WorldView-2 (WV-2) images with only Red-Green-Blue (RGB) bands were used to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed semantic classification framework for information extraction and the CA mapping task. Specifically, we used the deep learning framework TensorFlow to construct a platform for sampling, training, testing, and classifying to extract and map CA on the basis of DeepLabv3+. By leveraging per-pixel and random sample point accuracy evaluation methods, we conclude that the proposed approach can efficiently obtain acceptable accuracy (Overall Accuracy = 95%, Kappa = 0.90) of CA classification in the study area, and the approach performs better than other deep semantic segmentation networks (U-Net/PspNet/SegNet/DeepLabv2) and traditional machine learning methods, such as Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and RF (Random Forest). Furthermore, the proposed approach is highly scalable for the variety of crop types in a crop area. Overall, the proposed approach can train a precise and effective model that is capable of adequately describing the small, irregular fields of smallholder agriculture and handling the great level of details in RGB high spatial resolution images.

TI  - Numerical Assessments of Leaf Area Index in Tropical Savanna Rangelands, South Africa Using Landsat 8 OLI Derived Metrics and In-Situ Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on rangeland condition, productivity patterns and possible thresholds of potential concern, as well as the escalation of risks in the face of climate change and variability over savanna grasslands is essential for wildlife/livestock management purposes. The estimation of leaf area index (LAI) in tropical savanna ecosystems is therefore fundamental for the proper planning and management of this natural capital. In this study, we assess the spatio-temporal seasonal LAI dynamics (dry and wet seasons) as a proxy for rangeland condition and productivity in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral bands, derived vegetation indices and a non-parametric approach (i.e., random forest, RF) were used to assess dry and wet season LAI condition and variability in the KNP. The results showed that RF optimization enhanced the model performance in estimating LAI. Moderately high accuracies were observed for the dry season (R-2 of 0.63-0.72 and average RMSE of 0.60 m(2)/m(2)) and wet season (0.62-0.63 and 0.79 m(2)/m(2)). Derived thematic maps demonstrated that the park had high LAI estimates during the wet season when compared to the dry season. On average, LAI estimates ranged between 3 and 7 m(2)/m(2) during the wet season, whereas for the dry season most parts of the park had LAI estimates ranging between 0.00 and 3.5 m(2)/m(2). The findings indicate that Kruger National Park had high levels of productivity during the wet season monitoring period. Overall, this work shows the unique potential of Landsat 8-derived metrics in assessing LAI as a proxy for tropical savanna rangelands productivity. The result is relevant for wildlife management and habitat assessment and monitoring.

TI  - Analysis of coastline change in relation to meteorological conditions and human activities in Ca mau cape, Viet Nam
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ca Mau Cape is a part of Ngoc Hien district and is the southernmost tip of inland Vietnam. The district is highly vulnerable to coastal processes induced by natural and human factors that play important role in shaping and controlling the coastline. This study investigated the coastline change over 20 years, 1990-2010, in relation to meteorological conditions and human interventions using the land-use map (Landsat TM) and questionnaire survey. During this period, Ngoc Hien lost 2206 ha of coastal zone due to erosion. Most of the erosion occurred in the communes located in the east coast side. Remarkable changes in land-use/land-cover patterns were observed with a substantial reduction in the forest and increase in the aquaculture farming land. The results of the technical data analysis and questionnaire survey showed that both meteorological conditions and human interventions were interacted to cause the changes. Although the impacts of individual factors could not be readily quantified, the most important factors causing the coastline changes were forest area loss, river dredging, aquaculture and infrastructure development. The scientific information obtained in this study can be used to develop sustainable coastal management strategies for the study area.

TI  - Improving Aboveground Forest Biomass Maps: From High-Resolution to National Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation over large extents and high temporal resolution is crucial in managing Mediterranean forest ecosystems, which have been predicted to be very sensitive to climate change effects. Although many modeling procedures have been tested to assess forest AGB, most of them cover small areas and attain high accuracy in evaluations that are difficult to update and extrapolate without large uncertainties. In this study, focusing on the Region of Murcia in Spain (11,313 km(2)), we integrated forest AGB estimations, obtained from high-precision airborne laser scanning (ALS) data calibrated with plot-level ground-based measures and bio-geophysical spectral variables (eight different indices derived from MODIS computed at different temporal resolutions), as well as topographic factors as predictors. We used a quantile regression forest (QRF) to spatially predict biomass and the associated uncertainty. The fitted model produced a satisfactory performance (R-2 0.71 and RMSE 9.99 tha(-1)) with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the main vegetation index, in combination with topographic variables as environmental drivers. An independent validation carried out over the final predicted biomass map showed a satisfactory statistically-robust model (R-2 0.70 and RMSE 10.25 tha(-1)), confirming its applicability at coarser resolutions.

TI  - Pathologic Evaluation and Prognostic Implications of Nodal Micrometastases in Breast Cancer
T2  - SEMINARS IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using modern sentinel lymph node techniques, occult nodal metastases including micro metastases or isolated tumor cells are being increasingly discovered in up to 10% of early stage breast cancers. Furthermore, the rate of nonsentinel lymph node involvement is approximately 10%. However, the impact of these findings on disease-free survival is low, particularly with regards to axillary recurrences. Current evidence suggests small-volume lymph node involvement in breast cancer patients is only one of several factors that should guide adjuvant therapy options. In otherwise favorable patients, adjuvant radiation and systemic therapy can help mitigate the risk of recurrence when omitting axillary lymph node dissection. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Political Attitudes and the Processing of Misinformation Corrections
T2  - POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Misinformation often continues to influence people's memory and inferential reasoning after it has been retracted; this is known as the continued influence effect (CIE). Previous research investigating the role of attitude-based motivated reasoning in this context has found conflicting results: Some studies have found that worldview can have a strong impact on the magnitude of the CIE, such that retractions are less effective if the misinformation is congruent with a person's relevant attitudes, in which case the retractions can even backfire. Other studies have failed to find evidence for an effect of attitudes on the processing of misinformation corrections. The present study used political misinformation-specifically fictional scenarios involving misconduct by politicians from left-wing and right-wing parties-and tested participants identifying with those political parties. Results showed that in this type of scenario, partisan attitudes have an impact on the processing of retractions, in particular (1) if the misinformation relates to a general assertion rather than just a specific singular event and (2) if the misinformation is congruent with a conservative partisanship.

TI  - Should Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Be Performed for All T1b Melanomas in the New 8th Edition American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 130th Annual Meeting of the Southern-Surgical-Association
CL  - Palm Beach, FL
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system, the T1b category has been redefined based solely on thickness and ulceration. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend consideration of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for all patients with T1b melanomas (0.8 to 1.0 mm thick). We hypothesized that the new staging system would lead to excessive use of SLNB in patients with non-ulcerated T1b melanomas with a low risk of positive sentinel lymph nodes.STUDY DESIGN: The National Cancer Database 2015 Melanoma Public Use File was used to select patients undergoing SLNB for thin T1 cutaneous melanoma from 2010 to 2015. Clinicopathologic risk factors for having a positive SLNB were evaluated. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models and classification and regression tree analysis were performed to identify groups with high and low risk of positive SLNB.RESULTS: We selected patients undergoing SLNB without ulceration with thickness 0.75 to 1.04 mm, staged T1b in the new 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer by thickness criteria alone (6,894 patients). Independent risk factors for a positive sentinel lymph node were age 56 years or younger (odds ratio [OR] 1.74; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.17), thickness 1.0 vs 0.8 to 0.9mm(OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70), female sex (OR1.36; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.69), and mitotic rate >= 1/mm(2) (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.54 to 2.64). Classification and regression tree analysis identified 2 groups based on age, mitotic rate, and thickness with a risk of positive SLNB <5%. These 2 groups made up 55% of T1b, nonulcerated melanoma patients who underwent SLNB.CONCLUSIONS: The new 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system T1b category should not be used to determine use of SLNB in thin melanoma, as more than one half of T1b lesions without ulceration have a low risk of positive sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - Mapping of aboveground biomass in Gabon
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to map the aboveground biomass (AGB) in Gabon. First, a random forest (RF) model that relates reference AGB values to remote sensing (RS)-derived variables (mainly radar and optical images) was built, and the significant predictive variables were determined. Second, the built RF model was applied to the significant RS-derived variables to predict AGB across Gabon. The results showed that the overall RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) on the RS-derived AGB map with a spatial resolution of 50 m was 63.3 t/ha (R-2 = 0.53).To improve the accuracy of the RS-derived AGB map, the integration of LiDAR data provided by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was investigated. First, an RF model that relates reference AGB values to GLAS-derived metrics and a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) was built. Second, the calibrated RF model was applied to obtain a spatially distributed estimation of AGB (GLAS footprints geolocation) covering forested areas in Gabon, with a density of 0.13 footprints/km(2). Third, the semivariogram of residuals (RS-derived AGB map - GLAS-derived AGB "surrogate AGB") was computed. Later, a regression kriging interpolation was performed by taking into account the spatial structure of residuals to provide a continuous residual map. Finally, the RS-derived AGB map and the residual map were summed, and a final AGB map was obtained. The results showed that the integration of GLAS surrogate AGB data slightly improves the accuracy of the RS-derived AGB map only for AGB values lower than 100 t/ha (bias and RMSE reduced by 13.9 and 10 t/ha, respectively).

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable development of urban growth is a mandatory challenge to be addressed, as also highlighted in the Agenda 2030, and this requires suitable and sustainable planning strategies, as well as systematic and timely monitoring of urban expansion and its effects. In this context, satellite data (today also available free of charge) can provide both (i) historical time-series datasets, and (ii) timely updated information related to the current urban spatial structure and city edges, as well as parameters to assess urban features and their statistical characterization to better understand and manage the phenomenon. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that the identification and mapping of urban areas is still today a complex challenge, due to the heterogeneities of materials, complexity of the features, etc. Our approach, herein adopted, addresses the challenges in using heterogeneous data from multiple data sources for change detection analysis to improve knowledge and monitoring of landscape over time with a specific focus on urban sprawl and land-use change around cultural properties and archaeological areas. Two significant test cases were selected: (i) one in Egypt, the Catacombs of Mustafa Kamel in Alexandria, and (ii) one in Italy, the Aragonese Castle in Baia-Naples. For both study areas, the changes in urban layers were identified over time from satellite data and investigated using spatial analytic tools to statistically characterize them. The results of this study showed that (i) the increase in urban areas is the main phenomenon around both heritage areas, (ii) this increase is sharper in developing countries (e.g., Egypt) than developed countries (e.g., Italy), (iii) the methodology herein adopted is suitable for both big and small urban changes as observed around the Catacombs of Mustafa Kamel and the Aragonese Castle.

AB  - Waves are an important phenomena in the sea but in view of complicated nature are difficult to study. This research, with the aim of showing a primary research on satellite altimetry, studied significant wave height in offshore waters near Gilan province in the south-east of Caspian region during 2014. So wave's data including significant wave height and wind speed were obtained in a time interval from satellite. The significant wave height data were verified with buoy significant wave height data and their graphs generated. Using wave data and SPM method, the significant wave height and wave period obtained. The contour figure of significant wave height was depicted. The comparison of satellite significant wave height data and result of SPM method by buoy data showed that the satellite data has less error than SPM method result. The result of this research has shown that the effective parameters on wind waves are formation of high and low pressure atmospheric system. The maximum value of mean altimetry significant wave height is 0.70 m in November and 0.80 m in December. The maximum of significant wave height occurs in north portion of study region. The dominate direction of waves is northwestern in coasts of Gilan province.

TI  - Continental-scale assessment of the African offshore wind energy potential: Spatial analysis of an under-appreciated renewable energy resource
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Offshore wind energy is rapidly becoming a technology that developing countries could consider because project costs have recently fallen substantially. Further reductions are expected as the industry matures. For most African coastal states, specific information about their offshore wind potential is not available. This study aims to address this shortcoming by evaluating the technical offshore wind potential of the entire continent using spatially explicit models and long-term satellite data. Two different scenarios were developed to reflect different levels of technological maturity in the wind industry: The shallow-water, near-coast scenario 1 represented the conservative assumption that technology will not improve beyond what is available already now. The deep-water, full-exclusive economic zone (EEZ) scenario 2 assumes the operational availability of floating platforms that would allow it to access wind resources at much deeper water depths across the entire EEZ. It is emphasized that the model results are subject to a number of uncertainties and therefore should be treated as first order estimates only. Both scenarios indicate very good technical offshore wind energy potential for one third of the African coastal states, with Mozambique, South Africa, Somalia, Madagascar and Morocco exhibiting particularly good resources. More than 90% of the offshore wind resources are concentrated in coastal zones associated to three African Power Pools. These are the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), the Eastern African Power Pool (EAPP), and the Comite Maghrebin de l'Electricite (COMELEC). A joint and integrated development within these power pools could offer a promising approach to utilising offshore wind energy in Africa.

TI  - Agricultural Development and Implication for Wetlands Sustainability: A Case from Baoqing County, Northeast China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical thematic maps and remote sensing data were applied to address spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and its impact on wetlands sustainability based on eight LULC datasets from 1954 to 2015 in Baoqing County, Northeast China. This study demonstrated that LULC drastically changed in the past six decades due to conversion of wetlands, woodland, and grassland into cropland. The cropland was 578.8 km(2) in 1954, accounting for 5.8% of the area in Baoqing County, and it increased to 54.3% in 2015, which was nearly equivalent to 9.4 times of that in 1954. Cropland increased 4843.6 km(2) from 1954 to 2015 with average increased area of 79.4 km(2)/yr. The conversion of wetlands was the main reason for cropland increase (49.7%), and woodland (18%) and grassland (16.3%) conversion were other reasons. Results also revealed that 78% of wetlands were lost during the past six decades, of which 91.2% were converted cropland. Population increasing (population across Baoqing in 2015 was 7.8 times of that in 1949), agricultural technology development was the main reason for cropland increase, institutional and economic policies also played important roles for cropland dynamics, particularly paddy field influenced by market price. Agricultural development has caused severe wetlands degradation both in area and functionality, and still being the major threads for wetlands sustainable development. Several suggestions concerning the future land use policy formulation and wetlands sustainability were proposed. They are adjusting the food first' agricultural policy, reinforce management for wetlands nature reserves, creating infrastructure for the rational use of surface and groundwater, harnessing the degraded cultivated land.

TI  - Untrustworthy News and the Media as "Enemy of the People?" How a Populist Worldview Shapes Recipients' Attitudes toward the Media
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A common feature among populist parties and movements is their negative perspective on the media's role in society. This paper analyzes whether citizens with a populist worldview also hold negative attitudes toward the media. From a theoretical point of view, the paper shows that both the anti-elite, anti-outgroup and people centrism dimension of populism contradicts the normative expectations toward the media. For instance, the assumption of a homogeneous people and the exclusion of a societal outgroup is incompatible with a pluralistic media coverage. The results of a representative survey in Germany predominantly confirmed a relation between a populist worldview and negative media attitudes. However, the three populism dimensions influenced the evaluations not in a consistent way. A systematic relation could only be found for antielite populism, which is negatively associated with all analyzed media evaluations such as media trust or satisfaction with the media's performance. This indicates that in a populist worldview, the media are perceived as part of a detached elite that neglects the citizens' interests. However, the results confirm the assumption of a natural ally between populism and tabloid or commercial media. Individuals with people centrist and anti-outgroup attitudes have higher trust in these media outlets.

TI  - Evolution of saline lands in the North of the Saloum estuary (Senegal)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGIE-RELIEF PROCESSUS ENVIRONNEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area is characterized by a high salinity of its land. This space is between the Joal-Fadiouth lagoon and the right bank boundary of the Saloum estuary between latitudes 13 degrees 97 'and 14 degrees 32' North and longitudes 16 degrees 39 'and 16 degrees 20' West. These salted lands have existed since the recent Quaternary, but their current evolution is amplified by the climatic variability over the last decades and by the human activities. The objective of this research is to analyse dynamics of soil salinity in the northern Saloum estuary. The methodological approach adopted is based on satellite images processing. It processes Landsat MSS satellite images from 1973, TM from 1984, 1992, ETM + 2006, OLI and TIRS from 2014. The classification of maximum likelihood validated by field truths, by determination of the matrices of confusion and calculation of Kappa indices enabled characterizing the dynamics of salty lands. Results from the classification showed a strong advance of the salty lands during the last two decades. From 1994 to 2014, salty land increased of 21 000 ha. The annual average increase of salt affected area is estimated at 1 000 ha since 1994.

TI  - Automated Satellite-Based Landslide Identification Product for Nepal
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide event inventories are a vital resource for landslide susceptibility and forecasting applications. However, landslide inventories can vary in accuracy, availability, and timeliness as a result of varying detection methods, reporting, and data availability. This study presents an approach to use publicly available satellite data and open-source software to automate a landslide detection process called the Sudden Landslide Identification Product (SLIP). SLIP utilizes optical data from the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager sensor, elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission to create a reproducible and spatially customizable landslide identification product. The SLIP software applies change-detection algorithms to identify areas of new bare-earth exposures that may be landslide events. The study also presents a precipitation monitoring tool that runs alongside SLIP called the Detecting Real-Time Increased Precipitation (DRIP) model that helps to identify the timing of potential landslide events detected by SLIP. Using SLIP and DRIP together, landslide detection is improved by reducing problems related to accuracy, availability, and timeliness that are prevalent in the state of the art for landslide detection. A case study and validation exercise in Nepal were performed for images acquired between 2014 and 2015. Preliminary validation results suggest 56% model accuracy, with errors of commission often resulting from newly cleared agricultural areas. These results suggest that SLIP is an important first attempt in an automated framework that can be used for medium-resolution regional landslide detection, although it requires refinement before being fully realized as an operational tool.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The advent of US guided FNAC in the investigation of adenopathy has become a suitable and commonly practiced minimally invasive procedure which is safe, simple, quick, highly cost effective and innocuous. Nowadays, in modern days FNAC is done in almost all cases due to its high specificity, Positive predictive value (PPV) and no complications resulting in fewer SNLB and directly proceeding with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or ALND..METHODS: A total of 160 females between ages 30-60 years who had clinical palpable breast lump, newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer with palpable axilla nodes were included. Patients who already received neoadjuvant therapy and whose biopsy does not yield enough specimens and needs repeat biopsy were excluded. All the patients were then undergoing ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration. Afterwards, all patients were gone through axillary surgery for the definite histopathology report. FNAC results were compared with pathology after SLNB.RESULTS: Mean age was 46.61±8.75 years. In 67 FNAC positive patients, 61 were True Positive and 06 were False Positive. Among, 93 FNAC negative patients, 18 were False Negative whereas 75 were True Negative. Overall sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of US guided FNAC of suspicious axilla nodes in patent with primary breast carcinoma was 77.22%, 92.59%, 80.65%, 91.04% and 85.0% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that US guided FNAC of suspicious axilla nodes in patient with primary breast carcinoma has quite acceptable diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Water Body Extraction From Very High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Using Deep U-Net and a Superpixel-Based Conditional Random Field Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body extraction (WBE) has attracted considerable attention in the field of remote sensing image analysis. Herein, we present an enhanced deep convolutional encoder-decoder (DCED) network (or Deep U-Net) specifically tailored to WBE from remote sensing images by applying superpixel segmentation and conditional random fields (CRFs). First, we preclassify the entire remote sensing image into the water and nonwater areas via Deep U-Net, using the results of class membership probabilities as the unary potential in the CRF model. The pairwise potential of CRF is defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels, which forms a fully connected neighbor structure. Next, regional restriction is incorporated into the approach to enhance the consistency of the connected area. We use the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to generate superpixels and correct the binary classification results by calculating their average posterior probabilities. Finally, a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm, mean-field inference, is generated for the final model. The results from the experimental application to GaoFen-2 images and WorldView-2 images demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits competitive quantitative and qualitative performance, which effectively reduces salt-and-pepper noise and retains the edge structures of water bodies. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method achieves superior final results.

TI  - Evaluation of conflict of land use in the Lamarao river watershed, Federal District
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of studies and the constant degradation of Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA's) have represented one of the biggest barriers to the planning of conservation actions, in addition to promoting the use of inappropriate strategies for watershed management. Thus, the objective of was study map the land use, to automatically delimit the PPA's and to identify the occurrence of conflicts in land use, having as legal reference, the Brazilian Forest Code and Resolution No. 303, of CONAMA. The research has developed in the watershed of the Lamarao stream, located in the southeast of the Federal District, Brazil. For the land use classification, a digital image of the ALOS satellite with 10 - meter spatial resolution, AVNIR - 2 sensor, obtained in July 2010 has used. The relief and hydrography data used were obtained in digital format on a scale of 1: 10,000. It was possible to map seven land use classes: exposed soil (1.01%); agriculture (50.46%); sparse cerrado (11.28%); cerrado dense (10.45%); pasture (17.54%); central pivot (7.63%); and clouds (1.55%). The PPA's located in the upper third of hills (9.94 km); springs and their respective contributing areas (0.27 km(2)); riparian zones with width less than 10 meters (24.10 km(2)), summing 34.31 km(2) (36.85%). There were no identified PPA's on hillsides with slopes greater than 45 degrees. The area of undue use corresponded to 21.70 km(2) (63.24%), with agriculture (38.40%) and pasture (15.32%) classes occupying most of this area. Only 11.50 km(2) (33.46%) of PPA s are protected by native vegetation.

TI  - Estimating prescribed fire impacts and post-fire tree survival in eucalyptus forests of Western Australia with L-band SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prescribed burning is a technique commonly applied to reduce fire risk. Fire is introduced under specific environmental conditions, with explicit duration, intensity and rate of spread. Such conditions deviate from those encountered during the fire season. As a result, prescribed burns mostly affect surface fuels and understorey vegetation, an outcome markedly different when compared to wildfires.Information on prescribed burning outcomes is important for evaluating the extent to which land management objectives have been achieved. This study focused on the ability of Radar Burn Ratio (RBR), a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based multi-temporal index, to appraise the outcome of prescribed burns in eucalypt forests of Western Australia. L-band datasets acquired by the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) sensor were used to relate changes in radar backscatter coefficient with the effects of prescribed burning. Two modelling approaches based on post- to pre-fire ratios were used to evaluate prescribed burn impacts. Post-fire tree survival in areas affected by high fire impacts was inferred by assessing the recovery rates of the backscatter coefficient for the first year after the burn.The impact of prescribed burns was estimated with relatively high overall accuracy (79%) using cross-polarized backscatter (HV) under dry conditions. The HH polarization and the Normalized Difference Backscatter Intensity (NDBI) showed certain ability to detect burned areas under wet conditions. The results suggest that L-band backscatter coefficient may contribute to evaluating the success of prescribed burns in Western Australian eucalypt forests through its sensitivity to changes in vegetation structure. In addition, tree survival (as opposed to mortality) and recovery towards the pre-fire state might be inferred by analysing short-term post-fire trends of the backscatter coefficient in areas affected by high fire impacts.

TI  - Monitoring Spatial and Temporal Variabilities of Gross Primary Production Using MAIAC MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed vegetation indices (RSVIs) can be used to efficiently estimate terrestrial primary productivity across space and time. Terrestrial productivity, however, has many facets (e.g., spatial and temporal variability, including seasonality, interannual variability, and trends), and different vegetation indices may not be equally good at predicting them. Their accuracy in monitoring productivity has been mostly tested in single-ecosystem studies, but their performance in different ecosystems distributed over large areas still needs to be fully explored. To fill this gap, we identified the facets of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) that could be monitored using RSVIs. We compared the temporal and spatial patterns of four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRV, and CCI), derived from the MODIS MAIAC data set and of GPP derived from data from 58 eddy-flux towers in eight ecosystems with different plant functional types (evergreen needle-leaved forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, open shrubland, grassland, cropland, and wetland) distributed throughout Europe, covering Mediterranean, temperate, and boreal regions. The RSVIs monitored temporal variability well in most of the ecosystem types, with grasslands and evergreen broad-leaved forests most strongly and weakly correlated with weekly and monthly RSVI data, respectively. The performance of the RSVIs monitoring temporal variability decreased sharply, however, when the seasonal component of the time series was removed, suggesting that the seasonal cycles of both the GPP and RSVI time series were the dominant drivers of their relationships. Removing winter values from the analyses did not affect the results. NDVI and CCI identified the spatial variability of average annual GPP, and all RSVIs identified GPP seasonality well. The RSVI estimates, however, could not estimate the interannual variability of GPP across sites or monitor the trends of GPP. Overall, our results indicate that RSVIs are suitable to track different facets of GPP variability at the local scale, therefore they are reliable sources of GPP monitoring at larger geographical scales.

TI  - Prospectivity mapping for high sulfidation epithermal porphyry deposits using an integrated compositional and topographic remote sensing dataset
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The targeting and discovery of epithermal porphyry mineral deposits can be enhanced using a structured quantitative methodology to analyse the distribution of ore deposits and model their spatial association with exploration evidence providing improved understanding on the controls of ore deposition. A novel exploration tool integrating field and ASTER SWIR and TIR satellite imagery has been developed which provides an enhanced means of resolving surface expressions of the residual silica core of the lithocap. The alteration zones were clearly resolved by the remote sensing data and an intimate spatial relationship between high-grade altered rocks and topographic highs was identified at a number of locations. A Mineral Prospectivity Modelling (MPM) approach, parameterized by the results of the remote sensing study, using a GIS-based weighted linear combination implementation of a Multi-Criteria Evaluation approach and utilising a fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process to elucidate expert knowledge has been implemented to target high sulfidation epithermal porphyry deposits on the Island of Lesvos, Greece. The results from this integrated altitudinal-compositional modelling approach closely matched the hydrothermal alteration mapped in the field supporting the accuracy of this MPM approach.

TI  - Discriminating transplanted and direct seeded rice using Sentinel-1 intensity data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved rice crop and water management practices that make the sustainable use of resources more efficient are important interventions towards a more food secure future. A remote sensing-based detection of different rice crop management practices, such as crop establishment method (transplanting or direct seeding), can provide timely and cost-effective information on which practices are used as well as their spread and change over time as different management practices are adopted. Establishment method cannot be easily observed since it is a rapid event, but it can be inferred from resulting observable differences in land surface characteristics (i.e. field condition) and crop development (i.e. delayed or prolonged stages) that take place over a longer time. To examine this, we used temporal information from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter to detect differences in field condition and rice growth, then related those to crop establishment practices in Nueva Ecija (Philippines). Specifically, multi-temporal, dual-polarised, C-band backscatter data at 20m spatial resolution was acquired from Sentinel-1A every 12 days over the study area during the dry season, from November 2016 to May 2017. Farmer surveys and field observations were conducted in four selected municipalities across the study area in 2017, providing information on field boundaries and crop management practices for 61 fields. Mean backscatter values were generated per rice field per SAR acquisition date. We matched the SAR acquisition dates with the reported dates for land management activities and with the estimated dates for when the crop growth stages occurred. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify significant differences in backscatter between the two practices during the land management activities and crop growth stages. Significant differences in cross-polarised, co-polarised and band ratio backscatter values were observed in the early growing season, specifically during land preparation, crop establishment, rice tillering and stem elongation. These findings indicate the possibility to discriminate crop establishment methods by SAR at those stages, suggesting that there is more opportunity for discrimination than has been presented in previous studies. Further testing in a wider range of environments, seasons, and management practices should be done to determine how reliably rice establishment methods can be detected. The increased use of dry and wet direct seeding has implications for many remote sensing-based rice detection methods that rely on a strong water signal (typical of transplanting) during the early season.

TI  - COSMO-SkyMed Staring Spotlight SAR Data for Micro-Motion and Inclination Angle Estimation of Ships by Pixel Tracking and Convex Optimization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In past research, the problem of maritime targets detection and motion parameter estimation has been tackled. This new research aims to contribute by estimating the micro-motion of ships while they are anchored in port or stationed at the roadstead for logistic operations. The problem of motion detection of targets is solved using along-track interferometry (ATI) which is observed using two radars spatially distanced by a baseline extended in the azimuth direction. In the case of spaceborne missions, the performing of ATI requests using at least two real-time SAR observations spatially distanced by an along-track baseline. For spotlight spaceborne SAR re-synthesizing two ATI observations from one raw data is a problem because the received electromagnetic bursts are not oversampled for onboard memory space saving and data appears like a white random process. This problem makes appearing interlaced Doppler bands completely disjointed. This phenomenon, after the range-Doppler focusing process, causes decorrelation when considering the ATI interferometric phase information retransmitted by distributed targets. Only small and very coherent targets located within the same radar resolution cell are considered. This paper is proposing a new approach where the micro-motion estimation of ships, occupying thousands of pixels, is measured processing the information given by sub-pixel tracking generated during the coregistration process of two re-synthesized time-domain and partially overlapped sub-apertures generated splitting the raw data observed by a single wide Doppler band staring spotlight (ST) SAR map. The inclination of ships is calculated by low-rank plus sparse decomposition and Radon transform of some region of interest. Experiments are performed processing one set of COSMO-SkyMed ST SAR data.

TI  - Land take and landscape loss: Effect of uncontrolled urbanization in Southern Italy
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper describes a research that, based on the evolutionary data of the urban settlement over a period of half a century, shows the changes undergone by the various landscape categories of Southern Italy. The regions involved are four (Campania, Basilicata, Puglia and Calabria) and share renowned urban, economic and social issues such as unauthorised development, low income per capita and organised crime. All this has produced profound transformations on some of the most important and rare Italian landscapes, such as coastal plains and coastal carbonate slabs. Uncontrolled urban sprawl has further provoked an environmental crisis and eco-friendly insularisation of the yet numerous and valuable protected areas of this geographical area, thus leading to a high density of buildings and infrastructures even in national parks, breaking European records in this respect. Through finalised indicators, the characteristics of the evolution occurred have been analytically highlighted, and by using the latest generation satellite data, it is shown how such phenomena have continued to take place with significant energy over the last few years. The result is a picture of environmental threats still very prominent in this southern extremity of the peninsula, above all towards those naturalistic qualities and landscapes that are the main attractions of an intense national and international tourism whose income, however, has not been conveyed in a correct and inclusive way to allow high-level socio-economic conditions of the resident population.

TI  - Analyzing spatiotemporal types and patterns of urban growth in watersheds that flow into Jakarta Bay, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Jakarta is the economic hub of Indonesia and the primary target for urbanization. This condition encourages urban growth, particularly in the peri-urban regions of Jakarta. Uncontrolled urban growth impacts Jakarta negatively, because of its location downslope of eight watersheds. This study evaluated the spatiotemporal characteristics and types of urban growth in the watersheds that flow into Jakarta Bay using remote sensing data. Spatial rules revealed three urban growth types, including infilling, edge expansion, and outlying, from 2001 to 2017. Spatial metrics provided quantitative data on urban growth characteristics and explained the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban growth. The study area was divided into eight cardinal directions to analyze urban growth trends. From 2001 to 2017, the average annual urban and population growth rates were 3.75% and 3.9%, respectively. The prominent urban growth types, edge expansion and infilling, coalesced urban patches and rendered urban areas more compact. Results indicated that the North-West (NW) region demonstrated the most orderly urban growth, whereas the East region demonstrated the least.

TI  - The impact of post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology on quality of life: The sentinel experience of anger, hypervigilance and restricted affect
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is unclear which specific symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are related to poor perceived quality of life. Objective: To investigate the influence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology on quality of life in traumatic injury survivors. Method: Traumatic injury survivors completed questionnaires on post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology and quality of life at 3 months (n = 987), 12 months (n = 862), 24 months (n = 830) and 6 years (n = 613) post trauma. Results: Low quality of life was reported by 14.5% of injury survivors at 3 months and 8% at 6 years post event. The post-traumatic stress disorder symptom clusters that contributed most to poor perceived quality of life were numbing and arousal, the individual symptoms that contributed most were anger, hypervigilance and restricted affect. Conclusions: There was variability in the quality of life of traumatic injury survivors in the 6 years following trauma and a consistent proportion reported low quality of life. Early intervention to reduce anger, hypervigilance and restricted affect symptoms may provide a means to improving the quality of life of traumatic injury survivors.

AB  - This article compares the collective commemoration of martyrs to ascertain changes in cultural understandings of the relationship between the ultimate sacrifice offered by an individual and monarchal violence. This historical comparison is used to argue that changes in the nature of Christianity transformed the popular interpretation of sovereign violence from a desecrative to a redemptive force. While cultural individualism and political statism appear in secularized modernity as contradictory impulses, their birth in early modernity was induced by coherent and entirely consistent religious worldview.

TI  - Active-Passive Spaceborne Data Fusion for Mapping Nearshore Bathymetry
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - "In anticipation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ICESat-2 mission, which will employ the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a 532 nm photon-counting Light Detection and Ranging (lidar), we demonstrate a spaceborne data-fusion approach that has the potential to significantly shrink the global nearshore data gap often referred to as the "white ribbon". Bathymetry algorithms relying on multispectral imagery are conventionally limited by the availability of in situ reference depths, particularly in remote or difficult-to-map areas. Therefore, a completely spaceborne approach could greatly extend the usefulness of such algorithms. The approach is tested with data from NASA's airborne ICESat-2 ATLAS simulator, Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), and passive optical imagery from Landsat-8 using an existing spectral-ratio algorithm. The output bathymetric data set agrees with high-resolution Fugro LADS MK II bathymetric data to within an RMS difference of 1.1 m. The spatiotemporal variability of areas where this spaceborne data-fusion approach will potentially be useful is evaluated, based on worldwide coastal water clarity as interpreted from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Kd(490) data.

AB  - Poor communication is a leading cause of sentinel events. The aims of this pilot study were to determine whether the ISBAR (Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation) Interprofessional Communication Rubric (IICR) was a reliable tool among nurses and to examine the communication performance of new graduate nurses in a hospital-based simulation center. The IICR demonstrated reliability among raters in this setting (r(s) = .91). The new graduate RNs' communication performance scores were low, warranting continued professional development. The IICR may be used to guide continued education and development for nurse-physician communication.

TI  - Remote sensing based yield monitoring: Application to winter wheat in United States and Ukraine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop yield forecasts are critical for making informed agricultural policies and investments, as well as increasing market efficiency and stability. Earth observation data from space can contribute to agricultural monitoring, including crop yield assessment and forecasting. In this study, we present a new crop yield model based on the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 1 km resolution and the un-mixing of DVI at coarse resolution to a pure wheat signal (100% of wheat within the pixel). The model was applied to estimate the national and subnational winter wheat yield in the United States and Ukraine from 2001 to 2017. The model at the subnational level shows very good performance for both countries with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.7 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of lower than 0.6 t/ha (15-18%). At the national level for the United States (US) and Ukraine the model provides a strong coefficient of determination of 0.81 and 0.86, respectively, which demonstrates good performance at this scale. The model was also able to capture low winter wheat yields during years with extreme weather events, for example 2002 in US and 2003 in Ukraine. The RMSE of the model for the US at the national scale is 0.11 t/ha (3.7%) while for Ukraine it is 0.27 t/ha (8.4%).

TI  - Triple-site radiotracer application in breast lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node discordance
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) has demonstrated accuracy in the axillary staging of breast cancer patients. Despite variability in selection criteria and technique, an SLN is consistently identified in approximately 96% of cases and in most series predicts the status of remaining axillary LNs in >95% of cases. The false-negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was originally reported as 5%-10% (sensitivity 90%-95%), but improved rates are attainable by experienced surgeons. Radiolocalization with lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) increases SLN identification rates. LSG is a useful tool to establish the abnormal lymphatic drainage patterns and to detect the extra-axillary nodes, particularly internal mammary nodes. Despite controversy regarding the optimal injection method, studies have generally suggested high concordance between the various radiotracer application sites and axillary SLN identification. Discordant SLN identification would have implications for nodal staging as the true SLN might not be identified with individual injection techniques. In the current study, imaging from consecutive patients presenting for breast LSG over a-19 month period was retrospectively reviewed. Radiotracer application was performed with simultaneous injection of peritumoral, subcutaneous, and subareolar regions. This application method provided a mechanism to assess the LSG drainage patterns with a view to assessing injection site concordance and SLN identification rates. Data from 123 breast LSG patients were reviewed. Using our radiotracer technique, the axillary SLN identification rate was 98%. A single axillary node was detected in 110, two axillary nodes were detected in 10, and no axillary node was detected in three patients. Among those 10 patients in whom two axillary nodes were seen, at least two cases of discordant drainage occurred from different injection sites. This study demonstrates that different LSG injection sites can result in the identification of different axillary sentinel nodes although this appears to be a rare event. This finding may be of clinical importance if the true SLN is sought. In addition, the multisite injection technique appears to be an optimal method of axillary SLN identification, with high SLN detection rates.

TI  - System justification: Experimental evidence, its contextual nature, and implications for social change
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We review conceptual and empirical contributions to system justification theory over the last fifteen years, emphasizing the importance of an experimental approach and consideration of context. First, we review the indirect evidence of the system justification motive via complimentary stereotyping. Second, we describe injunctification as direct evidence of a tendency to view the extant status quo (the way things are) as the way things should be. Third, we elaborate on system justification's contextual nature and the circumstances, such as threat, dependence, inescapability, and system confidence, which are likely to elicit defensive bolstering of the status quo and motivated ignorance of critical social issues. Fourth, we describe how system justification theory can increase our understanding of both resistance to and acceptance of social change, as a change moves from proposed, to imminent, to established. Finally, we discuss how threatened systems shore up their authority by co-opting legitimacy from other sources, such as governments that draw on religious concepts, and the role of institutional-level factors in perpetuating the status quo.

TI  - Evaluation and Analysis of AMSR2 and FY3B Soil Moisture Products by an In Situ Network in Cropland on Pixel Scale in the Northeast of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An in situ soil moisture observation network at pixel scale is constructed in cropland in the northeast of China for accurate regional soil moisture evaluations of satellite products. The soil moisture products are based on the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithm and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and the products from the FengYun-3B (FY3B) satellite are evaluated using synchronous in situ data collected by the EC-5 sensors at the surface in a typical cropland in the northeast of China during the crop-growing season from May to September 2017. The results show that the JAXA product provides an underestimation with a bias (b) of -0.094 cm(3)/cm(3), and the LPRM soil moisture product generates an overestimation with a b of 0.156 cm(3)/cm(3). However the LPRM product shows a better correlation with the in situ data, especially in the early experimental period when the correlation coefficient is 0.654, which means only the JAXA product in the early stage, with an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.049 cm(3)/cm(3) and a b of -0.043 cm(3)/cm(3), reaches the goal accuracy (+/- 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3)). The FY3B has consistently obtained microwave brightness temperature data, but its soil moisture product data in the study area is seriously missing during most of the experimental period. However, it recovers in the later period and is closer to the in situ data than the JAXA and LPRM products. The three products show totally different trends with vegetation cover, soil temperature, and actual soil moisture itself in different time periods. The LPRM product is more sensitive and correlated with the in situ data, and is less susceptible to interferences. The JAXA is numerically closer to the in situ data, but the results are still affected by temperature. Both will decrease in accuracy as the actual soil moisture increases. The FY3B seems to perform better at the end of the whole period after data recovery.

TI  - Responses of Vegetation Productivity to Temperature Trends Over Continental United States From MODIS Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation growth and productivity may record signals of global climate change since vegetation is sensitive to modifications in climatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation. Significant changes in vegetation growth and productivity can affect the exchange of energy, water vapor, and momentum between the land surface and atmosphere. Despite consensus on the vegetation growth enhancement by the warming of temperature, little attention has been given to the understanding of the impacts of cooling temperature trends on vegetation growth and productivity. Based on satellite-derived land surface temperatures and vegetation indices, this study shows that alternating temperature trends are more reasonable than a monotonic temperature trend for the study period from 2003 to 2016. More importantly, results reveal that both warming and cooling temperature trends can have a positive impact on vegetation growth over the continental United States. These findings are of importance to understand global carbon cycle sinks and sources accurately in different regions.

TI  - Comparison of Surface Water Volume Estimation Methodologies That Couple Surface Reflectance Data and Digital Terrain Models
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty about global change requires alternatives to quantify the availability of water resources and their dynamics. A methodology based on different satellite imagery and surface elevation models to estimate surface water volumes would be useful to monitor flood events and reservoir storages. In this study, reservoirs with associated digital terrain models (DTM) and continuously monitored volumes were selected. The inundated extent was based on a supervised classification using surface reflectance in Landsat 5 images. To estimate associated water volumes, the DTMs were sampled at the perimeter of inundated areas and an inverse distance weighting interpolation was used to populate the water elevation inside the flooded polygons. The developed methodology (IDW) was compared against different published methodologies to estimate water volumes from digital elevation models, which assume either a flat water surface using the maximum elevation of inundated areas (Max), and a flat water surface using the median elevation of the perimeter of inundated areas (Median), or a tilted surface, where water elevations are based on an iterative focal maximum statistic with increasing window sizes (FwDET), and finally a tilted water surface obtained by replacing the focal maximum statistic from the FwDET methodology with a focal mean statistic (FwDET_mean). Volume estimates depend strongly on both water detection and the terrain model. The Max and the FwDET methodologies are highly affected by the water detection step, and the FwDET_mean methodology leads to lower volume estimates due to the iterative smoothing of elevations, which also tends to be computationally expensive for big areas. The Median and IDW methodologies outperform the rest of the methods, and IDW can be used for both reservoir and flood volume monitoring. Different sources of error can be observed, being systematic errors associated with the DTM acquisition time and the reported volumes, which for example fail to consider dynamic sedimentation processes taking place in reservoirs. Resolution effects account for a fraction of errors, being mainly caused by terrain curvature.

TI  - Assessing Orinoco river sediment discharge trend using MODIS satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to derive the Surface Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSSC) and river sediment discharge (for the period 2000-2016) along the Orinoco River reaches using MODIS remote sensing data. A single SSC retrieval algorithm was calibrated using HYBAM long term monitoring program data (n = 183). The comparison of satellite and field measurements showed a RMSE of 32%, corresponding to a mean absolute error of 21 mg l(-1). These results supported the use of MODIS sensors to monitor the SSSC at six virtual stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Orinoco River. The highest mean SSSC were found downstream of the Meta River (101 mg l(-1)) and of the Apure River (99 mg l(-1)), which provide the major sediment input to the Orinoco main stream. The lowest mean SSSC was found upstream of the Meta River (42 mg l(-1)). In the lower reach, at Ciudad Bolivar station we assessed a mean SSSC of 88 mg l(-1).MODIS-derived and ground-derived assessments of the annual sediment discharge show very fine agreement, within -2%. Coupling satellite-derived SSSC estimates and river discharge monitoring data, we calculated the Orinoco River sediment discharge at Ciudad Bolivar station between 2001 and 2016. For a mean Orinoco River discharge of 33,320 m3.s(-1), the sediment loads varied from 75 to 103 Mt.yr(-1), with a mean value of 89 Mt.yr-1 (RSD of 9%) corresponding to a sediment yield of 91-125 t.km(-2)yr-1 with no positive or negative trends over the observed period.

TI  - Exposure of yellow-legged gulls to <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> along the Western Mediterranean coasts: Tales from a sentinel
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficiently tracking and anticipating the dynamics of infectious agents in wild populations requires the gathering of large numbers of samples, if possible at several locations and points in time, which can be a challenge for some species. Testing for the presence of specific maternal antibodies in egg yolks sampled on the colonies could represent an efficient way to quantify the exposure of breeding females to infectious agents, particularly when using an abundant and widespread species, such as the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). We used such an approach to explore spatio-temporal patterns of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, a pathogenic protozoan responsible of toxoplasmosis in humans and other warm-blooded vertebrates. First, we tested the validity of this approach by exploring the repeatability of the detection of specific antibodies at the egg level using two different immunoassays and at the clutch level using an occupancy model. Then, samples gathered in 15 colonies from France, Spain and Tunisia were analysed using an immunoassay detecting antibodies specifically directed against T. gondii. Prevalence of specific antibodies in eggs was overall high while varying significantly among colonies. These results revealed that T. gondii circulated at a large spatial scale in the western Mediterranean yellow-legged gull population, highlighting its potential role in the maintenance community of this parasite. Additionally, this study illustrates how species commensal to human populations like large gulls can be used as wildlife sentinels for the tracking of infectious agents at the human-wildlife interface, notably by sampling eggs.

TI  - The decline of axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer. Evolution of its indication over the last 20 years
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In last 20 years, lymph node staging procedures in breast cancer have been modified. The objective of this study is to describe the evolution of these procedures at our hospital.Methods: A prospective observational study that included women with breast cancer who were treated surgically between 2001 and 2017. Four groups were identified according to the therapeutic regimen and 3 study periods defined by the lymph node dissection.Results: 1319 patients met the inclusion criteria. Primary conservative surgery was the most frequent therapy (54.13%), and 615 (46.62%) axillary lymph node dissections (ALND) were performed in the 20-year study period. The percentage of ALND decreased progressively over time, going from 91% in the first period to 34% in the last period. The futile ALND fell to 6.6% in the last year. In the primary conservative surgery, no futile ALND was performed in the last two years.Conclusion: The introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy and the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria have modified the indication for ALND. Thus, ALND without involvement have been reduced, thereby avoiding the associated morbidity. The study demonstrates the progressive decrease in the indication of lymphadenectomy in the different study groups, similar to reports by other authors. Several clinical trials have described that these changes have not negatively impacted survival. (C) 2019 AEC. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting wheat grain yield and spatial variability at field scale using a simple regression or a crop model in conjunction with Landsat images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early prediction of crop yields has been a challenge frequently resolved through the combination of remote sensing data and crop models. The aim of this study was to evaluate two different methods based on remote sensing data for predicting winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield at field scale. We compared the accuracy of: (i) a simple regression method between different vegetation indices at anthesis and grain yield, and (ii) a crop model method based on optimization of two parameters (specific leaf nitrogen and initial aboveground-biomass) using time series of vegetation indices. Vegetation indices were derived from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images acquired for two growing seasons (2013, 2014) across 22 fields in south western Uruguay with an average size of 128 ha. At all sites, leaf area index (LAI) was measured during a field campaign, and grain yield was measured with yield monitors on harvesters. The simple regression method (SRM) achieved higher accuracy than the model-based method (CMM) for the estimation of yield at field scale (RMSE = 966 kg ha(-1) and RMSE = 1532 kg ha(-1), respectively). When deviations between observed and estimated yields were evaluated at pixel (30 x 30 m) level, the model-based method was better at detecting existing spatial variability in grain yield and at identifying areas of different yield potential. Even though both methods have limited utility to estimate yield at field scale with very high accuracy due to large RMSE, the methodologies are suitable to predict harvest volumes at large agricultural areas or at country level, and to construct synthetic yield maps reflecting within field variability. Higher temporal resolution of images would improve accuracy in estimating yield and spatial variability at field scale.

AB  - Background We report the performance of a gene expression profile test to classify the recurrence risk of cutaneous melanoma tumors of the head and neck as low-risk Class 1 or high-risk Class 2.Methods Of note, 157 primary head and neck cutaneous melanoma tumors were identified. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods.Results Gene expression profile class and node status stratified tumors into significantly different 5-year survival groups by Kaplan-Meier method (P < .0001 for all end points), and both were independent predictors of recurrence in multivariate analysis. Overall, 74% of distant metastases and 88% of melanoma-specific deaths had Class 2 risk.Conclusion The gene expression profile test identifies cases at increased risk for metastasis and death independent of a clinically or pathologically negative nodal status, suggesting that incorporation of this molecular tool could improve clinical management of patients with head and neck cutaneous melanoma, especially in those with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Combining primary care surveillance and a meta-analysis to estimate the incidence of the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in Belgium, 2015-2017
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyme borreliosis (LB) is an important tick-borne disease which can cause a broad range of symptoms mainly affecting the skin, the nervous system and the joints. This study aims to estimate the incidence of the different clinical manifestations of LB in Belgium. The incidence of erythema migrans (EM) was estimated through the network of sentinel general practices at 97.6/100,000 inhabitants (uncertainty interval [UI] 82.0-113.0) for the period 2015-2017. This result was used to estimate the incidence of other LB manifestations based on their proportional distribution (ratios) to EM reported in the neighboring countries of Belgium. To estimate these ratios, we performed a systematic review of studies published between February 1, 2008 and January 31, 2018 and pooled the results using a random effects meta-analysis. Six studies were retained in the systematic review, and the meta-analysis estimated the occurrence ratios for Lyme neuroborreliosis/EM, Lyme arthritis/EM and other manifestations/EM at 0.024 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.016-0.037), 0.022 (95% CI 0.020-0.024) and 0.014 (95% CI 0.012-0.016) respectively. Applying these ratios to the EM incidence in Belgium resulted in an incidence estimation of 2.4/100,000 inhabitants (95% UI 1.5-3.7) for Lyme neuroborreliosis, 2.1/100,000 (95% UI 1.7-2.6) for Lyme arthritis and 1.4/100,000 (95% UI 1.1-1.7) for other less frequent manifestations. Some of these LB manifestations, other than EM, are more severe, hence these estimates are essential to assess the health burden and economic cost of LB which would be highly relevant for patients, healthcare providers and policymakers. As both over-and underestimation of different clinical LB manifestations remain possible due to characteristics of the primary surveillance systems and the disease itself, future studies to validate these estimates would be of great value.

TI  - A Hybrid Approach to Super-Resolution Mapping of Remotely Sensed Multi-spectral Satellite Images Using Genetic Algorithm and Hopfield Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Though super-resolution mapping of multi-spectral remote sensing satellite images is used to locate the multiple classes within a mixed pixel, it has limitations, for example, low rate of convergence leading to low accuracy and higher time consumption. This paper demonstrates a hybrid approach of genetic algorithm and Hopfield neural network which can not only speed up the process but also identify the exact global optimal solution using super-resolution mapping. The experiments are carried out for Landsat ETM+image of different dimensions (10x10, 25x25, 64x64, 128x128 and 256x256) and with map sizes of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Map size indicates the number of all sub-pixels which are resolved from a pixel. The overall accuracy is 89.44%, 90.25%, 91.09%, 92.56%, and 93.62%, respectively, for map sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thus showing an increase of nearly 2% accuracy for hybrid genetic algorithm. The time taken was also reduced by half of that for the genetic algorithm. Thus, the efficiency of this novel approach to map land cover classes in a coarse pixel with greater accuracy and appreciably lesser time has been demonstrated.

AB  - The therapeutic management of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer has seen a remarkable change in the past 2 decades. Clinical trials have refined our knowledge regarding the biology of the disease including the prognostic significance of disease in the regional lymph nodes. The contemporary management of lymph nodes is also influenced by advances in surgical technique, radiation oncology delivery systems, and effective systemic therapy regimens.

TI  - A geo-archaeological approach to the study of hydro-agricultural systems in arid areas of Western Syria
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 30 years, geoarchaeological surveys undertaken in the Near East have offered a powerful way of studying, inter alia, water supply systems at a microregional to regional scale. However, efforts to synthesize the results of surveys at a sub-continental scale in order to understand local differences and similarities, and compare local strategies through time, require specific tools. In this paper, we develop a methodology designed to characterize and facilitate comparison of strategies employed across the arid areas of Western Syria. This requires microregional field studies undertaken at the level of specific landscapes to be integrated within a wider GIS framework, based upon thematic layers (soils, rainfalls, hydrology) at a uniform spatial scale of assessment (in this case the pixel of a Landsat image), and a common description of the agronomic potential in those areas in which specific hydraulic installations were employed. In contrast to the usual practice of modelling, which depends upon the downscaling of environmental data (land cover, rainfall maps) generated at a continental scale, we stress here the need to generalize upwards, from observations made at the microregional level, by using common descriptors and qualitative indicators. The GIS analysis of these data provides a weighted average model derived from field evidence for the different technical choices made (i.e. the decision to utilize specific water management devices) in relation to the various agronomic landscapes.

TI  - A Modified Local Binary Pattern Descriptor for SAR Image Matching
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image matching is an important step which is taken in most applications of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this letter, a method is proposed for SAR image matching which introduces a modified local binary pattern (LBP) as a descriptor. Multitextural feature LBP (MTF-LBP) uses the gray-level cooccurrence matrix to increase image texture information. MTF-LBP creates bit plane for each point candidate for matching. Then, using hamming distance, true matches are determined. Experiments are conducted on four spaceborne SAR image pairs including Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X, ALOS-PALSAR, and Sentinel-1. The proposed method is compared with five common LBP approaches. The results indicate that the proposed method has a better performance in terms of the number of true matches.

TI  - Demystifying the Capability of Sublook Correlation Techniques for Vessel Detection in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the attainable performance of various Doppler sublook or subband cross correlation techniques for vessel detection in synthetic aperture radar images. Research from the past two decades claims that these techniques were capable of improving the detection of small ships in challenging maritime environments. Despite many published experimental examples, a thorough analytical investigation corroborating this claim is noticeably absent. This paper is based on a rigorous theoretical analysis founded on the statistical properties of a textured sea surface model in thermal noise with simultaneous consideration of a constant false alarm rate. Emphasis has been placed on the correct accounting for detrimental physical effects caused by the Doppler spectrum being split into nonoverlapping parts, which have not been sufficiently considered in the literature to date. The theoretical results are confirmed via simulations and are substantiated with real RADARSAT-2 data. The analysis in this paper has neither found theoretical nor empirical evidence that sublook correlation techniques outperform the classical detector based on the image magnitude.

TI  - Detection of waste dumping locations in landfill using multi-temporal Landsat thermal images
T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The disposal of solid waste in a conventional landfill is inevitably associated with potential adverse environmental impacts, resulting in the migration of landfill gas and offensive odors on the surrounding areas. In addition to the obnoxious fumes and hazardous leachate, heat generation is continuously observed within the landfill during the aerobic and anaerobic phases. Despite the negative impacts, such "heat generation" phenomenon can turn into valuable information to aid in detecting unauthorized landfill activities and tracing unrecorded dumping regions. The spatial distribution of waste buried under the ground can be approximated and revealed through measuring the ground surface heat flux. In this study, we demonstrate how to utilize thermal remote sensing techniques to measure the land surface temperature (LST), which can aid in outlining the waste dumping regions within a landfill. The Jeleeb Al-Shuyoukh landfill, located in Kuwait, was used to demonstrate the proposed method, where the record of the exact dumping location was missing during the Gulf war. Ten-year Landsat Thematic Mapper(TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images (1985-1994) were acquired and processed in order to compute the LST within the landfill. Through combining the multi-temporal LST contours and overlay analysis, the most probable dumping regions within the landfill were outlined. A probability map was created to indicate the possible location of waste dumping within the studied landfill. With reference to the 50 boreholes drilled by the Environmental Protection Authority of Kuwait, our results derived during the summer and winter seasons both yielded an overall accuracy of 72%.

TI  - Rethinking Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance: A Role for Lot Quality Assurance Sampling
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a key component of the 68th World Health Assembly Global Action Plan on AMR. Laboratory-based surveillance is inherently biased and lacks local relevance due to aggregation of data. We assessed the feasibility, sensitivity, and affordability of a population-based AMR survey using lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS), which classifies a population as having a high or low prevalence of AMR based on a priori defined criteria. Three studies were carried out in Medan and Bandung, Indonesia, between April 2014 and June 2017. LQAS classifications for 15 antibiotics were compared with AMR estimates from a conventional population-based survey, with an assessment of the cost of a single LQAS classification using microcosting methodology, among patients suspected of urinary tract infection at 11 sites in Indonesia. The sensitivity of LQAS was above 98%. The approach detected local variation in the prevalence of AMR across sites. Time to reach LQAS results ranged from 47 to 138 days. The average cost of an LQAS classification in a single facility was US$466. The findings indicate that LQAS-based AMR survey is a feasible, sensitive, and affordable strategy for population-based AMR surveys, providing essential data to inform local empirical treatment guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

TI  - <i>SegOptim</i>-A new R package for optimizing object-based image analyses of high-spatial resolution remotely-sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) is increasingly used to process high-spatial resolution imagery, with applications ranging from single species detection to habitat and land cover mapping. Image segmentation plays a key role in GEOBIA workflows, allowing to partition images into homogenous and mutually exclusive regions. Nonetheless, segmentation techniques require a robust parameterization to achieve the best results. Frequently, inappropriate parameterization leads to sub-optimal results and difficulties in comparing distinct methods.Here, we present an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize image segmentation parameters by using the performance scores from object-based classification, thus allowing to assess the adequacy of a segmented image in relation to the classification problem. This approach was implemented in a new R package called SegOptim, in which several segmentation algorithms are interfaced, mostly from open-source software (GRASS GIS, Orfeo Toolbox, RSGISLib, SAGA GIS, TerraLib), but also from proprietary software (ESRI ArcGIS). SegOptim also provides access to several machine-learning classification algorithms currently available in R, including Gradient Boosted Modelling, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest.We tested our approach using very-high to high spatial resolution images collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (0.03-0.10 m), WorldView-2 (2 m), RapidEye (5 m) and Sentinel-2 (10-20 m) in six different test sites located in northern Portugal with varying environmental conditions and for different purposes, including invasive species detection and land cover mapping. The results highlight the added value of our novel comparison of image segmentation and classification algorithms. Overall classification performances (assessed through cross-validation with the Kappa index) ranged from 0.85 to 1.00. Pilot-tests show that our GA-based approach is capable of providing sound results for optimizing the parameters of different segmentation algorithms, with benefits for classification accuracy and for comparison across techniques. We also verified that no particular combination of an image segmentation and a classification algorithm is suited for all the tasks/objectives. Consequently, it is crucial to compare and optimize available methods to understand which one is more suited for a certain objective.Our approach allows a closer integration between the segmentation and classification stages, which is of high importance for GEOBIA workflows. The results from our tests confirm that this integration has benefits for comparing and optimizing both processes. We discuss some limitations of the SegOptim approach (and potential solutions) as well as a future roadmap to expand its current functionalities.

TI  - Latex agglutination test for rapid on-site serodiagnosis of Japanese encephalitis in pigs using recombinant NS1 antigen
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & objectives: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquitoe-bome viral zoonotic disease and globally around three billion people are at the risk of disease. The occurrence of JE cases has shown a rising trend during last decade in India. Pig is the amplifying host for JE virus and serves as a suitable sentinel model for the prediction of disease outbreak in humans. The development of a diagnostic test that is suitable for surveillance of JE in pigs is the need of the hour. The existing tests require elaborate laboratory facilities which make their application in rural settings difficult. Therefore, realizing the need for a rapid test, efforts were made to standardize a latex agglutination test (LAT) for serodiagnosis of JE in pigs.Methods: Standardization of LAT by physical adsorption of recombinant NS1 (non-structural) protein of JE virus onto latex beads was done by altering six different variables, namely the antigen concentration, sensitization condition, surface blocking agent, blocking condition, particle concentration and reaction time. The standardized latex-protein complex was used for screening 246 pig serum samples under optimal conditions.Results: The test was standardized with a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 82.24 and 87.83%, respectively. Screening of 246 field pig serum samples using standardized LAT showed a seropositivity of 50.4%. The results were available within 5 min after addition of test serum sample to the sensitized beads.Interpretation & conclusion: The findings of the study highlight the potential of LAT as a rapid on-site assay for JE diagnosis in pigs which would aid in predicting JE outbreaks in humans.

TI  - Short-latency monitoring of continental, ocean- and atmospheric mass variations using GRACE intersatellite accelerations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - GRACE K-band intersatellite range observations have been processed in combination with precise orbit trajectories from reduced dynamic modelling and GNSS processing. These data have been inverted to mass equivalent quantities (water heights) by using physically motivated constraints in order to reduce well-known instabilities. In a first instance, the satellite observations are reduced using geophysical background modelling and implicitly continued downward using a rigorous formulation in terms of reproducing kernel functions which map time variable mass variations from Earth's fluid envelops to remotely sensed observations. The space-wise observation equations are well suited for a Kalman-filter measurement update approach which enables an enhanced temporal resolution of subweekly to daily time-series. For stochastic signal prediction and process model derivation, spatio-temporal correlations of mean hydrological and atmospheric signals have been used. It is shown that the GRACE dynamic measurements are converted to in situ observables, thus facilitating the combination with other data sources such as, for example higher resolution remote sensing data and/or available ground data. Through the consideration of full signal and measurement error covariances in a Kalman filter process, the effects of aliasing from poorly modelled or insufficiently available background information can be mitigated. We present the theoretical rational of the method, together with results for daily Kalman filtered solutions, for the full duration of the GRACE mission and numerical tests and comparisons to available operational GRACE products and inundation volumes. Finally, the major findings of these computations are listed.

TI  - Semantic Characterization of Adaptive Learning Objects using a Task Ontology
T2  - CIENCIA E INGENIERIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The incorporation of e-learning as an alternative paradigm to traditional education requires the development of tools that facilitate the teaching-learning process and the utilization of learning resources increasingly adjusted to the needs of the user. Among the learning resources are the Adaptive Learning Objects (ALO), which consist of Learning Objects (LO) with adaptability. In this sense, the goal of this work is semantically characterize ALOs, in order to conceptualize them and facilitate their implementation. For the modeling, the ODA methodology (Ontology-Driven Architecture) has been used. As a result, an ontology of tasks was designed that integrates the Rule, Metadata and OAA ontologies, in order to semantically characterize ALOs.

TI  - Surface albedo and reflectance: Review of definitions, angular and spectral effects, and intercomparison of major data sources in support of advanced solar irradiance modeling over the Americas
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This study defines albedo and reflectance in the context of solar applications. It examines the main sources of surface albedo data that can be used to help solar irradiance modeling efforts, such as undertaken by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) over the Americas, for instance, per the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The MODIS-based albedo database, as used as input to derive historical time series of solar irradiance in the current version of the NSRDB, is compared to other sources of global gridded data over the Americas in general and some specific areas in particular. The particular role of snow cover is analyzed. It is found that, in the current MODIS-based NSRDB implementation, snow-impacted areas have been assigned a too high albedo in general because of the lack of consideration for the antagonistic effect of surface roughness, among other factors. Other albedo databases, such as CMSAF, MINES-ParisTech or the ERAS reanalysis, do not display such high albedos at latitudes above approximate to 40 degrees N. The gap-free and snow-free MODIS MCD43GF product is found affected by a long-term downward trend over some areas and out-of-phase seasonal effects over other areas, in comparison with MERRA-2 reanalysis data in particular. Comparisons with actual albedo measurements at the arid Desert Rock site in Nevada also show that albedo data derived from land surface models are affected by systematic bias. Five albedo databases are intercompared for the area around Ivanpah Playa, California, which has great importance in both remote sensing and solar applications. Various aspects of the proper usage of albedo data in solar radiation modeling are discussed, regarding calculations of both the backscattering process and reflections on a tilted surface: spatial resolution, temporal resolution, angular effects, and spectral effects. An important distinction is made between the use of albedo data at approximate to 41cm resolution for backscattering calculations and at approximate to 10 m resolution for transposition calculations to tilted planes, which might additionally require spectral information for monofacial or bifacial PV applications. It is shown that the tilted calculations usually performed in solar resource assessments are far from realistic in the case of most large-scale PV applications, for which a more suitable methodological approach is described. For such needs, the limitations of the current sources of high-resolution reflectance data are discussed. The impact of surface albedo estimation errors on the estimation of backscattered irradiance over snowy areas is evaluated. It is found non-negligible, and even large under cloudy conditions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of heat fluxes in Beijing with land use change from 1997 to 2017
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is meaningful to explore the influence of land use change on urban thermal environment for urban sustainable development and city livability improvement etc. Based on one pixel component arranging comparing algorithm (PCACA), this study estimates three instantaneous heat fluxes of Beijing city from meteorological data and the NDVI, land surface temperature (LST), and albedo products retrieved from Landsat data on September 21, 1997, September 22, 2009 and September 28, 2017. Then the temporal and spatial variation in the heat fluxes of the Beijing with land use change is discussed. The following key points have been found: 1) LST and heat fluxes have distinctly spatial heterogeneity, and significant differences between mountainous and plain areas, and among different land use types in plain area; 2) both LST and heat fluxes have a consistent order of arrangement for different land use types at different times. Forest has the highest latent heat flux (LHF) with an average of 265.7 W/m(2), followed by cropland and grassland, and building land has the smallest average of 158.4 W/m(2). LST has the reverse order, cropland has the highest average of 24.8 degrees C, followed by grassland and cropland, water body has the lowest average of 19.2 degrees C; 3) temporally, urban thermal fluxes vary greatly with land use transition. LHF and sensible heat flux (SHF) will respectively drastically reduce and increase when natural surface changes into building land. These analyses suggest that green spaces play an important role in easing urban heat environment.

TI  - Remote sensing phenology of <i>Larix chinensis</i> forest in response to climate change in Qinling Mountains
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species at alpine timberline are sensitive to climate change, which are ideal species for studying climate change and phenological change. Based on the double Logistic curve fitting method, we reconstructed the MODIS EVI2 time series images from 2000 to 2015 and extracted key phenological parameters of Larix chinensis forest, combined with climatic data of the Taibai Mountain meteorological station, and analyzed the phenology of the L. chinensis forest and its responses to climate factors. From 2000 to 2015, the beginning time of growing period of L. chinensis forest was on about 120th day, and the ending time of growth period was on about 288th day, with an average growing period of 168 days. The rate of change was -0.65 d . 10 a(-1) at the beginning of the growing season with an advanced trend, and it was 0.35 d . 10 a(-1) at the end of the growing season with a delayed trend, with a delayed trend of 0.99 d . 10 a(-1) for the whole growing season. The areas with negative correlation between the start phenophase of L. chinensis forest and the temperature and precipitation in the same period accounted for 73. 11% and 61.25% of the study area, respectively, while the areas with positive correlation between the start phenophase and the potential evapotranspiration accounted for 65.17% of the study area. The end of phenophase was positively correlated with temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, sunshine and wind speed in the same period, with area rates of 74.91%, 72. 87%, 78.14%, 68.60% and 64.74%, respectively. Temperature was the major factor affecting the advance of the phenological stage of L. chinensis forest, while temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were the major factors affecting the late phenology.

TI  - An Analysis of the Discontinuity in Chinese Radiosonde Temperature Data Using Satellite Observation as a Reference
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconciling upper-air temperature trends derived from radiosonde and satellite observations is a necessary step to confidently determine the global warming rate. This study examines the raw and homogenized radiosonde observations over China and compares them with layer-mean atmospheric temperatures derived from satellite microwave observations for the lower-troposphere (TLT), mid-troposphere (TMT), upper-troposphere (TUT), and lower-stratosphere (TLS) by three research groups. Comparisons are for averages over China, excluding the Tibetan Plateau, and at individual stations where metadata contain information on radiosonde instrument changes. It is found that major differences between the satellite and radiosonde observations are related to artificial systematic changes. The radiosonde system updates in the early 2000s over China caused significant discontinuities and led the radiosonde temperature trends to exhibit less warming in the middle and upper troposphere and more cooling in the lower stratosphere than satellite temperatures. Homogenized radiosonde data have been further adjusted by using the shift-point adjustment approaches to match with satellite products for China averages. The obtained trends during 1979-2015 from the re-adjusted radiosonde observation are respectively 0.203 +/- 0.066, 0.128 +/- 0.044, 0.034 +/- 0.039, and -0.329 +/- 0.135 K decade(-1) for TLT, TMT, TUT, and TLS equivalents. Compared to satellite trends, the re-adjusted radiosonde trends are within 0.01 K decade(-1) for TMT and TUT, 0.054 K decade(-1) warmer for TLT, and 0.051 K decade(-1) cooler for TLS. The results suggest that the use of satellite data as a reference is helpful in identifying and removing inhomogeneities of radiosonde temperatures over China and reconciling their trends to satellite microwave observations. Future efforts are to homogenize radiosonde temperatures at individual stations over China by using similar approaches.

TI  - Analysis of cooling effect of water bodies on land surface temperature in nearby region: A case study of Ahmedabad and Chandigarh cities in India
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Erratic and unplanned development of the urban area has posed a threat to the environment in a country like India where the development is haphazard mostly. Congested and unsustainable planning, reduction in green covers and increased emissions from industries and vehicles have given birth to many climatic issues. One such issue is land surface temperature (LST) variations giving rise to Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. This study evaluates and provides direct evidence with the help of remote sensing technique about how stream water features affect the temperature variation in urban areas where the land use condition is very distinct. Surface water bodies present in an area are responsible for prospective cooling through evaporation thereby reducing the heating effect. Landsat images of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011of 30-meter resolution has been processed to produce the LST of the study areas. Water bodies, i.e., Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh and Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad are the research points to find the variation in microclimate developed near these water bodies. An appreciable average temperature dip of 7.51 degrees C and 3.12 degrees C is observed during summer and winter, respectively for three years near the Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh city. An average dip of about 1.57 degrees C and 1.71 degrees C is observed during summer and winter, respectively on the right bank of Sabarmati river up to an influence distance of about 200 to 300 m. The average fall of temperature near the left bank is about 0.69 degrees C and 0.65 degrees C during summer and winter, respectively.

TI  - Estimating long-term LULC changes in an agriculture-dominated basin using CORONA (1970) and LISS IV (2013-14) satellite images: a case study of Ramganga River, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The basin of Ramganga River, a major tributary of Ganga, has seen rapid industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural growth in modern times, especially during and after the 1970s, with consequent changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) of the basin. Object-based classification of seldom-used CORONA images (for 1970) for historical LULC scenario and LISS IV (Resourcesat-2) images (for 2013-14) for the present scenario of the basin was performed with high overall accuracies of 93% and 87% and Kappa coefficients of 0.89 and 0.82 respectively. Object-based classification using the eCognition software tool combined with manual classification of the images revealed significant decrease in total forest cover (similar to 485km(2)) and riverbed (similar to 498km(2)) LULC classes along with correspondingly increased agriculture (similar to 898km(2)) and built-up (similar to 313km(2)) classes in the basin. Further, though Ramganga reservoir (spread over similar to 70km(2)), operated since in 1974, has increased the water area by similar to 1295% in Afzalgarh sub-basin of the Ramganga Basin, the overall area of water class decreased by 1.64% in the basin, probably due to loss of ponds in agricultural lands. An upward shift of about 42km in the confluence point of Ramganga and Gangan Rivers was also observed, which may be attributed to the course shift of Ramganga in a south-west direction.

TI  - Towards Predictive Modeling of Sorghum Biomass Yields Using Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation Derived from Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery and Supervised Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sorghum crop is grown under tropical and temperate latitudes for several purposes including production of health promoting food from the kernel and forage and biofuels from aboveground biomass. One of the concerns of policy-makers and sorghum growers is to cost-effectively predict biomass yields early during the cropping season to improve biomass and biofuel management. The objective of this study was to investigate if Sentinel-2 satellite images could be used to predict within-season biomass sorghum yields in the Mediterranean region. Thirteen machine learning algorithms were tested on fortnightly Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B estimates of the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) in combination with in situ aboveground biomass yields from demonstrative fields in Italy. A gradient boosting algorithm implementing the xgbtree method was the best predictive model as it was satisfactorily implemented anywhere from May to July. The best prediction time was the month of May followed by May-June and May-July. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first time Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR is used in sorghum biomass predictive modeling. The results from this study will help farmers improve their sorghum biomass business operations and policy-makers and extension services improve energy planning and avoid energy-related crises.

TI  - Time-lapse optical flow regularization for geophysical complex phenomena monitoring
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we introduce a framework for the tracking of geophysical complex phenomena via time-lapse images. It includes the regularization of the derived surface motion maps time series. The proposed processing chain addresses five main challenges: undesired camera movement, missing frames, important photometric changes, weak/repetitive texture and model-free dense spatial transformations. In the proposed framework the motion maps time series are obtained via robust pre-processing steps and optical flow computing. The contribution consists of regularizing the resulting velocity and position time series to minimize a temporal closure error in a subsequent stage. This step serves to alleviate the limitations of existing methods in the context of geophysical monitoring. The temporal closure errors are formulated as linear mappings to inverse using signal priors and two formulations are defined along with illustrative cases. Related methods are discussed and extensive experimentation on simulated datasets is carried out to validate the approach and compare between the different proposed formulations and resolution schemes. Experimental results are presented on time series acquired by ground-based cameras used for the monitoring of Alpine glaciers. The algorithm is computationally efficient, even considering the quantity of processed and generated data, and is run in parallel on multiple cores for speed-up.

AB  - Background/Aim: This study aimed to examine whether the semi-dry dot-blot (SDB) method can correctly identify metastasis to lymph nodes in colorectal cancer. Materials and Methods: A total of 200 dissected lymph nodes from 83 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery between November 2013 and May 2016 were examined. Each lymph node was first examined by SDB using anti-pancytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3). Pathological Stage I/II patients with a negative reaction were further analyzed by SDB using anti-cytokeratin 20 antibody (CK-20) to detect micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of SDB using AE1/AE3 were 91.3%, 100%, and 98.0%, respectively. Five of 99 lymph nodes of pathological Stage I/II patients had a negative reaction to AE1/AE3, but were positive to CK-20, while 3 showed isolated tumor cells. Conclusion: The SDB is a useful diagnostic tool to detect lymph node metastases in colorectal cancer.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Diagnosis is the key component in disease elimination to improve global health. However, there is a tremendous need for diagnostic innovation for neglected tropical diseases that largely consist of mosquito-borne infections and bacterial infections. Early diagnosis of these infectious diseases is critical but challenging because the biomarkers are present at low concentrations, demanding bioanalytical techniques that can deliver high sensitivity with ensured specificity. Owing to the plasmonic nanomaterials-enabled high detection sensitivities, even up to single molecules, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has gained attention as an optical analytical tool for early disease biomarker detection. In this mini-review, we highlight the SERS-based assay development tailored to detect key types of biomarkers for mosquito-borne and bacterial infections. We discuss in detail the variations of SERS-based techniques that have developed to afford qualitative and quantitative disease biomarker detection in a more accurate, affordable, and field-transferable manner. Current and emerging challenges in the advancement of SERS-based technologies from the proof-of-concept phase to the point-of-care phase are also briefly discussed.

TI  - Improved understanding of snowmelt runoff from the headwaters of China's Yangtze River using remotely sensed snow products and hydrological modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a crucial source of runoff in headwater regions, seasonal snowmelt plays an important role in ensuring water availability downstream, particularly during low flow periods. As the major constituent of China's water towers, the headwater region of the Yangtze River (HRYR) provides water to hundreds of millions of people downstream. Therefore, accurately simulating snowmelt is critical to developing a better understanding of the hydrological processes, which would, in turn, benefit water supply management, irrigation, hydropower generation, and ecological integrity over the HRYR and its lower reaches. However, it is a considerable challenge to conduct hydrological modeling for ungauged and poorly gauged headwater regions, owing to a lack of in situ measurements to appropriately constrain the model and evaluate its results. Satellite remote sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity to capture hydrological state variables globally, such as snow cover area (SCA) based on optical remote sensing and snow water equivalent (SWE) based on passive microwave remote sensing. This study simulates snow and glacier meltwater of the HRYR (above the Zhimenda gauging station), and quantifies proportional meltwater contributions to total runoff using multisource remote sensing data and a distributed hydrological model. We, for the first time ever, evaluate the snowmelt simulations based on the hydrological consistency among precipitation, air and land surface temperatures, and remotely sensed SWE/SCA. Results show that the snowmelt simulations using either SWE or SCA as a reference for calibrating parameters of the hydrological model are highly consistent, with snow and glacier meltwater contributing similar to 7% and similar to 5%, respectively, to the total runoff during 2003-2014. This study serves as a basis to simulate snowmelt to understand runoff generation and evolution under climate change across ungauged and poorly gauged headwater regions using multisource remote sensing data.

TI  - Comparison of AVHRR aerosol optical depth production against CARSNET data in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH

AB  - This study presents a dedicated evaluation of a newly released satellite aerosol product derived from Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) measurements by using the Deep Blue/SOAR aerosol retrieval algorithm. Aerosol product from the Chinese Aerosol Network (CARSNET) is used as the ground truth in the comparison. Comparison of AVHRR and CARSNET aerosol optical depth (AOD) products during 2006-2011 shows that the accuracy and precision of AVHRR AOD demonstrate complicated spatial and seasonal dependence. First, AVHRR AOD is in good agreement with CARSNET AOD over eastern urban areas in China. 45% -78% of data points fall within the expeCted error range ( +/- 0.05 +/- 0.25 x AOD) over there. Second, in regions with natural vegetation cover and relatively clean environment conditions, low correlation is observed due to small AOD loadings ( < 0.2 and < 0.6, respectively) and small AOD variations ( < 1.0). Third, for dust affected arid and semi-arid dry regions and western urban regions, AVHRR AOD products need further great improvement. A large regional variation of AOD bias with increasing CARSNET AOD may be due to insufficient representation of aerosol properties in the algorithm. The systematic underestimation of AVHRR AOD in most sites likely attributes to improper surface reflectance estimation, which should be furthermore improved in the deep blue algorithm. AVHRR has great potential in the retrieval of the historical AOD record from 1979 to the present, therefore, one would expect that AVHRR aerosol products would contribute to furthering our understanding of aerosol effects on climate and environment.
