TI  - Habitat metrics based on multi-temporal Landsat imagery for mapping large mammal habitat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date and fine-scale habitat information is essential for managing and conserving wildlife. Studies assessing wildlife habitat commonly rely on categorical land-cover maps as predictors in habitat models. However, broad land-cover categories often do not adequately capture key habitat features and generating robust land-cover maps is challenging and laborious. Continuous variables derived directly from satellite imagery provide an alternative for capturing land-cover characteristics in habitat models. Improved data availability and processing capacities now allow integrating all available images from medium-resolution sensors in compositing approaches that derive spectral-temporal metrics at the pixel level, summarizing spectral responses over time. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of such metrics derived from Landsat imagery for mapping wildlife habitat. We categorize spectral-temporal metrics into habitat metrics characterizing different aspects of wildlife habitat. Comparing the performance of these metrics against categorical land-cover maps in habitat models for lynx, red deer and roe deer, we found that models using habitat metrics consistently outperformed models based on categorical land-cover maps, with average improvements of 13.7% in model AUC and 9.7% in the Continuous Boyce Index. Performance increases were larger for seasonal habitat models, indicating that the habitat metrics capture intra-annual variability in habitat conditions better than land-cover maps. Comparing suitability maps to ancillary data further revealed that our habitat metrics were sensitive to fine-scale heterogeneity in habitat associated with forest structure. Overall, our study highlights the considerable potential of Landsat-based spectral temporal metrics for assessing wildlife habitat. Given these metrics can be derived directly and in an automatized fashion from globally and freely available Landsat imagery, they open up new possibilities for monitoring habitat dynamics in space and time.

TI  - Mapping secondary succession species in agricultural landscape with the use of hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary succession is a process that is often observed taking place in former agricultural ecosystems. Its characteristics are especially important in protected areas, for the purposes of monitoring and protective measures. Effective mapping of succession is facilitated by the development of automated methodologies based on remote sensing data, which are capable of complementing traditional field research. The objective of this work is to determine whether the classification of high-resolution hyperspectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data with the use of the random forest algorithm enables us to produce an accurate succession species map. First, feature extraction techniques are applied to 1-m hyperspectral images and a similar to 7 point/m(2) dense point cloud. Minimum noise fraction layers and vegetation indices are calculated from the hyperspectral data and geometry related indices from the LiDAR data. Finally, the recursive feature elimination algorithm is applied to the combined dataset and the reference polygons to select the optimal set of features for subsequent classification. The results indicate that the proposed methodology has the potential to be used operationally. The final classification product is characterized by a relatively high Cohen's kappa value of 0.68, with single species classified with various accuracies, expressed by F1 scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.87.

TI  - Diagnosing Observed Stratospheric Water Vapor Relationships to the Cold Point Tropical Tropopause
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dehydration at the tropical cold point tropopause primarily controls the entry value of water vapor to the stratosphere, with additional (uncertain) contributions from subtropical monsoonal circulations and extreme deep convection. Here we quantify the links of observed stratospheric water vapor with near-equatorial cold point temperature (T-CP), based on interannual variations of monthly zonal averages over the period 1993-2017. Water vapor observations are from combined Halogen Occultation Experiment and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite measurements, and cold point temperatures are from high quality radiosondes and GPS satellite data. Interannual water vapor anomalies are highly correlated with T-CP, and coherent patterns can be traced in space and time away from the tropical tropopause to quantify transport in the Brewer-Dobson circulation, including diagnosing seasonal changes in circulation. Lagged regressions with T-CP are used to reconstruct water vapor variations directly tied to the cold point, and these reconstructions account for a majority of the observed interannual water vapor variability in the lower to middle stratosphere over most of the globe. Small systematic differences from observed water vapor can identify processes not tied to zonal average T-CP, and/or possible uncertainties in the satellite measurements.Plain Language Summary Stratospheric water vapor is controlled by the freeze-drying of air entering the stratosphere across the cold tropical tropopause, in addition to uncertain contributions from extreme deep convection and other processes. This work quantifies how interannual variations in water vapor measured by satellites during 1993-2017 are related to observed fluctuations in tropical tropopause temperature. We demonstrate strong correlations from the observations and use the evolution of correlation patterns to trace the transport of water vapor anomalies throughout the global stratosphere. We use the relationship with observed tropopause temperatures to estimate water vapor changes over time, and these calculations show excellent agreement with the satellite measurements over the entire globe. Our results demonstrate that tropopause temperatures exert a dominant control over global stratospheric water vapor.

TI  - Biomarkers of Exposure to Chemical Contamination in the Commercial Fish Species <i>Lepidopus caudatus</i> (Euphrasen, 1788): A Particular Focus on Plastic Additives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Mediterranean Sea has become an accumulation zone for waste generated by the 22 countries bordering its shores. Although the effects of plastic litter on the marine environment and on organisms have recently been studied in other areas, further information is needed for the Mediterranean Sea and, in particular, about plastics additives inputs and interactions with the biota and the trophic network, such as phthalates and bisphenol A. Plastic material production, use and disposal contribute also to the release of heavy metals into the environment, such as mercury (Hg), often used during the production of chlorine, the primary ingredient in PVC, lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd), which are used as stabilizers in PVC and leach out of products during use and disposal. Our research aims to evaluate phthalates, bisphenol A and heavy metals contamination in Lepidopus caudatus (Pisces, Trichiuridae), which could be considered as a potential sentinel species. For the evaluation of toxicological effects, we evaluated the expression of vitellogenin and metallothioneins 1. In all samples analyzed, we have not found microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract but chemical analysis revealed the presence of high content of phthalates, and in particular high quantities of DIDP, DEHP, bis-benzylester phthalate, bis-butyl ester phthalate and mono-N-butyl ester phthalate in different organs. Instead, trace elements detected in tissue revealed a trend of concentrations generally higher in liver and intestine than gill and muscle tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis for anti-metallothionein 1 antibody showed a strong positivity of liver cells, both in females and males. Analysis for the anti-vitellogenin antibody showed in females a strong positivity both in the liver cells and in the gonads, in male specimens was found to be always negative except for a specimen, in which it was highlighted a positivity in some areas of the liver and of the gonad.

TI  - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance in Australia: update to December 2017
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nationwide surveillance of human prion diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies), the most common being Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), is performed by the Australian National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Registry (ANCJDR), based at the University of Melbourne. National surveillance encompasses the period since 1970, with prospective surveillance occurring from 1993 onwards. Over this prospective surveillance period considerable developments have occurred, especially in relation to pre-mortem diagnostics, the delineation of new disease subtypes and a heightened awareness of prion diseases in the health care setting. The surveillance practices of the ANCJDR have evolved and adapted accordingly. Since the ANCJDR began offering cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3 protein testing in Australia in September 1997, the annual number of referrals has steadily increased to a maximum of 508 in 2017. The number of CSF test referrals in 2017 represents a 20% increase compared to that of 2016. In 2017, there was an overall stabilisation of the annual incidence rate of confirmed prion disease in Australia at expected levels; 72 persons with suspected human prion disease were added to the national register, with 72% of all suspected CJD cases undergoing neuropathological examination. The majority of the 72 suspected cases added to the register are as of 31 December 2017 still dassified as "incomplete" (47 cases), while four cases were excluded by either detailed dinical follow-up (1 case) or neuropathological examination (3 cases); 19 cases were dassified as definite and two as probable prion disease. No cases of variant CJD (vCJD) were confirmed.

TI  - Detection and Removal of Clouds and Associated Shadows in Satellite Imagery Based on Simulated Radiance Fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and shadows pose a significant barrier for land surface optical and infrared remote sensing image processing and their various applications. The detection and removal of clouds and shadows from satellite images have always been critical preprocessing steps. To date, a variety of methods have been designed to solve this problem. Some require particular channels, while others are heavily dependent on the availability of temporally adjacent images (reference images). Moreover, many methods are too complex to use by common users. For those reasons, in this paper an alternative scheme for detecting clouds and shadows is proposed based on simulated top-of-atmosphere radiance fields. At the same time, a simple approach to remove clouds and shadows is also provided. The results indicate that the new method can properly identify both clouds and shadows in satellite images. Especially, it shows obvious advantage over the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud product (MOD35) for shadow detection. Although the proposed cloud removal method is simple, the radiances of a contaminated image can be reasonably reconstructed with root-mean-square error < 3.0 W/m(2)<bold>sr</bold>mu m and mean bias < 1.0 W/m(2)<bold>sr</bold>mu m for all seven Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer reflective bands for our case studies. These results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in identifying and removing clouds and shadows from remotely sensed images. Meanwhile, these findings provide some new ideas for the remote sensing community, especially in the fields of cloud detection and image processing.

TI  - Use of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram to guide intraoperative sentinel lymph node frozen sections in patients with early breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We implemented selective use of frozen section (FS) to optimize accuracy and cost control in the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with breast cancer, guided by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nodal metastasis risk prediction nomogram. Methods Surgical pathology records were reviewed, examining 2582 consecutive biopsies from 2552 patients with breast cancer to compare intraoperative FS diagnoses with postoperative final reports. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rates (FNRs) for various MSKCC risk levels, also analyzing axillary reoperation rates, with and without FS, and the number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid separate axillary lymph node dissection. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and FNR of FS were 84.7%, 99.9%, and 15.3%, respectively. FNR and MSKCC risk level negatively correlated (r = -0.86; P = .002). Axillary reoperation rate significantly declined if FS was done (FS: 4.0%; no FS: 36.4%; P = .002). In grouping patients by quartile of MSKCC risk, axillary reoperation rates were 16.7%, 25.1%, 38.7%, and 58.7% without FS, compared with 4.3%, 3.2%, 5.6%, 3.3% with FS and NNT correspondingly fell from 8.1 to 4.6, 3.0, and 1.8. Conclusions A stratified decision-making algorithm based on the MSKCC risk prediction model improved the effectiveness of FS during SLN biopsy to avoid axillary reoperation.

TI  - Automatically Finding Ship Tracks to Enable Large-Scale Analysis of Aerosol - Cloud Interactions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship tracks appear as long winding linear features in satellite images and are produced by aerosols from ship exhausts changing low cloud properties. They are one of the best examples of aerosol-cloud interaction experiments. However, manually finding ship tracks from satellite data on a large scale is prohibitively costly while a large number of samples are required to improve our understanding. Here we train a deep neural network to automate finding ship tracks. The neural network model generalizes well as it not only finds ship tracks labeled by human experts but also detects those that are occasionally missed by humans. It finds more ship tracks than all previous studies combined and produces a map of ship track distributions off the California coast that matches well with known shipping traffic. Our technique will enable studying aerosol effects on low clouds using ship tracks on a large scale, which will potentially narrow the uncertainty of the aerosol-cloud interactions.

TI  - Spatial patterns of meadow sensitivities to interannual climate variability in the Sierra Nevada
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation of montane meadows is a high priority for land and water managers given their critical role in buffering the effects of climate variability and their vulnerability to increasing temperatures and evaporative demands. Recent advances in cloud computing have provided new opportunities to examine ecological responses to climate variability over the past few decades and at large spatial scales. In this study, we characterized the sensitivities (magnitude and direction of the slope) of meadow vegetation responses to interannual variations in climate. We calculated sensitivity as the regression slope between a 31-year (1985-2016) time series of Landsat-derived vegetation indices characterizing late-season vegetation vigour and water balance variables from the Basin Characterization Model. We identified April 1 snowpack as the climate variable the majority of meadows were most sensitive to. We assessed how vegetation sensitivities to snowpack varied with hydrogeomorphic context (e.g., climate, geology, soils, watershed geometry, and land cover) across the Sierra Nevada mountain range using factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the hydrogeomorphic data and multiple linear regression to model sensitivity responses. We found that meadow sensitivities to snowpack varied with long-term average meadow climate, indicators of watershed subsurface water storage capacity, and indicators of meadow vegetation composition. Alpine and subalpine meadows with high average annual precipitation but limited catchment subsurface storage exhibited the largest sensitivities. Our results provide a novel regional perspective on spatial patterns of meadow sensitivities to climate variability and the landscape-scale hydrogeomorphic factors that influence late-season water availability in meadow ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada.

TI  - Sensitivity of isoprene emissions to drought over south-eastern Australia: Integrating models and satellite observations of soil moisture
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - South-east Australia, characterized by arid and semi-arid climate, has experienced large-scale rainfall reductions in recent decades. Larger temporal and spatial drought conditions are predicted in future. The temperate south east coastal zone is characterized by dense forests of Eucalyptus. Drought conditions have implications for the functioning of these indigenous ecosystems, and for emissions of reactive gases that are upwind of major metropolitan regions along the eastern coast. Here, we focus on the impact of drought on the emission of isoprene, a volatile organic compound emitted by a range of trees and shrubs. Previous model calculations grossly overestimate observations of the isoprene mixing ratio, potentially due to overestimated emission factors for native vegetation, but could also be due to drought-induced isoprene emission reductions. We develop the implementation of the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) within the CSIRO Chemical Transport Model to include a parameterization of drought using soil moisture. We test this parameterization using two approaches. First, we drive MEGAN using soil moisture fields from two Australian land surface models achieving reductions in isoprene emissions of 24-52% during summer. Second, we use a simple statistical approach to nudge model soil moisture towards satellite observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) instrument. This work is the first application of SMOS towards isoprene emission modelling, providing a constraint on surface soil moisture which extends to global scales. Applying these soil moisture approaches, domain average isoprene emissions reduce by 38-58% in summer. Using these results, errors in basal emissions are likely in the region of 40%. Comparison of modelled soil moisture to observations using root density weighted averages across depths of 4 m showed minor differences of up to 0.04 m(3)m(-3). We find that the choice of land surface model used in the SMOS assimilations has a greater impact on isoprene emissions than adjusting either the nudging strength or the number of soil levels these satellite data may influence. However there are only small differences of 3% when using hourly or 24-hourly soil moisture input data to drive the emission calculations, suggesting that the lower temporal availability of satellite data does not reduce model quality. As the spatial resolution of satellite observations of atmospheric composition and land surface properties begin to approach the resolution of regulatory air quality models, we anticipate that these data will improve model predictive skills further.

TI  - Dynamic characterization of the main Cantabrian river plumes by means of MODIS
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - River plumes formed in the Cantabrian coast of the Bay of Biscay constitute the main source of nutrients for this coastal area. They are able to sustain high levels of phytoplankton and primary productivity which, in turn, affect the associated ecosystems. Moreover, these plumes also influence other processes as stratification, flow circulation, transport of pollutants or erosion-sedimentation patterns, affecting the morphodynamical and biogeochemical characteristics of the area, which makes their study of high importance. The general small extension of these plumes makes necessary the use of high spatial and temporal resolution data to characterize their fine-spatial structure and to identify their evolution that happens at a short time scale. For that, the response of the Cantabrian plumes to the main forcing was analyzed by means of data provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor onboard Aqua and Terra satellites, which provides daily high resolution of up to 250 m. Composite images of Nalon, Pas-Besaya, Nervion and Adour plumes were created to analyze the effect of each forcing, including river discharge, wind and tides.Adour is the only Cantabrian plume formed even under low discharges due to the greater basin and river discharge. The rest of Cantabrian plumes are only well developed under high river discharges, which shows this forcing as the most important. Nalon, Pas-Besaya and Nervion plumes mainly influence eastward locations whereas Adour plume mainly affects areas located north of river mouth, due to the predominant currents in each area. Wind has a remarkable impact when plumes are well developed, being especially important in Nalon, Pas-Besaya and Nervion plumes. Plume material is dispersed to the ocean (under upwelling and seaward winds) or retained near coast (under downwelling and landward winds) attending to the main wind direction, conditioning the characteristics of the plume area. The semidiurnal tidal cycle is also important when plumes are developed, being all of them greater under low tidal conditions, although the impact is less important in the Adour plume. The higher stability of Adour plume to the forcing could be related to the much greater extension, which makes necessary stronger forcing to cause similar effects. On the other hand, this greater extension favors its impact on thermohaline properties of seawater. The Adour River is able to provoke winter stratification in the plume area, as well as thermal inversions, which condition the thermohaline properties respect to oceanic area not affected by the plume.By last, the influence of Cantabrian plumes on the annual cycle of chlorophyll was evaluated for each plume area and the adjacent ocean also by means of MODIS data. A chlorophyll peak was detected in both areas for early spring and high values of chlorophyll were also detected during autumn and winter but only in plume areas, associated to the input of nutrients and the haline stratification promoted by the high rivers discharges during these months.

TI  - Site analysis in the Argentinean Andean region for the placement of astrophysical observatories and solar photovoltaic power plants. The case of the "Leoncito 2" site
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - After a detailed search for possible sites where to place astrophysical facilities in Argentinean Andean region, a location labeled as LEO 2 (31 degrees 24'22 '' S, 69 degrees 29'32 '' W, 1630 masl) is proposed. It is placed near the largest Astronomical Observatory of Argentina: Complejo AStrondmico El LEOncito (CASLEO). Its advantages are: a good altitude to detect the maximum development of cosmic ray showers, high spectral transmittance to UV and visible ranges, very low aerosol content (mean particle concentration measured at ground with an optical particle counter PM2.5 = 1.52 mu g m(-3) and PM>2 5 = 6.83 mu g m(-3), mean Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm = 0.027 (measured from space using the SeaWiFS instrument on board of the SeaStar NASA satellite). A local meteorological analysis was done, using data measured in situ, which shows a typical desertic site with the following mean annual (std. dev.) values:mean annual temperature 18.93 (7.66) degrees C, mean annual relative humidity 28.76 (20.55)%, low/moderate mean annual average wind speed 11.63 (8.78) km/h, low mean water content (0.73 cm) and rather low mean cloud coverage fraction (cloud coverage fraction): 0.29 (0.02) (for the period 2003-2016 from Aqua/NASA satellite MODIS device) and 0.25 (0.01) (for the period 2000-2016, Terra/NASA satellite MODIS device). Concerning the conditions for the placement of photovoltaic solar power plants, some positive aspects that can be remarked are a large rather flat available surface (336 km(2)) with very good levels of annual mean horizontal solar irradiation: Global (2334 kWh m(-2) per year), Direct (3127 kWh m(-2) per year) and Diffuse (394 kWh m(-2) per year). Optimum angle to place solar panels at this site is determined and the global tilted solar irradiation is calculated (2689 kWh m(-2) per year). In comparison with an African (Ouarzazate, Morocco) and Asian (Dubai) sites, the analysed site present better annual irradiation levels being the Global horizontal irradiation at the Argentinean site 8.1% and 10.3% higher than those calculated for the African and Asian site respectively. Also, a comparison is made of different solar cells (monocrystalline Si, polycrystalline Si and perovskite), through the calculation of the generated photocurrent (mean produced solar photovoltaic current per unit cell surface), considering the atmospheric and solar radiation parameters found for the studied site. We thus conclude that the proposed site in the Andes range is well suited for the placement of Astrophysical facilities, as well as Photovoltaic solar power plants.

TI  - Evidence for a lava lake on Mt. Michael volcano, Saunders Island (South Sandwich Islands) from Landsat, Sentinel-2 and ASTER satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mt. Michael is an active stratovolcano on Saunders Island in the South Sandwich Islands; a remote, oceanic island arc in the southern Atlantic Ocean, bordering the Southern Ocean. The arc contains the only active volcanoes in the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands British Overseas Territory, yet little is known of their activity. Despite lava lakes being extremely rare with only a few global examples, previous analyses of satellite AVHRR imagery of Mt. Michael in the 1990s showed persistent thermal anomalies not associated with magma overflowing the crater. This suggested the existence of a lava lake inside Mt. Michael's crater. However, their study relied on 1 km resolution imagery, and there have been no long-term investigations to determine if this is a persistent feature.In-situ observations of Mt. Michael are extremely difficult given the location. We used Landsat, Sentinel-2 and ASTER satellite data to monitor activity and detect thermal anomalies within the crater. Persistent volcanic plumes and eruptions were identified throughout the thirty-year period studied. On all 15 occasions that a suitable satellite image was available a thermal anomaly within the crater was detected in the high transmissivity shortwave infrared bands (SWIR) centred on 1.65 mu m and 2.2 mu m. Pixel-integrated surface temperatures over the crater floor yield temperatures of 284-419 degrees C; comparable to lava lakes elsewhere. Unmixing these temperatures using the dual-band method reveals a molten lava component at basaltic temperatures (989-1279 degrees C) among a cooler crust. This is the first evidence for a lava lake within Mt. Michael from data that can resolve the crater floor, and the first evidence for magmatic temperatures. As thermal anomalies were detected in all images showing the crater, we suggest that the lava lake is a common and persistent feature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting wheat productivity: Integrating time series of vegetation indices into crop modeling via sequential assimilation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining remote sensing (RS) information with crop modeling is an effective approach to accurately predict regional crop yields. Here, a sequential assimilation technique was developed by incorporating temporal remote sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and the WheatGrow-PROSAIL model-simulated VIs. Experimental data from different sites and years were used to search for the optimal assimilating parameter and growth stage window. Our results showed the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was superior to other vegetation indices as the assimilating parameter. The most accurate prediction was achieved when SAVI from jointing to booting stage, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) after booting stage were incorporated. Booting-heading stage was the optimal coupling window if only one phenological stage of RS data was available. For multiple stage data, the RS data from jointing to filling stage were the most informative. Model test results indicated that the new developed sequential assimilation technique improved the prediction accuracy of the WheatGrow model with root-mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.843, 1.202 g m(-2), and 510.68 kg ha(-1) for leaf area index, leaf nitrogen accumulation, and grain yield, respectively. These results provide significant technical support for regional crop growth monitoring and yield prediction.

TI  - Complex mechanisms linking land surface temperature to greenspace spatial patterns: Evidence from four southeastern Chinese cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have explored the complex mechanisms of urban heat islands by examining the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and greenspace spatial patterns. Few, however, have explored the relative contributions of greenspace spatial composition and configuration to LST using comparisons between cities. In this study, the authors sought to identify the relative contributions of greenspace spatial composition and configuration to LST and the stability mechanisms linking LST to greenspace at multiple locations. We looked at four highly-urbanized Chinese cities in a comparative study. Landsat 5/8 images for summer and winter were used to estimate LST and greenspace data were extracted from 0.5-m resolution imagery. The complex relationship between LST and greenspace spatial patterns was quantified and compared using a novel method that combines stepwise regression with hierarchical partitioning analysis concerning statistical size variations. The results indicated that greenspace spatial composition and configuration both consistently affect LST. However, the magnitude and significance of these relationships were very different. The combined contributions of the greenspace landscape metrics played a more critical role in determining LST than their independent contributions, especially in summer. However, the relative importance of spatial composition and spatial configuration was largely dependent on specific variables such as season or selected statistical grid size. The urban heat island (UHI) effect can be reduced not only by increasing the amount of greenspace, but also by optimizing greenspace spatial configuration; the latter is more effective than the former. Although scale dependence continued to be evident in our study, we were not able to confirm a universal "best" scale for analysis. This study extended our understanding of the complex mechanisms of UHI in the region with respect to seasonal and scale factors, and has provided valuable information to support UHI adaptation strategy development by urban planners.

TI  - Modeling electricity consumption using nighttime light images and artificial neural networks
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to model electricity consumption using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Total electricity consumption and consumption generated by households (HH) were modeled. The input variables of the ANN were based on nighttime light images from VIIRS DNB. Studies conducted thus far have covered mainly linear models. Most of case studies focused on single countries or groups of countries with only few focusing on the sub-national scale. This paper is pioneering in covering an area of Poland (Central Europe) at NUTS-2 level. The use of ANN enabled the modeling of the non-linear relations associated with the complex structure of electricity demand. Satellite data were collected for the period 2013-2016, and included images with improved quality (inter alia higher resolution), compared to the DMSP/OLS program. As images are available from April 2012 onwards, it is only recently that their number has become sufficient for ANN learning. The images were used to create models of multilayer perceptrons. The results achieved by ANN were compared with the results obtained using linear regressions. Studies have confirmed that electricity consumption can be determined with higher precision by the ANN method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of dust-polluted convective clouds over the Tibetan Plateau on downstream precipitation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on satellite observations and reanalysis datasets, this study focuses on the effect of aerosols on clouds over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the impact of dust-polluted convective clouds on precipitation over downstream regions. A heavy dust event is detected by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) over the northern slope of the TP on 16 July and 17 July 2016. The high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are mainly distributed over the northern slope of the TP. Simultaneously, the CloudSat satellite observes deep convective clouds over the northern slope area of the TP, in which convective clouds and dust mix at the same height. With the AOD increasing from 16 July to its peak on 17 July, the ice particle size decreases to a minimum, and convective clouds develop at higher heights because of the prolonged cloud life. Accordingly, a larger ice water path (IWP) is induced by the development of convective clouds that move eastwardly from 16 to 17 July. In the following days, under favorable meteorological conditions, some of the developed convective clouds continuously move eastward and merge with the convective cloud clusters along the motion path, which induces significant precipitation over the Yangtze River basin on 17 July. Furthermore, driven by the northward wind, some developed convective cloud clusters move northward and induce strong precipitation over North China on 19 July. The indirect effect of dust aerosols over the TP could enhance the plateau's cloud development and potentially contribute to downstream precipitation, which is a meaningful factor for weather forecasting.

TI  - Simulating the impact of climate change on soil erosion in sub-tropical monsoon dominated watershed based on RUSLE, SCS runoff and MIROC5 climatic model
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change due to precipitation is one of the important dominant variables that determine the trend of soil loss in future period. In the present study the MIROC5 model of RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 scenarios have been used to estimate the future period precipitation in storm rainfall event. Statistical downscaling approaches have been applied to estimate the precipitation for the time period of 1900 to 2010 and 2070 to 2100. Then the rainfall and runoff erosivity (R) factor has been estimated from the predicted precipitation scenario with the help of Modified Fourier Index from 2070 to 2100 in different return period such as 5 year, 10 year and 15 year return period. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) have been used to prepare the necessary thematic inputs for RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) model in GIS environment. In this study the information regarding the soil characteristics have been accounted based on the primary information. In the present study, 2 sq km * 2 sq km grids of the entire basin have been taken into consideration randomly for collecting the soil samples within this region. Then the soil texture has been estimated and identified through the automatic sieve shaker in laboratory. Despite the soil texture, the soil pH and organic matter have also been estimated in the laboratory for estimating the soil erodibility factor (Kfactor) more accurately. Slope length and steepness factor (LS) have been estimated from the SRTM DEM in GIS environment. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) was derived from the Landsat 8 OLI data for estimating the cover and management factor (C), support practice factor (P) related to slope direction has been estimated based on the primary observation during the field visit. Apart from that the SCS curve number values and the weighted curve number values for each and every individual LULC classes have been derived to estimate the R factor. It was revealed that the average annual soil loss in the severe region (very high) in the base year is 12.6% and it would be 25.12% (5 year return period), 26.48% (10 year return period), 27.59% (15 year return period) in RCP 2.6 scenario. The average annual soil loss in this region would be 28.53% (5 year return period), 30.00% (10 year return period), 30.97% (15 year return period) in RCP 4.5 scenario. The amount of soil in the severe region would be 32.19% (5 year return period), 33.48% (10 year return period), 34.05% (15 year return period) in RCP 6.0 scenario. In the RCP 8.5 scenario the average annual soil loss would be 32.78% (5 year return period), 32.97% (10 year return period), 33.28% (15 year return period). This type of study is more helpful for the decision makers and regional planner for adopting the suitable measures with keeping in the view the local environment. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

TI  - Modelling the extent of northern peat soil and its uncertainty with Sentinel: Scotland as example of highly cloudy region
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the extent and locations of peatland at landscape scale has implications for carbon inventories, conservation and ecosystem services assessments. The main aim of this paper was to model and map the extent of northern peat soils while taking into account its uncertainty, and in particular exploring:1. the use of radar Sentinel 1 as alternative to optical sensors to reduce problems due to clouds while taking advantage of the seasonality changes and2. the use of deep learning for peat classification and as application of Digital Soil Mapping.The data sets defining presence or absence of peat in the soil were obtained from different sources and different sampling schemes, densities and distributions. Scotland was used as test case, because of its cloudy weather and fragmented distribution of different types of peat.An extension of the scorpan-kriging approach was used. The trend was estimated with different approaches: Generalized Additive Models, RandomForest and deep learning (convolutional neural networks). Each approach produced the probability of belonging to a class and the predicted class for each pixel. The results were assessed using out-of-sample measures.In this study 108 combinations of data sets and models (including trend approaches, sets of covariates and modelling of the spatial structure) were assessed. Overall, spatially explicit models performed better. The choice of the statistical method can have a significant impact on the predictive performances, while the sets of environmental covariates had a lower impact. Sentinel-1 with morphological features proved to be a good alternative to optical data for peat mapping. It is important to have balanced data sets representing the distribution of the data, because merging heterogeneous sources of data from different populations does not necessarily improve predictions. The use of deep learning and convolutional neural network provided initial promising results.There were large differences in the modelling approaches. These differences and uncertainties need to be taken into account for further modelling such as earth surface modelling or carbon accounting.

TI  - Regional sulfate drives long-term rise in AOD over megacity Kolkata, India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present here the first long-term (2001-2017) record of aerosol optical depth (AOD; interchangeably, AOT) and contributions of aerosol chemical components to light extinction over Kolkata, the second-most polluted metropolis in India. For this purpose, we use daily gridded MODIS AOD measurements coupled with modeled AOT for 5 major aerosol constituents - sulfate, sea-salt, dust, organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC), from the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. We find that AOD over Kolkata has increased significantly (32% overall, 0.010 y(-1); Mann-Kendall test with Thiel-Sen slope estimation; p < 0.01) over the past 17 y to a mean of 0.74 +/- 0.10 in 2017, and an overwhelming majority of this increase is driven by a concurrent rise (70% overall, 0.007 y(-1), p < 0.01) in sulfate AOT. This is followed by smaller but significant enhancements in OC (40% overall, 0.002 y(-1), p < 0.01) and BC (20% overall, 0.0004 y(-1), p < 0.01) AOT. Although a non-trivial fraction (24%) of AOT is associated with natural emissions (sea-salt and dust), these do not exhibit significant trends over time and therefore are not instrumental in driving the observed AOD rise. A concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis shows that sulfate aerosol over Kolkata is mostly regional (within similar to 250 km) during winter and post-monsoon with significant footprints over thermal power plant clusters in neighboring states and areas with considerable residential biofuel use (eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin). In comparison, BC and OC AOT show a significant long-range component (similar to 1800 km) originating from northwestern and central IGP, especially during post-monsoon, when open agricultural residue burning is rampant. Overall, these results provide a preliminary indication that a considerable fraction of aerosol light extinction over Kolkata might be related to non-local, atmospherically transported aerosol. Once validated by ground-based measurements, these results would reinforce the need to bring regional and long-range emissions, in addition to within-the-city emissions, under the purview of air quality management policies.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides and debris flows in the Loess Plateau pose great threats to human lives and man-made infrastructure, such as buildings and expressways. Thus, the detection and monitoring of the stability of slopes are crucial in geohazard prevention and management. In this study, the time series synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) analysis method that combines persistent scatters (PSs) and distributed scatters (DSs) is employed to detect and map active slopes along the upstream Yellow River from the Longyang Gorge dam to the Lijia Gorge dam using one ALOS PALSAR data stack from 2006 to 2011 and two Sentinel-1 data stacks from 2015 to 2017. More than 100 active slopes in a total coverage of 222.5 km(2) were identified. Through a time series displacement analysis of active slopes, we found that changes in the water content of loess slopes induced by rainfall or reservoir impoundment might be a major factor that can activate unstable slopes or accelerate the movement of active slopes.

TI  - An efficient algorithm for detection of seasonal snow cover variations over undulating North Indian Himalayas, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of rapid snow cover variations over undulating Himalayan mountain ranges may get challenging due to the existence of steep slopes and a diverse range of spatial variability. In this paper, a change detection algorithm is proposed for the detection of seasonal snow cover variations over North Indian Himalayas (NIH). The novelty of the proposed model lies within the applicability of fuzzy classification in change vector analysis (CVA) to identify the mixed pixels, termed as mixels which represent the membership of multiple or partial class-categories. Additionally, this model offers various advantages over existing CVA based algorithms such as (a) ease in selection of threshold value; (b) ease in change determination procedure; and (c) effective utilization of coarse-resolution satellite dataset. The efficacy of the algorithm has been established through a case study in Lahaul and Spiti (Himachal Pradesh), India. This analysis has been done using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the two-winter periods (i.e. 2009-10 and 2017-18). The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is estimated by the performance-matrix (change-category image) and it has been observed that fuzzy based CVA has achieved better accuracy (85.6%) as compared to conventional improved CVA (ICVA) (71.2%) and post classification comparison (PCC) (69.6%). The relationships of seasonal snow cover variations with respect to altitudes between two winter seasons have also been summarized to represent a shift in the duration of ablation and accumulation from 2009 to 2018. Moreover, the snow cover area (SCA) computed from fuzzy based CVA has also been compared with the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) maps for the study period. The applications of the present study may include accurate estimation of the snowmelt runoff, water resource management via continuous snow cover monitoring and mapping. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

TI  - MODIS AOD sampling rate and its effect on PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation in North China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Much attention has been paid to develop methods to estimate particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD). One of fundamental limitation of these methods is lack of AOD and thereby PM2.5 cannot be derived from satellites when clouds are present or when surface conditions are not favorable. This would probably result in an inherent clear-sky biased estimate of PM2.5 for air quality assessment that requires continuous 24-h measurements at all-sky conditions. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD and PM2.5 data in North China, a highly polluted area with large spatiotemporal variabilities of AOD and PM2.5 values, missing MODIS AOD retrievals and its potential effect on PM2.5 estimation are studied. The MODIS dark target (DT) algorithm produces very few AODs in winter, with a regional observation rate of 4%, which limits its statistical significance for PM2.5 air quality monitoring. This limitation applies to MODIS DT AOD products at 10-km and 3-km resolutions since they are derived from the same retrieval core (Remer et al., 2013). In contrast, The MODIS deep blue (DB) AOD product complements the MODIS DT AOD coverage, which is remarkable in winter. The MODIS DT and DB merged product has comparable accuracy to that of the DT and DB products but shows a larger sampling rate, therefore, it is more suitable for estimating surface PM2.5. While the regional mean PM2.5 values in the presence and absence of AOD retrievals in spring and summer are comparable, but the former is substantially lower than the latter in autumn by 11.2 mu gm(-3 )and winter by 8.5 mu gm(-3) on average. The difference in some stations even exceeds 20 mu g m(-3). Methods to fill missing AOD values in North China are crucial to provide an unbiased sampling and estimate of PM2.5 concentration in all-sky conditions, likely by integrating satellite, surface and modeling data.

TI  - An adaptation of the CO<sub>2</sub> slicing technique for the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer to obtain the height of tropospheric volcanic ash clouds
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ash clouds are a geographically far-reaching hazard associated with volcanic eruptions. To minimise the risk that these pose to aircraft and to limit disruption to the aviation industry, it is important to closely monitor the emission and atmospheric dispersion of these plumes. The altitude of the plume is an important consideration and is an essential input into many models of ash cloud propagation. CO2 slicing is an established technique for obtaining the top height of aqueous clouds, and previous studies have demonstrated that there is potential for this method to be used for volcanic ash. In this study, the CO2 slicing technique has been adapted for volcanic ash and applied to spectra obtained from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). Simulated ash spectra are first used to select the most appropriate channels and then demonstrate that the technique has merit for determining the altitude of the ash. These results indicate a strong match between the true heights and CO2 slicing output with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 800 m. Following this, the technique was applied to spectra obtained with IASI during the Eyjafjallajokull and Grimsvotn eruptions in 2010 and 2011 respectively, both of which emitted ash clouds into the troposphere, and which have been extensively studied with satellite imagery. The CO2 slicing results were compared against those from an optimal estimation scheme, also developed for IASI, and a satellite-borne lidar is used for validation. The CO2 slicing heights returned an RMSE value of 2.2 km when compared against the lidar. This is lower than the RMSE for the optimal estimation scheme (2.8 km). The CO2 slicing technique is a relatively fast tool and the results suggest that this method could be used to get a first approximation of the ash cloud height, potentially for use for hazard mitigation, or as an input for other retrieval techniques or models of ash cloud propagation.

TI  - A compilation of global bio-optical in situ data for ocean-colour satellite applications - version two
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - A global compilation of in situ data is useful to evaluate the quality of ocean-colour satellite data records. Here we describe the data compiled for the validation of the ocean-colour products from the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI). The data were acquired from several sources (including, inter alia, MOBY, BOUSSOLE, AERONET-OC, SeaBASS, NOMAD, MERMAID, AMT, ICES, HOT and GeP&CO) and span the period from 1997 to 2018. Observations of the following variables were compiled: spectral remote-sensing reflectances, concentrations of chlorophyll a, spectral inherent optical properties, spectral diffuse attenuation coefficients and total suspended matter. The data were from multi-project archives acquired via open internet services or from individual projects, acquired directly from data providers. Methodologies were implemented for homogenization, quality control and merging of all data. No changes were made to the original data, other than averaging of observations that were close in time and space, elimination of some points after quality control and conversion to a standard format. The final result is a merged table designed for validation of satellite-derived ocean-colour products and available in text format. Metadata of each in situ measurement (original source, cruise or experiment, principal investigator) was propagated throughout the work and made available in the final table. By making the metadata available, provenance is better documented, and it is also possible to analyse each set of data separately. This paper also describes the changes that were made to the compilation in relation to the previous version (Valente et al., 2016). The compiled data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.898188 (Valente et al., 2019).

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of remotely sensed region heat islands during the rapid urbanization (1995-2015) of Southern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban agglomeration has become the most salient feature of global urbanization in recent decades, while spatiotemporal patterns and evolution remain poorly understood in urban agglomerations, which limit the decision-makers to make more informed decisions to improve the regional environment. Here we selected one of the most rapidly urbanized regions in the world - Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (PRDR), located in southern China, as the case. Landsat images spanning from 1995 to 2015 were used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). Four types of regional heat island (RHI) degree were defined for further analysis. Then multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of RHI were identified with the help of cloud-based computing, spatial and landscape analysis. We found that (1) traditional urban heat island (UHI) appears as an RHI on an urban agglomeration scale. In PRDR, we found RHI expended with increasing connectivity, especially in the estuary areas where isolated UHI gradually merged during the rapid urbanization. (2) The contribution of main cities in PRDR to RHI and the evolutionary trends and pattern, which is changed from a west-east to a southwest-northeast gradient, have been revealed. (3) Considering the scale effect and different RHI categories, we revealed that during the urbanization, the aggregation of the RHI is significant on a larger-scale, and the area of 4 degrees C <= Relative LST <= 8 degrees C is the stable and high-risk area, which provide scientific bases for the governance of the thermal environment on the regional scale. (4) The study also indicates the cooling effect of forests and water is better than that of grassland, while the cooling effect of grassland is uncertain. The methods and results of this study not only have implications on environmental planning and management in the PRDR but also provide useful insights into the thermal environment research and practice in other urban agglomerations.

TI  - Paleozoic glaciation in NE Africa: field and remote sensing-based evidence from the South Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Exhumed Paleozoic glacial deposits and landforms of the North Gondwana are reported here for the first time from the South Eastern Desert (SED) of Egypt. Using field observations and remote sensing datasets (Advanced Land Observing Satellite [ALOS], Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar [PALSAR] radar, multispectral Landsat TM datasets, and digital elevation models [DEMs]), we mapped the distribution of Paleozoic glacial features (i.e. deposits and landforms) in the SED. Two main glaciogenic facies were identified in three locations in the SED: (1) massive, poorly sorted, matrix supported, boulder-rich diamictites in Wadi El-Naam and Korbiai, and (2) moderately-sorted, occasionally bedded outwash deposits in Betan area. Inspection of radar, DEMs, and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images revealed previously unrecognized ENE-WSW trending glacial megalineations (MLs) over the peneplained Neoproterozoic basement rocks in the central sections of the SED, whose trends align along their projected extension with those of glacial features (tunnel valleys and striation trends) reported from Saudi Arabia. The glaciogenic features in the SED are believed to be largely eroded during the uplift associated with the Red Sea opening, except for those preserved as basal units beneath the Nubia Sandstone Formation or as remnant isolated deposits within paleo-depressions within the basement complex. The apparent spatial correlation of the SED glacial features with well-defined Late Ordovician deposits in North Africa and in Saudi Arabia, and the reported thermochronometric analyses and fossil records are consistent with a Late Ordovician age for the SED glaciogenic features and support models that call on the continuation of the Late Ordovician (Hirnantian) ice sheet from the Sahara into Arabia through the SED of Egypt.

TI  - Looking for the Cosmopolitical Fish: Monitoring Marine Pollution with Anglers and Congers in the Gulf of Fos, Southern France
T2  - SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Following a controversy over the construction of a waste incinerator in the Fos-sur-Mer industrial area (France), residents pointed to the lack of knowledge of the industry's cumulative impact on their health and environment. Under pressure, some of their elected representatives supported the creation of an independent scientific organization, the Ecocitizen Institute for Pollution Awareness (Institut ecocitoyen pour la connaissance des pollutions [IECP]). Its objective was to conduct localized scientific research on the effects of pollution and to lobby the administration to change its regulatory practices. This paper examines the efforts made to ensure that the "undone science" gets done, by focusing on the specificities of this industrialized site. We look at a participatory biomonitoring experiment that aimed to document pollution in the Gulf of Fos where scientists working for the IECP accepted anglers' requests and switched from an acknowledged sentinel species to another species. We tell the many stories that were shared with us about how conger qualified as a more suitable "cosmopolitical fish" in the study of pollution. Elaborating on actor-network theory and multispecies ethnographies, we discuss the appropriateness of congers as the newly appointed sentinel species. We argue that this demonstrates the importance of the "ecology of relations" in maintaining the livability of the area.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of surface chlorophyll-a in the Halmahera Sea and its relation to ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term satellite data are used to investigate the variability of ocean surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the Halmahera Sea (HS) under influence of the Australian-Indonesian Monsoon (AIM), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). In this study, we first analysed the seasonal variability of chl-a, and then examine the relationship between surface chl-a, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface wind stress in the area. Our results suggest that prevailing southeasterly winds play a fundamental role in generating chl-a blooms in the HS. Particularly on a seasonal timescale, through the mechanism of Ekman mass transport, strengthening of southeasterly wind stress during the Southeast Monsoon season (June - August) produces enhanced chl-a concentrations associated with ocean surface cooling in the area of study. On the other hand, the chl-a bloom completely diminishes during the Northwest Monsoon season (December - February) due to weakening of wind stress and Ekman transport. On an interannual timescale, sea level pressure and wind stress are coherent with ENSO and IOD phases. During El Nino and positive IOD events (La Nina and negative IOD events), both sea level pressure and wind stress greatly increase (decrease) over the HS. These conditions cause an anomaly in southerly (northerly) wind stress, which is favourable to an enhancement (reduction) of the chl-a concentration in the region. This study demonstrates that sea level pressure and wind stress are the critical factors in determining the magnitude of chl-a bloom in the HS.

TI  - Expanding domains and the personal, imperial style of Krs?adevaraya
T2  - INDIAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In modern literary histories of Telugu literature, no period shines as bright as King Krs?adevaraya's reign (1509-29). This period is noted for its bustling literary court from which a significant part of the Telugu canon emerged. These works, commonly referred to as the prabandhas, are often characterised as the Telugu counterpart of the Sanskrit mahakavya/court poem and within this context, Krs?adevaraya's reign is called 'the golden age' of Telugu literature and the 'age of prabandha'. Close examination of the prabandhas indicates that despite common influences from Sanskrit and Telugu literature, each of the prabandhas, takes a radically different approach to poetry, convention, and language, and is innovative in extremely diverse ways. As a case study, this article uses Krs?adevaraya's own celebrated Telugu poem, the Amuktamalyada. Though Krs?adevaraya uses many of the conventions associated with Sanskrit courtly culture in general and with the mahakavya in particular, he does so in unconventional ways. He gives everyday life a new, prominent role (previously unavailable to it in mahakavyas) and is able to do so by creating a new type of division of labour between Sanskrit and Telugu. He also integrates new poetic realms such as the village and temple into the so-called courtly settings, creating a new mode of narration. Thus, examined outside the context of the golden age of the Telugu prabandha, the Amuktamalyada emerges as a work in which previous schemes of power are inverted: the periphery and so-called margins-social, geographic, linguistic, and religious-create a new core which in turn, reflects Krs?adevaraya's unique personal and political worldview.

TI  - Satellite-Based Time Series of Chlorophyll in Chilko Lake, British Columbia, Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Canada, many northern lakes are remote and difficult to access, with limited limnological data. Satellite sensors provide widespread coverage and growing time series of data unavailable via conventional sampling, but global validation is still limited. We evaluated chlorophyll estimates from the MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor on board the European Space Agency (ESA) ENVISAT satellite for the ultra-oligotrophic Chilko Lake in the coastal mountains of central British Columbia. This lake supports a valuable sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) population. We obtained good temporal coverage, through 1,425 scenes between June 18, 2002 and April 6, 2012. Although pre-processing was required to produce a high-quality dataset, one standard ESA algorithm generated chlorophyll estimates similar to field data. Regional and interannual phenological patterns were clear, and differences that may be important determinants of salmon production were well described. Although MERIS ceased operation in April 2012, it was replaced by the OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument) on the SENTINEL 3a and 3b satellites launched in February 2016 and April 2018, respectively. We conclude that, with appropriate quality control and in situ validation, satellite-generated chlorophyll time series in sockeye salmon rearing lakes have significant potential as a fisheries planning and analysis tool.

TI  - Detailed Urban Land Use Land Cover Classification at the Metropolitan Scale Using a Three-Layer Classification Scheme
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) information is essential for urban and environmental management. It is, however, very difficult to automatically extract detailed urban LULC information from remote sensing imagery, especially for a large urban area. Medium resolution imagery, such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, cannot uncover detailed LULC information. Further, very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, such as IKONOS and QuickBird data, can only be applied to a small area, largely due to the data unavailability and high computation cost. As a result, little research has been conducted to extract detailed urban LULC information for a large urban area. This study, therefore, developed a three-layer classification scheme for deriving detailedurban LULC information by integrating newly launched Chinese GF-1 (medium resolution) and GF-2 (very high resolution) satellite imagery and synthetically incorporating geometry, texture, and spectral information through multi-resolution image segmentation and object-based image classification (OBIA). Homogeneous urban LULC types such as water bodies or large areas of vegetation could be derived from GF-1 imagery with 16 m and 8 m spatial resolutions, while heterogeneous urban LULC types such as industrial buildings, residential buildings, and roads could be extracted from GF-2 imagery with 3.2 m and 0.8 m spatial resolutions. The multi-resolution segmentation method and a random forest algorithm were employed to perform image segmentation and object-based image classification, respectively. An analysis of the results suggests an overall accuracy of 0.89 and 0.87 were achieved for the second and third level urban LULC classification maps, respectively. Therefore, the three-layer classification scheme has the potential to derive high accuracy urban LULC information through integrating medium and high-resolution remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing and Geophysics for Exploring Early Nomadic Funerary Architecture in the "Siberian Valley of the Kings"
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses the architecture of the Early Iron Age royal burial mound Tunnug 1 in the Siberian Valley of the Kings in Tuva Republic, Russia. This large monument is paramount for the archaeological exploration of the early Scythian period in the Eurasian steppes, but environmental parameters make research on site difficult and require the application of a diversity of methods. We thus integrate WorldView-2 and ALOS-2 remote sensing data, geoelectric resistivity and geomagnetic survey results, photogrammetry-based DEMs, and ortho-photographs, as well as excavation in order to explore different aspects of the funerary architecture of this early nomadic monument. We find that the large royal tomb comprises of a complex internal structure of radial features and chambers, and a rich periphery of funerary and ritual structures. Geomagnetometry proved to be the most effective approach for a detailed evaluation of the funerary architecture in our case. The parallel application of several surveying methods is advisable since dataset comparison is indispensable for providing context.

T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To evaluate the relationship between visoperception and anthropometric features related to prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods We compared two cohorts of infants aged between 5 and 18 years. Seventy-nine children, adopted from Eastern Europe, were included in the study group. The control group was formed by age and gender matched children born in Spain. All children underwent a full ophthalmologic assessment and standardised testing of visual cognitive skills. Results Adoptees presented worse visual motor and visual perceptual outcomes in all skills compared with control subjects, with statistically significant difference in test of visual perceptual skills (TVPS) global centile (50.3 vs 66.8; P = 0.001), spatial relationships (64.6 vs 81.9; P = 0.004) and visual figure-ground (52.1 vs 74.1; P = 0.002) tasks. Face recognition was as well significantly worse in adopted children (42.4 vs 57.1; P = 0.009). Twenty-one adopted children (26.6%) had sentinel finding for foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Main facial features related to FASD correlated with visual cognitive outcomes. Of the adopted children, those diagnosed of FASD showed incrementally worse visual perceptual and visual motor outcomes (TVPS global centile = 36.86, P = 0.001; TVAS = 10.38, P = 0.002). Conclusion Children adopted from eastern Europe are at increased risk of visual perceptual disabilities, especially those with sentinel findings of foetal alcohol syndrome disorders.

TI  - Landscape characteristics of non-native pine plantations and invasions in Southern Chile
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of non-native conifers into areas naturally dominated by other vegetation types is a growing problem in South America. This process results in a landscape transformation as the conifers suppress native vegetation leading to reduced biodiversity, lower water availability and altered nutrient dynamics. Previous research highlights the broad spatial extents of land cover change in parts of Chile. However, in Southern Chile, the extent of plantations and the landscape characteristics associated with plantations and ongoing pine invasions are poorly understood. Here, we characterised non-native pine land cover within one Landsat scene (World Reference System 2 Path 232/Row 92; similar to 34 000 km(2)) in Southern Chile. We created training data based on historical high-resolution imagery, derived land cover predictors from time series of Landsat observations and used a Random Forest classifier to map the distribution of non-native pines. The overall classification accuracy was 88%, and the accuracy of the non-native pine class exceeded 90%. Although 71% of non-native pine patches were within 500 m of other non-native pine patches, isolated non-native pine patches were found to occur up to 55 km from the nearest neighbour. These distant plantations could exacerbate invasion risk by creating propagule sources for novel invasion fronts. In relation to landscape characteristics, non-native pines were found to be more likely to occur in low slope and mid-elevation areas. Because most of the study area is native forest, most non-native pine patches border native forest. However, non-native pine patches were almost three times more likely than random patches to border grass/agriculture. This suggests that grasslands and disturbed sites, which have low resistance to non-native pine invasion, are disproportionately exposed to pine propagules. Our results indicate that non-native pine plantations are extensive across Southern Chile, and well poised to cause future invasion.

TI  - Monitoring the Land Subsidence Area in a Coastal Urban Area with InSAR and GNSS
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the enormous losses caused by urban surface deformation have received more and more attention. Traditional geodetic techniques are point-based measurements, which have limitations in using traditional geodetic techniques to detect and monitor in areas where geological disasters occur. Therefore, we chose Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology to study the surface deformation in urban areas. In this research, we discovered the land subsidence phenomenon using InSAR and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology. Two different kinds of time-series InSAR (TS-InSAR) methods: Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) and the Permanent Scatterer InSAR (PSI) process were executed on a dataset with 31 Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. We generated the surface deformation field of Shenzhen, China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The time series of the 3d variation of the reference station network located in the HKSAR was generated at the same time. We compare the characteristics and advantages of PSI, SBAS, and GNSS in the study area. We mainly focus on the variety along the coastline area. From the results generated by SBAS and PSI techniques, we discovered the occurrence of significant subsidence phenomenon in the land reclamation area, especially in the metro construction area and the buildings with a shallow foundation located in the land reclamation area.

TI  - Is positive correlation between cloud droplet effective radius and aerosol optical depth over land due to retrieval artifacts or real physical processes?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) C6 L3, Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Edition-4 L3 products, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data are employed to systematically study aerosol-cloud correlations over three anthropogenic aerosol regions and their adjacent oceans, as well as explore the effect of retrieval artifacts and underlying physical mechanisms. This study is confined to warm phase and single-layer clouds without precipitation during the summertime (June, July, and August). Our analysis suggests that cloud effective radius (CER) is positively correlated with aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land (positive slopes), but negatively correlated with aerosol index (AI) over oceans (negative slopes) even with small ranges of liquid water path (quasi-constant). The changes in albedo at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) corresponding to aerosol-induced changes in CER also lend credence to the authenticity of this opposite aerosol-cloud correlation between land and ocean. It is noted that potential artifacts, such as the retrieval biases of both cloud (partially cloudy and 3-D-shaped clouds) and aerosol, can result in a serious overestimation of the slope of CER-AOD/AI. Our results show that collision-coalescence seems not to be the dominant cause for positive slope over land, but the increased CER caused by increased aerosol might further increase CER by initializing collision-coalescence, generating a positive feedback. By stratifying data accord- ing to the lower tropospheric stability and relative humidity near cloud top, it is found that the positive correlations more likely occur in the case of drier cloud top and stronger turbulence in clouds, while negative correlations occur in the case of moister cloud top and weaker turbulence in clouds, which implies entrainment mixing might be a possible physical interpretation for such a positive CER-AOD slope.

TI  - OSARIS, the "Open Source SAR Investigation System" for Automatized Parallel InSAR Processing of Sentinel-1 Time Series Data With Special Emphasis on Cryosphere Applications
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of the two Sentinel-1 (S1) satellites, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with high temporal and spatial resolution are freely available. This provides a promising framework to facilitate detailed investigations of surface instabilities and movements on large scales with high temporal resolution, but also poses substantial processing challenges because of storage and computation requirements. Methods are needed to efficiently detect short term changes in dynamic environments. Approaches considering pair-wise processing of a series of consecutive scenes to retain maximum temporal resolution in conjunction with time series analyses are required. Here we present OSARIS, the "Open Source SAR Investigation System," as a framework to process large stacks of S1 data on high-performance computing clusters. Based on Generic Mapping Tools SAR, shell scripts, and the workload manager Slurm, OSARIS provides an open and modular framework combining parallelization of high-performance C programs, flexible processing schemes, convenient configuration, and generation of geocoded stacks of analysis-ready base data, including amplitude, phase, coherence, and unwrapped interferograms. Time series analyses can be conducted by applying automated modules to the data stacks. The capabilities of OSARIS are demonstrated in a case study from the northwestern Tien Shan, Central Asia. After merging of slices, a total of 80 scene pairs were processed from 174 total input scenes. The coherence time series exhibits pronounced seasonal variability, with relatively high coherence values prevailing during the summer months in the nival zone. As an example of a time series analysis module, we present OSARIS' "Unstable Coherence Metric" which identifies pixels affected by significant drops from high to low coherence values. Measurements of motion provided by LOSD measurements require careful evaluation because interferometric phase unwrapping is prone to errors. Here, OSARIS provides a series of modules to detect and mask unwrapping errors, correct for atmospheric disturbances, an remove large-scale trends. Wall clock processing time for the case study (area similar to 9,000 km(2)) was similar to 12 h 4 min on a machine with 400 cores and 2 TB RAM. In total, similar to 12 d 10 h 44 min (similar to 96%) were saved through parallelization. A comparison of selected OSARIS datasets to results from two state-of-the-art SAR processing suites, ISCE and SNAP, shows that OSARIS provides products of competitive quality despite its high level of automatization. OSARIS thus facilitates efficient S1-based region-wide investigations of surface movement events over multiple years.

TI  - Bare Soil Surface Moisture Retrieval from Sentinel-1 SAR Data Based on the Calibrated IEM and Dubois Models Using Neural Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of two radar backscattering models; the calibrated integral equation model (CIEM) and the modified Dubois model (MDB) over an agricultural area in Karaj, Iran. In the first part, the performance of the models is evaluated based on the field measurement and the mentioned backscattering models, CIEM and MDB performed with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.78 dB and 1.45 dB, respectively. In the second step, based on the neural networks (NNS), soil surface moisture is estimated using the two backscattering models, based on neural networks (NNs), from single polarization Sentinel-1 images over bare soils. The inversion results show the efficiency of the single polarized data for retrieving soil surface moisture, especially for VV polarization.

TI  - Joint Assimilation of Leaf Area Index and Soil Moisture from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data into the WOFOST Model for Winter Wheat Yield Estimation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that timely crop growth monitoring and accurate crop yield estimation at a fine scale is of vital importance for agricultural monitoring and crop management. Crop growth models have been widely used for crop growth process description and yield prediction. In particular, the accurate simulation of important state variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) and root zone soil moisture (SM), is of great importance for yield estimation. Data assimilation is a useful tool that combines a crop model and external observations (often derived from remote sensing data) to improve the simulated crop state variables and consequently model outputs like crop total biomass, water use and grain yield. In spite of its effectiveness, applying data assimilation for monitoring crop growth at the regional scale in China remains challenging, due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data that can match the small field sizes which are typical for agriculture in China. With the accessibility of freely available images acquired by Sentinel satellites, it becomes possible to acquire data at high spatiotemporal resolution (10-30 m, 5-6 days), which offers attractive opportunities to characterize crop growth. In this study, we assimilated remotely sensed LAI and SM into the Word Food Studies (WOFOST) model to estimate winter wheat yield using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. The LAI was calculated from Sentinel-2 using a lookup table method, and the SM was calculated from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 based on a change detection approach. Through validation with field data, the inverse error was 10% and 35% for LAI and SM, respectively. The open-loop wheat yield estimation, independent assimilations of LAI and SM, and a joint assimilation of LAI + SM were tested and validated using field measurement observation in the city of Hengshui, China, during the 2016-2017 winter wheat growing season. The results indicated that the accuracy of wheat yield simulated by WOFOST was significantly improved after joint assimilation at the field scale. Compared to the open-loop estimation, the yield root mean square error (RMSE) with field observations was decreased by 69 kg/ha for the LAI assimilation, 39 kg/ha for the SM assimilation and 167 kg/ha for the joint LAI + SM assimilation. Yield coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.41, 0.65, 0.50, and 0.76 and mean relative errors (MRE) of 4.87%, 4.32%, 4.45% and 3.17% were obtained for open-loop, LAI assimilation alone, SM assimilation alone and joint LAI + SM assimilation, respectively. The results suggest that LAI was the first-choice variable for crop data assimilation over SM, and when both LAI and SM satellite data are available, the joint data assimilation has a better performance because LAI and SM have interacting effects. Hence, joint assimilation of LAI and SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 at a 20 m resolution into the WOFOST provides a robust method to improve crop yield estimations. However, there is still bias between the key soil moisture in the root zone and the Sentinel-1 C band retrieved SM, especially when the vegetation cover is high. By active and passive microwave data fusion, it may be possible to offer a higher accuracy SM for crop yield prediction.

TI  - Post-Carnegie II curricular reform: a north American survey of emerging trends & challenges
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn 2010, coincident with the 100th anniversary of Flexner's sentinel report, the Carnegie Foundation published an updated review of North American medical education and challenged medical schools to initiate further educational reforms. Specific recommendations pertained to a) ensuring standardized outcomes while allowing for individualized processes, b) integrating foundational knowledge with clinical experience, c) cultivating habits of inquiry and innovation and d) professional identity formation. As we approach the 10-year anniversary of this latest report, we sought to determine what type of curricular revisions have been emerging within the past decade and what types of challenges have been encountered along the way?MethodsIn 2018, an electronic survey was sent to all 166 Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredited North American Medical Schools, using the points of contact (educational deans) that were listed in a publicly available, Association of American Medical Colleges database. Free text comments were grouped into themes using the constant-comparative technique.ResultsSixty unique responses yielding a 36.14% response rate. The distribution of responses was proportionally representative of the distribution of public vs. private, old vs. new vs. established North American medical schools. Self-reported curricular changes aggregated into five main themes: Changes in curricular structure/organization, changes in curricular content, changes in curricular delivery, changes in assessment, and changes involving increased use of technology/informatics. Challenges were predominantly focused on overcoming faculty resistance, faculty development, securing adequate resourcing, change management, and competition for limited amounts of curricular time.ConclusionsChanges in curricular organization, content, delivery, assessment and the use of technology reflect reforms that are broad and deep. Empowering faculty to let go of familiar constructs/processes requires strong leadership, particularly when initiating particularly disruptive curricular changes, such as relocating the Step 1 examination or shifting to a competency-based curriculum. While North American medical schools are responding to the calls for action described in the second (2010) Carnegie Foundation report, the full vision has yet to be achieved.

TI  - Using satellite observations of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> columns to infer long-term trends in US NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions: the importance of accounting for the free tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> background
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Emission Inventory (NEI) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports a steady decrease in US NOx emissions over the 2005-2017 period at a rate of 0.1 Tg N a(-1) (53 % decrease over the period), reflecting sustained efforts to improve air quality. Tropospheric NO2 columns observed by the satellite-based Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over the US show a steady decrease until 2009 but a flattening afterward, which has been attributed to a flattening of NOx emissions, contradicting the NEI. We show here that the steady 2005-2017 decrease in NOx emissions reported by the NEI is in fact largely consistent with observed network trends of surface NO2 and ozone concentrations. The OMI NO2 trend is instead similar to that observed for nitrate wet deposition fluxes, which is weaker than that for anthropogenic NOx emissions, due to a large and increasing relative contribution of non-anthropogenic background sources of NOx (mainly lightning and soils). This is confirmed by contrasting OMI NO2 trends in urban winter, where the background is low and OMI NO2 shows a 2005-2017 decrease consistent with the NEI, and rural summer, where the background is high and OMI NO2 shows no significant 2005-2017 trend. A GEOS -Chem model simulation driven by NEI emission trends for the 2005-2017 period reproduces these different trends, except for the post-2009 flattening of OMI NO2, which we attribute to a model underestimate of free tropospheric NO2. Better understanding is needed of the factors controlling free tropospheric NO2 in order to relate satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 columns to the underlying NOx emissions and their trends. Focusing on urban winter conditions in the satellite data minimizes the effect of this free tropospheric background.

TI  - An Improved Time-Series Model Considering Rheological Parameters for Surface Deformation Monitoring of Soft Clay Subgrade
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Building deformation models consistent with reality is a crucial step for time-series deformation monitoring. Most deformation models are empirical mathematical models, lacking consideration of the physical mechanisms of observed objects. In this study, we propose an improved time-series deformation model considering rheological parameters (viscosity and elasticity) based on the Kelvin model. The functional relationships between the rheological parameters and deformation along the Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR) line of sight are constructed, and a method for rheological parameter estimation is provided. To assess the feasibility and accuracy of the presented model, both simulated and real deformation data over a stretch of the Lungui highway (built on soft clay subgrade in Guangdong province, China) are investigated with TerraSAR-X satellite imagery. With the proposed deformation model, the unknown rheological parameters over all the high coherence points are obtained and the deformation time-series are generated. The high-pass (HP) deformation component and external leveling ground measurements are utilized to assess the modeling accuracy. The results show that the root mean square of the residual deformation is +/- 1.6 mm, whereas that of the ground leveling measurements is +/- 5.0 mm, indicating an improvement in the proposed model by 53%, and 34% compared to the pure linear velocity model. The results indicate the reliability of the presented model for the application of deformation monitoring of soft clay highways. The estimated rheological parameters can be provided as a reference index for the interpretation of long-term highway deformation and the stability control of subgrade construction engineering.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of influenza A (H3N2) infected patients in Jinhua area, and therefore to improve the understanding of infection with H3N2 influenza virus. Methods: The pharynx swab specimens for pathogenic detection were collected from acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases in the fever clinic of the sentinel hospital in Jinhua area from 2014 to 2017. Descriptive statistics method was used to analyze the clinical features and pathogenics characteristics of the patients infected with H3N2 influenza virus. The t test or chi(2) test of independent samples were used for comparison between groups. Results: A total of 3 803 cases of acute respiratory infection (ARI) were reported in the sentinel hospital in Jinhua area from 2014 to 2017. Among them, 245 cases (6.4%) of H3N2 influenza were diagnosed, including 153 males (62.4%) and 92 females (37.6%), aged from 0.5 to 95 years, with an average age of (50.1+15.7) years. They were divided into 5 age groups, with 107 (43.7%) patients aged 60 years and older. The incidence of major diseases was 43.7%. There was no significant difference in the gender in different age groups (chi(2)=4.581, P=0.333). The seasonal peak of H3N2 influenza A virus infection was mainly in summer (In June-September), but was also seen in other months. In the 4 years from 2014 to 2017, there were a total of 4 peaks, which occurred in July-September, July-August, June-August, and June-August. The body temperature of most patients (73.1%) was between 38.0 and 38.9 ℃. The main positive signs of H3N2 influenza A virus infection were different degrees of pharyngeal hyperemia and tonsillar enlargement. Fever (>38 ℃), cough, dizziness, fatigue, sore throat, headache, chills, shortness of breath, runny nose, myalgia, expectoration, nasal congestion were the main symptoms of H3N2 cases. The proportion of abnormal X-ray/CT manifestations in H3N2 influenza A virus infection cases was lower than that of other influenza viruses. 89.8% of the patients were positive for H3N2 influenza A. The average lymphocyte count was (1.1±0.5) * 10(9)/L, total platelet count (157±39) * 10(9)/L in H3N2 influenza A infection group, which were lower than those in other influenza positive patients [(1.2±0.6)*10(9)/L and (165±42) * 10(9)/L], while the neutrophil count (3.6±0.8) * 10(9)/L was higher than that in other influenza positive patients (3.4±1.0) * 10(9)/L(all P<0.05). Conclusions: Patients with H3N2 influenza A in Jinhua mostly presented with throat congestion and tonsillar enlargement in varying degrees, fever (>38 ℃), cough and sputum production. The seasonal peak of influenza A was in summer (June-September). Elderly aged 60 years or older were the susceptible group.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of group A rotavirus in outpatient diarrhea infants and children in Chongqing, China, 2011-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human group A rotavirus (RVA) is the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in children under 5 years old worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the genotype distribution of RVA in the Midwest of China. Sentinel-based surveillance of acute diarrhea was conducted at Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2011 to 2015. RVA was tested by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The partial VP4 genes and VP7 genes of rotavirus were amplified and sequenced, and genotyping and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Among the 2236 stool specimens collected from children with acute gastroenteritis, 681 (30.46%) were positive for RVA. The majority of children (89.28%) who tested positive for RVA were children aged <= 2 years. The seasonal peak of RVA was in the winter. As for genotype, four strain combinations, G9P[8], G3P[8], G1P[8], and G2P[4] contributed to 75.62% (515/681) of the RVA-associated diarrhea cases. After a marked increase in G9P[8] (30.77%) in 2013, G9P[8] became the predominant genotype in 2014 and 2015, whilst the prevalence of G1P[8] was decreased to 2.72% in 2015. Unusual G-P combinations (eg, G1P[4], G9P[4], G4P[6], G3P[4], G2P[8]) were also detected sporadically over the study period. Phylogenetic tree analysis results showed that the VP7 sequences of G9 strains were clustered into two main lineages, and 77.34% of them were clustered into lineage VI, with the highest nucleotide similarity to the strain JS12-17(China). VP4 gene sequences of P[8] strains were almost P[8]-lineage 3. Substantial temporal variation in the circulation of various genotypes of rotavirus in Chongqing was observed during 2011-2015, and highlights the need for continuous surveillance of RVA infection for better understanding and control of RVA infection.

The inventory is used to analyze the origin, spatial distribution, geometry and dynamics of rock glaciers using a combination of optical remote sensing techniques with a geographic information system (GIS). Results show that development of rock glaciers in this region depends strongly on high elevation (> 4000 m a.s.l.) and slope aspect. Rock glaciers are more dominant towards the southern quadrant (S, SE, SW) than the northern quadrant (N, NE, NW). A large number (n = 608) of small (<0.5 km(2)) rock glaciers originating from glacial moraine indicates glacial retreat in this region as one of the major causes for the formation of such a large number of rock glaciers. Median elevation of intact rock glaciers indicates that climatic conditions above 4600 m a.s.l. are suitable for the existence of permafrost in this region and that the lower limit of discontinuous permafrost gradually increases from west to east. Despite mean annual air temperatures below 0 degrees C, increasing mean temperatures during warmest quarter of the year could be a strong controlling factor for permafrost thawing in the region. Logistic regression modeling using WorldClim version 2 climate data sets and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data show that these models can produce fairly reliable estimates of permafrost probability in the studied area. MODIS LST climate data sets can be crucial for mapping and monitoring permafrost in the region.

TI  - MODIS probabilistic cloud masking over the Amazonian evergreen tropical forests: a comparison of machine learning-based methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian tropical forests play a significant role in global water, carbon and energy cycles. Satellite remote sensing is presented as a feasible means in order to monitor these forests. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is amongst major tools for studying this region. Nevertheless, MODIS operative surface variable retrieval was reported to be impacted by cloud contamination effects. A proper cloud masking is a major consideration in order to ensure accuracy when analysing Amazonian tropical forests current and future status. In the present study, the potential of supervised machine learning algorithms in order to overcome this issue is evaluated. In front of global operative MODIS cloud masking algorithms (MYD35 and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC)) these algorithms benefit from the fact that they can be optimized to properly represent the local cloud conditions of the region. Models considered were: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These algorithms are able to provide a continuous measure of cloud masking uncertainty (i.e. a probability estimate of each pixel belonging to clear and cloudy class) and therefore can be used for probabilistic cloud masking. Truth reference dataset (a priori knowledge) requirement was satisfied by considering the collocation of Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations with MODIS sensor. Model performance was tested using three independent datasets: 1) collocated CPR/CALIOP and MODIS data, 2) MODIS manually classified images and 3) in-situ ground data. For satellite image and in-situ testing results were additionally compared to current operative MYD35 (version 6.1) and MAIAC cloud masking algorithms. Satellite image and in-situ testing results show that machine learning algorithms are able to improve MODIS operative cloud masking performance over the region. MYD35 and MAIAC tend to underestimate and overestimate the cloud cover over the study region, respectively. Amongst the models considered, probabilistic algorithms (LDA, GNB and in less extent QDA) provided better performance than RF, SVM and MLP machine learning algorithms as they were able to better deal with the viewing conditions limitation that resulted from collocating MODIS and CPR/CALIOP observations. In particular, best performance was obtained for LDA with a difference in Kappa coefficient (model minus MODIS operative algorithm) of 0.293/0.155 (MYD35/MAIAC, respectively) considering satellite image testing validation. Worst performance was obtained for MLP with a difference in Kappa coefficient of 0.175/0.037. For in-situ testing, models overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient values are higher than MYD35/MAIAC respective values. Models are computationally efficient (swath image calculation time between 0.37 and 9.49 s) and thus being able to be implanted for remote-sensing vegetation retrieval processing chains over the Amazonian tropical forests. LDA stands out as the best candidate because of its maximum accuracy and minimum computational associated.

TI  - Characterization of functional traits with focus on udder health in heifers with divergent paternally inherited haplotypes on BTA18
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A major challenge in modern medicine and animal husbandry is the issue of antimicrobial resistance. One approach to solving this potential medical hazard is the selection of farm animals with less susceptibility to infectious diseases. Recent advances in functional genome analysis and quantitative genetics have opened the horizon to apply genetic marker information for efficiently identifying animals with preferential predisposition regarding health traits. The current study characterizes functional traits with a focus on udder health in dairy heifers. The animals were selected for having inherited alternative paternal haplotypes for a genomic region on Bos taurus chromosome (BTA) 18 genetically associated with divergent susceptibility to longevity and animal health, particularly mastitis.Results: In the first weeks of lactation, the q heifers which had inherited the unfavorable (q) paternal haplotype displayed a significantly higher number of udder quarters with very low somatic cell count (<10,000 cells / ml) compared to their paternal half-sib sisters with the favorable (Q) paternal haplotype. This might result in impaired mammary gland sentinel function towards invading pathogens. Furthermore, across the course of the first lactation, there was indication that q half-sib heifers showed higher somatic cell counts, a surrogate trait for udder health, in whole milkings compared to their paternal half-sib sisters with the favorable (Q) paternal haplotype. Moreover, heifers with the haplotype Q had a higher feed intake and higher milk yield compared to those with the q haplotype. Results of this study indicate that differences in milk production and calculated energy balance per se are not the main drivers of the genetically determined differences between the BTA18 Q and q groups of heifers.Conclusions: The paternally inherited haplotype from a targeted BTA18 genomic region affect somatic cell count in udder quarters during the early postpartum period and might also contribute to further aspects of animal's health and performance traits due to indirect effects on feed intake and metabolism.

TI  - Estimating the size of urban populations using Landsat images: a case study of Bo, Sierra Leone, West Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis is the third paper in a 3-paper series evaluating alternative models for rapidly estimating neighborhood populations using limited survey data, augmented with aerial imagery. MethodsBayesian methods were used to sample the large solution space of candidate regression models for estimating population density.ResultsWe accurately estimated the population densities and counts of 20 neighborhoods in the city of Bo, Sierra Leone, using statistical measures derived from Landsat multi-band satellite imagery. The best regression model proposed estimated the latter with an absolute median proportional error of 8.0%, while the total population of the 20 neighborhoods was estimated with an error of less than 1.0%. We also compare our results with those obtained using an empirical Bayes approach.ConclusionsOur approach provides a rapid and effective method for constructing predictive models for population densities and counts utilizing remote sensing imagery. Our results, including cross-validation analysis, suggest that masking non-urban areas in the Landsat section images prior to computing the candidate covariate regressors should further improve model generality.

TI  - Utilizing Sentinel-1A Radar Images for Large-Area Land Cover Mapping with Machine-learning Methods
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover maps are vital sources of information for many applications. Recently, using high-resolution and open-access satellite images has become a preferred method for mapping land cover, especially over large areas. This study was designed to map the land cover and agricultural fields of a large area using Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Seven machine-learning methods were employed for image analyses. The Random Forest classifier algorithm outperformed the other machine-learning methods in the training step; thus, we selected it for further use and tuned its parameters. After several image processing steps, we classified the final image into 23 land cover classes and achieved an overall accuracy of 42% for all classes, and 57% for agricultural fields. This research note highlights some characteristics and advantages of using Sentinel-1A images and provides novel methods for nation-wide large-area mapping applications.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter at the fluvial-marine transition in the Laptev Sea using in situ data and ocean colour remote sensing
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - River water is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Arctic Ocean. DOC plays an important role in the Arctic carbon cycle, and its export from land to sea is expected to increase as ongoing climate change accelerates permafrost thaw. However, transport pathways and transformation of DOC in the land-to-ocean transition are mostly unknown. We collected DOC and a(CDOM)(lambda)/samples from 11 expeditions to river, coastal and offshore waters and present a new DOC- a(CDOM)(lambda)/model for the fluvial-marine transition zone in the Laptev Sea. The a(CDOM) (lambda)/characteristics revealed that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in samples of this dataset are primarily of terrigenous origin. Observed changes in a(CDOM)(443) and its spectral slopes indicate that DOM is modified by microbial and photodegradation. Ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) provides the absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)(lambda)/(sat)) at lambda = 440 or 443 nm, which can be used to estimate DOC concentration at high temporal and spatial resolution over large regions. We tested the statistical performance of five OCRS algorithms and evaluated the plausibility of the spatial distribution of derived a(CDOM)(lambda)/(sat). The OLCI (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) neural network swarm (ONNS) algorithm showed the best performance compared to in situ a(CDOM)(440) (r(2) = 0 : 72). Additionally, we found ONNS-derived a(CDOM)(440), in contrast to other algorithms, to be partly independent of sediment concentration, making ONNS the most suitable a(CDOM)(lambda)/sat algorithm for the Laptev Sea region. The DOC-a(CDOM)(lambda)/model was applied to ONNS-derived a(CDOM)(440), and retrieved DOC concentration maps showed moderate agreement to in situ data (r(2) = 0.53). The in situ and satellite-retrieved data were offset by up to several days, which may partly explain the weak correlation for this dynamic region. Satellite-derived surface water DOC concentration maps from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data demonstrate rapid removal of DOC within short time periods in coastal waters of the Laptev Sea, which is likely caused by physical mixing and different types of degradation processes. Using samples from all occurring water types leads to a more robust DOC-a(CDOM)(lambda)/model for the retrievals of DOC in Arctic shelf and river waters.

TI  - Assimilation of SMOS brightness temperatures in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperature (T-B) data in numerical weather prediction systems influences the state of the soil, which in turn affects the exchange of energy and water fluxes between the soil and the near-surface atmosphere, with potential implications for the prediction of atmospheric variables. In this paper, the impact of assimilating SMOS T-B alone or in combination with screen-level observations and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals is assessed. Independent quality controlled insitu soil moisture observations belonging to several networks included in the International Soil Moisture Network, were used to validate the quality of both the new soil moisture analyses and the skill to predict soil moisture up to 5 days ahead. The impact on atmospheric variables is indirect and was evaluated through computation of the forecast skill at different lead times. The analysis period was selected to be around the boreal summer, a period of the year when evaporatranspiration fluxes are stronger, and when it is therefore expected that the assimilation of remote-sensing data provides the largest impact on the state of the soil. The results show that the soil moisture state benefits from the direct assimilation of SMOS T-B, especially in better representing the temporal variations of soil moisture. The skill of atmospheric variables is mainly driven by the screen-level observations. Despite the clear benefits to the soil state, remote-sensing data need to be used with screen-level variables to add value to the state of the atmosphere, pointing to inconsistencies in the physical coupling between the land and near-surface components of the ECMWF Earth system.

TI  - High therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Somalia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA/PPQ) are the recommended first- and second-line treatments, respectively, for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Somalia. The studies reported here were conducted to assess the efficacy of these artemisinin-based combinations and the mutations in Plasmodium falciparum K13-propeller (Pfk13) domain and amplification in Pfplasmepsin 2 (Pfpm2) gene in Somalia.Methods: One-arm prospective studies were conducted to assess the clinical and parasitological responses to DHA/PPQ and AL at two sites in 2016 and 2017, respectively, using the standard WHO protocol. The patterns of molecular markers associated with artemisinin and PPQ resistance were investigated for the first time in Somalia.Results: A total of 339 patients were enrolled with 139 for AL and 200 for DHA/PPQ. With AL, no parasite recurrence was observed among patients treated at either site, corresponding to 100% clinical and parasitological responses. For DHA-PPQ, an adequate clinical and parasitological response rate > 97% was observed. All study patients on both treatments at both sites were parasite-free on day 3. Of the 138 samples with interpretable results for the polymorphism in Pfk13, only one (0.7%), from Bosaso, contained a non-synonymous mutation (R622I), which is not one of the known markers of artemisinin resistance. No Pfpm2 amplification was observed among the 135 samples with interpretable results.Conclusions: AL and DHA/PPQ were highly effective in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and there was no evidence of resistance to artemisinin or PPQ. These two combinations are thus relevant in the chemotherapeutic strategy for malaria control in Somalia.

TI  - Learning to walk: Modeling transportation mode choice distribution through neural networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transportation mode distribution has a large implication on the resilience, economic output, social cost of cities and the health of urban residents. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and the availability of remote sensing data have opened up opportunities for bottom-up modeling techniques that allow understanding of how subtle differences in the urban fabric can impact transportation mode share distribution. This project presents a novel neural network-based modeling technique capable of predicting transportation mode distribution. Trained with millions of images labeled with information from a georeferenced transportation survey, the resulting model is able to infer transportation mode share with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.58) from satellite images alone. Additionally, this method can disaggregate data in areas where only aggregated information is available and infer transportation mode share in areas without underlying information. This work demonstrates a new and objective method to evaluate the impact of the urban fabric on transportation mode share. The methodology is robust and can be adapted for cases around the world as well as deployed to evaluate the impact of new developments on the transportation mode choice.

TI  - Development of avalanche information system using remote sensing and GIS technology in the Indian Karakoram Himalaya
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches pose severe threat to lives and property in snow-bound regions of the Western Himalaya. The Karakoram Range in Western Himalaya has the highest mean elevation and is the most glaciated region compared to other ranges. Snowfall in this range is frequent even during summer season. Snow accumulation on mountain slopes results into frequent snow avalanches and several lives have been lost due to snow avalanches in the past. In this communication we discuss about the development of avalanche information system using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technology for the Indian Karakoram Himalaya. High spatial resolution (0.5 m) PLEIADES satellite images and digital elevation model (DEM) of ASTER GDEM V2 (30 m) and Cartosat (10 m) have been used here. Terrain parameters, e.g. slope, aspect, elevation, etc. have been derived using DEM. Sites in avalanche-prone areas have been identified using terrain parameters and snowfall information. Villages in the region, camp locations of border-guarding personnel, pedestrian routes followed by villagers and border-guarding personnel, avalanche sites along pedestrian routes, etc. have been digitized using appropriate GIS vector features, e. g. point, line and polygons. Past avalanche accidents along pedestrian routes, past avalanche occurrences, climatology of the region, etc. have been mapped in GIS environment. Remote sensing and GIS technology proved to be useful for the development of avalanche information system in digital form. The system is being used for avalanche forecasting and mitigation of avalanche hazard in the Indian Karakoram Himalaya.

TI  - Coral habitat mapping: a comparison between maximum likelihood, Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer classifiers
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study deals with the mixed-pixel problem of detecting benthic habitat class membership and evaluates two soft classifiers for coral habitat mapping on Lang Tengah island (Malaysia). A comparison was made between the Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) with a traditional maximum likelihood (ML). The heterogeneous pattern of reef environment, established by field observation, four classes of coral habitats containing various combinations of live coral, dead coral with algae, rubble coral and sand. Posterior probability and belief maps, generated by Bayesian and D-S, respectively, were evaluated by visual inspection and final coral habitat distribution maps were validated via accuracy assessment estimates. The accuracy validation tests agreed with the visual inspection of the probability, uncertainty and coral distribution maps. The Bayesian algorithm performed better, with a 34.7-68.5% improvement in accuracy compared to D-S and ML, respectively. Probability maps demonstrate the advantages of the soft classifier over the hard classifier for coral mapping.

TI  - Strained-layer-superlattice-based compact thermal imager for the International Space Station
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The compact thermal imager (CTI) is a dual-band, strained-layer-superlattice (SLS) detector-based instrument that was installed on the exterior of the International Space Station (ISS) in conjunction with the third Robotic Refueling Mission 3 (RRM3) in 2018. The CTI serves as a pathfinder for future thermal infrared capability on Landsat. The CTI incorporates an SLS hybrid, a dual-band 3-5 and 8-10 mu m, electrically switchable, 320 x 256 array with 30 mu m(2) pixels, bonded to an Indigo ISC0903 Readout Integrated Circuit (ROIC). The telescope was built around an integrated detector cryocooler assembly developed under a NASA Small Business Innovative Research award with QmagiQ, LLC. The cooler is a Ricor K508 and the front-end optics is a custom-designed, doublet lens telescope with a 150 mm focal length. The ground resolution is 80 meters/pixel from the ISS altitude of 400 km. A filter creates two spectral channels from the dual bands, 3.3-5.4 and 7.8-10.2 mu m. The detector hybrid control electronics is a custom-developed system based on the Teledyne Imaging Systems SIDECAR Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. This module provides the electronic interface from the RRM3 SpaceCube on-board processor to the detector/ROIC assembly. The primary goal of this mission was to perform a technology demonstration of the SLS technology and the commercial cooler technology elevating the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to TRL 9 on a bare-bones budget and relatively fast development cycle. Some science objectives include locating fires, approximating land surface temperatures, and monitoring evapo-transpiration, sea ice, and glacier dynamics. In this paper, we will present the design of the focal plane, optics, electronics, and mechanical structure of the CTI. We will also describe the operation and qualification tests that were performed to bring the CTI to the NASA TRL 6 in preparation for the launch on a SpaceX Dragon from the Kennedy Space Center.

M3  - Review
AB  - Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell in most mammals including humans. The primary role of these cells is host defense against microbes and clearance of tissue debris in order to facilitate wound healing and tissue regeneration. The recruitment of neutrophils from blood into tissues is a key step in this process and is mediated by numerous different chemoattractants. The neutrophil migratory response is essential for host defense and survival, but excessive tissue accumulation of neutrophils is observed in many inflammatory disorders and strongly correlates with disease pathology. The vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is a circulating multifunctional plasma protein that can significantly enhance the chemotactic activity of neutrophil chemoattractants both in vitro and in vivo. Recent in vivo studies using DBP deficient mice showed that DBP plays a larger and more central role during inflammation since it induces selective recruitment of neutrophils, and this cofactor function is not restricted to C5a, as prior in vitro studies indicated, but can enhance chemotaxis to many chemoattractants. DBP also is an extracellular scavenger for actin released from damaged/dead cells and formation of DBP-actin complexes is an immediate host response to tissue injury. Recent in vitro evidence indicates that DBP bound to G-actin, and not free DBP, functions as an indirect but essential cofactor for neutrophil migration. DBP-actin complexes always will be formed regardless of what initiated an inflammation, since release of actin from damaged cells is a common feature in all types of injury and DBP is abundant and ubiquitous in all extracellular fluids. Indeed, these complexes have been detected in blood and tissue fluids from both humans and experimental animals following various forms of injury. The published data strongly supports the premise that DBP-actin complexes are the functional neutrophil chemotactic cofactor that enhances neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro and augments neutrophilic inflammation in vivo. This review will assess the fundamental role of DBP in neutrophilic inflammation and injury.

TI  - Management of the Neck in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity and Oropharynx: ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE The aim of the current work is to provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and others on the management of the neck in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx.METHODS ASCO convened an Expert Panel of medical oncology, surgery, radiation oncology, and advocacy experts to conduct a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 1990 through 2018. Outcomes of interest included survival, regional disease control, neck recurrence, and quality of life. Expert Panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.RESULTS The literature search identified 124 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline. Six clinical scenarios were devised; three for oral cavity cancer and three for oropharynx cancer, and recommendations were generated for each one.RECOMMENDATIONS For oral cavity cancers, clinical scenarios focused on the indications for and the hallmarks of a high-quality neck dissection, indications for postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and whether radiotherapy alone is sufficient elective treatment of an undissected neck compared with high-quality neck dissection. For oropharynx cancers, clinical scenarios focused on hallmarks of a high-quality neck dissection, factors that would favor operative versus nonoperative primary management, and clarifying criteria for an incomplete response to definitive chemoradiation for which salvage neck dissection would be recommended. Consensus was reached and recommendations were made for all six clinical scenarios. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/head-neck-cancer-guidelines.

TI  - A Method for Hyperspectral Reflectance Reconstruction from Automatic Observation with Multispectral Radiometer
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for hyperspectral reflectance reconstruction from observed data with an automatic multispectral radiometer is presented. The surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function effect is considered in our method in order to meet the on-orbit calibration requirement of sensors with different spectral characteristics and viewing angles. The satellite-ground synchronous observation data from the National Calibration and Validation Site for High Resolution Remote Sensors arc used to validate the proposed method. The results show that the average relative difference between the reconstructed hyperspectral reflectance and the measured reflectance by a field spectrometer is about 2.67%. Compared with observation values of Sentinel-2A/H, the difference is less than 10% for each band. Furthermore, the results of uncertainty analysis show that uncertainty of hyperspectral reflectance obtained by the proposed method is about 3.31%. The overall uncertainty of radiometric calibration at blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands of Sentinel-2A/B is about 3. 35%, 3. 77%, 1.10%, and 1.29%, respectively.

TI  - Collaboration or competition: The impact of incentive types on urban cycling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bicycling is an important mode of transport for cities and many cities are interested in promoting its uptake by a larger portion of the population. Several cycling mobile applications primarily rely on competition as a motivation strategy for urban cyclists. Yet, collaboration may be equally useful to motivate and engage cyclists. The present research reports on an experiment comparing the impact of collaboration-based and competition-based rewards on users' enjoyment, satisfaction, engagement with, and intention to cycle. It involved a total of 57 participants in three European cities: Munster (Germany), Castello (Spain), and Valletta (Malta). Our results show participants from the study reporting higher enjoyment and engagement with cycling in the collaboration condition. However, we did not find a significant impact on the participants' worldview when it comes to the intentions to start or increase cycling behavior. The results support the use of collaboration-based rewards in the design of game-based applications to promote urban cycling.

TI  - Detecting grassland cover changes through spatiotemporal outlier analysis using remotely sensed time-series data: a case study from Xilingol, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant land cover change (SLCC) in grassland ecosystem includes both conversions in land cover types and critical modifications to specific land cover properties without land cover conversions. A statistics-based framework, known as spatiotemporal outlier analysis (STOA), was proposed to detect SLCC from time-series remote sensing data considering both spatial and temporal contexts. The proposed STOA combines local spatial association analysis (spatial context) and temporal variation analysis (temporal context) to extract spatiotemporal outliers. As the case study, STOA was applied to mapping SLCC on the grassland of Xilinhot, China using time-series MODIS vegetation index during 2000-2015. The results clearly revealed the anisotropic characteristics and spatio-temporal variations in the extracted SLCC, demonstrating meaningful patterns in the land cover changes (LCC). Considering the scale-effect, it is inferred that the detected SLCC is most likely attributed to human-induced impact. We conclude that STOA is a promising tool to quantify LCC for grassland ecosystems.

TI  - On-Orbit Degradation Monitoring Technology for Solar Diffuser Reflectance
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-channel scanning imaging radiometer is installed on the FY-1 meteorological satellite. To realize high-precision quantitative remote sensing, an on-board calibration device is provided. The device primarily uses a solar diffuser (SD) to reflect sunlight as a standard radiance source, and the solar diffuser reflectance degradation monitoring (SDRDM) device regularly monitors the reflectance variation of the SD. This study introduces the working principle of SDRDM and establishes a calculation model of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) degradation factor of the SD based on the characteristics of on-orbit data. The data show that the SDRDM device is affected by temperature and its uncertainty is 0.165% per degrees C. The ratio monitoring method eliminates the influence of temperature. The combined monitoring uncertainties of three channels' degradation factors arc calculated, which is 1.18% (k = 2) for the first channel and 1. 16% (k = 2) for the second and third channels, respectively. These results suggest that the SDRDM device can effectively monitor the degradation of the SD's reflectance.

TI  - Plant functional traits and climate influence drought intensification and land-atmosphere feedbacks
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The fluxes of energy, water, and carbon from terrestrial ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Land-atmosphere feedbacks can intensify extreme climate events like severe droughts and heat-waves because low soil moisture decreases both evaporation and plant transpiration and increases local temperature. Here, we combine data from a network of temperate and boreal eddy covariance towers, satellite data, plant trait datasets, and a mechanistic vegetation model to diagnose the controls of soil moisture feedbacks to drought. We find that climate and plant functional traits, particularly those related to maximum leaf gas exchange rate and water transport through the plant hydraulic continuum, jointly affect drought intensification. Our results reveal that plant physiological traits directly affect drought intensification and indicate that inclusion of plant hydraulic transport mechanisms in models may be critical for accurately simulating land-atmosphere feedbacks and climate extremes under climate change.

TI  - Validation of febrile seizures identified in the Sentinel Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring Program
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Sentinel Initiative was established in 2008 to monitor the safety of FDA-regulated medical products. We evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of ICD-9 codes for post-vaccination febrile seizures to identify optimal algorithms for use in post-market safety surveillance.Methods: We identified ICD-9 diagnosis codes for fever and seizures in the emergency department or inpatient setting after vaccinations of interest from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011. Medical record review was conducted to verify febrile seizure events.Results: Of 216 potential febrile seizures identified with one or more seizure codes (the broadest algorithm), 152 were chart-confirmed (i.e., documentation of fever within 24 h of seizure or clinician diagnosis of febrile seizure; PPV 70%, 95% CI 64, 76%). Two codes specific for febrile seizures produced the highest PPV (PPV 91%, 95% CI 85, 95%) and accounted for 140 confirmed febrile seizures. In the absence of febrile seizure codes, other seizure codes yielded much lower PPVs, regardless of the presence of fever codes.Conclusions: Our results indicate that ICD-9 diagnosis codes in the inpatient and emergency department settings have high predictive value for identifying febrile seizures within the Sentinel Distributed Database. While the PPV of the algorithm based on any diagnosis code for seizure is moderate, the algorithm limited to febrile seizure codes has a high PPV (>90%) and captures the vast majority of confirmed cases identified by the broadest algorithm, suggesting that the narrower algorithm limited to febrile seizure,codes may be preferred.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the feasibility and application value of toluidine bule-dextran-40 (TB-Dex-40) as the tracer for lymphatic system in head and neck region. Methods: Twenty healthy adult New Zealand white rabbits were equally divided into two groups: the experimental group (TB-Dex-40 group, n=10) and the control group (TB group, n=10). Rabbits in experimental group received submucosal injection of 1.0% (0.14 mOsm/L) TB-Dex-40, and the control group received injection of 1.0% (32.60 mOsm/L) TB.The staining time and fading time of lymphatic vessels and lymphnodes in the neck region were recorded, and the diffusion ranges of the two dyes in the tongue region were measured. Lymph nodespecimen were collected for pathological examination after 10 min, 1 hour and 4 weeks of staining. The experimental animals were sacrificed before and 4 weeks after the experiment. After death, organs of heart, lung, liver and kidney were examined pathologically. Results: TB-Dex-40 reached sentinel lymph node (SLN) and stained lymphatic vessels at an average of (21.67±0.19) s after injection, while in control group was(3.22±0.34) s (P<0.01). The time difference between the two dyes reaching sentinel lymph nodes was statistically significant.The durations from lymphatic staining to marked fading were (19.70±1.34) min in experimental group and (14.30±0.95) min in control group, respectively.The difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). SLN staining by TB-Dex-40 was still evident after 4 weeks, while TB staining has completely faded after 2 d.The average ranges of diffusionin tongue were (10.50±1.08) mm in experimental group and (20.00±1.05) mm in controlgroup, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.01).No abnormalities were found in blood test and pathological examination of main organs. Conclusions: TB-Dex-40 has high specificity forstaining lymphatic vessels and is a good tracer with potential clinical value.

TI  - Multi-decadal hydrologic change and variability in the Amazon River basin: understanding terrestrial water storage variations and drought characteristics
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the interannual and interdecadal hydrological changes in the Amazon River basin and its sub-basins during the 1980-2015 period using GRACE satellite data and a physically based, 2 km grid continental-scale hydrological model (LEAF-Hydro-Flood) that includes a prognostic groundwater scheme and accounts for the effects of land use-land cover (LULC) change. The analyses focus on the dominant mechanisms that modulate terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations and droughts. We find that (1) the model simulates the basin-averaged TWS variations remarkably well; however, disagreements are observed in spatial patterns of temporal trends, especially for the post-2008 period. (2) The 2010s is the driest period since 1980, characterized by a major shift in the decadal mean compared to the 2000s caused by increased drought frequency. (3) Long-term trends in TWS suggest that the Amazon overall is getting wetter (1.13 mm yr(-1)), but its southern and southeastern subbasins are undergoing significant negative TWS changes, caused primarily by intensified LULC changes. (4) Increasing divergence between dry-season total water deficit and TWS release suggests a strengthening dry season, especially in the southern and southeastern sub-basins. (5) The subsurface storage regulates the propagation of meteorological droughts into hydrological droughts by strongly modulating TWS release with respect to its storage preceding the drought condition. Our simulations provide crucial insight into the importance of sub-surface storage in alleviating surface water deficit across Amazon and open pathways for improving prediction and mitigation of extreme droughts under changing climate and increasing hydrologic alterations due to human activities (e.g., LULC change).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate Finnish theology students' experiences of the learning environment provided by their faculty in relation to their personal worldview. Previous research has shown that theology students deal with the fundamental spiritual and religious questions in their learning processes both before and during their studies, irrespective of their career goals or professional orientation. This study was conducted among second-year higher education students of theology. The students responded to a questionnaire concerning their experiences of the learning environment in relation to their own religious or ideological worldview and experienced position in the learning context as part of the majority, minority or non-religious group. According to the results, students affiliated with majority and minority religious groups were more strongly committed to their personal worldviews than non-religious students were. The students' experiences of the learning environment varied regarding the group they identified themselves.

TI  - Hydromorphological attributes for all Australian river reaches derived from Landsat dynamic inundation remote sensing
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Hydromorphological attributes such as flow width, water extent, and gradient play an important role in river hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes and can help to predict river conveyance capacity, discharge, and flow routing. While there are some river width datasets at global or regional scales, they do not consider temporal variation in river width and do not cover all Australian rivers. We combined detailed mapping of 1.4 million river reaches across the Australian continent with inundation frequency mapping from 27 years of Landsat observations. From these, the average flow width at different recurrence frequencies was calculated for all reaches, having a combined length of 3.3 million km. A parameter gamma was proposed to describe the shape of the frequency-width relationship and can be used to classify reaches by the degree to which flow regime tends towards permanent, frequent, intermittent, or ephemeral. Conventional scaling rules relating river width to gradient and contributing catchment area and discharge were investigated, demonstrating that such rules capture relatively little of the real-world variability. Uncertainties mainly occur in multi-channel reaches and reaches with unconnected water bodies. The calculated reach attributes are easily combined with the river vector data in a GIS, which should be useful for research and practical applications such as water resource management, aquatic habitat enhancement, and river engineering and management. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.25914/5c637a7449353 (Hou et al., 2019).

TI  - Utilization of bioelectrical impedance analysis for detection of lymphedema in breast Cancer survivors: a prospective cross sectional study
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer survivors are at risk of developing breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) after surgical treatment, which may have a negative effect on quality of life. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical role of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and the relationship between the development of BCRL in breast cancer survivors who have undergone axillary surgery.MethodsA total of 228 patients with breast cancer were enrolled in the study between May 2016 and January 2017. BCRL was assessed by measuring the circumference of both arms at 15cm below the acromion process and the olecranon process. Patients were classified as BCRL (n=22) and non-BCRL (n=206) based on the difference of the arm circumference of 2cm. Data including lymphedema, anthropometry, BIA measurements, food frequency questionnaire, type of surgery, total number of dissected lymph nodes, and post-operative treatment were collected.ResultsOf the breast cancer survivors, 10.4% had BCRL by the definition. The BCRL group contained 22 patients, while the non-BCRL group contained 206 patients. Compared to the non-BCRL group, the BCRL group had a higher body mass index, a larger percentage of ideal body weight, more dissected lymph nodes, and higher single frequency BIA (SFBIA) ratio (P=0.027, P=0.031, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). The SFBIA ratio provided 63.64% sensitivity and 95.15% specificity in estimating the risk of BCRL.ConclusionOur data provides evidence to support that the use of SFBIA ratio can serve as an alternative method to monitor and/or diagnose BCRL.Trial registrationThis trial was retrospectively registered at Clinicaltrials.govidentifier (NCT03391206) on the 5 January 2018.

TI  - Anthropogenic modifications to fire regimes in the wider Serengeti-Mara ecosystem
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a key driver in savannah systems and widely used as a land management tool. Intensifying human land uses are leading to rapid changes in the fire regimes, with consequences for ecosystem functioning and composition. We undertake a novel analysis describing spatial patterns in the fire regime of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, document multidecadal temporal changes and investigate the factors underlying these patterns. We used MODIS active fire and burned area products from 2001 to 2014 to identify individual fires; summarizing four characteristics for each detected fire: size, ignition date, time since last fire and radiative power. Using satellite imagery, we estimated the rate of change in the density of livestock bomas as a proxy for livestock density. We used these metrics to model drivers of variation in the four fire characteristics, as well as total number of fires and total area burned. Fires in the Serengeti-Mara show high spatial variability-with number of fires and ignition date mirroring mean annual precipitation. The short-term effect of rainfall decreases fire size and intensity but cumulative rainfall over several years leads to increased standing grass biomass and fuel loads, and, therefore, in larger and hotter fires. Our study reveals dramatic changes over time, with a reduction in total number of fires and total area burned, to the point where some areas now experience virtually no fire. We suggest that increasing livestock numbers are driving this decline, presumably by inhibiting fire spread. These temporal patterns are part of a global decline in total area burned, especially in savannahs, and we caution that ecosystem functioning may have been compromised. Land managers and policy formulators need to factor in rapid fire regime modifications to achieve management objectives and maintain the ecological function of savannah ecosystems.

TI  - Unpacking the Theory of African American Offending: A Qualitative Exploration of Racial Socialization Processes and Their Effects on African American Male College Students
T2  - RACE AND JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2011, Dr. James Unnever and Dr. Shaun Gabbidon introduced a Theory of African American Offending, which posits that African American offending is motivated in part by common experiences of racism. They argue that these experiences contribute to a shared worldview that includes both an accumulation of bad feelings toward pro-social institutions and legal cynicism toward the justice system, leading to decreased social bonds and a greater predilection toward delinquency. They also suggest that racial socialization can help to mitigate these effects of racism. Previous studies have found support for this idea, but few have examined the mechanisms by which racial socialization takes place. The current study uses qualitative interviews to explore the racial socialization process among a sample of Black male college students in a Midwestern public university. The findings reveal that racial socialization processes vary widely among male college students in terms of content (police contact, dating, safety), sources (parents, grandparents, peers, and other adult role models), timing, and the effect on social bonds to White-dominated institutions. Implications of the findings for the research on race, racial socialization, social problems, and criminological theory are presented and discussed.

TI  - Postoperative complications in combined gynecologic, plastic, and breast surgery: An analysis from National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients undergoing the addition of a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy with unilateral breast cancer have an increased and potentially doubled post-operative complication rate. One documented detriment from post-operative complications is the potential delay in initiating adjuvant therapy. To determine if the addition of a gynecologic and/or plastic reconstructive procedure to breast surgery results in an increased risk of postoperative complications and re-admissions, we evaluated outcomes in patients undergoing single vs multi-site surgery in a large national surgical database. We utilized the National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to identify patients who underwent breast surgery between 2011 and 2015. We extracted patients who underwent prophylactic oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy as a comparison group. Chi square analysis was used to assess postoperative outcomes including complications, readmission, and reoperation. All statistics were performed in SPSS v. 24. During the study timeframe, 77 030 patients had a solitary or combined breast surgical procedure and a second cohort of 124 patients underwent gynecologic surgery. Breast cancer patients who did not have a simultaneous reconstruction or gynecologic procedure were older with more comorbidities. Patients undergoing coordinated procedures had a significantly longer length of stay, higher complication, readmission, and reoperation rates (P < 0.001 for all) as compared with patients who underwent single site surgery. Patients with surgery for breast cancer, either with a plastic or gynecologic procedure, have greater postoperative complications. Higher complication rates for those with coordinated operations may lead to delays in adjuvant therapy and discussions regarding the indications for simultaneous surgery are recommended.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Over the Nepalese Cryosphere Derived From an Empirical Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Himalayan region, aerosols received much attention because they affect the regional as well as local climate. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observation from satellite are limited in the Himalayan region mainly due to high surface reflectance. To overcome this limitation, we have conducted a multivariate regression analysis to predict the AOD over the cryospheric portion of Nepalese Himalaya. Prediction using three meteorological variables from ERA-Interim: relative humidity, wind velocity components (U10 and V10) were taken into account for model development as independent variables, while the longest time series AOD observation at Pokhara station is used as dependent variable. Model coefficients were found significant at 95 percent level with 0.53 coefficients of determination for daily values. Correlation coefficients between model output and AERONET observations were found to be 0.68, 0.73, 0.75, 0.83, and 0.82 at Lumbini, Kathmandu Bode (KTM-BO), Kathmandu University (KTM-UN), Jomson, and Pyramid laboratory/observatory (EVK2CNR) AERONET stations, respectively. Model overestimate AOD at Jomsom, and EVK2CNR AERONET stations while slightly underestimates AOD in Lumbini, KTM-UN, and KTM-BO AERONET station, respectively. Both model output and MODIS observation showed that the highest AOD over Nepal is observed during winter and pre-monsoon season. While lowest AOD is observed during monsoon, and post-monsoon season. The result of this research supports that the use of linear regression model yields good estimation for daily average AOD in Nepal. The model that we have presented could possibly be used in other mountain regions for climate research.

TI  - Effects of River Geomorphology on River Ice Freeze-up and Break-up Rates Using MODIS Imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating driving factors of river ice freeze-up and break-up is critical for the understanding associated with river ice processes, as well as for providing a means to predict potential natural hazards of river ice formation or deformation. Spatiotemporal changes from fifteen years (2000-2015) of MODIS reflectance band 2 images were analyzed in pixel-wise linear regressions to be used as an indicator of the rates of ice freeze-up and break-up along the Slave River (Canada). The random forest algorithm was used to model the rates using river corridor slope, effective width, shape, and sinuosity as a set of predictor variables. The results reveal that the selected predictor variables can explain about 80% and 70% of the variations in ice freeze-up and break-up rates along the Slave River respectively. The slope was the most important factor in determining both freeze-up and break-up rates, followed by shape, effective width, and sinuosity. The spatiotemporal patterns of river freeze-up and ice-cover break-up obtained from the analysis of MODIS data and geomorphological variables show strong agreement with ground observations and hydrometeorological conditions along the Slave River.

TI  - Divergent changes in the elevational gradient of vegetation activities over the last 30 years
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reported progressive change of vegetation activity along elevational gradients has important aesthetic and conservation values. With climate change, cooler locations are suggested to warm faster than warmer ones, raising concerns of a more homogenized landscape along the elevation. Here, we use global satellite data to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the elevational gradient (EG) in vegetation greenness (NDVImax3), spring (SOS) and autumn phenology (EOS) during 1982-2015. Although we find clear geographical patterns of the EG in NDVImax3 and SOS, there are no prevalent trends of vegetation homogenization or phenology synchronization along elevational gradients. Possible mechanisms, including spatially heterogeneous temperature lapse rate changes, different vegetation sensitivities to climate change, and human disturbances, may play diverse roles across different regions. Our finding of mixed EG trends and no general rules controlling EG dynamics poses challenges for mitigating possible adverse impacts of climate change on mountainous biological diversity and ecosystem services.

TI  - The great Atlantic <i>Sargassum</i> belt
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pelagic Sargassum is abundant in the Sargasso Sea, but a recurrent great Atlantic Sargassum belt (GASB) has been observed in satellite imagery since 2011, often extending from West Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. In June 2018, the 8850-kilometer GASB contained > 20 million metric tons of Sargassum biomass. The spatial distribution of the GASB is mostly driven by ocean circulation. The bloom of 2011 might be a result of Amazon River discharge in previous years, but recent increases and interannual variability after 2011 appear to be driven by upwelling off West Africa during boreal winter and by Amazon River discharge during spring and summer, indicating a possible regime shift and raising the possibility that recurrent blooms in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea may become the new norm.

TI  - Effects of reclamation and natural changes on coastal wetlands bordering China's Yellow Sea from 1984 to 2015
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are rapidly disappearing worldwide, which is posing a substantial threat to the integrity of coastal ecosystems. In addition to the direct area reduction caused by reclamation, coastal wetlands experience natural changes due to sediment transport in coastal regions. Arguably, the reclamation rates must be less than the net accretion rate to guarantee the restoration of coastal wetlands. By applying an automatic and replicable shoreline algorithm to all available Landsat imagery from 1984 to 2015 using the Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform, we developed distribution maps of coastal wetlands and reclamation in China's Yellow Sea (CYS) at 4- or 5-year intervals. In addition, we divided coastal wetlands into saltmarshes and mudflats and analysed their trends separately. Over the past 30 years, the area of coastal wetlands decreased by 53% (from 6,463 to 3,036 km(2)), including a 67% decrease in saltmarshes (from 1,471 to 489 km(2)) and a 49% decrease in mudflats (from 4,992 to 2,547 km(2)). Meanwhile, the reclaimed area was 7,696 km(2) (including 1,276 km(2) of saltmarshes and 3,002 km(2) of mudflats), which exceeded the area of newly formed coastal wetlands (852 km(2)). The natural state of mudflats gradually changed from accretion to erosion, but without considering the natural state of coastal wetlands, reclamation will continue at a high rate in CYS according to China's national marine functional zoning (MFZ) for 2010-2020. In view of their important ecological services, there is an urgent need to revise the national MFZ to achieve 'no net loss' of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Reducing the effects of vegetation phenology on change detection in tropical seasonal biomes
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical seasonal biomes (TSBs), such as the savannas (Cerrado) and semi-arid woodlands (Caatinga) of Brazil, are vulnerable ecosystems to human-induced disturbances. Remote sensing can detect disturbances such as deforestation and fires, but the analysis of change detection in TSBs is affected by seasonal modifications in vegetation indices due to phenology. To reduce the effects of vegetation phenology on changes caused by deforestation and fires, we developed a novel object-based change detection method. The approach combines both the spatial and spectral domains of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using a pair of Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 images acquired in 2015 and 2016. We used semivariogram indices (SIs) as spatial features and descriptive statistics as spectral features (SFs). We tested the performance of the method using three machine-learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The results showed that the combination of spatial and spectral information improved change detection by correctly classifying areas with seasonal changes in NDVI caused by vegetation phenology and areas with NDVI changes caused by human-induced disturbances. The use of semivariogram indices reduced the effects of vegetation phenology on change detection. The performance of the classifiers was generally comparable, but the SVM presented the highest overall classification accuracy (92.27%) when using the hybrid set of NDVI-derived spectral-spatial features. From the vegetated areas, 18.71% of changes were caused by human-induced disturbances between 2015 and 2016. The method is particularly useful for TSBs where vegetation exhibits strong seasonality and regularly spaced time series of satellite images are difficult to obtain due to persistent cloud cover.

M3  - Article
AB  - As we reflect on the leisure science canon, we use this occasion to ponder how our scholarship has engaged with communities with alternative worldviews compared with the Euro-North American worldview dominant in leisure scholarship. While some Indigenous cultural practices may, at first glance, seem similar to behaviors found in Euro-North American leisure space-time, such a comparison is often problematic when an Indigenous language has no equivalent concept or word for leisure and the worldview assumes a different relational reality. Drawing on our ongoing research working with Kanaka Hawai'i, we offer a discussion of the relevance and need for Ieisure scholars and practitioners to engage with Indigenous worldviews, ways of knowing and being. We specifically focus on approaches and dispositions relevant to scholars and practitioners as we look to nourishing possibilities for richer relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples through leisure.

TI  - Rethinking Idris-i Bidlisi: An Iranian Bureaucrat and Historian between the Shah and the Sultan
T2  - IRANIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A bureaucrat and historian of Iranian origin, Idris-i Bidlisi (b. Ray/Iran 1457-d. Istanbul 1520), is undoubtedly one of the most original and important intellectual figures in the Ottoman-Iranian borderland in the sixteenth century. He lived in a very turbulent period and established different relationships with Iranian and Ottoman dynasties at the end of the fifteenth century and at the beginning of the sixteenth century. He and his works have been the focus of long-standing historical debates in Turkey that have continued to the present day. Until now, most modern scholarly works on Bidlisi have failed to provide a proper, in-depth textual and historical analysis. As a result, such modern works have come to present a skewed, romanticized image of Bidlisi, largely detached from the nature and dynamics of the historical context in which Bidlisi lived and evolved as an intellectual and writer. This paper provides a realistic appraisal of Bidlisi and discusses the shortcomings of modern historiography on him. By looking at Bidlisi and his corpus, and more specifically at the ways in which the latter was shaped by Bidlisi's patronage relationships, the paper aims to open up a window into Bidlisi's evolving mindset and worldview. In other words, through an in-depth analysis of his corpus and new archival sources the paper strives to unveil the intellectual life and career of an Iranian bureaucrat and historian positioned between Ottoman-Iranian borderland and provide a glimpse into the nature of patronage in the sixteenth century.

TI  - Proposing an agricultural belt to protect a city's semi-rural characteristics: The example of Bartin, Turkey
T2  - LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl, a type of urban expansion, is perceived as a global problem due to changes in land conversions and landscape patterns. Farms, forests and shores have been converted into urban areas; this transformation affects energy flow, biochemical cycles and climatic conditions. To follow and evaluate the physical, social and ecological results of urban sprawl, we identified and measured temporal changes in land use and land cover. This is especially important for urban planning policies. In this study, temporal change is identified in the city of Bartin using remote sensing and landscape metrics. An analysis of land cover and land transformation was done with LANDSAT5 TM/ETM satellite images from 1985 and 2015. These images were used to identify agricultural areas as land that has most commonly undergone drastic changes. Bartin is a small semi-rural city that has undergone significant changes. Among the most important reasons for these changes were uncontrolled urban sprawl due to political and administrative decisions that lacked long-term planning and a comprehensive city plan. This study examined the risk factors for loss of semi-rural characteristics using the example of Bartin city. To protect semi-rural city characteristics and control urban sprawl, we propose an agricultural belt based on spatial suitability and an evaluation of landscape metrics.

TI  - Axillary sentinel node biopsy in prone position for melanomas on the upper back or nape
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY AND HAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - In patients with melanomas on the upper back or nape, axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB), when performed in the traditional supine position, is often disturbed by scattered radiation emitted from the primary tumor site. The results from the present study suggestthat axillary SLNB performed in the prone position can solve this problem. We compared two consecutive groups of patients with melanomas of the dorsal trunk or nape who received axillary SLNB performed either in the supine (n = 119) or in the prone position (n = 130). The number of SLNs detected and excised was significantly higher in prone position group (2.4 +/- 1.5 SLNs versus 1.9 +/- 0.95 SLNs, p = 0.002). Using the prone position, intra-operative repositioning of the patient for excision of a primary site of the upper back or neck was not necessary. The SLN identification rates and the SLN-positivity rates did not differ significantly between the two types of intraoperative patient positioning. There were no significant differences in survival outcomes or false-negative rates. In conclusion, axillary SLNB in prone position yields a higher number of excised SLNs in patients with melanomas of the upper back or nape. Axillary SLNB in prone position is easy to perform and reliable. Intraoperative repositioning of the patient is not necessary, which saves time and resources.

TI  - Quantifying annual land-cover change and vegetation greenness variation in a coastal ecosystem using dense time-series Landsat data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover change may affect water and carbon cycles when transitioning from one land-cover category to another (land-cover conversion, LCC) or when the characteristics of the land-cover type are altered without changing its overall category (land-cover modification, LCM). Given the increasing availability of time-series remotely sensed data for earth monitoring, there has been increased recognition of the importance of accounting for both LCC and LCM to study annual land-cover changes. In this study, we integrated 1,513 time-series Landsat images and a change-updating method to identify annual LCC and LCM during 1986-2015 in the coastal area of Zhejiang Province, China. The purpose was to quantify their contributions to land-cover changes and impacts on the amount of vegetation. The results show that LCC and LCM can be successfully distinguished with an overall accuracy of 90.0%. LCM accounted for 22% and 40.5% of the detected land-cover changes in reclaimed and inland areas, respectively, during 1986-2015. In the reclaimed area, LCC occurred mostly in muddy tidal flats, construction land, aquaculture ponds, and freshwater herbaceous land, whereas LCM occurred mostly in freshwater herbaceous land, Spartina alterniflora, and muddy tidal flats. In the inland area, both LCC and LCM were concentrated in forest and dryland. Overall, LCC had a mean magnitude of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) change similar to that of LCM. However, LCC had a positive effect and LCM had a negative effect on NDVI change in the reclaimed area. Both LCC and LCM in the inland area had negative impacts on vegetation greenness, but LCC resulted in larger NDVI change magnitude. Impacts of LCC and LCM on vegetation greenness were quantified for each land-cover type. This study provided a methodological framework to take both LCC and LCM into account when analyzing land-cover changes and quantified their effects on coastal ecosystem vegetation.

TI  - A generalized simulation capability for rotating-beam scatterometers
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rotating-beam wind scatterometers exist in two types: rotating fan-beam and rotating pencil-beam. In our study, a generic simulation frame is established and verified to assess the wind retrieval skill of the three different scatterometers: SCAT on CFOSAT (China France Oceanography SATellite), WindRad (Chinese Wind Radar) on FY-3E, and SeaWinds on QuikSCAT. Besides the comparison of the so-called first rank solution retrieval skill of the input wind field, other figures of merit (FoMs) are applied to statistically characterize the associated wind retrieval performance from three aspects: wind vector root mean square error, ambiguity susceptibility, and wind biases. The evaluation shows that, overall, the wind retrieval quality of the three instruments can be ranked from high to low as WindRad, SCAT, and SeaWinds, where the wind retrieval quality strongly depends on the wind vector cell (WVC) location across the swath. Usually, the higher the number of views, the better the wind retrieval, but the effect of increasing the number of views reaches saturation, considering the fact that the wind retrieval quality at the nadir and sweet swath parts stays relatively similar for SCAT and WindRad. On the other hand, the wind retrieval performance in the outer swath of WindRad is improved substantially as compared to SCAT due to the increased number of views. The results may be generally explained by the different incidence angle ranges of SCAT and WindRad, mainly affecting azimuth diversity around nadir and number of views in the outer swath. This simulation frame can be used for optimizing the Bayesian wind retrieval algorithm, in particular to avoid biases around nadir but also to investigate resolution and accuracy through incorporating and analyzing the spatial response functions of the simulated Level-1B data for each WVC.

TI  - Assessment of gaseous emissions and radiative forcing in Indian forest fires
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Studies
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports a study of the gaseous emissions from Indian forest fires from 2005 to 2016 and their potential impact on radiative forcing. Initially, forest burned area is quantified using MODIS-MCD45A1 data. Results showed that annual burned area of the study period ranges from 8439 km(2) to 25,442 km(2) and the maximum forest area is burned during February, March, and April in any year. Gaseous emissions are estimated using emission factors, the mass of fuel available for combustion, combustion factor, and burned area. CO2, CO, and CH4 are the major emissions during forest fires with an annual average of 105 x 10(6) tonnes, 6 x 10(6) tonnes, and 3.25 x 10(5) tonnes, respectively. The average radiative forcing (RF) for CO2, CH4, and N2O is estimated as 1.8 Wm(-2), 0.49 Wm(-2,) and 0.177 Wm(-2), respectively. An important finding in the present study is the recurrence of forest fires during the pre-monsoon season.

TI  - Variability of bulk water vapor content in the marine cloudy boundary layers from microwave and near-infrared imagery
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work uses the synergy of collocated microwave radiometry and near-infrared imagery to study the marine boundary layer water vapor. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) provides the total column water vapor, while the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared imagery provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor under certain conditions. As a byproduct of this algorithm, we also store cloud top information of the MODIS pixels used, a proxy for the inversion height, as well as the sea surface temperature and total column water vapor from the AMSR measurements. Hence, the AMSR-MODIS dataset provides several of the variables associated with the boundary layer thermodynamic structure. Comparisons against radiosondes and GPS radio occultation (GPSRO) data demonstrate the robustness of these boundary layer water vapor estimates. We explore the annual cycle of the number of observations as a proxy for stratus cloud amount, in well-known stratus regions; we then exploit the 16 years of AMSR-MODIS synergy to study for the first time the annual variations of the boundary layer water vapor in comparison to the sea surface temperature and the boundary layer cloud top height (equivalent to the inversion height) climatologies, and lastly we explore the climatological behavior of these variables on stratocumulus-to-cumulus transitions.

TI  - Linking remotely sensed Urban Green Space (UGS) distribution patterns and Socio-Economic Status (SES)-A multi-scale probabilistic analysis based in Mumbai, India
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGS) offer social and environmental benefits that enhance quality of life of the residents. However, due to the underlying social and economic disparities, different sections of urban population have disproportionate level of access to UGS. The environmental inequity owing to the varied UGS distribution poses a challenge to urban planners in efficient resource allocation. This study attempts to counter this challenge using a novel remote sensing-based approach. The variations in UGS distribution (in terms of quantity, quality and accessibility) across the neighbourhoods in Mumbai vis-a-vis the socio-economic status (SES) of neighbourhood residents are assessed using remote sensing-based indicators. Further, as these indicators are susceptible to the effect of changing scales, a multi-scale approach is adopted to study the potential variations in the relationship between SES and spatial metrics of UGS with spatial resolution. The neighbourhood SES was assessed using the newly developed Socio-Economic Status Index (SESI) and the neighbourhoods were classified into multiple SES categories. The UGS were extracted from remotely sensed data using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and their spatial distribution aspects were characterized using indicators at neighbourhood level. The variations in indicators of UGS distribution in the neighbourhoods belonging to different SES categories were analysed using a logistic regression model. The results showed that, while quantity of UGS is not statistically associated with neighbourhoods SES, the quality and accessibility aspects of UGS share a statistically significant relation with SES. Also, this relation was found to vary significantly with spatial resolutions. Further, it was found that the neighbourhoods with higher SES in Mumbai have a better access to green spaces, indicating spatial inequities in UGS distribution in Mumbai. This study has important implications for planning equitable green spaces in cities that are currently in urbanization transition.

TI  - Two decades observing smoke above clouds in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean: Deep Blue algorithm updates and validation with ORACLES field campaign data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents and evaluates an updated algorithm for quantification of absorbing aerosols above clouds (AACs) from passive satellite measurements. The focus is biomass burning in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean during the 2016 and 2017 ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign deployments. The algorithm retrieves the above-cloud aerosol optical depth (AOD) and underlying liquid cloud optical depth and is applied to measurements from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) from 1997 to 2017. Airborne NASA Ames Spectrometers for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research (4STAR) and NASA Langley High Spectral Resolution Lidar 2 (HSRL2) data collected during ORACLES provide important validation for spectral AOD for MODIS and VIIRS; as the SeaWiFS mission ended in 2010, it cannot be evaluated directly. The 4STAR and HSRL2 comparisons are complementary and reveal performance generally in line with uncertainty estimates provided by the optimal estimation retrieval framework used. At present the two MODIS -based data records seem the most reliable, although there are differences between the deployments, which may indicate that the available data are not yet sufficient to provide a robust regional validation. Spatiotemporal patterns in the data sets are similar, and the time series are very strongly correlated with each other (correlation coefficients from 0.95 to 0.99). Offsets between the satellite data sets are thought to be chiefly due to differences in absolute calibration between the sensors. The available validation data for this type of algorithm are limited to a small number of field campaigns, and it is strongly recommended that such airborne measurements continue to be made, both over the southern Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - EUMETSAT Satellite Conference
CL  - Tallinn, ESTONIA
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) represents a new generation of satellite imagers for global operational observations. In many aspects, it is comparable to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operated since 2000, i.e. almost for two decades. The Canada Centre for Remote Sensing has developed a unique MODIS processing chain to produce a long-term time series of clear-sky composites and some terrestrial products at 250?m spatial resolution over a 5700?km???4800?km region centered on Canada. The paper describes an extension of the MODIS time series at the top of the atmosphere level using VIIRS data. The VIIRS clear-sky composites are produced on a 250-m spatial grid for I-bands and a 500-m grid for M-bands. Nominal products are generated as 10-day composites, while snow mask and normalized difference vegetation index are generated as daily products. Preliminary assessment of VIIRS versus MODIS composites has been conducted through comparison of value-added warm season snow/ice probability maps and minimum snow/ice extent. The results demonstrate a high level of consistency (with the average different difference around 0.12%), which indicates that the developed VIIRS processing technology produces results that can potentially be used to extend MODIS time series into the future.

TI  - Long-short-term-memory-based crop classification using high-resolution optical images and multi-temporal SAR data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland parcel-based crop classification using satellite data plays an important role in precision agriculture. In this study, a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method employing optical images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is presented for crop classification for cloudy and rainy regions. Central to this method is the spatial-temporal incorporation of high-resolution optical images and multi-temporal SAR data and deep-learning-based time-series analysis. First, a precise farmland parcel map is delineated from high-resolution optical images. Second, pre-processed SAR intensity images are overlaid onto the parcel map to construct time series of crop growth for each parcel. Third, a deep-learning-based (using the long short-term memory, LSTM, network) classifier is employed to learn time-series features of crops and to classify parcels to produce a final classification map. The method was applied to two datasets of high-resolution ZY-3 images and multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data to classify crop types in Hunan and Guizhou of China. The classification results, with an 5.0% improvement in overall accuracy compared to those of traditional methods, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for parcel-based crop classification for southern China. A further analysis of the relationship between crop calendars and change patterns of time-series intensity indicates that the LSTM model could learn and extract useful features for time-series crop classification.

TI  - Improving the disaggregation of MODIS land surface temperatures in an urban environment: a statistical downscaling approach using high-resolution emissivity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially and temporally dense land surface temperature (LST) data are necessary to capture the high variability of the urban thermal environment. Sensors on board satellites with high revisit time cannot provide adequately detailed spatial information; thus, the downscaling of LST is recognized as being an important and inevitable intermediate process. In this paper, improvement in the downscaled LST accuracy is investigated, employing the statistical downscaling methodology in an urban setting. A new approach is proposed, where thermal radiances are disaggregated using multiple regression analysis and are then combined with emissivity values derived from a high-resolution image classification. Predictors include reflectance values, built-up and vegetation indices, and topographic data. Surface classification is performed utilizing machine learning techniques and fusing Sentinel-2 imagery with ancillary data. Thermal data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor are downscaled from their original resolution to 100 m in the city of Athens, Greece. Validation of sharpened temperatures is performed using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) surface temperature product and in-situ measurements. It is demonstrated that the proposed downscaling framework using ridge regression has the potential to produce reliable, high temporal LST estimates with an average error of fewer than 2 K, while consistently having a better accuracy than the reference, single-predictor downscaling of the MODIS LST product.

TI  - Towards an object-based multi-scale soil moisture product using coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of the new generation of microwave and optical sensors with unique characteristics, the multi-sensor fusion for the soil moisture retrieval has given rise to a considerable research interest. The Sentinel satellites enable operational soil moisture mapping with moderate accuracy while providing regular temporal coverage and high spatial resolution at no cost to the users. In the meantime, working at the object level enables us to take advantage of some of the unique capabilities of this approach. This letter outlines an object-based approach for the multi-scale soil moisture retrieval by coupling the single polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data. To fulfil this goal, a broad range of optical and texture features was extracted from the optical and single polarization mode SAR data. Subsequently, the relevant features were properly selected using the Random Forest-Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE) algorithm. Then, the selected features were imported to the segmentation process to create the image objects. Afterwards, the support vector regression (SVR) technique was used to estimate the soil moisture value of the image objects and to conduct the multi-scale soil moisture retrieval with a small training database. It is observed that the proposed approach can provide multi-scale soil moisture maps with a reasonable accuracy in different applications requiring different scale requirements.

TI  - Ground subsidence observation of solid waste landfill park using multi-temporal radar interferometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence on landfill parks needs to be consistently and periodically measured because the landfill areas tend to subside unexpectedly. Although in-situ measurements have been adopted in general, these have a number of limitations of spatial and temporal resolutions because of the high cost. However, the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) can overcome these disadvantages. In this study, we carried out two experiments using the InSAR method. We then compared the interferometric coherence between ALOS PALSAR and TerraSAR-X data and measured the ground subsidence using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data acquired from ascending and descending paths. The mean coherences from the ALOS PALSAR and TerraSAR-X interferograms were 0.26 and 0.54, respectively. The coherence from TerraSAR-X was nearly 2 times higher than that of ALOS PALSAR, despite its shorter wavelength of radar signal. These results showed that the data with the shorter temporal baseline is appropriate to monitor the ground subsidence on landfill park areas. As a result of measuring surface deformation, the mean line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rates estimated from the small baseline subset (SBAS) method were -2.4 and -3.2 cm/year for the ascending and descending data of TerraSAR-X, respectively. Also, the mean deformation rate in the vertical and east-west directions were -5.7 and -1.7 cm/year, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) of InSAR measurements by comparing with the in-situ measurements was about 1.2 cm/year and the coefficient of determination () was about 0.97. These results indicated good agreements between the InSAR measurements and the in-situ measurements.

AB  - A micro-relief map (1:90,000 scale) and a geomorphological map (1:25,000 scale) of the central sector of the Po Plain (northern Italy) are presented. The geomorphological map represents fluvial and anthropogenic landforms as well as the distribution of the textures of superficial alluvial deposits. It resulted from the integration of different study methods, including remote sensing data analysis, field surveys and grain size analysis of superficial deposits. The micro-relief map was a fundamental tool for identifying many inconspicuous landforms. The geomorphological map can provide local authorities with useful information for correct territorial management and planning, in particular for seismic and flood hazard assessment.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to detect and map MSV using RapidEye multispectral sensor in Ofcolaco farm. To achieve this objective, the acquired RapidEye sensor was classified using the robust Random Forest algorithm. Furthermore, the variable importance technique was used to determine the influence of each spectral band and indices on the mapping accuracy. For better performance of image data, the value of the commonly used vegetation indices in improving the classification accuracy was tested. The results revealed that the use of RapidEye spectral bands in detection and mapping of MSV yielded good classification results with an overall accuracy of 82.75%. The inclusion of vegetation indices computed from RapidEye sensor improved the classification accuracies by 3.4%. The most important RapidEye spectral bands in classifying MSV were near infrared, blue and red-edge. On the other hand, the most important vegetation indices were the Soil adjusted vegetation index, Enhanced vegetation index, Red index and Normalized Vegetation Index. The current study recommends future studies to assess the importance of multi-temporal remote sensing applications in detecting and monitoring the spread of MSV.

TI  - Atmospheric aerosol pollution across China: a spatiotemporal analysis of satellite-based aerosol optical depth during 2000-2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing attention has been paid to the deterioration of air quality in China during the past decade. This study presents the spatiotemporal variations of aerosol concentration across China during 2000-2016 using aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the atmospheric product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Percentile thresholds are applied to define AOD days with different loadings. Temporally, aerosol concentration has increased since 2000 and reached the highest level in 2011; then it has declined from 2011 to 2016. Seasonally, aerosol concentration is the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. Spatially, North China and Sichuan Basin are featured by high aerosol concentration with increasing trends in North China and decreasing trends in Sichuan Basin. North, Southeast and Southwest China have been through increasing days with low AOD loading; however, Northeast China has experienced increasing days with high AOD loading. It is likely that air quality influenced by aerosols has notably improved over North China in spring and summer, over Southwest and Southeast China in autumn, but has degraded over Northeast China in autumn.

TI  - An evaluation of energy balance parameters, and the relations between topographical and biophysical characteristics using the mountainous surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy balance parameters are very important in various applications such as energy global cycle, environment, climatic change monitoring, weather forecast, agriculture. The present study evaluates the influence of topographical conditions on the amount of downward shortwave radiation (SWD) of the surface, as well as the relation between surface Net radiation with biophysical characteristics and region's land use's. For this purpose, Landsat images, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and a set of sample points have been used. To calculate the downward shortwave radiation and Net radiation fluxes, it has employed the mountainous SEBAL algorithm. Greenness, Brightness, Wetness, Normalization Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalization Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Albedo parameters considered as surface biophysical characteristics. Brightness, NDBI and Albedo information shows the percentage of impervious x200f; surfaces while Greenness and NDVI information is related to vegetation percentage and Wetness information concerns water-related rates as well as the wetness of the soil, plant, and built-up lands. Statistical analysis has been used to study the relationship between different parameters. Results show that the slope is the most influential topographical parameters on the amount of SWD of the surface. There is a reverse relation between the variants of SWD of the surface, and the slope of the surface, in second-degree polynomial form with a Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of 0.82. North aspect receive the minimum SWD average with a 681 W m(-2) while flat lands receive the maximum SWD average with a 783 W m(-2). Areas with the highest elevation, lowest slope, and flatlands, receive the highest SWD. Built-up lands have the lowest Net radiation flux average with a 595 W m(-2) while water has the highest Net radiation flux average with a 761 W m(-2). Net radiation flux is directly related with NDVI, Greenness and Wetness parameters, while it is reversely related to NDBI, Albebo and Brightness with a high r.

TI  - Vegetation patterns in a South American coastal wetland using high-resolution imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the main plant communities in a temperate coastal wetland using high-resolution imagery. We produced a map of Samborombon Bay at 1:25,000 scale using a WorldView-2 image. An Object-based Image Analysis approach was chosen, and an unsupervised classification algorithm was applied. Overall classification accuracy was 81%, and the Kappa index was 78.1%. Six land cover types were mapped including four main natural monospecific plant communities. The lower intertidal area was dominated by mudflats without vegetation and stands of Bolboschoenus maritimus. The middle intertidal area was dominated by Sarcocornia ambigua, while, in the higher intertidal area, Sporobolus densiflorus and grasslands with Cortaderia selloana prevailed. We found four spatial patterns at a landscape scale, based on the presence and spatial distribution of the natural plant communities. This map represents a valuable tool for future studies on wetland environmental indicators.

TI  - Can forest pattern affect the distribution and abundance of <i>Arhopalus rusticus</i> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)? A landscape perspective in central Argentina
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2006, Arhopalus rusticus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) has expanded its range in the pine production area of Cordoba Province (Argentina). In this paper, we analyse the effect of landscape pattern on the distribution and abundance of A. rusticus. Land cover was estimated using Landsat 8 scenes. Landscape was quantified by estimating the Total Class Area, which showed a positive relationship with A. rusticus abundance, and Mean Euclidean distance and Mean Shape index, which had a negative relationship. Since its arrival, Arhopalus rusticus has proved to be a successful invader, affected by the landscape pattern of the patches.

TI  - A novel change detection approach for VHR remote sensing images by integrating multi-scale features
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel change detection (CD) method for very high-resolution images is proposed by integrating multi-scale features. First, a novel edge density matching index was designed, and the structural similarity of textures, including grey level co-occurrence matrix, Gaussian Markov random field, and Gabor features between bitemporal images, were extracted to measure changes. Then, an adaptive approach was proposed to select optimal textures based on the majority consistency between spectrum and textures. Afterward, all features were decomposed into multi-scale features and fused into initial CD maps using Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Finally, advantage fusion was implemented to generate the final CD map by fusing initial CD maps to remove noise and preserve details. Experiments conducted on real SPOT 5 and simulated QuickBird datasets, which achieved the total error ratios of 8.74% and 2.50%, respectively, indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of urban growth in selected small, medium and large Indian cities
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to ascertain the spatial and temporal variations in the evolution of Indian cities using multi-date remote sensing data. A two-stage object-based nearest neighbour classification approach with hierarchical segmentation was used to extract built-up area in selected small, medium and large cities, whereas object-based temporal inversion was applied for change analysis. The temporal trend of net population density, degree of scattered development and compactness of urban core in each city was determined using the built-up area. The study observed a declining trend in growth rate of built-up area in small and medium sized-cities, in contrast to large cities. However, the net population density in cities of all types is decreasing as urban growth has outpaced the corresponding population growth. Furthermore, small and medium cities indicated greater tendency for scattered development in comparison to large cities, whereas the core urban areas of the later appeared relatively less compact.

TI  - Monitoring Islamic Archaeological Landscapes in Ethiopia Using Open Source Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The African landscape is set to change dramatically in the coming years, and will have a detrimental impact on the inherent archaeological and cultural heritage elements if not monitored adequately. This paper explores how satellite imagery, in particular open source imagery (Google Earth, multispectral satellite imagery from Landsat and Sentinel-2), can be utilized to monitor and protect sites that are already known with particular reference to Islamic archaeological sites in Ethiopia. The four sites used are in different geographic and geomorphological areas: three on the Somali Plateau (Harlaa, Harar, and Sheikh Hussein), and one on the edge of the Afar Depression (Nora), and have varied histories. The results indicate that open source satellite imagery offers a mechanism for evaluating site status and conservation over time at a large scale, and can be used on data from other areas of Africa by heritage professionals in the African continent at no cost.

TI  - Estimating cholera risk from an exploratory analysis of its association with satellite-derived land surface temperatures
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Occurrence and growth of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is linked to modalities of elevated temperatures and heavy precipitation. Previous studies have employed temperature- and satellite-derived precipitation data to determine the risk of cholera, but predictions were limited because of the coarse spatial resolution of temperature data (about 50 km). Cholera estimation has a severe impact on those in vulnerable regions with marginal civil infrastructure and those suffering additional damage after a natural disaster. In this study, a new remote-sensing data-based algorithm is proposed that includes a pathway to associate coarse-resolution cholera prediction with high-resolution land surface temperature (LST) dataset. The algorithm allows identification and prediction of regions with elevated risk of cholera at least four weeks in advance. Additionally, it employs a hierarchical structure comprising long-term anomalous LST values to determine hot spots of potential Vibrio cholerae. The algorithm was tested in five cholera epidemic regions of Sub-Saharan Africa (Mozambique, Central African Republic, Cameroon, South Sudan, and Rwanda), with realistic accuracy in demarcating regions where human cholera cases had been reported.

TI  - A geospatial approach to assessing land change in the built-up landscape of Wa Municipality of Ghana
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban landscapes are changing in response to changes in socio-economic conditions. Land change scientists seek to understand these land dynamics in the coupled human-environment system of urban landscapes. This study assessed land change in the built-up area of Wa Municipality between 1986 and 2016 using Landsat images. We used the Support Vector Machine algorithm for classifying the images. We recorded image classification accuracies of 97%, 95%, 92% and 96% for the 1986, 1996, 2006 and 2016 classified images, respectively. Our study finds that over the 1986?2016 period, agricultural land and bare land transitioned to build-up land by 9.23% and 3.79%, respectively, as compared to 2.79% for vegetation and 0.05% for water. Our in-municipal level analysis thus shows that urban landscapes could expand more sustainably by targeting other dominant land categories instead of the vegetation cover. The findings in this paper could serve as a spatial model for planning and reducing the unintended socio-ecological impacts of expansion in the built-up area.

TI  - The <i>Orlando Furioso</i> Atlas: A Digital-Cartographic Study of a Sixteenth-Century Epic
T2  - ITALIAN CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the genesis, architecture, and scholarly and pedagogical implications of the Orlando furioso Atlas (http://furiosoatlas.com). Ludovico Ariosto's sixteenth-century narrative poem, the Orlando furioso, represents the epitome of the Renaissance romance epic genre. This Digital Humanities project aims to translate cartographically the Furioso through the creation of interactive maps for each of the poem's 46 cantos. This initiative in literary mapping is but the latest in a long tradition of visual and cartographic illustrations of the Furioso meant to supplement and elucidate the poem, helping readers to visualize and interpret the many intricately woven narrative strands and the vast geographic space that make up this dizzyingly complex work. The characters' travels are traced onto Martin Waldseemuller's contemporaneous world map that portrays a worldview in flux, facilitating an understanding of the interaction of the real and the fantastic in the poetic text, in the cartographic text, and in readers' imaginations. The fundamental role of student research assistants in the creation of this project, as well as the role of this and similar projects in maintaining a place for Italian Studies at the heart of the liberal arts college and the humanities at large, are also discussed.

TI  - A new total generalized variation induced spatial difference prior model for variational pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposed a new and effective total generalized variation (TGV) induced spatial difference prior model for variational pansharpening problem, which aimed to estimate a high-resolution (HR) multispectral (MS) image from its low-resolution (LR) version and the corresponding HR panchromatic (Pan) image of the same earth scene. In addition to using the local spectral consistency constraint for spectral information preserving, this letter particularly exploited the spatial difference prior between the HR-MS and Pan images, and hence proposed a new TGV-induced spatial difference prior term for spatial information preserving. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm was designed for solving the proposed model under the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) framework. Finally, the experimental results validated that the proposed method performed higher spatial and spectral qualities than various methods in both the subjective and objective aspects.

TI  - Weakly supervised classification of time-series of very high resolution remote sensing images by transfer learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In multi-temporal remotely sensed data analysis, labeling samples from each image is often a required process, this is however very tedious and time-consuming. In many cases the ground objects do not change significantly through time, and one can reuse some of the labels with appropriate consistency verification. In this letter, a novel weakly supervised transfer learning framework is proposed to classify multi-temporal remote-sensing images with only one labeled image. By utilizing the consistency of time-series images and a domain adaptation method, our framework is able to classify all the other multi-temporal images chronologically without any labeling effort for these images. Our framework achieves a similar level of classification accuracy as if it were through supervised learning. Our framework is shown to be effective for processing multi-temporal remote-sensing images when training samples are only available for one temporal dataset.

TI  - Healthcare seeking behaviour for common infectious syndromes among people in three administrative regions of Johannesburg, South Africa, 2015: a cross-sectional study
T2  - PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: hospital-based surveillance programs only capture people presenting to facilities and may underestimate disease burden. We conducted a healthcare utilisation survey to characterise healthcare-seeking behaviour among people with common infectious syndromes in the catchment areas of two sentinel surveillance hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods: a cross-sectional survey was conducted within three regions of Johannesburg from August to November 2015. Premises were randomly selected from an enumerated list with data collected on household demographics and selected syndromes using a structured questionnaire. Fisher's exact or chi-square tests were used to determine association of characteristics among different regions. Results: of 3650 selected coordinates, 3358 were eligible dwellings and 2930 (87%) households with 9850 individuals participated. Four percent of participants (431/9850) reported influenza-like illness (ILI) in the last 30 days; equal numbers of participants (0.2%, 20/9850) reported pneumonia or tuberculosis symptoms in the last year and <1% reported diarrhoea or meningitis symptoms. Sixty eight percent (295/431) of participants who reported ILI, 75% (6/8) of children with diarrhoea and all participants who reported pneumonia (20), tuberculosis (20) or meningitis (6) sought healthcare. For all syndromes most sought care at registered healthcare providers. Of these only 10% (24/237) attended sentinel hospitals, predominantly those that lived closer to the hospitals. In contrast, of patients with meningitis, 50% (3/6) sought care at sentinel hospitals. Conclusion: patterns of seeking healthcare differed by syndrome and distance from facilities. Surveillance programs are still relevant in collecting information on infectious syndromes and reflect a proportion of the hospital's catchment area.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Dolutegravir is recommended worldwide as a first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for individuals living with HIV. A recent study reported increased rates of neural tube defects in infants of dolutegravir-treated women. This study examined rates of congenital anomalies in infants born to women living with HIV (WLWH) in Canada. Design The Canadian Perinatal HIV Surveillance Programme captures surveillance data on pregnant WLWH and their babies and was analysed to examine the incidence of congenital anomalies. Setting Paediatric HIV clinics. Population Live-born infants born in Canada to WLWH between 2007 and 2017. Methods Data on mother-infant pairs, including maternal ART use at conception and during pregnancy, are collected by participating sites. Main outcome measures Congenital anomalies. Results Of the 2423 WLWH, 85 (3.5%, 95% CI 2.85-4.36%) had non-chromosomal congenital anomalies. There was no evidence of a significant difference in rates of congenital anomalies between women who were on ART in their first trimester (3.9%, CI 1.7-7.6%) or later in the pregnancy (3.9%, 95% CI 2.6-5.6%). Four of the 80 (5.0%, 95% CI 1.4-12.3%) neonates born to WLWH on dolutegravir during the first trimester had congenital anomalies, none were neural tube defects (95% CI 0.00-3.10%). Conclusion Despite recent evidence raising a safety concern, this analysis found no signal for increased congenital anomalies. Tweetable abstract Five percent of the infants of Canadian women living with HIV on dolutegravir at conception had congenital anomalies; none had neural tube defects.

TI  - Operational system for automatic coastal upwelling detection in the Baltic Sea based on the 3D CEMBS model
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The upwelling in the Baltic Sea region is very common phenomenon. According to different studies, in some places it can exist almost one-third of the year leading to vertical mixing and transporting fresh, rich in nutrients water from deeper layers to the surface. The upwelling phenomenon has been analysed for years 2010-2016, during thermally stratified period, i.e. between May and September. Surface layer temperature from coupled ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea - 3D CEMBS was analysed together with NOAA/AVHRR satellite SST observations. Wind data from weather forecasting model - UM from ICM UW were also analysed to describe favourable conditions for the upwelling occurrences. The research includes statistical analysis of entire Baltic Sea region as well as particular examples from selected areas. Areas of upwelling occurrences were found along almost entire coastline of the Baltic Sea. Main areas were located along Swedish coast in Baltic Proper, Oland and along Finnish coast in the Gulf of Finland, where the event can last up to 30% of the time. Other areas, with frequencies over 20%, include Polish coast, Gotland and Bay of Bothnia. It was determined that collected results were in good agreement with earlier studies, with satellite data giving slightly higher frequencies closer to the shore. Based on these results, an automated coastal upwelling detection system was designed and launched in operational mode together with the 3D CEMBS model.

T2  - ANIMAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an emerging mosquito-borne zoonotic flaviviral disease. The present study was undertaken with the objective to develop TaqMan real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for rapid detection and quantification of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in swine blood and mosquito vectors. The amplification of envelope (E) gene was targeted by designing gene-specific MGB TaqMan fluorescent probe along with the primers. The best performance in terms of sensitivity was achieved by standardized TaqMan real-time RT-PCR with a detection limit of 2.8 copies/reaction and it was found to be 4-log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR. The applicability of the standardized TaqMan assay was evaluated by screening representative sets of field swine blood samples and mosquito pools for JEV. The viral load ranged between 3.32 x 10(7)-4.2 x 10(2) copies/ml of swine blood samples, and 5.7 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(2) copies/pool of mosquitoes. The standardized assay which is highly sensitive, specific and rapid would aid in screening sentinel swine and mosquitoes under JEV surveillance programs for effective prevention and control of disease in human beings.

TI  - Dictionary-based classifiers for exploiting feature sequence information and their application to hyperspectral remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of classification is shared across various disciplines. Designing even less computationally demanding and more effective classifiers has been a key challenge for researchers for many years. No single classifier can be highly effective for all types of datasets and thus, depending on the data distribution, various classifiers have been proposed in the literature. To our knowledge, feature values have been vastly exploited as the base for discriminating classes, while feature sequence information has been somehow under-exploited so far. In the proposed approach normalised features are sorted and ranked, creating a sequence of finite numbers. The associated rank of the created sequence is used as an additional feature, which in a way defines the sample-specific intra-feature relationship. Three novel dictionary-based approaches such as Sequence Classifier (SC), Sequence-dictionary-based k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier (SDk-NN) and Combined-dictionary-based k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier (CDk-NN) are proposed in this paper. In the case of remotely sensed data, and specifically in Hyper-Spectral Images (HSI), the spectral features (Spectral signatures) represent a strong, object-specific spectral relationship, which is a key point in our proposed approach. In this case, indeed, the proposed classifiers were tested over various (five) HS datasets and found to be effective. Based on the classifiers features, two derived distance measures are proposed and validated for the HS dataset, namely: the Normalised Sequence Distance (NSD) measure and Combined Distance (CD) measure. These measures appear to overperform the conventional Normalised Euclidean Distance (NED) in this context. Also, validation for both binary and multi-class datasets are experimented and their performances are evaluated in terms of accuracy and other standard measures. Experimental results over 21 datasets revealed that the proposed approaches perform comparably, and in some cases even better than other classifiers. Stack-operated, class-specific sparse dictionaries are also introduced in order to reduce the computational complexity, which can be used as an active learning-based approach for optimal training sample selection. Additional tests were performed with variable levels of dictionary sparsity for assessing its impact on accuracy.

TI  - Whale Optimization Algorithm and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System: a hybrid method for feature selection and land pattern classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is a robust method in solving non-linear classification by employing a human-readable interpretation manner. This paper verified a hybrid model, named WANFIS, where Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) was used for feature selection and tuning parameters of the ANFIS for land-cover classification. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, was selected as a case study, because of its complex surface morphology. The model was trained and validated with different data sets, which were subsets of the segmented objects from SPOT 7 satellite data (1.5 m in panchromatic and 6 m multiple spectral bands). The image segmentation was carried out by using PCI Geomatics software (evaluation version), and output objects with associated spectral, shape, and metric information were selected as input data to train and validate the proposed model. For accuracy assessment, the performance of the model was compared to several benchmarked classifiers by using standard statistical indicators such as Receiver Operator Characteristics, Area under ROC, Root Mean Square Error, Absolute Mean Error, Kappa index, and Overall accuracy. The results showed that WANFIS outperformed the other in almost all training data sets for both operations. It could be concluded that the examination of the classification model in different training data sizes is significant, and the proper determination of predictor variables and training sizes would improve the quality of classification of remotely sensed data.

TI  - The cultural and religious underpinnings of moral teaching according to English language teachers' perceptions: a case study from Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we attempt to explore a distinctive worldview as it pertains to Iranian education. We do this by focusing on the moral component implicit in English Language Teaching (ELT) in Iran and the challenges that might be experienced among ELT teachers when engaging in moral teacher practice, including making moral decisions in relation to their teaching. For this purpose, 30 ELT teachers working at Shiraz University's Language Learning Centre volunteered to describe morality in teaching and used narrative to elicit their personal stories and understandings of the challenges entailed in making moral decisions and their justifications. The article aims to determine: how ELT teachers' perceived morality is manifested in their teaching; what kinds of moral conflicts they identify in ELT; and, how they set out to resolve these conflicts. Through content analyses, we concluded that ELT teachers defined the moral component in teaching as consisting of: a balanced relationship with the learners; being on time; and, effective teaching. Moreover, they stated that mismatches between their ideologies and external codes are the biggest challenges they experience in making moral decisions. To resolve these challenges, they mostly referred to the cultural values cultivated by their religion, together with their family backgrounds, in order to justify their decisions.

TI  - A survey of remote sensing image classification based on CNNs
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - With the development of earth observation technologies, the acquired remote sensing images are increasing dramatically, and a new era of big data in remote sensing is coming. How to effectively mine these massive volumes of remote sensing data are new challenges. Deep learning provides a new approach for analyzing these remote sensing data. As one of the deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can directly extract features from massive amounts of imagery data and is good at exploiting semantic features of imagery data. CNNs have achieved remarkable success in computer vision. In recent years, quite a few researchers have studied remote sensing image classification using CNNs, and CNNs can be applied to realize rapid, economical and accurate analysis and feature extraction from remote sensing data. This paper aims to provide a survey of the current state-of-the-art application of CNN-based deep learning in remote sensing image classification. We first briefly introduce the principles and characteristics of CNNs. We then survey developments and structural improvements on CNN models that make CNNs more suitable for remote sensing image classification, available datasets for remote sensing image classification, and data augmentation techniques. Then, three typical CNN application cases in remote sensing image classification: scene classification, object detection and object segmentation are presented. We also discuss the problems and challenges of CNN-based remote sensing image classification, and propose corresponding measures and suggestions. We hope that the survey can facilitate the advancement of remote sensing image classification research and help remote-sensing scientists to tackle classification tasks with the state-of-art deep learning algorithms and techniques.

TI  - A novel change detection method combined with registration for SAR images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel change detection method combined with image registration. Inspired by the mutual beneficial property of change detection and image registration, we model these two tasks into a unified process and represent this process as an optimization problem. Then, we use the alternating direction method (ADM) algorithm with proper initialization to solve the optimization problem. Finally, we use spatial information to refine the changed component obtained by the ADM algorithm. Experimental results accomplished over synthetic data and RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images demonstrate that the proposed method can improve both the accuracy of image registration and change detection.

TI  - Evaluating metrics derived from Landsat 8 OLI imagery to map crop cover
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing techniques are required to generate agricultural land cover maps to monitor agricultural fields. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) offers reflectance data over the visible to shortwave-infrared range. OLI offers several advantages, such as adequate spatial and spectral resolution, and 16 day repeat coverage, furthermore, spectral indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI possess great potential for evaluating the status of vegetation. Additionally, classification algorithms are essential for generating accurate maps. Recently, multi-Grained Cascade Forest, which is also called deep forest, was proposed, and it was shown to give highly competitive performance for classification. However, the ability of this algorithm to generate crop maps with satellite data had not yet been evaluated. In this study, the reflectance at 7 bands and 57 spectral indices calculated from Landsat 8 OLI data were evaluated for its potential for crop type identification.

TI  - Assessing the efficiency of multispectral satellite and airborne hyperspectral images for land cover mapping in an aquatic environment with emphasis on the water caltrop (<i>Trapa natans</i>)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of clear issues are pertinent when considering whether, or not, to use a remotely sensed dataset. We evaluate these issues here by comparing an aerial hyperspectral image at 1.5 m geometric resolution that comprises 128 narrow bands within a spectral range between 400 nm and 1,000 nm as well as a nine-band Landsat 8 image at 30.0 m geometric resolution. We therefore applied Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers utilizing different input data sets to determine the best thematic accuracy for both types of images by involving all possible bands and then minimized them using variable selection and dimension reduction via Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF). We then compared Landsat images to an aerial hyperspectral one. The results of this analysis revealed that band selections based on variable importance and MNF-transformation improved thematic accuracy assessed as Overall Accuracy (OA). Results reveal a 1.00% improvement in OA via variable selection as 59 bands instead of 128 bands and a 1.50% via MNF-transformation of the hyperspectral image. This improvement was 4.52% in the Landsat image when using a MNF-transformation compared to the best performances without transformation or variable selection. Data also showed that application of Landsat spectral range on hyperspectral bands resulted in different outcomes; specifically, SVM resulted in a 91.50% OA while RF resulted in 95.50% OA. Landscape ecology results show that use of the Landsat image provided fewer land cover patches and that differences encompassed 6.30% of the whole area. We therefore conclude that Landsat data can be used with a number of limitations for accurate ecological mapping.

TI  - Study on shoreline monitoring system based on satellite SAR imagery
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study develops a SAR-based shoreline monitoring system which consists of: (i) selection of SAR scenes suitable for shoreline detection; (ii) extraction of shoreline from the selected scenes; and (iii) estimation of the shoreline at arbitrary water level. The first model focused on ALOS-2 SAR scenes and determined fitting formulae for estimation of the backscattering coefficients at a sea and a beach surfaces. To quantify the suitability of scenes for shoreline detection, a parameter, P, was newly introduced. The value of P represents a probability at which a backscattering coefficient at a beach becomes higher than the one at a sea and it was confirmed that P reasonably indicates suitability of scenes for shoreline detection. A shoreline extraction technique was then developed based on the edge detection technique. Bilateral filter was applied to reduce the speckle noise of SAR images and wavelet transform was applied to detect the edge location. Validity of the proposed technique was confirmed through application of the present technique to Shimizu and Shonan coasts. Finally, a simple polynomial function was introduced to represent the shoreline location at arbitrary water level. Applicability of the proposed technique was also tested and validated against the detailed data obtained by image analysis.

TI  - Evaluation of standard and regional satellite chlorophyll-a algorithms for moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Bohai and Yellow Seas, China: a comparison of chlorophyll-a magnitude and seasonality
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of satellite remotely sensed chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in coastal regions such as the Bohai and Yellow Seas (BYS) is challenging due to their complex oceanic and atmospheric optical properties. The standard OC3M (ocean chl-a three-band algorithm for MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer)) algorithm has been widely used in the BYS, despite well-known uncertainties about its accuracy in terms of absolute magnitude. This was based on the belief that OC3M chl-a is capable of representing reliable relative spatial and temporal patterns of sea surface chl-a concentrations. In this study, the ability of the standard OC3M chl-a algorithm to reproduce accurate seasonality patterns was evaluated, based on comparisons with in situ chl-a measurements in the BYS. The results quantified the overestimation by the standard OC3M algorithm with a median absolute percentage difference of 98.48% and a median relative difference of 1.13 mg m(-3).More importantly, the seasonality from OC3M chl-a was significantly biased relative to the seasonal patterns of in situ chl-a. In addition, a regional GAM (generalized additive model)-based satellite chl-a algorithm was evaluated and compared with OC3M chl-a. The results showed the GAM chl-a improved accuracy in both magnitude and seasonality when compared with in situ chl-a, relative to that from OC3M chl-a.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics using the universal normalized vegetation index (UNVI): An optimized vegetation index-VIUPD
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper propose a universal normalized vegetation index (UNVI), which is an improved vegetation index (VI) based on the universal pattern decomposition method (UPDM), termed VIUPD. We also derive new matrices to facilitate convenient calculation of the UNVI based on data from the MODIS and Landsat-TM, ETM, OLI satellite sensors. We compared the performance of the UNVI to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and modified soil adjusted vegetation index 2 (MSAVI2) to estimate the vegetation dynamics (chlorophyll content and leaf area index [LAI]). The results show that the UNVI was more sensitive to vegetation dynamics than the NDVI, EVI and MSAVI2. The UNVI has a higher LAI saturation point than the other three indices. The UNVI can be used to monitor global changes in above ground biomass (AGB) and gross primary production (GPP) with respect to a wide range of vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Effects of agriculture, climate, and policy on NDVI change in a semi-arid river basin of the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1999, the Grain for Green Project was implemented by the Chinese government. Since then, the vegetation of Zuli River Basin, a semi-arid river basin of the Chinese Loess Plateau, has been greatly changed. Clearly understanding the impact of natural and artificial factors on vegetation change is important for policy making and ecosystem management. In this study, spatio-temporal variations in vegetation cover in Chinese Zuli River Basin during 1999-2016 were investigated using Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Analyses of several indicators, including changes in NDVI in different slopes and land use changes and the relationships between climatic factors and NDVI change, were presented to quantitatively evaluate the effects of agriculture, climate, and policy on NDVI change. The NDVI in the Zuli River Basin increased during the study period, and the main contributors to this change were forest in 1999-2011, cropland, abandoned farmland, and grassland in 2009-2016, and land with slopes <= 15 degrees. Land with slope > 15 degrees, where the "Project" was implemented, slightly contributed to the increase in regional NDVI. In 1999-2011, the project (-98.16%) combined with climate change (-68.18%) showed negative effects on the increase in NDVI in the Zuli River Basin, but agriculture (22.28%) played a positive role in increasing this index. In 2009-2016 and 1999-2016, the project (38.45% and 35.25%, respectively), the project combined with climate change (49.83% and 46.30%, respectively), agriculture (18.61% and 23.30%, respectively), promoted increases in NDVI in the basin.

TI  - Research on multimorbidity in primary care. Selected abstracts from the EGPRN meeting in Tampere, Finland, 9-12 May 2019 All abstracts of the conference can be found at the EGPRN website: www.egprn.org/page/conference-abstracts
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Meeting
AB  - Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide range of health services, including prevention and public health promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained. According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too. Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need more in the future is more research on new practices and models.Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication? Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland, randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist, filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n = 59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19% of the patients in the control group and for 68% in the intervention group. Shortly after the appointment, only 14% of the patients in the control group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32% in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64% in the control group vs 95% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new antihypertensive medications.Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation. Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP) trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018, trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44 of them 65.7% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5%) refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their achievements. 'Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion: Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees.Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3%) were classified as having peripartum depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs. Incidences of depression were 17.4% in women with a history of antidepressant medication, 16% among women with diabetes, and 11.8% among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without. Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy may help identify women in need of support.Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions. This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102 were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49 years. The participants' age had a significant influence on sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438 participants, 33.3% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7% general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education. 'Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction: 49.8% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently. Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies, reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial. According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests the term 'effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE. Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3, 2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword 'Hawthorne Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting. Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its implication as an experimental artefact.Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise. Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming. Recent eHealth tools, such as the 'systematic tool to reduce inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10 patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria (version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients' willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss primary care in this new eHealth environment.Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide. Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions. How often it happened towards young doctors working as general practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9%, female 87%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of the residents were working in an urban practice (63%), others in the rural and the suburban once (27%, 10%). All GP residents experienced patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them. High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was experienced by 44%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual harassment) by 84% while all residents experienced verbal violence. Only 13.2% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions. Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing.Background: About 50% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France. Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development, validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and 18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65 years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence: motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE protocol.Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe how these associations differ across different European countries and regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+ years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis will take into account differences between countries and regions. Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits, social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants (49.09%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95%CI: -1.29, -1.24) with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in Israel, -0.67 (95%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL.Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking, hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy. Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004 with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7%) were diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the age of 45 onwards was 94.0% (95%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8% (95%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was associated with a 9.0-year delay (95%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants without risk factors was 6.0 years (95%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent 21.6% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8% for those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45 years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up. Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of morbidity of NCDs.Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how: financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of recording diagnoses was about 40% in the primary care units. After four years, the recording rate had risen to 90% (p < 0.001). The rate of change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public.Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and communities and remains undiscovered in 90% of the cases. In total, 80% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the Netherlands, at least 3% (118 000) of children are victims of child abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3% of abuse cases are reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs' experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results: Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling that 'something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients' trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other professionals.Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts, especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life (QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results: There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of QoL among patients with multimorbidity.Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care. Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity. Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e. decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up? Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status 'decompensation' or 'nothing to report' was collected. A logistic regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6% of the population, had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days. Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039). Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others in medical literature.Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the 20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods: Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure using electronic medical records based on the International Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness diversity.Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations. Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods: Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the 'homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training, and for further research in these five countries.Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively. Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2. Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement scores.Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research, which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now. There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that 'intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different challenges to researchers and health services compared to 'active psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward. This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also the scale.Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases (multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR) database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records. Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of >= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented, stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the context of multimorbidity.Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48% female. Thirty-one percent lived alone, and 85% prepared their medication themselves, all others required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular medicines and 24% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76%) were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78% did not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96%), long-term drugs (56%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92%). When it comes to deprescribing, 89% of participants wanted as much information as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP was a further key factor to them (85%). Conclusion: Most older adults are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared decision-making with the GP they trust.Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity, general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need' patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to automatically create a list of possible 'high need' patients could be a quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients. Research question: Can 'high need' patients with multimorbidity be identified automatically from their primary care medical records? Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity (>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were identified, of which 48% were above the age of 65 and 57% female. More than 42% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62% used five or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC: 0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: 'High need' patients with multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care.Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies. Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up? Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted, estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2) the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP. Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total, 916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific (42.0% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases (19.3%), osteometabolic (7.9%), cardio-circulatory (6.6%), and others. Most patients, minimum 59.2%, remained in the same cluster during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1%) and nervous (31.8%) MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs.Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the general population. Research question: What is the best possible reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36, SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to 0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as no external validity is available.Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question: This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test. We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer, receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment, anaemia less than 9 mg%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637 patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September 2017. The following information was collected: age, gender, socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA, CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection (for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of infection between 29 and 60%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c increased the risk by 8.5%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the infection increases the chance of infection by 734%. Conclusion: Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much more significant risk factor.

TI  - An Integrated Data Analytics Platform
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - An Integrated Science Data Analytics Platform is an environment that enables the confluence of resources for scientific investigation. It harmonizes data, tools and computational resources to enable the research community to focus on the investigation rather than spending time on security, data preparation, management, etc. OceanWorks is a NASA technology integration project to establish a cloud-based Integrated Ocean Science Data Analytics Platform for big ocean science at NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) for big ocean science. It focuses on advancement and maturity by bringing together several NASA opensource, big data projects for parallel analytics, anomaly detection, in situ to satellite data matchup, quality-screened data subsetting, search relevancy, and data discovery. Our communities are relying on data available through distributed data centers to conduct their research. In typical investigations, scientists would (1) search for data, (2) evaluate the relevance of that data, (3) download it, and (4) then apply algorithms to identify trends, anomalies, or other attributes of the data. Such a workflow cannot scale if the research involves a massive amount of data or multi-variate measurements. With the upcoming NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission expected to produce over 20PB of observational data during its 3-year nominal mission, the volume of data will challenge all existing Earth Science data archival, distribution and analysis paradigms. This paper discusses how OceanWorks enhances the analysis of physical ocean data where the computation is done on an elastic cloud platform next to the archive to deliver fast, web-accessible services for working with oceanographic measurements.

TI  - On the Potential of Sentinel-1 for High Resolution Monitoring of Water Table Dynamics in Grasslands on Organic Soils
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For soils with shallow groundwater and high organic carbon content, water table depth (WTD) is a key parameter to describe their hydrologic state and to estimate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Since the microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 satellite data might support the monitoring of these climate-relevant soils at high spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) by detecting spatial and temporal changes in local field and water management. Despite the low penetration depth of the C-band, sigma(0) is influenced by shallow WTD fluctuations via the soil hydraulic connection between the water table and surface soil. Here, we analyzed sigma(0) at 60 monitoring wells in a drained temperate peatland with degraded organic soils used as extensive grassland. We evaluated temporal Spearman correlation coefficients between sigma(0) and WTD considering the soil and vegetation information. To account for the effects of seasonal vegetation changes, we used the cross-over (incidence) angle method. Climatologies of the slope of the incidence angle dependency derived from two years of Sentinel-1 data and their application to the cross-over angle method did improve correlations, though the effect was minor. Overall, averaged over all sites, a temporal Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.45 (+/- 0.17) was obtained. The loss of correlation during summer (higher vegetation, deeper WTD) and the effects of cuts and grazing are discussed. The site-specific general wetness level, described by the mean WTD of each site was shown to be a major factor controlling the strength of the correlation. Mean WTD deeper than about -0.60 m lowered the correlations across sites, which might indicate an important limit of the application.

TI  - SmokeNet: Satellite Smoke Scene Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network with Spatial and Channel-Wise Attention
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A variety of environmental analysis applications have been advanced by the use of satellite remote sensing. Smoke detection based on satellite imagery is imperative for wildfire detection and monitoring. However, the commonly used smoke detection methods mainly focus on smoke discrimination from a few specific classes, which reduces their applicability in different regions of various classes. To this end, in this paper, we present a new large-scale satellite imagery smoke detection benchmark based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, namely USTC_SmokeRS, consisting of 6225 satellite images from six classes (i.e., cloud, dust, haze, land, seaside, and smoke) and covering various areas/regions over the world. To build a baseline for smoke detection in satellite imagery, we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning-based image classification models. Moreover, we propose a new convolution neural network (CNN) model, SmokeNet, which incorporates spatial and channel-wise attention in CNN to enhance feature representation for scene classification. The experimental results of our method using different proportions (16%, 32%, 48%, and 64%) of training images reveal that our model outperforms other approaches with higher accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Specifically, the proposed SmokeNet model trained with 64% training images achieves the best accuracy of 92.75% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9130. The model trained with 16% training images can also improve the classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient by at least 4.99% and 0.06, respectively, over the state-of-the-art models.

TI  - Influence of Landscape Heterogeneity and Spatial Resolution in Multi-Temporal In Situ and MODIS NDVI Data Proxies for Seasonal GPP Dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper was to evaluate the use of in situ normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIis) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI (NDVIMD) time series data as proxies for ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) to improve GPP upscaling. We used GPP flux data from 21 global FLUXNET sites across main global biomes (forest, grassland, and cropland) and derived MODIS NDVI at contrasting spatial resolutions (between 0.5 x 0.5 km and 3.5 x 3.5 km) centered at flux tower location. The goodness of the relationship between NDVIis and NDVIMD varied across biomes, sites, and MODIS spatial resolutions. We found a strong relationship with a low variability across sites and within year variability in deciduous broadleaf forests and a poor correlation in evergreen forests. Best performances were obtained for the highest spatial resolution at 0.5 x 0.5 km). Both NDVIis and NDVIMD elicited roughly three weeks later the starting of the growing season compared to GPP data. Our results confirm that to improve the accuracy of upscaling in situ data of site GPP seasonal responses, in situ radiation measurement biomes should use larger field of view to sense an area, or more sensors should be placed in the flux footprint area to allow optimal match with satellite sensor pixel size.

TI  - An Unsupervised Method to Detect Rock Glacier Activity by Using Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometric Coherence: A Regional-Scale Study in the Eastern European Alps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers are widespread periglacial landforms in mountain regions like the European Alps. Depending on their ice content, they are characterized by slow downslope displacement due to permafrost creep. These landforms are usually mapped within inventories, but understand their activity is a very difficult task, which is frequently accomplished using geomorphological field evidences, direct measurements, or remote sensing approaches. In this work, a powerful method to analyze the rock glaciers' activity was developed exploiting the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data. In detail, the interferometric coherence estimated from Sentinel-1 data was used as key indicator of displacement, developing an unsupervised classification method to distinguish moving (i.e., characterized by detectable displacement) from no-moving (i.e., without detectable displacement) rock glaciers. The original application of interferometric coherence, estimated here using the rock glacier outlines as boundaries instead of regular kernel windows, allows describing the activity of rock glaciers at a regional-scale. The method was developed and tested over a large mountainous area located in the Eastern European Alps (South Tyrol and western part of Trentino, Italy) and takes into account all the factors that may limit the effectiveness of the coherence in describing the rock glaciers' activity. The activity status of more than 1600 rock glaciers was classified by our method, identifying more than 290 rock glaciers as moving. The method was validated using an independent set of rock glaciers whose activity is well-known, obtaining an accuracy of 88%. Our method is replicable over any large mountainous area where rock glaciers are already mapped and makes it possible to compensate for the drawbacks of time-consuming and subjective analysis based on geomorphological evidences or other SAR approaches.

TI  - Micro-Motion Estimation of Maritime Targets Using Pixel Tracking in Cosmo-Skymed Synthetic Aperture Radar Data-An Operative Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to estimate the micro-motion (m-m) of ships from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. To this end, observe that the problem of motion and m-m detection of targets is usually solved using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) along-track interferometry through two radars spatially separated by a baseline along the azimuth direction. The approach proposed in this paper for m-m estimation of ships, occupying thousands of pixels, processes the information generated during the coregistration of several re-synthesized time-domain and not overlapped Doppler sub-apertures. Specifically, the SAR products are generated by splitting the raw data according to a temporally small baseline using one single wide-band staring spotlight (ST) SAR image. The predominant vibrational modes of different ships are then estimated. The performance analysis is conducted on one ST SAR image recorded by COSMO-SkyMed satellite system. Finally, the newly proposed approach paves the way for application to the surveillance of land-based industry activities.

TI  - Oil-Slick Category Discrimination (Seeps vs. Spills): A Linear Discriminant Analysis Using RADARSAT-2 Backscatter Coefficients (σ°, β°, and γ°) in Campeche Bay (Gulf of Mexico)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel empirical approach to categorize oil slicks' sea surface expressions in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements into oil seeps or oil spills is investigated, contributing both to academic remote sensing research and to practical applications for the petroleum industry. We use linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to try accuracy improvements from our previously published methods of discriminating seeps from spills that achieved similar to 70% of overall accuracy. Analyzing 244 RADARSAT-2 scenes containing 4562 slicks observed in Campeche Bay (Gulf of Mexico), our exploratory data analysis evaluates the impact of 61 combinations of SAR backscatter coefficients (sigma degrees, beta degrees, gamma degrees), SAR calibrated products (received radar beam given in amplitude or decibel, with or without a despeckle filter), and data transformations (none, cube root, log(10)). The LDA ability to discriminate the oil-slick category is rather independent of backscatter coefficients and calibrated products, but influenced by data transformations. The combination of attributes plays a role in the discrimination; combining oil-slicks' size and SAR information is more effective. We have simplified our analyses using fewer attributes to reach accuracies comparable to those of our earlier studies, and we suggest using other multivariate data analyses-cubist or random forest-to attempt to further improve oil-slick category discrimination.

TI  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Continuity of the Landsat 4-5 MSS and TM: Investigations Based on Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 4-5, built at the same time and with the same design, carrying the Multispectral Scanner System (MSS) and the Thematic Mapper (TM) simultaneously, jointly provided observation service for about 30 years (1982-2013). Considering the importance of data continuity for time series analyses, investigations on the continuity of the Landsat 4-5 MSS and TM are required. In this paper, characterization differences between the Landsat 4-5 MSS and TM were initially discussed using the synthesized reflectance records generated from a collection of Hyperion hyperspectral profiles which were well calibrated and widely distributed. The difference in near-infrared region mostly contributed to the difference in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) between MSS and TM, while the between-sensor difference in red spectrum was relatively minor. Models for transforming MSS NDVI to TM NDVI were proposed, and validated subsequently through cross-validation tests. Furthermore, effectiveness of the transformation models was investigated using eight synchronous observation pairs of the Landsat 5 MSS and TM. On average, the univariate models through ordinary least squares regression (OLS) regression resulted in a decrease about 10% of the median relative difference (MdRD). Meanwhile, the bivariate models improved the NDVI comparability in most cases, especially when the transformation models through ridge regression were implemented. The univariate model through OLS regression could be the only solution for cases when problems of data quality are encountered (e.g., problem in the MSS near-infrared channel (800-1000 nm)). In conclusion, the findings on NDVI transformation models from MSS to TM are valuable for reference, because of the collection of diverse Hyperion hyperspectral profiles used.

TI  - Extracting Crop Spatial Distribution from Gaofen 2 Imagery Using a Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite remote sensing has become a mainstream approach for extracting crop spatial distribution. Making edges finer is a challenge, while simultaneously extracting crop spatial distribution information from high-resolution remote sensing images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on the characteristics of the crop area in the Gaofen 2 (GF-2) images, this paper proposes an improved CNN to extract fine crop areas. The CNN comprises a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor employs a spectral feature extraction unit to generate spectral features, and five coding-decoding-pair units to generate five level features. A linear model is used to fuse features of different levels, and the fusion results are up-sampled to obtain a feature map consistent with the structure of the input image. This feature map is used by the classifier to perform pixel-by-pixel classification. In this study, the SegNet and RefineNet models and 21 GF-2 images of Feicheng County, Shandong Province, China, were chosen for comparison experiment. Our approach had an accuracy of 93.26%, which is higher than those of the existing SegNet (78.12%) and RefineNet (86.54%) models. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in extracting crop spatial distribution information from GF-2 remote sensing images.

TI  - Remote Sensing to Detect Nests of the Leaf-Cutting Ant <i>Atta sexdens</i> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Teak Plantations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf-cutting ants of the genus Atta are an important insect pest in forest plantations in many countries of South America. The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential for using Landsat-8 images, with medium spatial resolution and distributed free of charge, to detect leaf-cutting ant nests in Tectona grandis plantations in Brazil, using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The regression model adjusted by PLS-DA selected three principal components with a cross-validation error of 0.275 to map and predict the presence of leaf-cutting ant nests in these plantations. The most important bands and vegetation indices were selected using the main variables in the projection (VIP) and predicted pixels with the presence or absence of leaf-cutting ant nests with an accuracy of 72.3% on an independent validation data set. The study indicates that Landsat-8 OLI images have the potential to detect and map leaf-cutting ant nests in T. grandis plantations.

TI  - Asymmetric Effects of Daytime and Nighttime Warming on Boreal Forest Spring Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is the most intuitive and sensitive biological indicator of environmental conditions, and the start of the season (SOS) can reflect the rapid response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. At present, the model based on mean temperature neglects the role of the daytime maximum temperature (TMAX) and the nighttime minimum temperature (TMIN) in providing temperature accumulation and cold conditions at leaf onset. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of spring phenology for the boreal forest from 2001 to 2017 based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data (MOD13A2) and investigated the asymmetric effects of daytime and nighttime warming on the boreal forest spring phenology during TMAX and TMIN preseason by partial correlation analysis. The results showed that the spring phenology was delayed with increasing latitude of the boreal forest. Approximately 91.37% of the region showed an advancing trend during the study period, with an average advancement rate of 3.38 +/- 0.08 days/decade, and the change rates of different land cover types differed, especially in open shrubland. The length of the TMIN preseason was longer than that of the TMAX preseason and diurnal temperatures showed an asymmetrical increase during different preseasons. The daytime and nighttime warming effects on the boreal forest are asymmetrical. The TMAX has a greater impact on the vegetation spring phenology than TMIN as a whole and the effect also has seasonal differences; the TMAX mainly affects the SOS in spring, while TMIN has a greater impact in winter. The asymmetric effects of daytime and nighttime warming on the SOS in the boreal forest were highlighted in this study, and the results suggest that diurnal temperatures should be added to the forest terrestrial ecosystem model.

TI  - Pushing the Limits of Seagrass Remote Sensing in the Turbid Waters of Elkhorn Slough, California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery has been successfully used to map seagrass in clear waters, but here we evaluate the advantages and limitations of different remote sensing techniques to detect eelgrass in the tidal embayment of Elkhorn Slough, CA. Pseudo true-color imagery from Google Earth and broadband satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 allowed for detection of the various beds, but retrievals particularly in the deeper Vierra bed proved unreliable over time due to variable image quality and environmental conditions. Calibrated water-leaving reflectance spectrum from airborne hyperspectral imagery at 1-m resolution from the Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM) revealed the extent of both shallow and deep eelgrass beds using the HOPE semi-analytical inversion model. The model was able to reveal subtle differences in spectral shape, even when remote sensing reflectance over the Vierra bed was not visibly distinguishable. Empirical methods exploiting the red edge of reflectance to differentiate submerged vegetation only retrieved the extent of shallow alongshore beds. The HOPE model also accurately retrieved the water column absorption properties, chlorophyll-a, and bathymetry but underestimated the particulate backscattering and suspended matter when benthic reflectance was represented as a horizontal eelgrass leaf. More accurate water column backscattering could be achieved by the use of a darker bottom spectrum representing an eelgrass canopy. These results illustrate how high quality atmospherically-corrected hyperspectral imagery can be used to map eelgrass beds, even in regions prone to sediment resuspension, and to quantify bathymetry and water quality.

AB  - The Midwestern US is dominated by corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) production, and the carbon dynamics of this region are dominated by these production systems. An accurate regional estimate of gross primary production (GPP) is imperative and requires upscaling approaches. The aim of this study was to upscale corn and soybean GPP (referred to as GPP(calc)) in four counties in Central Iowa in the 2016 growing season (DOY 145-269). Eight eddy-covariance (EC) stations recorded carbon dioxide fluxes of corn (n = 4) and soybean (n = 4), and net ecosystem production (NEP) was partitioned into GPP and ecosystem respiration (RE). Additional field-measured NDVI was used to calculate radiation use efficiency (RUEmax). GPP(calc) was calculated using 16 MODIS satellite images, ground-based RUEmax and meteorological data, and improved land use maps. Seasonal NEP, GPP, and RE ((x) over bar +/- SE) were 678 +/- 63, 1483 +/- 100, and -805 +/- 40 g C m(-2) for corn, and 263 +/- 40, 811 +/- 53, and -548 +/- 14 g C m(-2) for soybean, respectively. Field-measured NDVI aligned well with MODIS fPAR (R-2 = 0.99), and the calculated RUEmax was 3.24 and 1.90 g C MJ(-1) for corn and soybean, respectively. The GPP(calc) vs. EC-derived GPP had a RMSE of 2.24 and 2.81 g C m(-2) d(-1), for corn and soybean, respectively, which is an improvement to the GPP(MODIS) product (2.44 and 3.30 g C m(-2) d(-1), respectively). Corn yield, calculated from GPP(calc) (12.82 +/- 0.65 Mg ha(-1)), corresponded well to official yield data (13.09 +/- 0.09 Mg ha(-1)), while soybean yield was overestimated (6.73 +/- 0.27 vs. 4.03 +/- 0.04 Mg ha(-1)). The approach presented has the potential to increase the accuracy of regional corn and soybean GPP and grain yield estimates by integrating field-based flux estimates with remote sensing reflectance observations and high-resolution land use maps.

TI  - Multi-Resolution Weed Classification via Convolutional Neural Network and Superpixel Based Local Binary Pattern Using Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic weed detection and classification faces the challenges of large intraclass variation and high spectral similarity to other vegetation. With the availability of new high-resolution remote sensing data from various platforms and sensors, it is possible to capture both spectral and spatial characteristics of weed species at multiple scales. Effective multi-resolution feature learning is then desirable to extract distinctive intensity, texture and shape features of each category of weed to enhance the weed separability. We propose a feature extraction method using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and superpixel based Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Both middle and high level spatial features are learned using the CNN. Local texture features from superpixel-based LBP are extracted, and are also used as input to Support Vector Machines (SVM) for weed classification. Experimental results on the hyperspectral and remote sensing datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that it outperforms several feature extraction approaches.

TI  - Finer Resolution Mapping of Marine Aquaculture Areas Using WorldView-2 Imagery and a Hierarchical Cascade Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine aquaculture plays an important role in seafood supplement, economic development, and coastal ecosystem service provision. The precise delineation of marine aquaculture areas from high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery is vital for the sustainable development and management of coastal marine resources. However, various sizes and detailed structures of marine objects make it difficult for accurate mapping from HSR images by using conventional methods. Therefore, this study attempts to extract marine aquaculture areas by using an automatic labeling method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), i.e., an end-to-end hierarchical cascade network (HCNet). Specifically, for marine objects of various sizes, we propose to improve the classification performance by utilizing multi-scale contextual information. Technically, based on the output of a CNN encoder, we employ atrous convolutions to capture multi-scale contextual information and aggregate them in a hierarchical cascade way. Meanwhile, for marine objects with detailed structures, we propose to refine the detailed information gradually by using a series of long-span connections with fine resolution features from the shallow layers. In addition, to decrease the semantic gaps between features in different levels, we propose to refine the feature space (i.e., channel and spatial dimensions) using an attention-based module. Experimental results show that our proposed HCNet can effectively identify and distinguish different kinds of marine aquaculture, with 98% of overall accuracy. It also achieves better classification performance compared with object-based support vector machine and state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, such as FCN-32s, U-Net, and DeeplabV2. Our developed method lays a solid foundation for the intelligent monitoring and management of coastal marine resources.

TI  - Wind Speed Retrieval from Simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission Compact Polarimetry SAR Data for Marine Application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) compact polarimetry (CP) data were simulated using 504 RADARSAT-2 quad-pol SAR images. These images were used to samples CP data in three RCM modes to build a data set with co-located ocean wind vector observations from in situ buoys on the West and East coasts of Canada. Wind speeds up to 18 m/s were included. CP and linear polarization parameters were related to the C-band model (CMOD) geophysical model functions CMOD-IFR2 and CMOD5n. These were evaluated for their wind retrieval potential in each RCM mode. The CP parameter Conformity was investigated to establish a data-quality threshold (>0.2), to ensure high-quality data for model validation. An accuracy analysis shows that the first Stokes vector (SV0) and the right-transmit vertical-receive backscatter (RV) parameters were as good as the VV backscatter with CMOD inversion. SV0 produced wind speed retrieval accuracies between 2.13 m/s and 2.22 m/s, depending on the RCM mode. The RCM Medium Resolution 50 m mode produced the best results. The Low Resolution 100 m and Low Noise modes provided similar results. The efficacy of SV0 and RV imparts confidence in the continuity of robust wind speed retrieval with RCM CP data. Three image-based case studies illustrate the potential for the application of CP parameters and RCM modes in operational wind retrieval systems. The results of this study provide guidance to direct research objectives once RCM is launched. The results also provide guidance for operational RCM data implementation in Canada's National SAR winds system, which provides near-real-time wind speed estimates to operational marine forecasters and meteorologists within Environment and Climate Change Canada.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of MODIS NDVI in the Semi-Arid Region of Kurdistan (Iran)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatiotemporal behavior of vegetation cover in the Kurdistan province of Iran was analyzed for the first time by TIMESAT and Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithms. They were applied on Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from 2000 to 2016 derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The TIMESAT software package was used to estimate the seasonal parameters of NDVI and their relation to land covers. BFAST was applied for identifying abrupt changes (breakpoints) of NDVI and their magnitudes. The results from TIMESAT and BFAST were first reported separately, and then interpreted together. TMESAT outcomes showed that the lowest and highest amplitudes of NDVI during the whole time period happened in 2008 and 2010. The spatial distribution of the number of breakpoints showed different behaviors in the west and east of the study area, and the breakpoint frequency confirmed the extreme NDVI amplitudes in 2008 and 2010 found by TIMESAT. For the first time in Iran, a correlation analysis between accumulated precipitations and maximum NDVIs (from one to seven months before the NDVI maximum) was conducted. The results showed that precipitation one month before had a higher correlation with the maximum NDVIs in the region. Overall, the results describe the NDVI behavior in terms of greenness, lifetime, abrupt changes for the different land covers, and across the years, suggesting how the northwest and west of the study area can be more susceptible to drought conditions.

TI  - Fault Slip Model of the 2018 Mw 6.6 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi, Japan, Earthquake Estimated from Satellite Radar and GPS Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and global positioning system (GPS) data were used to jointly determine the source parameters and fault slip distribution of the Mw 6.6 Hokkaido eastern Iburi, Japan, earthquake that occurred on 5 September 2018. The coseismic deformation map obtained from the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 InSAR data and GPS data is consistent with a thrust faulting event. A comparison between the InSAR-observed and GPS-projected line-of-sight (LOS) deformation suggests that descending Sentinel-1 track T046D, descending ALOS-2 track P018D, and ascending ALOS-2 track P112A and GPS data can be used to invert for the source parameters. The results of a nonlinear inversion show that the seismogenic fault is a blind NNW-trending (strike angle similar to 347.2 degrees), east-dipping (dip angle similar to 79.6 degrees) thrust fault. On the basis of the optimal fault geometry model, the fault slip distribution jointly inverted from the three datasets reveals that a significant slip area extends 30 km along the strike and 25 km in the downdip direction, and the peak slip magnitude can approach 0.53 m at a depth of 15.5 km. The estimated geodetic moment magnitude released by the distributed slip model is , equivalent to an event magnitude of Mw 6.50, which is slightly smaller than the estimates of focal mechanism solutions. According to the Coulomb stress change at the surrounding faults, more attention should be paid to potential earthquake disasters in this region in the near future. In consideration of the possibility of multi-fault rupture and complexity of regional geologic framework, the refined distributed slip and seismogenic mechanism of this deep reverse faulting should be investigated with multi-disciplinary (e.g., geodetic, seismic, and geological) data in further studies.

TI  - Reflectance Properties of Hemiboreal Mixed Forest Canopies with Focus on Red Edge and Near Infrared Spectral Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study present the results of airborne top-of-canopy measurements of reflectance spectra in the spectral domain of 350-1050 nm over the hemiboreal mixed forest. We investigated spectral transformations that were originally designed for utilization at very different spectral resolutions. We found that the estimates of red edge inflection point by two methods-the linear four-point interpolation approach (S2REP) and searching the maximum of the first derivative spectrum (Dmax) according to the mathematical definition of red edge inflection point-were well related to each other but S2REP produced a continuously shifting location of red edge inflection point while Dmax resulted in a discrete variable with peak jumps between fixed locations around 717 nm and 727 nm for forest canopy (the third maximum at 700 nm appeared only in clearcut areas). We found that, with medium high spectral resolution (bandwidth 10 nm, spectral step 3.3 nm), the in-filling of the O2-A Fraunhofer line (Farea) was very strongly related to single band reflectance factor in NIR spectral region (rho = 0.91, p < 0.001) and not related to Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). Stemwood volume, basal area and tree height of dominant layer were negatively correlated with reflectance factors at both visible and NIR spectral region due to the increase in roughness of canopy surface and the amount of shade. Forest age was best related to single band reflectance at NIR region (rho = -0.48, p < 0.001) and the best predictor for allometric LAI was the single band reflectance at red spectral region (rho = -0.52, p < 0.001) outperforming all studied vegetation indices. It suggests that Sentinel-2 MSI bands with higher spatial resolution (10 m pixel size) could be more beneficial than increased spectral resolution for monitoring forest LAI and age. The new index R751/R736 originally developed for leaf chlorophyll content estimation, also performed well at the canopy level and was mainly influenced by the location of red edge inflection point (rho = 0.99, p < 0.001) providing similar info in a simpler mathematical form and using a narrow spectral region very close to the O2-A Fraunhofer line.

TI  - Monitoring of Land Use/Land Cover and Socioeconomic Changes in South China over the Last Three Decades Using Landsat and Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover changes (LULCC) are prime variables that reflect changes in ecological systems. The Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau (GHKM) region located in South China has undergone rapid economic development and urbanization over the past three decades (1986-2017). Therefore, this study investigates the changes in LULC of GHKM based on multi-year Landsat and nighttime light (NTL) data. First, a supervised classification technique, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), is used to classify the Landsat images into seven thematic classes: forest, grassland, water, fishponds, built-up, bareland, and farmland. Second, the demographic activities are studied by calculating the light index, using nighttime light data. Third, several socioeconomic factors, derived from statistical yearbooks, are used to determine the impact on the LULCC in the study area. The post-classification change detection shows that the increase in the urban area, from 0.76% (1488.35 km(2)) in 1986 to 10.31% (20,643.28 km(2)) in 2017, caused GHKM to become the largest economic segment in South China. This unprecedented urbanization and industrialization resulted in a substantial reduction in both farmland (from 53.54% (105,123.93 km(2)) to 33.07% (64,932.19 km(2))) and fishponds (from 1.25% (2463.35 km(2)) to 0.85% (1674.61 km(2))) during 1986-2017. The most dominant conversion, however, was of farmland to built-up area. The subsequent urban growth is also reflected in the increasing light index trends revealed by NTL data. Of further interest is that the overall forest cover increased from 33.24% (65,257.55 km(2)) to 45.02% (88,384.19 km(2)) during the study period, with a significant proportion of farmland transformed into forest as a result of different afforestation programs. An analysis of the socioeconomic indicators shows that the increase in gross domestic product, total investment in real estate, and total sales of consumer goods, combined with the overall industrialization, have led to (1) urbanization on a large scale, (2) an increased light index, and (3) the reduction of farmland. The speed of development suggests that opportunistic development has taken place, which requires a pressing need to improve land policies and regulations for more sustainable urban development and protection of farmland.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Random Forest and A-LSTM Networks for Large-scale Winter Wheat Identification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning comprises a group of powerful state-of-the-art techniques for land cover classification and cropland identification. In this paper, we proposed and evaluated two models based on random forest (RF) and attention-based long short-term memory (A-LSTM) networks that can learn directly from the raw surface reflectance of remote sensing (RS) images for large-scale winter wheat identification in Huanghuaihai Region (North-Central China). We used a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images over one growing season and the corresponding winter wheat distribution map for the experiments. Each training sample was derived from the raw surface reflectance of MODIS time-series images. Both models achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying winter wheat, and the F1 scores of RF and A-LSTM were 0.72 and 0.71, respectively. We also analyzed the impact of the pixel-mixing effect. Training with pure-mixed-pixel samples (the training set consists of pure and mixed cells and thus retains the original distribution of data) was more precise than training with only pure-pixel samples (the entire pixel area belongs to one class). We also analyzed the variable importance along the temporal series, and the data acquired in March or April contributed more than the data acquired at other times. Both models could predict winter wheat coverage in past years or in other regions with similar winter wheat growing seasons. The experiments in this paper showed the effectiveness and significance of our methods.

TI  - Ozone and temperature decadal solar-cycle responses, and their relation to diurnal variations in the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere, based on measurements from SABER on TIMED
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is evidence that the ozone and temperature responses to the solar cycle of similar to 11 years depend on the local times of measurements. Here we present relevant results based on SABER data over a full diurnal cycle, which were not previously available. In this area, almost all satellite data used are measured at only one or two fixed local times, which can differ among various satellites. Consequently, estimates of responses can be different depending on the specific data set. Furthermore, over years, due to orbital drift, the local times of the measurements of some satellites have also drifted. In contrast, SABER makes measurements at various local times, providing the opportunity to estimate diurnal variations over 24 h. We can then also estimate responses to the solar cycle over both a diurnal cycle and at the fixed local times of specific satellite data for comparison. Responses derived in this study, based on zonal means of SABER measurements, agree favorably with previous studies based on data from the HALOE instrument, which only measured data at sunrise and sunset, thereby supporting the analysis of both studies. We find that for ozone above similar to 40 km, zonal means reflecting specific local times (e.g., 6, 12, 18, 24 LST - local solar time) lead to different values of responses, and to different responses based on zonal means that are also averages over the 24 h local time period, as in 3-D models. For temperature, the effects of diurnal variations on the responses are not negligible even at similar to 30 km and above. We also considered the consequences of local time variations due to orbital drifts of certain operational satellites, and, for both ozone and temperature, their effects can be significant above similar to 30 km. Previous studies based on other satellite data do not describe the treatment, if any, of local times. Some studies also analyzed data merged from different sources, with measurements made at different local times. Generally, the results of these studies do not agree very well among themselves. Although responses are a function of diurnal variations, this is not to say that they are the major reason for the differences, as there are likely other data-related issues. The effects due to satellite orbital drift may explain some unexpected variations in the responses, especially above 40 km.

TI  - Evaluation of Four Atmospheric Correction Algorithms for GOCI Images over the Yellow Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction (AC) for coastal waters is an important issue in ocean color remote sensing. AC performance is fundamental in retrieving reliable water-leaving radiances and then bio-optical parameters. Unlike polar-orbiting satellites, geostationary ocean color sensors allow high-frequency (15-60 min) monitoring of ocean color over the same area. The first geostationary ocean color sensor, i.e., the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), was launched in 2010. Using GOCI data acquired over the Yellow Sea in summer 2017 at three principal overpass times (02:16, 03:16, 04:16 UTC) with +/- 1 and +/- 3 h match-up times, this study compared four GOCI AC algorithms: (1) the standard near infrared (NIR) algorithm of NASA (NASA-STD), (2) the Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) standard algorithm for GOCI (KOSC-STD), (3) the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm Kd (490)-based NIR correction algorithm (Kd-based), and (4) the Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM). The GOCI-estimated remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), aerosol parameters [aerosol optical thickness (AOT), Angstrom Exponent (AE)], and chlorophyll-a (Chla) were validated using in situ data. For Rrs, AOT, AE, and Chla, GOCI-retrieved results performed well within the +/- 1 h temporal window, but the number of match-ups was extended within the +/- 3 h match-up window. For +/- 3 h GOCI-derived Rrs, all algorithms had an absolute percentage difference (APD) at 490 and 555 nm of <40%, while other bands showed larger differences (APD > 60%). Compared with in situ values, the APD of the Rrs(490)/Rrs(555) band ratio was <20% for all ACs. For AOT and AE, the APD was >40% and >200%, respectively. Of the four algorithms, the KOSC-STD algorithm demonstrated satisfactory performance in deriving Rrs for the region of interest (Rrs APD: 22.23%-73.95%) in the visible bands. The Kd-based algorithm worked well obtaining Ocean Color 3 GOCI Chla because Rrs(443) is more accurate than the KOSC-STD. The poorest Rrs retrievals were achieved using the NASA-STD and the MUMM algorithms. Statistical analysis indicated that all methods had optimal performance at 04:16 UTC.

TI  - Management of Wild Edible Fungi in the Meseta Purepecha Region, Michoacan, Mexico
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethnoecology is the study of the relationship between humans and their environments and components, including fungi. Mexico is an exceptional setting for studying the interactions between humans and fungi, since most of the native cultures have interacted with these organisms for thousands of years. The state of Michoacan is particularly relevant, since nearly 11% of the fungi species recorded in Mexico occur there, 139 of which are edible. The aim of this study was to analyze the interactions of the Purepecha native communities with edible fungi and their environment, the position of mushrooms in the local worldview, and the classification system, management forms, and social and environmental problems associated with their use. Semi-structured interviews at regional markets were conducted. We conducted participant observation, proof interviews in harvesting areas, and workshops with the communities. Ethnoecological information was recorded for 21 edible fungi species and the environments where people interact with these mushrooms. People called hongueros (fungi handlers) identified the following environmental problems: A loss of local knowledge, a decreasing consumption of fungi among young people, land-use changes, the illegal extraction of forest resources, deforestation, unplanned urban growth, uncontrolled fires, livestock raising, and agricultural intensification. These issues affect fungi diversity, distribution, and abundance. All these factors, in turn, affect decreasing economic incomes associated with this activity and changes in the diets of the local people. Information from this study will help local authorities and people of the community to design management strategies for maintaining the environment and fungi, strategies which aim to contribute to the sustainable use of both fungi and forests.

TI  - Retrieval of Internal Solitary Wave Amplitude in Shallow Water by Tandem Spaceborne SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of the upper layer thickness in a two-layer ocean is a crucial step in the retrieval of internal solitary wave (ISW) amplitude from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In this paper, we present a method to derive the upper layer thickness and the consequent ISW amplitude by combining two consecutive SAR images with the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation. An ISW case observed twice by the Chinese C-band SAR GaoFen-3 (GF-3) and the German X-band SAR TerraSAR-X (TS-X) with a temporal interval of approximately 11 min in shallow water to the southeast of Hainan Island in the northwestern South China Sea was used to demonstrate the applicability of the method. Using the in situ measurements of temperature and salinity near the observed ISW, the proposed method yielded an ISW amplitude of -4.52 m, in close proximity to -5.66 +/- 1.24 m derived by applying the classic Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation based on the continuously stratified theory. Moreover, the climatological dataset of the World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA13) was also used with the proposed method in the Hainan case, and the results showed that the method can still provide a reasonable estimate of ISW amplitude in shallow water even when in situ oceanic stratification measurements are absent. The application of our method to derive the ISW amplitude from consecutive SAR images seems highly promising with the increasing emergence of tandem satellites in orbits.

TI  - Trends in the Seaward Extent of Saltmarshes across Europe from Long-Term Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes provide crucial functions for flora, fauna, and humankind. Thus far, studies of their dynamics and response to environmental drivers are limited in space and time. Satellite data allow for looking at saltmarshes on a large scale and over a long time period. We developed an unsupervised decision tree classification method to classify satellite images into saltmarsh vegetation, mudflat and open water, integrating additional land cover information. By using consecutive stacks of three years, we considered trends while taking into account water level variations. We used Landsat 5 TM data but found that other satellite data can be used as well. Classification performance for different periods of the Western Scheldt was almost perfect for this site, with overall accuracies above 90% and Kappa coefficients of over 0.85. Sensitivity analysis characterizes the method as being robust. Generated time series for 125 sites across Europe show saltmarsh area changes between 1986 and 2010. The method also worked using a global approach for these sites. We reveal transitions between saltmarsh, mudflat and open water, both at the saltmarsh lower edge and interior, but our method cannot detect changes at the saltmarsh-upland boundary. Resulting trends in saltmarsh dynamics can be coupled to environmental drivers, such as sea level, tidal currents, waves, and sediment availability.

TI  - Comparison of Cloud Properties from Himawari-8 and FengYun-4A Geostationary Satellite Radiometers with MODIS Cloud Retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development and the improvement of meteorological satellites, different instruments have significantly enhanced the ability to observe clouds over large spatial regions. Recent geostationary satellite radiometers, e.g., Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Himawari-8 and the Fengyun-4A satellite, respectively, provide observations over similar regions at higher spatial and temporal resolutions for cloud and atmosphere studies. To better understand the reliability of AHI and AGRI retrieval products, we compare their cloud products with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products, especially in terms of the cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER). Our comparison indicates that cloud mask and cloud phase of these instruments are reasonably consistent, while clear differences are noticed for COT and CER results. The average relative differences (RDs) between AHI and AGRI ice COT and that of MODIS are both over 40%, and the RDs of ice CER are less than 20%. The consistency between AHI and MODIS water cloud results is much better, with the RDs of COT and CER being 29% and 9%, respectively, whereas the RDs of AGRI COT and CER are still larger than 30%. Many factors such as observation geometry, cloud horizontal homogeneity, and retrieval system (e.g., retrieval algorithm, forward model, and assumptions) may contribute to these differences. The RDs of COTs from different instruments for homogeneous clouds are about one-third smaller than the corresponding RDs for inhomogeneous clouds. By applying unified retrieval systems based on the forward radiative transfer models designed for each particular band, we find that 30% to 70% of the differences among the results from different instruments are caused by the retrieval system (e.g., different treatments or assumptions for the retrievals), and the rest may be due to sub-pixel inhomogeneity, parallax errors, and calibration.

TI  - Regional Vicarious Calibration of the SWIR-Based Atmospheric Correction Approach for MODIS-Aqua Measurements of Highly Turbid Inland Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water color remote sensing requires accurate atmospheric correction but this remains a significant challenge in highly turbid waters. In this respect, the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band-based atmospheric correction approach has proven advantageous when applied to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite. However, even so, uncertainties affect its accuracy. We performed a regional vicarious calibration of the MODIS-Aqua SWIR (1240, 2130)-based atmospheric correction using in situ water surface reflectance data measured during different seasons in Lake Taihu, a highly turbid lake. We then verified the accuracy of the (1240, 2130)-based atmospheric correction approach using these results; good results were obtained for the remote sensing reflectance retrievals at the 555, 645, and 859 nm, with average relative errors of 15%, 14%, and 22%, respectively, and no significant bias. Comparisons with the (1240, 2130)-based iterative approach and (1640, 2130)-based approach showed that the vicarious calibrated (1240, 2130)-based approach has the best accuracy and robustness. Thus, it is applicable to the highly turbid Lake Taihu. It may also be applicable to other highly turbid inland waters with similar optical and aerosol optical properties above water, but such applications will require further validation.

TI  - Stratification Has Strengthened in the Baltic Sea - An Analysis of 35 Years of Observational Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stratification of the water column, consisting of the three layers (upper, intermediate, and deep layer) separated by the seasonal thermocline and the permanent halocline, respectively, is an important factor for the functioning of the brackish Baltic Sea. In the present work, changes in the vertical structure of temperature and salinity, as well as heat content, salt mass, and stratification conditions were estimated on the basis of in situ and remote sensing data in 1982-2016. The seasonal thermocline and the halocline have strengthened in most of the sea by a rate of 0.33-0.39 and 0.70-0.88 kg m(-3), respectively, during 35 years. The upper layer has warmed by 0.03-0.06 degrees C year (-1) and sub-halocline deep layer 0.04-0.06 degrees C year(-1) in most of the sea. The total warming trend in the whole Baltic has been 1.07 degrees C for 35 years, being approximately twice higher compared to the upper 100 m in the Atlantic Ocean. Average upper layer warming of the sea from May to September has been 0.07-0.08 degrees C year(-1) while in winter, trends were mostly statistically not significant. More rapid warming during summers has occurred in shallower, closed-end areas of gulfs if compared to the rest of the sea. Possible reasons for high warming there might be shallow depths and limited water exchange, stronger stratification, and/or higher turbidity. Sea surface temperature trends estimated by in situ and satellite data agree well. Trends of freshening (-0.005 to -0.014 g kg(-1) year(-1)) of the upper layer and increasing salinity (0.02 to 0.04 g kg(-1) year(-1)) in the sub-halocline deep layer were detected. Increased salinity in the deep layer is likely caused by the increased lateral import of saltier water from the North Sea. Changes in the upper layer salinity might not be related to the accumulated river runoff only, but decadal changes of vertical salt flux might also contribute. The vertically distinct changes cancel each other and no significant trend in the mean salinity of the Baltic Sea was detected. No remarkable changes have occurred in the cold intermediate layer. In conclusion, different dominating processes have caused distinct long-term trends in the three layers of the Baltic Sea.

TI  - Fusion Method Combining Ground-Level Observations with Chemical Transport Model Predictions Using an Ensemble Deep Learning Framework: Application in China to Estimate Spatiotemporally-Resolved PM<sub>2.5</sub> Exposure Fields in 2014-2017
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric chemical transport models (CTMs) have been widely used to simulate spatiotemporally resolved PM2.5 concentrations. However, CTM results are usually prone to bias and errors. In this study, we improved the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions by developing an ensemble deep learning framework to fuse model simulations with ground-level observations. The framework encompasses four machine-learning models, i.e., general linear model, fully connected neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting machine, and combines them by stacking approach. This framework is applied to PM2.5 concentrations simulated by the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for China from 2014 to 2017, which has complete spatial coverage over the entirety of China at a 12-km resolution, with no sampling biases. The fused PM2.5 concentration fields were evaluated by comparing with an independent network of observations. The R-2 values increased from 0.39 to 0.64, and the RMSE values decreased from 33.7 mu g/m(3) to 24.8 mu g/m(3). According to the fused data, the percentage of Chinese population residing under the level II National Ambient Air Quality Standards of 35 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 has increased from 46.5% in 2014 to 61.7% in 2017. The method is readily adapted to utilize near-real-time observations for operational analyses and forecasting of pollutant concentrations and can be extended to provide source apportionment forecasts as well.

TI  - Developing Transformation Functions for VENμS and Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance over Israel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation and Environmental New micro Spacecraft (VEN mu S) and Sentinel-2 are both ongoing earth observation missions that provide high-resolution multispectral imagery at 10 m (VEN mu S) and 10-20 m (Sentinel-2), at relatively high revisit frequencies (two days for VEN mu S and five days for Sentinel-2). Sentinel-2 provides global coverage, whereas VEN mu S covers selected regions, including parts of Israel. To facilitate the combination of these sensors into a unified time-series, a transformation model between them was developed using imagery from the region of interest. For this purpose, same-day acquisitions from both sensor types covering the surface reflectance over Israel, between April 2018 and November 2018, were used in this study. Transformation coefficients from VEN mu S to Sentinel-2 surface reflectance were produced for their overlapping spectral bands (i.e., visible, red-edge and near-infrared). The performance of these spectral transformation functions was assessed using several methods, including orthogonal distance regression (ODR), the mean absolute difference (MAD), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). Post-transformation, the value of the ODR slopes were close to unity for the transformed VEN mu S reflectance with Sentinel-2 reflectance, which indicates near-identity of the two datasets following the removal of systemic bias. In addition, the transformation outputs showed better spectral similarity compared to the original images, as indicated by the decrease in SAM from 0.093 to 0.071. Similarly, the MAD was reduced post-transformation in all bands (e.g., the blue band MAD decreased from 0.0238 to 0.0186, and in the NIR it decreased from 0.0491 to 0.0386). Thus, the model helps to combine the images from Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S into one time-series that facilitates continuous, temporally dense vegetation monitoring.

TI  - The value of sentinel plants for risk assessment and surveillance to support biosecurity
T2  - NEOBIOTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective surveillance for early detection of invasive alien species in natural ecosystems, or on valued plants found in modified areas, could prevent potentially devastating and costly impacts (whether environmental, economic or cultural) of new invasions on the invaded country. Surveillance technologies are often constrained by a range of factors. Determining which species present a significant risk before they reach the border is an effective strategy to minimize the possibility of invasion and/or the impact of invasion. Surveillance of sentinel plants provides an important tool to strengthen biosecurity programs assisting with i) detecting and identifying insect pests, nematodes and plant diseases that could potentially invade uncolonized countries, and ii) developing pest risk analysis profiles to eliminate or mitigate the risk of arrival. This review examines some of the challenges and opportunities provided by sentinel plant research and discusses the factors that could affect the success of their use for biosecurity risk assessment and surveillance in the New Zealand context.

TI  - Optimized Stratification for Mapping Riparian Vegetation in Arid and Semiarid Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a method of mapping riparian vegetation in semi-arid to arid environments using the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The method successfully identified a range of riparian community types across the entire state of Nevada, USA, which spans 7 degrees of latitude and almost 4000 m of elevation. The landscape was stratified into units of similar elevation and solar exposure, and riparian areas were identified as having anomalously high NDVI within a local neighborhood. Thousands of calibration points were used in a simplex optimization to select the spatial neighborhood, the elevation and insolation strata, the minimum NDVI to be considered as potentially riparian, the number of standard deviations from the mean for an anomaly to be classified as riparian, and a limit on upslope position. Mapping of subpixel riparian corridors was improved by applying a directional high-pass filter to the NDVI data. Irrigated areas in agricultural and urban areas were removed based on land ownership maps and manual editing. The final map was tested with 400 independent test points: producer's accuracy was 84.6% and user's accuracy was 93.5%. This method should be broadly useful for mapping riparian features across large and complex regions with arid to semi-arid environments.

TI  - Uptake and Retention of Nanoplastics in Quagga Mussels
T2  - GLOBAL CHALLENGES
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, a set of experiments to assess the feasibility of using an invasive and widespread freshwater mussel (Dreissena rostrformis bugensis) as a sentinel species for nanoplastic detection is reported. Under laboratory experimental conditions, mussels ingest and retain fluorescent polystyrene (PS) beads with carboxylic acid (- COOH) termination over a size range of 200-2000 nm. The number of beads the mussels ingested is quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy and the location of the beads in the mussels is imaged using fluorescence microscopy. PS beads of similar size (1000-2000 nm) to mussels' preferred food are trafficked in the ciliated food grooves of the gills. Beads of all sizes are observed in the mussels' digestive tracts, indicating that the mussels do not efficiently reject the beads as unwanted foreign material, regardless of size. Fluorescence microscopy shows all sizes of beads are concentrated in the siphons and are retained there for longer than one month postexposure. Combined atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy and photothermal infrared spectroscopy are used to locate, image, and chemically identify the beads in the mussel siphons. In sum, these experiments demonstrate the potential for using mussels, specifically their siphons, to monitor environmental accumulation of aquatic nanoplastics.

TI  - Tracking the Land Use/Land Cover Change in an Area with Underground Mining and Reforestation via Continuous Landsat Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the changes in a land use/land cover (LULC) is important for environmental assessment and land management. However, tracking the dynamic of LULC has proved difficult, especially in large-scale underground mining areas with extensive LULC heterogeneity and a history of multiple disturbances. Additional research related to the methods in this field is still needed. In this study, we tracked the LULC change in the Nanjiao mining area, Shanxi Province, China between 1987 and 2017 via random forest classifier and continuous Landsat imagery, where years of underground mining and reforestation projects have occurred. We applied a Savitzky-Golay filter and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based approach to detect the temporal and spatial change, respectively. The accuracy assessment shows that the random forest classifier has a good performance in this heterogeneous area, with an accuracy ranging from 81.92% to 86.6%, which is also higher than that via support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), and maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. LULC classification results reveal that cultivated forest in the mining area increased significantly after 2004, while the spatial extent of natural forest, buildings, and farmland decreased significantly after 2007. The areas where vegetation was significantly reduced were mainly because of the transformation from natural forest and shrubs into grasslands and bare lands, respectively, whereas the areas with an obvious increase in NDVI were mainly because of the conversion from grasslands and buildings into cultivated forest, especially when villages were abandoned after mining subsidence. A partial correlation analysis demonstrated that the extent of LULC change was significantly related to coal production and reforestation, which indicated the effects of underground mining and reforestation projects on LULC changes. This study suggests that continuous Landsat classification via random forest classifier could be effective in monitoring the long-term dynamics of LULC changes, and provide crucial information and data for the understanding of the driving forces of LULC change, environmental impact assessment, and ecological protection planning in large-scale mining areas.

TI  - Characterizing Land Use/Land Cover Using Multi-Sensor Time Series from the Perspective of Land Surface Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to a rapid increase in accessible Earth observation data coupled with high computing and storage capabilities, multiple efforts over the past few years have aimed to map land use/land cover using image time series with promising outcomes. Here, we evaluate the comparative performance of alternative land cover classifications generated by using only (1) phenological metrics derived from either of two land surface phenology models, or (2) a suite of spectral band percentiles and normalized ratios (spectral variables), or (3) a combination of phenological metrics and spectral variables. First, several annual time series of remotely sensed data were assembled: Accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day land surface temperature products, 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), and the spectral variables from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2, as well as from the U.S. Landsat Analysis Ready Data surface reflectance products. Then, at each pixel, EVI2 time series were fitted using two different land surface phenology models: The Convex Quadratic model (CxQ), in which EVI2 = f(AGDD) and the Hybrid Piecewise Logistic Model (HPLM), in which EVI2 = f(day of year). Phenometrics and spectral variables were submitted separately and together to Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) to depict land use/land cover in Roberts County, South Dakota. HPLM RFC models showed slightly better accuracy than CxQ RFC models (about 1% relative higher in overall accuracy). Compared to phenometrically-based RFC models, spectrally-based RFC models yielded more accurate land cover maps, especially for non-crop cover types. However, the RFC models built from spectral variables could not accurately classify the wheat class, which contained mostly spring wheat with some fields in durum or winter varieties. The most accurate RFC models were obtained when using both phenometrics and spectral variables as inputs. The combined-variable RFC models overcame weaknesses of both phenometrically-based classification (low accuracy for non-vegetated covers) and spectrally-based classification (low accuracy for wheat). The analysis of important variables indicated that land cover classification for this study area was strongly driven by variables related to the initial green-up phase of seasonal growth and maximum fitted EVI2. For a deeper evaluation of RFC performance, RFC classifications were also executed with several alternative sampling scenarios, including different spatiotemporal filters to improve accuracy of sample pools and different sample sizes. Results indicated that a sample pool with less filtering yielded the most accurate predicted land cover map and a stratified random sample dataset covering approximately 0.25% or more of the study area were required to achieve an accurate land cover map. In case of data scarcity, a smaller dataset might be acceptable, but should not smaller than 0.05% of the study area.

TI  - Validation of ESA Sentinel-2 L2A Aerosol Optical Thickness and Columnar Water Vapour during 2017-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a validation of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and integrated water vapour (IWV) products provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) from multi-spectral imager (MSI) measurements on board the Sentinel-2 satellite (ESA-L2A). For that purpose, data from 94 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations over Europe and adjacent regions, covering a wide geographical region with a variety of climate and environmental conditions and during the period between March 2017 and December 2018 have been used. The comparison between ESA-L2A and AERONET shows a better agreement for IWV than the AOT, with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 5.33% and 9.04%, respectively. This conclusion is also reflected in the values of R-2, which are 0.99 and 0.65 for IWV and AOT, respectively. The study period was divided into two sub-periods, before and after 15 January 2018, when the Sentinel-2A spectral response functions of bands 1 and 2 (centered at 443 and 492 nm) were updated by ESA, in order to investigate if the lack of agreement in the AOT values was connected to the use of incorrect spectral response functions. The comparison of ESA-L2A AOT with AERONET measurements showed a better agreement for the second sub-period, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.08 in comparison with 0.14 in the first sub-period. This same conclusion was attained considering mean bias error (MBE) values that decreased from 0.09 to 0.01. The ESA-L2A AOT values estimated with the new spectral response functions were closer to the correspondent reference AERONET values than the ones obtained using the previous spectral response functions. IWV was not affected by this change since the retrieval algorithm does not use bands 1 and 2 of Sentinel-2. Additionally, an analysis of potential uncertainty sources to several factors affecting the AOT comparison is presented and recommendations regarding the use of ESA-L2A AOT dataset are given.

TI  - Pedagogical Laboratories: A Case Study of Transformative Sustainability Education in an Ecovillage Context
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Students, practitioners, and scholars of sustainability education are increasingly calling for divergent curricula and novel pedagogical approaches that cultivate transformation and emancipation at both the individual and institutional levels. For decades, ecovillages around the globe have provided alternatives for sustainable living and many have also developed alternative educational approaches. For this reason, ecovillages can be important learning laboratories for experimenting with sustainability education curricula and pedagogies, allowing scholars to learn across disciplinary, cultural, and worldview boundaries. In the present study, we conducted a descriptive case study of Findhorn Foundation College's 5-week Ecovillage Design Education course. By applying a narrative analysis of archives, field notes, surveys, and interviews, we arrived at 17 different categorical elements across six major themes. Using the field data, we linked these categorical elements to three consistent pedagogical elements: ritual pedagogies, pedagogies of story, and collaborative pedagogies. We conclude by highlighting several inductive themes present in participant data that indicated potential hindrances, constraints, and cautionary tales regarding implementation of these pedagogies in higher education contexts situated in the Global North.

TI  - Giving Ecological Meaning to Satellite-Derived Fire Severity Metrics across North American Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived spectral indices such as the relativized burn ratio (RBR) allow fire severity maps to be produced in a relatively straightforward manner across multiple fires and broad spatial extents. These indices often have strong relationships with field-based measurements of fire severity, thereby justifying their widespread use in management and science. However, satellite-derived spectral indices have been criticized because their non-standardized units render them difficult to interpret relative to on-the-ground fire effects. In this study, we built a Random Forest model describing a field-based measure of fire severity, the composite burn index (CBI), as a function of multiple spectral indices, a variable representing spatial variability in climate, and latitude. CBI data primarily representing forested vegetation from 263 fires (8075 plots) across the United States and Canada were used to build the model. Overall, the model performed well, with a cross-validated R-2 of 0.72, though there was spatial variability in model performance. The model we produced allows for the direct mapping of CBI, which is more interpretable compared to spectral indices. Moreover, because the model and all spectral explanatory variables were produced in Google Earth Engine, predicting and mapping of CBI can realistically be undertaken on hundreds to thousands of fires. We provide all necessary code to execute the model and produce maps of CBI in Earth Engine. This study and its products will be extremely useful to managers and scientists in North America who wish to map fire effects over large landscapes or regions.

TI  - Automatic 3-D Building Model Reconstruction from Very High Resolution Stereo Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in the availability of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite data together with efficient data acquisition and large area coverage have led to an upward trend in their applications for automatic 3-D building model reconstruction which require large-scale and frequent updates, such as disaster monitoring and urban management. Digital Surface Models (DSMs) generated from stereo satellite imagery suffer from mismatches, missing values, or blunders, resulting in rough building shape representations. To handle 3-D building model reconstruction using such low-quality DSMs, we propose a novel automatic multistage hybrid method using DSMs together with orthorectified panchromatic (PAN) and pansharpened data (PS) of multispectral (MS) satellite imagery. The algorithm consists of multiple steps including building boundary extraction and decomposition, image-based roof type classification, and initial roof parameter computation which are prior knowledge for the 3-D model fitting step. To fit 3-D models to the normalized DSM (nDSM) and to select the best one, a parameter optimization method based on exhaustive search is used sequentially in 2-D and 3-D. Finally, the neighboring building models in a building block are intersected to reconstruct the 3-D model of connecting roofs. All corresponding experiments are conducted on a dataset including four different areas of Munich city containing 208 buildings with different degrees of complexity. The results are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. According to the results, the proposed approach can reliably reconstruct 3-D building models, even the complex ones with several inner yards and multiple orientations. Furthermore, the proposed approach provides a high level of automation by limiting the number of primitive roof types and by performing automatic parameter initialization.

TI  - Improvement of Remote Sensing-Based Assessment of Defoliation of Pinus spp. Caused by Thaumetopoea pityocampa Denis and Schiffermuller and Related Environmental Drivers in Southeastern Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used Landsat temporal series to describe defoliation levels due to the Pine Processionary Moth (PPM) in Pinus forests of southeastern Andalusia (Spain), utilizing Google Earth Engine. A combination of remotely sensed data and field survey data was used to detect the defoliation levels of different Pinus spp. and the main environmental drivers of the defoliation due to the PPM. Four vegetation indexes were also calculated for remote sensing defoliation assessment, both inside the stand and in a 60-m buffer area. In the area of study, all Pinus species are affected by defoliation due to the PPM, with a cyclic behavior that has been increasing in frequency in recent years. Defoliation levels were practically equal for all species, with a high increase in defoliation levels 2 and 3 since 2014. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI) and Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) exhibited similar overall (p < 0.001) accuracy in the assessment of defoliation due to the PPM. The synchronization of NDII-defoliation data had a similar pattern for all together and individual Pinus species, showing the ability of this index to adjust the model parameters based on the characteristics of specific defoliation levels. Using Landsat-based NDII-defoliation maps and interpolated environmental data, we have shown that the PPM defoliation in southeastern Spain is driven by the minimum temperature in February and the precipitation in June, March, September, and October. Therefore, the NDII-defoliation assessment seems to be a general index that can be applied to forests in other areas. The trends of NDII-defoliation related to environmental variables showed the importance of summer drought stress in the expansion of the PPM on Mediterranean Pinus species. Our results confirm the potential of Landsat time-series data in the assessment of PPM defoliation and the spatiotemporal patterns of the PPM; hence, these data are a powerful tool that can be used to develop a fully operational system for the monitoring of insect damage.

TI  - Sensitivity of Seven MODIS Vegetation Indices to BRDF Effects during the Amazonian Dry Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, processed by the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm, to investigate the sensitivity of seven vegetation indices (VIs) to bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects in the dry season (June-September) of the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis was first performed over three sites, located from north to south of the Amazon, and then extended into the entire region. We inspected for differences in viewing-illumination parameters and pixel quality retrievals during MODIS data acquisition over the region. By comparing and correlating corrected and non-corrected data for bidirectional effects, we evaluated monthly changes in reflectance and VIs (2000-2014). Finally, we computed the effect size of the BRDF correction using non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests and Cohen's r metrics. The results showed that the most anisotropic VIs were the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and shortwave infrared normalized difference (SWND). These VIs presented the largest relative changes and the lowest correlation coefficients, between corrected and non-corrected data, because of the large effect size of the BRDF. The least anisotropic VI was the normalized difference water index (NDWI). The anisotropy of these VIs was stronger in the northern Amazon. It increased from the beginning to the end of the dry season, following changes in the relative azimuth angle (RAA) toward the BRDF hotspot in September. The modifications in the relative proportions of backscattering observations used in composite products caused a reflectance increase in all MODIS bands at the end of the dry season, especially in the near infrared (NIR). The reflectance decreased after BRDF correction. Because of the atmospheric effects, the view zenith angle (VZA) of the pixels selected in composite products decreased toward the south of the Amazon. In the southern Amazon, the seasonal amplitude in the solar zenith angle (SZA) reached values close to 18 degrees. For the most anisotropic index, the BRDF correction removed, on average, 30% of the EVI signal in June, and 60% of the EVI signal in September, reducing dry season variations over time. The results reinforce the need for bidirectional correction of MODIS data before the seasonal and inter-annual analyses of the most anisotropic VIs.

TI  - Water-Quality Classification of Inland Lakes Using Landsat8 Images by Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-quality monitoring of inland lakes is essential for freshwater-resource protection. In situ water-quality measurements and ratings are accurate but high costs limit their usage. Water-quality monitoring using remote sensing has shown to be cost-effective. However, the nonoptically active parameters that mainly determine water-quality levels in China are difficult to estimate because of their weak optical characteristics and lack of explicit correlation between remote-sensing images and parameters. To address the problems, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with hierarchical structure was designed to represent the relationship between Landsat8 images and in situ water-quality levels. A transfer-learning strategy in the CNN model was introduced to deal with the lack of in situ measurement data. After the CNN model was trained by spatially and temporally matched Landsat8 images and in situ water-quality data that were collected from official websites, the surface quality of the whole water body could be classified. We tested the CNN model at the Erhai and Chaohu lakes in China, respectively. The experiment results demonstrate that the CNN model outperformed widely used machine-learning methods. The trained model at Erhai Lake can be used for the water-quality classification of Chaohu Lake. The introduced CNN model and the water-quality classification method could cover the whole lake with low costs. The proposed method has potential in inland-lake monitoring.

TI  - Quantifying the Impacts of Land-Use and Climate on Carbon Fluxes Using Satellite Data across Texas, US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and variability, soil types and soil characteristics, animal and microbial communities, and photosynthetic plants are the major components of the ecosystem that affect carbon sequestration potential of any location. This study used NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 carbon products, gross primary productivity (GPP), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) to quantify their spatial and temporal variabilities for selected terrestrial ecosystems across Texas during the 2015-2018 study period. These SMAP carbon products are available at 9 km spatial resolution on a daily basis. The ten selected SMAP grids are located in seven climate zones and dominated by five major land uses (developed, crop, forest, pasture, and shrub). Results showed CO2 emissions and uptake were affected by land-use and climatic conditions across Texas. It was also observed that climatic conditions had more impact on CO2 emissions and uptake than land-use in this state. On average, South Central Plains and East Central Texas Plains ecoregions of East Texas and Western Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion of Upper Coast climate zones showed higher GPP flux and potential carbon emissions and uptake than other climate zones across the state, whereas shrubland on the Trans Pecos climate zone showed lower GPP flux and carbon emissions/uptake. Comparison of GPP and NEE distribution maps between 2015 and 2018 confirmed substantial changes in carbon emissions and uptake across Texas. These results suggest that SMAP carbon products can be used to study the terrestrial carbon cycle at regional to global scales. Overall, this study helps to understand the impacts of climate, land-use, and ecosystem dynamics on the terrestrial carbon cycle.

TI  - The RITMIA™ Smartphone App for Automated Detection of Atrial Fibrillation: Accuracy in Consecutive Patients Undergoing Elective Electrical Cardioversion
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The RITMIA (TM) app (Heart Sentinel (TM), Parma, Italy) is a novel application that combined with a wearable consumer-grade chest-strap Bluetooth heart rate monitor, provides automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), and may be promising for sustainable AF screening programs, since it is known that prolonged monitoring leads to increased AF diagnosis. Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine whether RITMIA (TM) could accurately differentiate sinus rhythm (SR) from AF compared with gold-standard physician-interpreted 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Design. In this observational prospective study consecutive patients presenting for elective cardioversion (ECV) of AF, from November 2017 to November 2018, were enrolled. Patients underwent paired 12-lead ECG and RITMIA (TM) recording, both before and after ECV procedure. The RITMIA (TM) automated interpretation was compared with 12-lead ECG interpreted by the agreement of two cardiologists. The latter were blinded to the results of the App automated diagnosis. Feasibility, sensitivity, specificity, and K coefficient for RITMIA (TM) automated diagnosis were calculated. Results. A total of 100 consecutive patients were screened and enrolled. Five patients did not undergo ECV due to spontaneous restoration of SR. 95 patients who actually underwent ECV were included in the final analysis. Mean age was 66.2 +/- 10.7 years; female patients were 20 (21.1%). There were 190 paired ECGs and RITMIA (TM) recordings. The RITMIA (TM) app correctly detected AF with 97% sensitivity, 95.6% specificity, and a K coefficient of 0.93. Conclusions. The automated RITMIA (TM) algorithm very accurately differentiated AF from SR before and after elective ECV. The only hardware required by this method is a cheap consumer-grade Bluetooth heart rate monitor of the chest-strap type. This robust and affordable RITMIA (TM) technology could be used to conduct population-wide screening in patients at risk for silent AF, thanks to the long-term monitoring applicability.

TI  - The influence of fire frequency on the structure and botanical composition of savanna ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas cover 60% of the land surface in Southern Africa, with fires and herbivory playing a key role in their ecology. The Limpopo National Park (LNP) is a 10,000 km(2) conservation area in southern Mozambique and key to protecting savannas in the region. Fire is an important factor in LNP's landscapes, but little is known about its role in the park's ecology. In this study, we explored the interaction between fire frequency (FF), landscape type, and vegetation. To assess the FF, we analyzed ten years of the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area product (2003-2013). A stratified random sampling approach was used to assess biodiversity across three dominant landscapes (Nwambia Sandveld-NS, Lebombo North-LN, and Shrubveld Mopane on Calcrete-C) and two FF levels (low-twice or less; and high-3 times or more, during 10 years). Six ha were sampled in each stratum, except for the LN versus high FF in which low accessibility allowed only 3 ha sampling. FF was higher in NS and LN landscapes, where 25% and 34% of the area, respectively, burned more than three times in 10 years. The landscape type was the main determinant of grass composition and biomass. However, in the sandy NS biomass was higher under high FF. The three landscapes supported three different tree/shrub communities, but FF resulted in compositional variations in NS and LN. Fire frequency had no marked influence on woody structural parameters (height, density, and phytomass). We concluded that the savannas in LNP are mainly driven by landscape type (geology), but FF may impose specific modifications. We recommend a fire laissez-faire management system for most of the park and a long-term monitoring system of vegetation to address vegetation changes related to fire. Fire management should be coordinated with the neighboring Kruger National Park, given its long history of fire management. Synthesis: This study revealed that grass and tree/shrub density, biomass, and composition in LNP are determined by the landscape type, but FF determines some important modifications. We conclude that at the current levels FF is not dramatically affecting the savanna ecosystem in the LNP (Figure 1). However, an increase in FF may drive key ecosystem changes in grass biomass and tree/shrub species composition, height, phytomass, and density.

TI  - Automated Near-Real-Time Mapping and Monitoring of Rice Extent, Cropping Patterns, and Growth Stages in Southeast Asia Using Sentinel-1 Time Series on a Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 50% of the world's population consumes rice. Accurate and up-to-date information on rice field extent is important to help manage food and water security. Currently, field surveys or MODIS satellite data are used to estimate rice growing areas. This study presents a cost-effective methodology for near-real-time mapping and monitoring of rice growth extent and cropping patterns over a large area. This novel method produces high-resolution monthly maps (10 m resolution) of rice growing areas, as well as rice growth stages. The method integrates temporal Sentinel-1 data and rice phenological parameters with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform. It uses monthly median time series of Sentinel-1 at VH polarization from September 2016 to October 2018. The two study areas are the northern region of West Java, Indonesia (0.75 million ha), and the Kedah and Perlis states in Malaysia (over 1 million ha). K-means clustering, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and a visual interpretation of VH polarization time series profiles are used to generate rice extent, cropping patterns, and spatiotemporal distribution of growth stages. To automate the process, four supervised classification methods (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests, and C5.0 classification models) were independently trialled to identify cluster labels. The results from each classification method were compared. The method can also forecast rice extent for up to two months. The VH polarization data can identify four growth stages of rice-T&P: tillage and planting (30 days); V: vegetative-1 and 2 (60 days); R: reproductive (30 days); M: maturity (30 days). Compared to field survey data, this method measures overall rice extent with an accuracy of 96.5% and a kappa coefficient of 0.92. SVM and ANN show better performance than random forest and C5.0 models. This simple and robust method could be rolled out across Southeast Asia, and could be used as an alternative to time-consuming, expensive field surveys.

TI  - Comparing Spectral Characteristics of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Same-Day Data for Arctic-Boreal Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic-Boreal regions experience strong changes of air temperature and precipitation regimes, which affect the thermal state of the permafrost. This results in widespread permafrost-thaw disturbances, some unfolding slowly and over long periods, others occurring rapidly and abruptly. Despite optical remote sensing offering a variety of techniques to assess and monitor landscape changes, a persistent cloud cover decreases the amount of usable images considerably. However, combining data from multiple platforms promises to increase the number of images drastically. We therefore assess the comparability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery and the possibility to use both Landsat and Sentinel-2 images together in time series analyses, achieving a temporally-dense data coverage in Arctic-Boreal regions. We determined overlapping same-day acquisitions of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images for three representative study sites in Eastern Siberia. We then compared the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 pixel-pairs, downscaled to 60 m, of corresponding bands and derived the ordinary least squares regression for every band combination. The acquired coefficients were used for spectral bandpass adjustment between the two sensors. The spectral band comparisons showed an overall good fit between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images already. The ordinary least squares regression analyses underline the generally good spectral fit with intercept values between 0.0031 and 0.056 and slope values between 0.531 and 0.877. A spectral comparison after spectral bandpass adjustment of Sentinel-2 values to Landsat-8 shows a nearly perfect alignment between the same-day images. The spectral band adjustment succeeds in adjusting Sentinel-2 spectral values to Landsat-8 very well in Eastern Siberian Arctic-Boreal landscapes. After spectral adjustment, Landsat and Sentinel-2 data can be used to create temporally-dense time series and be applied to assess permafrost landscape changes in Eastern Siberia. Remaining differences between the sensors can be attributed to several factors including heterogeneous terrain, poor cloud and cloud shadow masking, and mixed pixels.

TI  - Mapping and Statistical Analysis of NO<sub>2</sub> Concentration for Local Government Air Quality Regulation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growing interest in healthy living worldwide, there has been an increasing demand for more accurate measurements of the concentrations of air pollutants such as NO2. In particular, analyzing the characteristics and sources of air pollutants by region could improve the effectiveness of environmental policies applied in accordance with the environmental characteristics of individual regions. In this study, a detailed nationwide NO2 concentration map was generated using the cokriging interpolation technique, which integrates ground observations and satellite image data. The root-mean-square standardized (RMSS) error for this technique was close to 1, which indicates high accuracy. Using spatially interpolated NO2 concentration data, an administrative unit map was generated. When comparing the data for four NO2 data sources (observation data, satellite image data, detailed national data interpolated using cokriging, and NO2 concentrations averaged by an administrative unit based on the interpolated NO2 concentration data), the average concentrations were highest for remote sensing data. Land use regression (LUR) models of urban and non-urban regions were then developed to analyze the characteristics of the NO2 concentration by region using NO2 concentrations for the administrative units.

TI  - Extended Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (EPICS) for the Cross-Calibration of Optical Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing number of Earth-observing satellite sensors are being launched to meet the insatiable demand for timely and accurate data to aid the understanding of the Earth's complex systems and to monitor significant changes to them. To make full use of the data from these sensors, it is mandatory to bring them to a common radiometric scale through a cross-calibration approach. Commonly, cross-calibration data were acquired from selected pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS), located primarily throughout the Saharan desert in North Africa, determined to be temporally, spatially, and spectrally stable. The major limitation to this approach is that long periods of time are required to assemble sufficiently sampled cloud-free cross-calibration datasets. Recently, Shrestha et al. identified extended, cluster-based sites potentially suitable for PICS-based cross-calibration and estimated representative hyperspectral profiles for them. This work investigates the performance of extended pseudo-invariant calibration sites (EPICS) in cross-calibration for one of Shrestha's clusters, Cluster 13, by comparing its results to those obtained from a traditional PICS-based cross-calibration. The use of EPICS clusters can significantly increase the number of cross-calibration opportunities within a much shorter time period. The cross-calibration gain ratio estimated using a cluster-based approach had a similar accuracy to the cross-calibration gain derived from region of interest (ROI)-based approaches. The cluster-based cross-calibration gain ratio is consistent within approximately 2% of the ROI-based cross-calibration gain ratio for all bands except for the coastal and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) 2 bands. These results show that image data from any region within Cluster 13 can be used for sensor cross-calibration.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Surface Urban Heat Islands in Four Rapidly Growing African Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa's unprecedented, uncontrolled and unplanned urbanization has put many African cities under constant ecological and environmental threat. One of the critical ecological impacts of urbanization likely to adversely affect Africa's urban dwellers is the urban heat island (UHI) effect. However, UHI studies in African cities remain uncommon. Therefore, this study attempts to examine the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and the spatial patterns, composition and configuration of impervious surfaces/green spaces in four African cities, Lagos (Nigeria), Nairobi (Kenya), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Lusaka (Zambia). Landsat OLI/TIRS data and various geospatial approaches, including urban-rural gradient, urban heat island intensity, statistics and urban landscape metrics-based techniques, were used to facilitate the analysis. The results show significantly strong correlation between mean LST and the density of impervious surface (positive) and green space (negative) along the urban-rural gradients of the four African cities. The study also found high urban heat island intensities in the urban zones close (0 to 10 km) to the city center for all cities. Generally, cities with a higher percentage of the impervious surface were warmer by 3-4 degrees C and vice visa. This highlights the crucial mitigating effect of green spaces. We also found significant correlations between the mean LST and urban landscape metrics (patch density, size, shape, complexity and aggregation) of impervious surfaces (positive) and green spaces (negative). The study revealed that, although most African cities have relatively larger green space to impervious surface ratio with most green spaces located beyond the urban footprint, the UHI effect is still evident. We recommend that urban planners and policy makers should consider mitigating the UHI effect by restoring the urban ecosystems in the remaining open spaces in the urban area and further incorporate strategic combinations of impervious surfaces and green spaces in future urban and landscape planning.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Coastal Aquaculture Derived from Sentinel-1 Time Series Data and the Full Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Asia is the major contributor to global aquaculture production in quantity, accounting for almost 90%. These practices lead to extensive land-use and land-cover changes in coastal areas, and thus harm valuable and sensitive coastal ecosystems. Remote sensing and GIS technologies contribute to the mapping and monitoring of changes in aquaculture, providing essential information for coastal management applications. This study aims to investigate aquaculture expansion and spatio-temporal dynamics in two Chinese river deltas over three decades: the Yellow River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Long-term patterns of aquaculture change are extracted based on combining a reference layer on existing aquaculture ponds for 2015 derived from Sentinel-1 data with annual information on water bodies extracted from the long-term Landsat archive. Furthermore, the suitability of the proposed approach to be applied on a global scale is tested based on exploiting the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset. We found enormous increases in aquaculture area for the investigated target deltas: an 18.6-fold increase for the YRD (1984-2016), and a 4.1-fold increase for the PRD (1990-2016). Furthermore, we detect hotspots of aquaculture expansion based on linear regression analyses for the deltas, indicating that hotspots are located in coastal regions for the YRD and along the Pearl River in the PRD. A comparison with high-resolution Google Earth data demonstrates that the proposed approach can detect spatio-temporal changes of aquaculture at an overall accuracy of 89%. The presented approach has the potential to be applied to larger spatial scales covering a time period of more than three decades. This is crucial to define appropriate management strategies to reduce the environmental impacts of aquaculture expansion, which are expected to increase in the future.

TI  - Bundle Adjustment Using Space-Based Triangulation Method for Improving the Landsat Global Ground Reference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an ever-increasing interest and need for accurate georegistration of remotely sensed data products to a common global geometric reference. Although georegistration has improved substantially in the last decade, the lack of an accurate global ground reference dataset poses serious issues for data providers seeking to make geometrically stackable analysis-ready data. The existing Global Land Survey 2000 (GLS2000) dataset derived from Landsat 7 images provides global coverage and can be used as a reference dataset, but its accuracy is much lower than what can be attained using the agile and precise pointing capability of the new spacecrafts. The improved position and pointing knowledge of the new spacecrafts such as Landsat 8 can be used to improve the accuracy of the existing global ground control points using a space-based triangulation method. This paper discusses the theoretical basis, formulation, and application of the space-based triangulation method at a continental scale to improve the accuracy of the GLS-derived ground control points. Our triangulation method involves adjusting the spacecraft position, velocity, attitude, attitude rate, and ground control point locations, iteratively, by linearizing the non-linear viewing geometry, such that the residual errors in the measured image points are minimized. The complexity of the numerical inversion and processing is dealt with in our approach by processing and eliminating the ground points one at a time. This helps to reduce the size of the normal matrix significantly, thereby making the triangulation of a continent-wide scale block feasible and efficient. One of the unique characteristics of our method is the use of a correlation model linking the attitude corrections between images of the same pass, which promotes consistency in the attitude corrections. We evaluated the performance of our triangulation method over the Australian continent using the Australian Geographic Reference Image (AGRI) dataset as a reference. Both a free adjustment, using only the pointing information of the Landsat 8 spacecraft, and a constrained adjustment using the AGRI as external control were performed and the results compared. The Australian block's horizontal accuracy improved from 15.4 m to 3.6 m with the use of AGRI controls and from 15.4 m to 8.8 m without the use of AGRI controls.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Derivation under All Sky Conditions through Integrating AMSR-E/AMSR-2 and MODIS/GOES Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important input to the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model to derive the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) for drought monitoring. Currently, LST inputs to the ALEXI model come from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, but clouds affect them. While passive microwave (e.g., AMSR-E and AMSR-2) sensors can penetrate non-rainy clouds and observe the Earth's surface, but usually with a coarse spatial resolution, how to utilize multiple instruments' advantages is an important methodology in remote sensing. In this study, we developed a new five-channel algorithm to derive LST from the microwave AMSR-E and AMSR-2 measurements and calibrate to the MODIS and GOES LST products. A machine learning method is implemented to further improve its performance. The MODIS and GOES LST products still show better performance than the AMSR-E and AMSR-2 LSTs when evaluated against the ground observations. Therefore, microwave LSTs are only used to fill the gaps due to clouds in the MODIS and GOES LST products. A gap filling method is further applied to fill the remaining gaps in the merged LSTs and downscale to the same spatial resolution as the MODIS and GOES products. With the daily integrated LST at the same spatial resolution as the MODIS and GOES products and available under nearly all sky conditions, the drought index, like the ESI, can be updated on daily basis. The initial implementation results demonstrate that the daily drought map can catch the fast changes of drought conditions and capture the signals of flash drought, and make flash drought monitoring become possible. It is expected that a drought map that is available on daily basis will benefit future drought monitoring.

TI  - Land-based and climatic stressors of mangrove cover change in the Auckland Region, New Zealand
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in mangrove forest cover (increases and decreases) have been observed globally as a result of the influence of environmental changes and human impacts. Although mangrove forest increases are globally uncommon, in New Zealand mangroves are increasing in distribution at the expense of other intertidal estuarine habitats. This study quantified the change in mangrove area over a period of 74 years (1940-2014), and investigated the influence of land-based (e.g. land use conversion in the catchments), climatic, and oceanic factors on the change in temperate mangrove forest cover in the Auckland Region of New Zealand over that period. An improved mapping approach using aerial photographs and Landsat images was applied to quantify changes in tall and dwarf mangrove cover, and to identify the mechanism of change (expansion, gap filling, and loss), across 38 estuaries in the Auckland Region, New Zealand. Mangrove area increased from 2313 ha in 1940 to 10 483 ha in 2014 (on average 3.2% yr(-1)), with higher rates in small estuaries (<1000 ha) than in large estuaries (>1000 ha). The area of the intertidal mudflat habitat, i.e. potential area for mangrove colonization, has doubled from 14 193 ha in 1974 to 28 764 ha in 2014. The increase in total mangrove area was explained primarily by gap filling followed by expansion. The proportion of expansion-related increase was predominantly seaward (82%) but mangroves also expanded upstream (16%). Boosted regression tree analysis revealed that catchment forest cover, sea level, and mean annual air temperature explained around 85% of the variation in mangrove area. Periods of catchment forest clearing coincided with gains in mangrove forest area. Dwarf mangroves were more sensitive to changes in sea level, in particular over the past 25 years, when the annual sea-level rise exceeded the sediment accumulation rates. Catchment land use, especially the clearing of forests, associated with increased sediment supply into estuaries is the strongest driver of mangrove forest gain. Thus, land-use management is a necessary aspect of the management of New Zealand estuaries to conserve the diversity of estuarine habitats (including mangroves) and the ecosystem services that each habitat provides.

TI  - Semi-Automatic Identification and Pre-Screening of Geological-Geotechnical Deformational Processes Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work describes a new procedure aimed to semi-automatically identify clusters of active persistent scatterers and preliminarily associate them with different potential types of deformational processes over wide areas. This procedure consists of three main modules: (i) ADAfinder, aimed at the detection of Active Deformation Areas (ADA) using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data; (ii) LOS2HV, focused on the decomposition of Line Of Sight (LOS) displacements from ascending and descending PSI datasets into vertical and east-west components; iii) ADAclassifier, that semi-automatically categorizes each ADA into potential deformational processes using the outputs derived from (i) and (ii), as well as ancillary external information. The proposed procedure enables infrastructures management authorities to identify, classify, monitor and categorize the most critical deformations measured by PSI techniques in order to provide the capacity for implementing prevention and mitigation actions over wide areas against geological threats. Zeri, Campiglia Marittima-Suvereto and Abbadia San Salvatore (Tuscany, central Italy) are used as case studies for illustrating the developed methodology. Three PSI datasets derived from the Sentinel-1 constellation have been used, jointly with the geological map of Italy (scale 1:50,000), the updated Italian landslide and land subsidence maps (scale 1:25,000), a 25 m grid Digital Elevation Model, and a cadastral vector map (scale 1:5000). The application to these cases of the proposed workflow demonstrates its capability to quickly process wide areas in very short times and a high compatibility with Geographical Information System (GIS) environments for data visualization and representation. The derived products are of key interest for infrastructures and land management as well as decision-making at a regional scale.

TI  - Using Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Observed by OCO-2 to Predict Autumn Crop Production in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has attracted considerable attention as a new monitor of vegetation photosynthesis. Previous studies have revealed the close correlation between SIF and terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), and have used SIF to estimate vegetation GPP. This study investigated the relationship between the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF products at two retrieval bands (SIF757, SIF771) and the autumn crop production in China during the summer of 2015 on different timescales. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance to estimate the autumn crop production of 2016 by using the optimal model developed in 2015. In addition, the OCO-2 SIF was compared with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (VIs) (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; enhanced vegetation index, EVI) for predicting the crop production. All the remotely sensed products exhibited the strongest correlation with autumn crop production in July. The OCO-2 SIF757 estimated autumn crop production best (R-2 = 0.678, p < 0.01; RMSE = 748.901 ten kilotons; MAE = 567.629 ten kilotons). SIF monitored the crop dynamics better than VIs, although the performances of VIs were similar to SIF. The estimation accuracy was limited by the spatial resolution and discreteness of the OCO-2 SIF products. Our findings demonstrate that SIF is a feasible approach for the crop production estimation and is not inferior to VIs, and suggest that accurate autumn crop production forecasts while using the SIF-based model can be obtained one to two months before the harvest. Furthermore, the proposed method can be widely applied with the development of satellite-based SIF observation technology.

TI  - Mapping Hydrothermal Zoning Pattern of Porphyry Cu Deposit Using Absorption Feature Parameters Calculated from ASTER Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying hydrothermal zoning pattern associated with porphyry copper deposit is important for indicating its economic potential. Traditional approaches like systematic sampling and conventional geological mapping are time-consuming and labor extensive, and with limitations for providing small scale information. Recent developments suggest that remote sensing is a powerful tool for mapping and interpreting the spatial pattern of porphyry Cu deposit. In this study, we integrated in situ spectral measurement taken at the Yudai copper deposit in the Kalatag district, northwestern China, information obtained by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), as well as the spectra of samples (hand-specimen) measured using an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) FieldSpec4 high-resolution spectrometer in laboratory, to map the hydrothermal zoning pattern of the copper deposit. Results proved that the common statistical approaches, such as relative band depth and Principle Component Analysis (PCA), were unable to identify the pattern accurately. To address the difficulty, we introduced a curve-fitting technique for ASTER shortwave infrared data to simulate Al(OH)-bearing, Fe/Mg(OH)-bearing, and carbonate minerals absorption features, respectively. The results indicate that the absorption feature parameters can effectively locate the ore body inside the research region, suggesting the absorption feature parameters have great potentials to delineate hydrothermal zoning pattern of porphyry Cu deposit. We foresee the method being widely used in the future.

TI  - SBAS-InSAR Based Deformation Detection of Urban Land, Created from Mega-Scale Mountain Excavating and Valley Filling in the Loess Plateau: The Case Study of Yan'an City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yan'an new district (YND) is one of the largest civil engineering projects for land creation in Loess Plateau, of which the amount of earthwork exceeds 600 million m(3), to create 78.5 km(2) of flat land. Such mega-scale engineering activities and complex geological characteristics have induced wide land deformation in the region. Small baseline subset synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) method and 55 Sentinel-1A (S-1A) images were utilized in the present work to investigate the urban surface deformation in the Yan'an urban area and Yan'an new airport (YNA) from 2015 to 2019. The results were validated by the ground leveling measurements in the YNA. It is found that significant uneven surface deformation existed in both YND and YNA areas with maximum accumulative subsidence of 300 and 217 mm, respectively. Moreover, the average subsidence rate of the YND and YNA areas ranged from -70 to 30 mm/year and -50 to 25 mm/year, respectively. The present work shows that the land deformation suffered two periods (from 2015 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2019) and expanded from urban center to surrounding resettlement area, which are highly relevant with urban earthwork process. It is found that more than 60% of land subsidence occurs at filled areas, while more than 65% of surface uplifting occurs at excavation areas. The present work shows that the subsidence originates from the earth filling and the load of urban buildings, while the release of stress is the major factor for the land uplift. Moreover, it is found that the collapsibility of loess and concentrated precipitation deteriorates the degree of local land subsidence. The deformation discovered by this paper shows that the city may suffer a long period of subsidence, and huge challenges may exist in the period of urban maintaining buildings and infrastructure facilities.

TI  - Robotic-Assisted Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping With Indocyanine Green in Pelvic Malignancies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Newer technologies such as near-infrared (NIR) imaging of the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) and daVinci Xi Surgical System have become promising tools for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. This meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic value of SLN in assessing lymph nodal metastasis in pelvic malignancies, using ICG with NIR imaging in robotic-assisted surgery.Materials and Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed for studies in English before April 2019. The detection rate, sensitivity of SLN detection of metastatic disease, and factors associated with successful mapping (sample size, study design, mean age, mean body mass index, type of cancer) were synthesized for meta-analysis.Results: A total of 17 articles including 1,059 patients were finally included. The reported detection rates of SLN ranged from 76 to 100%, with a pooled average rate of 95% (95% CI: 93-97; 17 studies). The sensitivity of SLN detection of metastatic disease ranged from 50 to 100% and the pooled sensitivity was 86% (95% CI: 75-94; 8 studies). There were no complications related to ICG administration reported.Conclusions: NIR imaging system using ICG in robotic-assisted surgery is a feasible and safe method for SLN mapping. Due to its promising performance, it is considered to be an alternative to a complete pelvic lymph node dissection.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice Planting Area in Northeastern China Using Spatiotemporal Data Fusion and Phenology-Based Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate paddy rice mapping with fine spatial detail is significant for ensuring food security and maintaining sustainable environmental development. In northeastern China, rice is planted in fragmented and patchy fields and its production has reached over 10% of the total amount of rice production in China, which has brought the increasing need for updated paddy rice maps in the region. Existing methods for mapping paddy rice are often based on remote sensing techniques by using optical images. However, it is difficult to obtain high quality time series remote sensing data due to the frequent cloud cover in rice planting area and low temporal sampling frequency of satellite imagery. Therefore, paddy rice maps are often developed using few Landsat or time series MODIS images, which has limited the accuracy of paddy rice mapping. To overcome these limitations, we presented a new strategy by integrating a spatiotemporal fusion algorithm and phenology-based algorithm to map paddy rice fields. First, we applied the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) to fuse the Landsat and MODIS data and obtain multi-temporal Landsat-like images. From the fused Landsat-like images and the original Landsat images, we derived time series vegetation indices (VIs) with high temporal and high spatial resolution. Then, the phenology-based algorithm, considering the unique physical features of paddy rice during the flooding and transplanting phases/open-canopy period, was used to map paddy rice fields. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we compared our results with those from other three classification strategies: (1) phenology-based classification based on original Landsat images only, (2) phenology-based classification based on original MODIS images only and (3) random forest (RF) classification based on both Landsat and Landsat-like images. The validation experiments indicate that our fusion-and phenology-based strategy could improve the overall accuracy of classification by 6.07% (from 92.12% to 98.19%) compared to using Landsat data only, and 8.96% (from 89.23% to 98.19%) compared to using MODIS data, and 4.66% (from93.53% to 98.19%) compared to using the RF algorithm. The results show that our new strategy, by integrating the spatiotemporal fusion algorithm and phenology-based algorithm, can provide an effective and robust approach to map paddy rice fields in regions with limited available images, as well as the areas with patchy and fragmented fields.

TI  - Coupling Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data with a Crop Model to Study Winter Wheat Water Demand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information of crop growth conditions and water status can improve irrigation management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of SAFYE (simple algorithm for yield and evapotranspiration estimation) crop model for simulating winter wheat growth and estimating water demand by assimilating leaf are index (LAI) derived from canopy reflectance measurements. A refined water stress function was used to account for high crop water stress. An experiment with nine irrigation scenarios corresponding to different levels of water supply was conducted over two consecutive winter wheat growing seasons (2013-2014 and 2014-2015). The calibration of four model parameters was based on the global optimization algorithms SCE-UA. Results showed that the estimated and retrieved LAI were in good agreement in most cases, with a minimum and maximum RMSE of 0.173 and 0.736, respectively. Good performance for accumulated biomass estimation was achieved under a moderate water stress condition while an underestimation occurred under a severe water stress condition. Grain yields were also well estimated for both years (R-2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.48 t.ha(-1); MRE = 8.4%). The dynamics of simulated soil moisture in the top 20 cm layer was consistent with field observations for all scenarios; whereas, a general underestimation was observed for total water storage in the 1 m layer, leading to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. This research provides a scheme for estimating crop growth properties, grain yield and actual evapotranspiration by coupling crop model with remote sensing data.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Lake Ice Phenology across a Range of Lakes Sizes, ME, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of ice phenology for small lakes is hindered by a lack of satellite observations with both high temporal and spatial resolutions. By merging multi-source satellite data over individual lakes, we present a new algorithm that successfully estimates ice freeze and thaw timing for lakes with surface areas as small as 0.13 km(2) and obtains consistent results across a range of lake sizes. We have developed an approach for classifying ice pixels based on the red reflectance band of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, with a threshold calibrated against ice fraction from Landsat Fmask over each lake. Using a filter derived from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) surface air temperature product, we removed outliers in the time series of lake ice fraction. The time series of lake ice fraction was then applied to identify lake ice breakup and freezeup dates. Validation results from over 296 lakes in Maine indicate that the satellite-based lake ice timing detection algorithm perform well, with mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.54 days for breakup dates and 7.31 days for freezeup dates. This algorithm can be applied to lakes worldwide, including the nearly two million lakes with surface area between 0.1 and 1 km(2).

TI  - A Harmonious Satellite-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Ground Measurement Inversion Method for Monitoring Salinity in Coastal Saline Soil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization adversely impacts crop growth and production, especially in coastal areas which experience serious soil salinization. Therefore, rapid and accurate monitoring of the salinity and distribution of coastal saline soil is crucial. Representative areas of the Yellow River Delta (YRD)-the Hekou District (the core test area with 140 sampling points) and the Kenli District (the verification area with 69 sampling points)-were investigated. Ground measurement data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery and Sentinel-2A multispectral imagery were used as the data sources and a satellite-UAV-ground integrated inversion of the coastal soil salinity was performed. Correlation analyses and multiple regression methods were used to construct an accurate model. Then, a UAV-based inversion model was applied to the satellite imagery with reflectance normalization. Finally, the spatial and temporal universality of the UAV-based inversion model was verified and the soil salinity inversion results were obtained. The results showed that the green, red, red-edge and near-infrared bands were significantly correlated with soil salinity and the spectral parameters significantly improved this correlation; hence, the model is more effective upon combining spectral parameters with sensitive bands, with modeling precision and verification precision of the best model being 0.743 and 0.809, respectively. The reflectance normalization yielded good results. These findings proved that applying the UAV-based model to reflectance normalized Sentinel-2A images produces results that are consistent with the actual situation. Moreover, the inversion results effectively reflect the distributions characteristic of the soil salinity in the core test area and the study area. This study integrated the advantages of satellite, UAV and ground methods and then proposed a method for the inversion of the salinity of coastal saline soils at different scales, which is of great value for real-time, rapid and accurate soil salinity monitoring applications.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon based on Landsat 8 Monthly NDVI Data for the Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) are beneficial for managing soil fertility and understanding the global carbon cycle. Digital soil mapping plays an important role in efficiently obtaining the spatial distribution of SOC, which contributes to precision agriculture. However, traditional soil-forming factors (i.e., terrain or climatic factors) have weak variability in low-relief areas, such as plains, and cannot reflect the spatial variation of soil attributes. Meanwhile, vegetation cover hinders the acquisition of the direct information of farmland soil. Thus, useful environmental variables should be utilized for SOC prediction and the digital mapping of such areas. SOC has an important effect on crop growth status, and remote sensing data can record the apparent spectral characteristics of crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important index reflecting crop growth and biomass. This study used NDVI time series data rather than traditional soil-forming factors to map SOC. Honghu City, located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain, was selected as the study region, and the NDVI time series data extracted from Landsat 8 were used as the auxiliary variables. SOC maps were estimated through stepwise linear regression (SLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Ordinary kriging (OK) was used as the reference model, while root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and coefficient of determination of prediction (R-P(2)) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results showed that SOC had a significant positive correlation in July and August (0.17, 0.29) and a significant negative correlation in January, April, and December (-0.23, -0.27, and -0.23) with NDVI time series data. The best model for SOC prediction was generated by ANN, with the lowest RMSEP of 3.718 and highest R-P(2) of 0.391, followed by SVM (RMSEP = 3.753, R-P(2) = 0.361) and PLSR (RMSEP = 4.087, R-P(2) = 0.283). The SLR model was the worst model, with the lowest R-P(2) of 0.281 and highest RMSEP of 3.930. ANN and SVM were better than OK (RMSEP = 3.727, R-P(2) = 0.372), whereas PLSR and SLR were worse than OK. Moreover, the prediction results using single-data NDVI or short time series NDVI showed low accuracy. The effect of the terrain factor on SOC prediction represented unsatisfactory results. All these results indicated that the NDVI time series data can be used for SOC mapping in plain areas and that the ANN model can maximally extract additional associated information between NDVI time series data and SOC. This study presented an effective method to overcome the selection of auxiliary variables for digital soil mapping in plain areas when the soil was covered with vegetation. This finding indicated that the time series characteristics of NDVI were conducive for predicting SOC in plains.

TI  - Monitoring of Nitrogen and Grain Protein Content in Winter Wheat Based on Sentinel-2A Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grain protein content (GPC) is an important indicator of wheat quality. Earlier estimation of wheat GPC based on remote sensing provided effective decision to adapt optimized strategies for grain harvest, which is of great significance for agricultural production. The objectives of this field study are: (i) To assess the ability of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) of Sentinel 2 data to detect the wheat nitrogen (N) attributes related to the grain quality of winter wheat production, and (ii) to examine the accuracy of wheat N status and GPC estimation models based on different VIs and wheat nitrogen parameters across Analytical Spectra Devices (ASD) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) hyper-spectral data-simulated sentinel data and the real Sentinel-2 data. In this study, four nitrogen parameters at the wheat anthesis stage, including plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA), plant nitrogen content (PNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), and leaf nitrogen content (LNC), were evaluated for their relationship between spectral parameters and GPC. Then, a multivariate linear regression method was used to establish the wheat nitrogen and GPC estimation model through simulated Sentinel-2A VIs. The coefficients of determination (R-2) of four nitrogen parameter models were all greater than 0.7. The minimum R-2 of the prediction model of wheat GPC constructed by four nitrogen parameters combined with VIs was 0.428 and the highest R-2 was 0.467. The normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of the four nitrogen estimation models ranged from 26.333% to 29.530% when verified by the ground-measured data collected from the Beijing suburbs, and the corresponding nRMSE for the GPC-predicted models ranged from 17.457% to 52.518%. The accuracy of the estimated model was verified by UAV hyper-spectral data which had resized to different spatial resolution collected from the National Experimental Station for Precision Agriculture. The normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of the four nitrogen estimation models ranged from 16.9% to 37.8%, and the corresponding nRMSE for the GPC-predicted models ranged from 12.3% to 13.2%. The relevant models were also verified by Sentinel-2A data collected in 2018 while the minimum nRMSE for GPC invert model based on PNA was 7.89% and the maximum nRMSE of the GPC model based on LNC was 12.46% in Renqiu district, Hebei province. The nRMSE for the wheat nitrogen estimation model ranged from 23.200% to 42.790% for LNC and PNC. These data demonstrate that freely available Sentinel-2 imagery can be used as an important data source for wheat nutrition and grain quality monitoring.

AB  - There are no established data about lymphadenectomy during treatment of endometrial cancers (ECs) and to what extent lymphadenectomy should be performed. In addition, retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy increases the intraoperative and postoperative complications. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has the lowest costs and highest quality-adjusted survival. SLN is the most cost-effective strategy in the management of low-risk ECs. Women staged with SLN mapping were more likely to receive adjuvant treatment compared with women staged with systemic lymphadenectomy. This review article designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the methods of SLN detection in ECs.

TI  - Monitoring Groundwater Storage Depletion Using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Data in Bakhtegan Catchment, Iran
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bakhtegan catchment, an important agricultural region in south-western Iran, has suffered groundwater depletion in recent years. As groundwater is considered the main source of fresh water in the catchment, especially for agriculture, monitoring groundwater responses to irrigation is important. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data can help determine water mass changes in catchments and assess water volume changes. In this study, we compared GRACE-derived water mass data against groundwater volume variations measured in situ. We also assessed the efficiency of GRACE-derived data in catchments smaller than the 200,000 km(2) recommended area when using GRACE. For the study period (January 2002 through December 2011), the GRACE data showed a 7.6 mm annual decline in groundwater level, with a total volume loss of 2.6 km(3) during the period. The in situ monthly measurements of groundwater level showed an average depletion of 10 m in catchment aquifers during the study period. This depletion rate was supported by the recorded decrease in precipitation volume, especially in the post-drought period after 2007. These results demonstrate that GRACE can be useful tool for monitoring groundwater depletion in arid catchments.

M3  - Article
AB  - The possibilities of the use of satellite data to study lithospheric magnetic anomalies in remote and poorly studied regions are analyzed. The experiment uses data from CHAMP satellite measurements of the geomagnetic field at altitudes of similar to 280-320 km. Maps of the magnetic field over the territories of the North Atlantic Province, the Central Asian Fold Belt, and the Rhodope mountain range (Bulgaria) are given. The possible nature of lithospheric magnetic anomalies and their connection with deep structures and active tectonic processes in the lithosphere of the studied provinces are examined. The interpretation of the obtained maps shows that the lithospheric anomalies of the geomagnetic field are associated with modern, large-scale, geological and tectonic structures of the studied areas. The results are of interest for further complex geological and geophysical studies and the construction of valid models of the evolution of the lithosphere.

M3  - Article
AB  - A field study of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) in European Russia provided information on the occurrence and abundance of the species and enabled a prediction of the possible boundaries of species naturalization. As a result, the understanding of the ecological limits of common ragweed distribution related to the limiting environmental factors was refined. Insufficient heat supply during the seed ripening period is the factor that determines the expansion of the species to the north in European Russia. The moisture deficit factor determines the eastern and southeastern boundaries of species expansion. Ecological maps based on MODIS data from the Terra satellite were used in the ecological analysis of geographical distribution of the common ragweed. As a result, the map of the distribution potential of the common ragweed in European Russia was refined and the possibility of species naturalization in the area was plotted on the map.

TI  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast - Discordant size on imaging and pathology: A case report and review of literature
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon tumour of the breast. It is known for its rare lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. A triple-negative breast cancer that has a favorable prognosis compared to other triple negative ductal carcinomas, it accounts for approximately 0.1-1% of all breast cancers.Presentation of case: We report a case of a 69-year-old female with a palpable left breast mass who underwent multiple imaging modalities with significant size variance between the studies. Breast conserving therapy (BCT) was performed with axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) followed by radiation therapy (RT). Pathological examination confirmed the tumour as ACC.Discussion: ACC, known as an persistent if low-grade malignant tumour of salivary gland, is considered to have low-malignant potential in the breast. It is a very rare subtype and from this scant data, there is minimal mention about size discrepancy between imaging modalities such as ultrasound and MRI.No consistent MRI features have been demonstrated, with the exception of T2 hyperintensity in larger lesions and T2 iso-intensity in smaller lesions. Ultrasound demonstrates primarily a hypoechoic or heterogenous mass with minimum vascularity, consistent with our radiographic findings.Conclusion: ACC is a rare entity in breast cancer pathology. Its size can be highly variable as measured by various radiographic modalities, and final Pathology from the surgical specimen is, as always, required for an accurate tumoral diameter. With that caveat, careful utilization of pre-operative imaging modalities is critical in pre-surgical planning to choose the appropriate surgery.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study has combined the 16-day NDVI (250-m) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer remote sensing data and cadastre maps for monitoring cultivated areas during 2000-2013 in downstream of Doroodzan dam agricultural lands, Fars province, Iran. There are three regions in dams' downstream including Marvdasht, Shiraz and Kharameh which were mainly irrigated by this reservoir. In the surveyed period, 300 artificial bounds of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used. Then, the cadastre maps of each region were crossed over the NDVI bounds and the fluctuation of NDVI time series in each farmland were determined. Also, based on the ground observations through the Fars Comprehensive Agricultural Database (FCADB), the NDVI more than 0.2 throughout the time series was specified as the cultivation area. Therefore, on each farmland the history of cultivation was achieved. Also, the relationships between NDVI fluctuation and monthly mean temperature, precipitation and its anomaly (standardized precipitation) in various lags were analyzed. Results exhibited two crop cultivations including in both winter (mainly wheat and barley crops) and summer season types (majority paddy and maize). However, during droughts and shortages, just winter cultivation was detected from 2008 to 2010 in Shiraz and Kharameh farmlands. Also, the summer crop cultivation areas in Marvdasht region decreased during these years. Moreover, Kharameh in 2009 had no crop cultivation. With regard to cultivation areas with temperature, the most correlations were found between temperature and cultivation area in the third lag months equal to 0.73, 0.68 and 0.44 for Shiraz, Marvdasht and Kharameh, respectively. For precipitation, the most correlation with cultivation area appeared in 9 lag months equal to 0.44, 0.43 and 0.28 for Shiraz, Marvdasht and Kharameh, respectively. Although temperature and precipitation play an exclusive role in the fluctuation of NDVI over the study area, the lack of exact data, mainly cadastre one, has been the main source of non-efficient water allocation systems over the farmlands. Based on the new data provided by FCADB based on the cadastre maps, the managers and decision makers can have a stronger irrigation planning over the agricultural lands.

TI  - Dynamic process and artificial mechanism of coastline change in the Pearl River Estuary
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pearl River Estuary (PRE) is a window into the drastic changes that occurred throughout coastal areas due to artificial agglomeration following China's 1978 economic reform. In this study, multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing images were used to extract coastlines in the PRE with the support vector machine (SVM). In addition, the coastline was divided into nine segments by using the eight mouths as the cut-off points. A statistical analysis was performed on the length and changes of each coastline segment. The analysis was focused on the five shores that exhibited obvious changes. Subsequently, a correlation analysis between three artificial development factors, namely, the development intensity, development speed, and development density, and the shoreline length was conducted, following which the main driving factors influencing the changes in the coastline were obtained. Finally, the dynamic processes and artificial mechanisms of the coastline changes in the PRE were deeply analyzed. The results reveal that the coastline has been gradually advancing over a distance of 164.01 km toward the sea over the past 40 years, and the growth rate initially showed a rapidly increasing trend in 1978 but has since slowed from 1998 to the present. The most significant changes were detected along the Hutiao Men-Jiti Men and Jiti Men-Modao Men shore areas due to the impacts of human activities. The development speed presented dominant influence on coastline change at the end of the 20th century, but the development intensity was the primary influence factor during the early 21st century. To a certain extent, the monitoring and analysis of historical coastline changes can contribute to coastal zone planning in more detail, thereby promoting the sustainable development of coastal zones.

TI  - Allergy-like reactions to methylene blue following laparoscopic chromopertubation: A systematic review of the literature
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Methylene blue is commonly used as a tracer in sentinel lymph node mapping for many malignant diseases or chromopertubation during gynecologic laparoscopy. In contrast with other blue dyes such as patent blue V or isosulfan blue, methylene blue rarely causes an allergy-like reaction in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping. However, in chromopertubation, some cases of allergy-like reaction to methylene blue have been reported; these comprise two types: an allergic reaction and methemoglobinemia. In this study, a systematic literature review of allergy-like reactions caused by methylene blue dye following laparoscopic chromopertubation was conducted. A search was conducted in PUBMED, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception until June 2018, using the terms: "methylene blue", "complication", "allergic", "hypersensitive", "lung/pulmonary edema","methemoglobinemia", "anaphylactic shock", "chromopertubation", "pertubation", "laparoscopic", and "laparoscopy". Ultimately, the eligibility criteria were fulfilled by only 12 case reports. Among 13 cases including our case of severe anaphylactic shock after chromopertubation, allergic reactions were diagnosed in four cases, methemoglobinemia in six, and there was no confirmed diagnosis in three cases; the clinical course consisted of skin changes, blue discoloration of body fluids, respiratory failure, and hemodynamic failure, regardless of the underlying diagnoses. Regarding diagnosis, methemoglobinemia was confirmed with co-oximetry (spectrophotometry). First-line therapy included supportive care for both cases of allergic reactions and methemoglobinemia.

TI  - Change detection on land use/land cover and land surface temperature using spatiotemporal data of Landsat: a case study of Gaza Strip
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human and natural activities are considered one of several factors that lead to global environmental changes. Urbanization and population growth are the most prevailing issues facing scientists around the world which further affect the environment and temperature. According to statistics, the population in Gaza Strip, a small and besieged area, will be over 2.4 million and the land demands will exceed the sustainable capacity of land use by 2023. In this study, geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS)techniques were applied to estimate temporal change detection of land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) for Gaza Strip between 2000 and 2017 and to indicate the relationship between land changes and demography changes and LST in the same period. In this study, two kinds of pixel-based classifiers, i.e., maximum likelihood (ML) and support vector machine (SVM), have been performed to extract LULC changes. While for LST, it was calculated by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) andSurface Emissivity equations. The results show clear decrease between 2000 and 2017 in bare land (67.19%) compared to an increase in urban (13.12%) and crop and vegetation (4.95%). Furthermore, the increase in population is directly proportional to the increase in urban area through this period. In addition to that, LST in bare lands has the highest temperature in July and September (summer, autumn) and the lowest in January (winter) due to seasonal effects.

TI  - Assessment of the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network method performance in geological mapping using satellite images and Boolean logic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, in executive comparative studies and even in the research studies of natural resources, the use of maps produced by the geological survey forms the basis of geological studies. However, in recent years, remote sensing technology has been introduced as a new and efficient tool for geological studies which in addition to the accuracy has other benefits such as access to the arduous mountainous areas or inaccessible that can help us to prepare geological maps with more accuracy. The purpose of this study is to compare geological survey geological maps with a scale of 1: 100,000, and produced and modified by Google Earth maps by using fuzzy ARTMAP artificial neural network method. For this purpose, the geological map of a part of Yazd-Shirkooh watershed prepared by using Landsat 7 image by fuzzy ARTMAP artificial neural network method with Kappa coefficient of 89%. Also, geological survey and Google Earth map prepared. Graphic map obtained from the visual interpretation of Google Earth images with the ground control was considered as the base map and comparing it with other maps evaluated by using Boolean logic. By using the sampling network created 100 points which 62 points were in the study area and 56 cases in the fuzzy ARTMAP map and 52 cases in the geological survey map were consistent with the base map. Due to reduced cost and time and no limits of time and space, fuzzy ARTMAP is a suitable method for the preparation of geological maps.

TI  - On the Prediction of Upwelling Events at the Colombian Caribbean Coasts from Modis-SST Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The upwelling cores on the Caribbean Colombian coasts are mainly located at the Peninsula de la Guajira and Cabo de la Aguja. We used monthly averaged Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea surface temperature as the only information to build up a prediction model for the upwelling events. This comprised two steps: (i) the reduction of the complexity by means of the Karhunen-Loeve transform and (ii) a prediction model of time series. Two prediction models were considered: (a) a parametric autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) time series from the Box-Jenkins methodology and (b) a harmonic synthesis model. The harmonic synthesis also comprised of two steps: the maximum entropy spectral analysis and a least-squares harmonic analysis on the set of frequencies. The parametric ARMA time series model failed at the time of prediction with a very narrow range, and it was quite difficult to apply. The harmonic synthesis allowed prediction with a horizon of six months with a correlation of about 0.80. The results can be summarized using the time series of the weights of the different oscillation modes, their spatial structures with the nodal lines, and a high confidence model with a horizon of prediction of about four months.

TI  - Assessment of Remote Sensing Data to Model PM10 Estimation in Cities with a Low Number of Air Quality Stations: A Case of Study in Quito, Ecuador
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of air pollutant concentration within cities is crucial for environment management and public health policies in order to promote sustainable cities. In this study, we present an approach to estimate the concentration of particulate matter of less than 10 mu m diameter (PM10) using an empirical land use regression (LUR) model and considering different remote sensing data as the input. The study area is Quito, the capital of Ecuador, and the data were collected between 2013 and 2017. The model predictors are the surface reflectance bands (visible and infrared) of Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS, and Aqua-Terra/MODIS sensors and some environmental indexes (normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI; normalized difference soil index-NDSI, soil-adjusted vegetation index-SAVI; normalized difference water index-NDWI; and land surface temperature (LST)). The dependent variable is PM10 ground measurements. Furthermore, this study also aims to compare three different sources of remote sensing data (Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-8 OLI, and Aqua-Terra/MODIS) to estimate the PM10 concentration, and three different predictive techniques (stepwise regression, partial least square regression, and artificial neuronal network (ANN)) to build the model. The models obtained are able to estimate PM10 in regions where air data acquisition is limited or even does not exist. The best model is the one built with an ANN, where the coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.68) is the highest and the root-mean-square error (RMSE = 6.22) is the lowest among all the models. Thus, the selected model allows the generation of PM10 concentration maps from public remote sensing data, constituting an alternative over other techniques to estimate pollutants, especially when few air quality ground stations are available.

TI  - Molecular characterization of rotavirus genotype-A in children with acute diarrhea attending a tertiary hospital in Ilorin, Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND ALLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite indications that severe rotavirus diarrhea in children under <5 years of age is a major public health problem, only limited specific data on rotavirus burden are available in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to carry out molecular characterization of circulating rotavirus strains causing acute diarrhea among under-five children attending University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Ilorin, Nigeria.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three under-five children who are hospitalized with severe diarrhea were enrolled and their stool samples were collected for the detection and subsequent characterization for G and P rotavirus serotypes.RESULTS: Of a total of 93 samples comprising 54 (58.1%) males and 39 (41.9%) females, 25 (26.9%) samples were positive for rotavirus by ELISA. Genotyping by RT-PCR was done on 25 samples. The most prevalent type-able VP7 G types were G9 (28%), G1 (24%), followed by G12 (20%), G2 (12%), and G10 (4%); on the other hand, the most prevalent type-able VP4 P types are P8 (48%), P4 (24%), and P6 (16%). The most common G-P combination was G9P (4) (20%) followed by G12P (8) and G1P (4) (16%, respectively); then GNTP (8) and G1P (6) (8%, respectively); and G9P (8), G12P (4), G10P (6), G2P (8), and G2P (6) (4%, respectively). The rotaviruses isolated from these children were from those <24 months of age (100%). There is statistical relationship between the prevalence of rotavirus infection with age (P = 0.033) but not with gender (P = 0.765).CONCLUSION: This study highlights the rotavirus disease burden and diversity of rotavirus strains circulating in UITH. Continued sentinel surveillance will provide useful information to policy-makers with regard to rotavirus vaccine introduction.

TI  - Testing early warning metrics for drought-induced tree physiological stress and mortality
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change-driven drought stress has triggered numerous large-scale tree mortality events in recent decades. Advances in mechanistic understanding and prediction are greatly limited by an inability to detect in situ where trees are likely to die in order to take timely measurements and actions. Thus, algorithms of early warning and detection of drought-induced tree stress and mortality could have major scientific and societal benefits. Here, we leverage two consecutive droughts in the southwestern United States to develop and test a set of early warning metrics. Using Landsat satellite data, we constructed early warning metrics from the first drought event. We then tested these metrics' ability to predict spatial patterns in tree physiological stress and mortality from the second drought. To test the broader applicability of these metrics, we also examined a separate drought in the Amazon rainforest. The early warning metrics successfully explained subsequent tree mortality in the second drought in the southwestern US, as well as mortality in the independent drought in tropical forests. The metrics also strongly correlated with spatial patterns in tree hydraulic stress underlying mortality, which provides a strong link between tree physiological stress and remote sensing during the severe drought and indicates that the loss of hydraulic function during drought likely mediated subsequent mortality. Thus, early warning metrics provide a critical foundation for elucidating the physiological mechanisms underpinning tree mortality in mature forests and guiding management responses to these climate-induced disturbances.

TI  - Analysis of vegetation cover area as an urban environmental quality factor
T2  - REVISTA DE CIENCIAS AGRICOLAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of urbanization modifies and eliminates biological components of urban morphology by replacing vegetation cover with gray surfaces. This study aimed to identify the changes in vegetation cover in the city of San Juan de Pasto between the periphery and commune 1, which has the lowest vegetation cover in the city. A multi-temporal analysis was performed with LANDSAT satellite images over a period of 27 years (1989-2016) using the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) to determine the loss of urban vegetation cover (UVC). The urban environmental quality index (UEQI) was estimated based on the methodology proposed by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia (MinAmbiente), obtaining a score of 42 points that indicates low environmental quality. Furthermore, a new UEQI was calculated by mathematically extrapolating and correlating the theoretical benefits of UVC with environmental quality indicators, such as air quality, urban population exposure to noise exceeding the permitted levels, and residential energy consumption per capita. There was an improvement in the score of all the indicators and, consequently, the UEQI. A high projected environmental quality score of 60 was obtained, demonstrating that UVC through its benefits is a transforming factor of urban environmental quality due to the benefits provided by vegetation cover.

TI  - Perioperative PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy and fluorescent real-time imaging for sentinel lymph node mapping in early staged colon cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Using current optical imaging techniques and gamma imaging modalities, perioperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification in colon cancer can be difficult when the SLN is located near the primary tumour or beneath a thick layer of (fat) tissue. Sentinel lymph node mapping using PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy combined with real-time visualization of the SLN using near-infrared imaging has shown promising results in several types of cancer and may facilitate the successful identification of the number and location of the SLN in early colon cancer.MethodsClinical feasibility of PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy using preoperative endoscopically injected [Zr-89]Zr-Nanocoll and intraoperative injection of the near-infrared (NIR) tracer Indocyanine Green (ICG) was evaluated in ten early colon cancer patients. Three preoperative PET/CT scans and an additional ex vivo scan of the specimen were performed after submucosal injection of [Zr-89]Zr-Nanocoll. All SLNs and other lymph nodes underwent extensive pathological examination for metastases. A histopathological proven lymph node visible at preoperative PET/CT and identified at PET/CT of the specimen was defined as SLN.ResultsA total of 27 SLNs were harvested in seven out of eight patients with successful injection of both tracers. In one patient no SLNs were assigned preoperatively. In two patients injection of [Zr-89]Zr-Nanocoll failed due to incorrect needle positioning. Twenty-one (78%) SLNs were found intraoperatively using NIR-imaging. Eleven of the 27 (41%) SLNs were located near the primary tumour (< 2cm). Those six SLNs not found intraoperatively with NIR-imaging were all located close to the tumour. In all seven patients at least one SLN could be assigned at preoperative imaging 24h after tracer administration. One SLN contained metastases detected by immunohistochemistry. No metastases were found in the non-SLNs.ConclusionsThis study shows the potential of preoperative PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy to inform the surgeon about the number and location of SLNs in patients with early colon cancer. The additional use of NIR-imaging allows for intraoperative identification of these SLNs which are invisible with conventional white light imaging. Further research is necessary to improve and simplify the technique. We recommend perioperative SLN identification using a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy scan just before surgery approximately 24h after injection. Additionally a postoperative scan of the specimen combined with intraoperative real-time NIR-imaging should be performed.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Owabi Reservoir Catchment, Ghana: Implications for Livelihoods and Management
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir catchments in Ghana have undergone significant changes in recent years with major implications for socio-economic development and local livelihoods. We studied land use and land cover changes and their impacts on livelihoods in the Owabi reservoir catchment from 1970 to 2014 using Landsat, ERDAS Imagine and Arc Geographic Information System (ArcGIS 10.2) software supplemented with participatory approaches including focus group discussions, key informant interviews and questionnaire surveys with 400 households. Our results showed that, since 1970, 24.6% of high-density forests and 15.8% of sparse forests have disappeared, while the built-up area has increased from 9.8% to 56.6%. Additionally, the proportion of bare soil (areas that do not have vegetation cover due to forest clearing and other anthropogenic activities) has increased, while the areas of waterbodies have declined. We identified urbanisation and lack of community involvement in catchment management as the key factors driving the land cover changes that have adversely affected the livelihoods of the local fringe communities. This study highlights the threats from urbanisation to land cover changes and identifies the key drivers of land use change. For effective and sustainable management of natural resources, the local communities should be more actively involved in the decision-making process regarding the management of their individual catchments.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated human induced changes to land use and land cover in three areas of Ethiopia that were occupied by Eritrean refugees, over a period of 10-18 years. Three years of Landsat satellite images were acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey. To detect changes, we used cloud free Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper for the years 2000 and 2010, and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor for 2017 for data interpretation. Significant changes were observed including significant loss of forests in all three refuges areas and an increment ion cultivated land in two areas (an average of 122%) except in one area where it reduced by 79.8%. Changes in the other classes of land use and land cover were also observed but at different rates. Our results demonstrate that alternative energy sources that replace firewood consumption are needed, as well as diversification of sources of income, such as off-farm activities, in order to improve the livelihood of the host community.

TI  - Landsat 8 OLI TIRS Imagery Ability for Monitoring Post Forest Fire Changes
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem in this research is monitoring the forest fire disasters in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. One form of technology that can be applied to support the forest fire prevention activities is remote sensing satellite technology. The objective of this research is to analyze the ability of the Landsat 8 OLI TIRS for monitoring post-fire forest changes based on the Delta NBR and Delta NDVI values. The data used in this research were Delta NBR and Delta NDVI generated from Landsat 8 OLI data record from August 11 to September 6, 2017. The research showed that burned areas in South Kalimantan Province could be identified from the Landsat 8 OLI imagery based on changes on the Delta NBR and Delta NDVI values. The former burned areas during the 2017 fire season in South Kalimantan Province (August-September) were mostly found in some regency such as Banjar, Hulu Sungai Utara, Hulu Sungai Selatan, Tapin, Tanah Laut, and Banjarbaru. The Landsat 8 OLI TIRS has longer spectral bands. The use of the NBR index using the SWIR band makes the Landsat 8 OLI TIRS to be more preferred than other imagery.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) is an Earth observation mission currently in development by the European Space Agency to perform quantitative measurements of the solar induce vegetation fluorescence. As a core of the mission concept, FLEX is planned to be launched by the end of 2023 and shall fly in tandem with one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, which is already in orbit. This situation will allow FLEX to benefit from the optical and thermal sensors of Sentinel-3 and provide an integrated package of measurements. This paper presents the preliminary parametric analysis on the along-track dynamic of the tandem flight formation between Sentinel-3 and FLEX. It includes the study of the maneuvering strategy for a master-slave scenario concept, where Sentinel-3 acts as the master of the formation, whereas FLEX is the slave. This control strategy is assessed in terms of safety for both satellites and performance, where it is of interest to maintain the along-track distance between satellites as bounded as possible. Numerical and analytical results of this paper are provided showing that the control strategy proposed is able to fulfill the mission requirements under the expected conditions while providing enough time for the control center to coordinate the orbital maneuvers of Sentinel-3 and FLEX. Additionally, and from the results obtained in this paper, it is concluded that the safest configuration for the mission is locating FLEX ahead of Sentinel-3.

TI  - Assessment of hotspots using sparse autoencoder in industrial zones
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite systems can be used to detect industrial zones by means of thermal infrared bands. There are several satellite systems loaded with thermal infrared sensors such as Landsat and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). In this study, ASTER thermal infrared data were converted to land surface temperature (LST) in order to determine hotspots caused by industrial zones. High LST values surrounded by low LST values are called hotspots here. These hotspots can be determined by applying different methodologies. One of these methods of sparse autoencoder can be used to indicate hotspots using different sizes of hidden layers. The principle of sparse autoencoder depends on unlabeled data in unsupervised learning. It does not need any information about labeled data as in supervised learning. The autoencoder reproduces its output with the same dimensions as the input image by managing the size of the hidden layer. The reconstruction of the image depends on the minimization of a cost function. The size of the hidden layer sets the fitting degree of the function for the reproduced image. A low-order reproduced image is the main target for hotspot detection. In this study, the difference between the original image and the reproduced image was analyzed for hotspot detection. Sparse autoencoder was successfully applied to ASTER thermal band 10 for hotspot detection in 7 pre-defined sites of a region known for steel industry for the two different days.

TI  - Unexpected Finding on Mammography and MRI due to Accumulation of Iron Oxide Particles Used for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a case with imaging artefacts on mammography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) caused by iron oxide particles. After being diagnosed with the medullary cancer of the breast, the female patient had a breast conserving surgery on right breast. Iron oxide particles were used for the detection of the sentinel lymph node during operation. On follow ups, a de novo density on mammography, which was initially thought to be a new tumour, was found. MR images proved that the lesion is an artefact caused by iron oxide accumulation. Our aim in this case study is to underline and discuss the imaging artefacts caused by these particles and raise awareness.

TI  - Modeling the spatial distribution of Global Solar Radiation (GSR) over Ghana using the Angstrom-Prescott sunshine duration model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation is an important geological and meteorological parameter. In most developing countries, data is readily unavailable owing to lack of instrumentation and skilled personnel. In this study, Global solar radiation (GSR) over Ghana has been quantified using the Angstrom-Prescott sunshine model with sunshine duration data from 22 synoptic stations distributed across the country's ecological zones. The simulated data was gridded at 10 km by 10 km, establishing the spatial distribution of solar radiation over the country. Comparison with satellite data showed good results with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 1-5 MJm(-2)day(-1) and correlation coefficient of 60 - 66%. Meanwhile, the estimated total GSR over the country was found to be 412.82 MJm(-2)day(-1). The savanna zone had the maximum estimated total monthly mean GSR for the year, with the highest value of 20.76 MJm(-2)day(-1) in Navrongo. The forest zone had the minimum estimated total annual mean GSR, with the lowest radiation level in Oda (17.11 MJm(-2)day(-1)). A maximum and minimum mean clearness index of 0.59 and 0.48 respectively are estimated, implying that about 53% of solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere reaches the study area after attenuation. The satellite data has a total monthly mean horizontal Global Solar irradiance of 366.62 MJm(-2)day(-1). The study shows that the region is a potential field to harness and optimize solar energy for the operation of photovoltaic systems and solar collectors for industrial and domestic applications.

TI  - A novel unsupervised change detection approach based on reconstruction independent component analysis and ABC-Kmeans clustering for environmental monitoring
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I propose a new unsupervised change detection method for optical satellite imagery. The proposed technique consists of three phases. In the first stage, difference images are calculated using four different functions. Two of the functions were first used in this study. In the second stage, using Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis, this four-difference matrix is projected to one feature. In the last stage, clustering is performed. Kmeans tuned by Artificial Bee Colony (ABC-Kmeans) clustering technique has been developed and proposed by following a different strategy in the clustering phase. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was examined using two different datasets, Sardinia and Mexico. Quantitative evaluation was performed in two stages. In the first stage, proposed method was compared with different unsupervised change detection algorithms using False Alarm, Missed Alarm, Total Error, and Total Error Rate metrics which are calculated using ground truth image in dataset. In the second experimental study, the proposed approach is compared in detail with PCA-Kmeans approach, which is quite often preferred for similar studies, using the Mean Squared Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and Universal Image Quality Index metrics. According to quantitative and qualitative analysis, proposed approach can produce quite successful results using optical remote sensing data.

TI  - Graphite/Nanocrystalline Zeolite Platform for Selective Electrochemical Determination of Hepatitis C Inhibitor Ledipasvir
T2  - ELECTROANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple and efficient procedure is described for the electrochemical determination of ledipasvir (LDP) in presence of co-formulated drug sofosbuvir (SOF). Herein, a highly sensitive, low-cost electrochemical protocol was utilized to fabricate a zeolite modified carbon paste electrode (ZY/CPE) through mixing of zeolite nanostructures with graphite powder. The fabricated sensor displayed high sensitivity, allowing optimal charge transfer/electrode kinetics. Different experimental and chemical factors, including electrode composition, effect of pH, scan rate and amount of ZY were evaluated carefully to obtain the highest electrochemical response. Under optimized conditions and using square wave voltammetry (SWV), the current response of the ZY/CPE electrochemical sensing platform exhibited a detection limit of 7.5x10(-9) M and a large linear range from 5.0x10(-8) to 1.0x10(-4) M. The practical applicability of the suggested electrochemical platform was verified in the assessment of LDP in pharmaceutical formulations with excellent recoveries in the range of 99.50-98.87 %. Moreover, a biological relevance of the developed sensor was established by the analysis of LDP in human urine and plasma samples with satisfactory recoveries of 99.00 and 99.68 %, respectively. Due to the simplicity and ease of preparation of the proposed sensor, it can be used in quality control laboratories and for clinical analysis.

TI  - Crop residue open field burning in Pakistan; multi-year high spatial resolution emission inventory for 2000-2014
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over recent years, crop residue burning has become a widely practiced agricultural activity in developing countries due to varying economic and social reasons. To estimate current pollution generation from crop residue burning in Pakistan, an emission inventory was developed based on district level crop production data from 2000 to 2014. Spatial distribution of quantified emissions was achieved by using MODIS Active Fire Data (MOD/MYD14A1) at 1-day temporal and 1 x km spatial resolutions. The fire occurrences were extracted over agricultural land using land cover data provided by European Space Agency/Climate Change Initiative (ESA/CCI) at 300 m spatial resolution for 2000 to 2014. Results show that CO emissions have increased by 40% at an average annual rate of 2.7% from 1.16 Tg in 2000 to 1.63 Tg in 2014 and increase in emissions of CO2, CH4, NMVOCs, N2O, NH3, SO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, OC and BC ranged between 37%, to 63% during same period. Spatially, CO emissions were more significant in districts of Punjab and Sindh provinces with intensive agricultural activities as compared to other areas of Pakistan with highest emission grids located in Muzaffargarh, Jafferabad, and Noushahro Feroze districts. Crop residue burning exhibited similar trend with highest emissions in June followed by February and November over 15-year period. The emissions for most of the considered pollutants were comparable to the limited previous studies available. Finally, the study conducted provides better understanding regarding spatial and temporal patterns of crop residue burning across Pakistan and can be utilized for air quality modeling and management with higher accuracy.

TI  - Effect of Digital Elevation Model Resolution on the Simulation of the Snow Cover Evolution in the High Atlas
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow melt from the High Atlas represents a crucial water resource for crop irrigation in the semiarid regions of Morocco. Recent studies have used assimilation of snow cover area data from high-resolution optical sensors to compute the snow water equivalent and snow melt in other mountain regions. These techniques however require large model ensembles, and therefore it is a challenge to determine the adequate model resolution that yields accurate results with reasonable computation time. Here we study the sensitivity of an energy balance model to the resolution of the model grid for a pilot catchment in the High Atlas. We used a time series of 8-m resolution snow cover area maps with an average revisit time of 7.5 days to evaluate the model results. The digital elevation model was generated from Pleiades stereo images and resampled from 8 to 30, 90, 250, 500, and 1,000 m. The results indicate that the model performs well from 8 to 250 m but the agreement with observations drops at 500 m. This is because significant features of the topography were too smoothed out to properly characterize the spatial variability of meteorological forcing, including solar radiation. We conclude that a resolution of 250 m might be sufficient in this area. This result is consistent with the shape of the semivariogram of the topographic slope, suggesting that this semivariogram analysis could be used to transpose our conclusion to other study regions.

TI  - The 'sentinel' vessel: an anatomical landmark to identify the pes anserinus during hamstrings harvest for ACL reconstruction
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hamstrings identification and subsequent graft harvest can be made difficult by body habitus and variability in tendon anatomy. We describe a 'sentinel' blood vessel near the insertions of gracilis and semitendinosus to facilitate identification. A prospective study of 100 patients (100 knees) undergoing primary arthroscopic ACL reconstruction (via the anterior approach) with hamstrings graft was conducted. We searched for a 'sentinel' vessel and studied its position, orientation and perpendicular distance from the pes tendons. The 'sentinel' vessel was present in 98/100 knees. It passed from the superficial fascia to the periosteum at the pes insertion at a mean perpendicular distance of 8 mm from the upper border of the pes tendons. The 'sentinel' vessel was a consistent anatomical finding and served as a reliable guide in determining the pes insertion. Identifying this anatomical landmark allowed a small skin incision with limited wound dissection minimising risk of injury to the infra-patellar branch of the saphenous nerve.

TI  - Methods for Earth-Observing Satellite Surface Reflectance Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study an initial validation of the Landsat 8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) Surface Reflectance (SR) product was performed. The OLI SR product is derived from the L8 Top-of-Atmosphere product via the Landsat Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) software and generated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate proper validation methodology for the OLI L2 SR product. Validation was performed using near-simultaneous ground truth SR measurements during Landsat 8 overpasses at 13 sites located in the U.S., Brazil, Chile and France. The ground truth measurements consisted of field spectrometer measurements, automated hyperspectral ground measurements operated by the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) and derived SR measurements from Airborne Observation Platforms (AOP) operated by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The 13 sites cover a broad range of 0-0.5 surface reflectance units across the reflective solar spectrum. Results show that the mean reflectance difference between OLI L2 SR products and ground truth measurements for the 13 validation sites and all bands was under 2.5%. The largest uncertainties of 11% and 8% were found in the CA and Blue bands, respectively; whereas, the longer wavelength bands were within 4% or less. Results consistently indicated similarity between the OLI L2 SR product and ground truth data, especially in longer wavelengths over dark and bright targets, while less reliable performance was observed in shorter wavelengths and sparsely vegetated targets.

TI  - Magnetic detection of sentinel lymph node in papillary thyroid carcinoma: The MAGIC-PAT study results
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Despite the controversy concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), successful detection rates can be achieved by radioguidance and vital dyeing. However, the drawbacks in both techniques are notable. Magnetic-guided SLNB (mSLNB) using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles is appealing as an alternative procedure.Materials and Methods: mSLNB using the Sentimag-Sienna System (R), total thyroidectomy and central compartment dissection (CCD) were performed on all PTC patients. Lymph node involvement was assessed by postoperative pathological examination.Results: From 2014 to 2016, 33 consecutive patients with PTC were enrolled in the study. A total of 20 patients met the eligibility. mSLNB succeeded in 16 patients, with a detection rate of 80%. A median of two SLN per patient were detected. A median of 10.5 non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN) from CCD were examined. Among the patients, 56.25% (9/16) had no metastatic nodes, while 12.5% (2/16) had exclusively SLN involvement. No false negative cases were found. The agreement between SLN and NSLN status was 87.5%. The prediction of NSLN involvement by SLN status showed 100% sensitivity, 81.8% specificity, 71.4% PPV and 100% NPV. Subsequently, mSLNB and the final pathological analysis would discriminate 43.75% (7/16) of patients who would certainly benefit from CCD whilst 56.25% of the total would confirm an unnecessary lymphadenectomy and avoid morbidity.Conclusion: mSLNB showed satisfactory performance in FTC with clinical-negative nodes. We have shown mSLNB to be a good predictor of central compartment status that can improve the staging and management of PTC patients.

TI  - Assessing nighttime lights for mapping the urban areas of 50 cities across the globe
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System have been widely used to map urban/built-up areas (hereafter referred to as "built-up area"), but to date there has not been a geographically comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of using nighttime lights data to map urban areas. We created accurate, convenient, and scalable grid cells based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System nighttime light pixels. We then calculated the density of Landsat-derived built-up areas within each grid cell. We explored the relationship between Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System nighttime lights data and the density of built-up areas to assess the utility of nighttime lights for mapping urban areas in 50 cities across the globe. We found that the brightness of nighttime lights was only in moderate agreement with the density of built-up areas; moreover, correlations between nighttime lights and Landsat-derived built-up areas were weak. Even in relatively sparsely populated urban regions (where the density of the built-up area is less than 20%), the highest correlation coefficient (R-2) was only 0.4. Furthermore, nighttime lights showed lighted areas that extended beyond the area of large cities, and nighttime lights reduced the area of small cities. The results suggest that it is difficult to use the regression model to calibrate the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System nighttime lights to fit urban built up areas.

TI  - Jujube yield prediction method combining Landsat 8 Vegetation Index and the phenological length
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging to generate a time series of vegetation indices from moderate spatial resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper images (Landsat 8) for crop yield forecasting. In addition, crop yields are correlated with phenology information, especially the fruit filling days. The objectives of this study were to identify the phenology time for making a reliable jujube yield prediction, more importantly, explore an approach that used the length of phenology growth period to improve remotely sensed estimates of inter-annual variability for yields. The best time for making jujube yield prediction was found to be during the fruit filling period, showing higher correlation coefficient (r) between vegetation indices and yields. The average NDVI for 14th and 15th half-months represented a better performance for yield prediction, with a highest r value of 0.87 for NDVI, 0.82 for SAVI, 0.73 for NDWI and 0.73 for EVI, respectively. The potential of using Landsat-NDVI for jujube yield estimation, combined with the phenological length, was preliminarily proved based on 200 observations of individual jujube orchards, showing a validated R-2 of 0.85, 0.80 and 0.67, RMSE of 0.61, 0.78 and 0.85 t ha(-1) for 2013, 2014 and 2016, respectively. Furthermore, the phenological adjusted model was further evaluated by inter-annual official statistic data, with R-2 and RMSE values ranging from 0.38 to 0.53, and 0.31 to 0.47 t ha(-1), respectively. The proposed method showed better performance between years when the fruit filling days differed greatly than the leave-one-year-out method, which was verified to well fit to jujube yield monitoring and mapping two months before harvest.

TI  - Kawasaki disease and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination among young children: A self-controlled risk interval and cohort study with null results
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundKawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis that primarily affects children younger than 5 years of age. Its etiology is unknown. The United States Vaccine Safety Datalink conducted postlicensure safety surveillance for 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), comparing the risk of Kawasaki disease within 28 days of PCV13 vaccination with the historical risk after 7-valent PCV (PCV7) vaccination and using chart-validation. A relative risk (RR) of 2.38 (95% CI 0.92-6.38) was found. Concurrently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a postlicensure safety review that identified cases of Kawasaki disease through adverse event reporting. The FDA decided to initiate a larger study of Kawasaki disease risk following PCV13 vaccination in the claims-based Sentinel/Postlicensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) surveillance system. The objective of this study was to determine the existence and magnitude of any increased risk of Kawasaki disease in the 28 days following PCV13 vaccination.Methods and findingsThe study population included mostly commercially insured children from birth to <24 months of age in 2010 to 2015 from across the US. Using claims data of participating Sentinel/PRISM data-providing organizations, PCV13 vaccinations were identified by means of current procedural terminology (CPT), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), and National Drug Code (NDC) codes. Potential cases of Kawasaki disease were identified by first-in-365-days International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) code 446.1 or International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) code M30.3 in the inpatient setting. Medical records were sought for potential cases and adjudicated by board-certified pediatricians. The primary analysis used chart-confirmed cases with adjudicated symptom onset in a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) design, which controls for time-invariant potential confounders. The prespecified risk interval was Days 1-28 after vaccination; a 28-day-long control interval followed this risk interval. A secondary analytic approach used a cohort design, with alternative potential risk intervals of Days 1-28 and Days 1-42. The varying background risk of Kawasaki disease by age was adjusted for in both designs. In the primary analysis, there were 43 confirmed cases of Kawasaki disease in the risk interval and 44 in the control interval. The age-adjusted risk estimate was 1.07 (95% CI 0.70-1.63; p = 0.76). In the secondary, cohort analyses, which included roughly 700 potential cases and more than 3 million person-years, the risk estimates of potential Kawasaki disease in the risk interval versus in unexposed person-time were 0.84 (95% CI 0.65-1.08; p = 0.18) for the Days 1-28 risk interval and 0.97 (95% CI 0.79-1.19; p = 0.80) for the Days 1-42 risk interval. The main limitation of the study was that we lacked the resources to conduct medical record review for all the potential cases of Kawasaki disease. As a result, potential cases rather than chart-confirmed cases were used in the cohort analyses.ConclusionsWith more than 6 million doses of PCV13 administered, no evidence was found of an association between PCV13 vaccination and Kawasaki disease onset in the 4 weeks after vaccination nor of an elevated risk extending or concentrated somewhat beyond 4 weeks. These null results were consistent across alternative designs, age-adjustment methods, control intervals, and categories of Kawasaki disease case included.

TI  - Predictive factors of unexpected lymphatic drainage pathways in early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. The purpose of this study was to describe sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) topography in patients with early-stage cervical cancer and to determine factors associated with atypical lymphatic drainage pathway (LDP).Methods. We analyzed the data of two prospective multicentric trials on SLN biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I and II) in women undergoing surgery for early-stage cervical cancer. SLN detection was realized with a combined labeling technique (Patent blue and radioactive tracer). Patients having bilateral SLN detection were included. Univariate and Multivariate analysis were performed by patients and by side to assess clinical and pathologic factors that may predict atypical LDP.Results. Between January 2005 and July 2012, 326 patients with 1104 intraoperative detected SLNs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The SLNs were mainly located in the interiliac or external iliac area in 83.2%. The other localizations were: 9.2% in the common iliac area, 3.9% in the parametrium, 1.6% in the promontory area, 1.5% in the paraaortic area and 0.5% in other areas. Thirty-five patients (10.7%) had atypical SLN without SLN in typical area on one or both sides. In multivariate analysis, tumor size ?20 mm appeared as an independent factor of having at least one exclusive atypical LDP (ORa = 3.95 95%Cl = [1.60-9.78], p = 0.003). Multiparity decreased significantly the probability of having at least one exclusive atypical LDP (ORa = 0.16 95%Cl = [0.07-039], p <0.0001).Conclusions. Tumor size larger than 20 mm and nulliparity increase the risk of having exclusive atypical LDP in early-stage cervical cancer. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Up and out: A multifaceted approach to characterizing urbanization in Greater Saigon, 2000-2009
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this case study of Greater Saigon, two types of satellite data are used to estimate the rate of change in urban spatial expansion, both horizontally and volumetrically (horizontal and vertical components), and integrates them with socioeconomic data to examine the correlates and potential causes of both kinds of change. We employ new data products - the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) derived largely from Landsat and a Dense Sampling Method (DSM) product based on QuikSCAT - in combination with data from the 1999 and 2009 censuses of Vietnam. Unlike past studies, we examine horizontal and volumetric changes in urban form and pay particular attention to the role of migration in locations experiencing those different types of change. We find these two types of urban change occur at different rates and in different localities, with the highest rates of horizontal change occurring to the north of administrative Saigon. In contrast, we find the highest rates of volumetric change in the areas north of the central districts but mostly within administrative Saigon. In-migration is strongly associated with horizontal change, whereas increases in population density appears to drive volumetric change, controlling for other factors. Positive volumetric change is associated with necessary amenities of modern urban living, often in high-rise buildings found in dense population centers like Saigon: the increasing presence in households of computers, air conditioners, piped water, and gas fuel. Use of these new integrated data hold promise to shed new light on both the built-environment and social dimensions of urbanization in low- and middle-income settings.

T2  - DERMATOLOGIC CLINICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most common cancers in the United States. Outcomes are generally favorable, but a subset of cSCC is bio-logically distinct and requires a different approach because of its higher risk of local recurrence, metastasis, and death. This article focuses on the recent literature regarding identification of this high-risk subset, efforts to validate and improve the prognostic ability of staging systems, and updates in management.

TI  - Negative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Melanoma: The Patient's Perspective
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The majority of patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma will have a negative SLN. The long-term sequelae of a negative result are important when discussing this staging investigation with patients. The objective of this study was to assess rates of lymphoedema and quality of life for these patients.Methods. A prospective, cross-sectional study was performed on patients under routine follow-up with a history of melanoma, who had undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy where no metastasis was found (N0) at a high-volume melanoma centre. Relevant limbs were measured to assess for lymphoedema and patients completed the FACT-M quality of life instrument and a study specific questionnaire.Results. A total of 102 patients were recruited. Wound complications were observed in 25% and lymphoedema in 2% of patients. Physical and functional well-being scores were lowest in patients seen within 3months of their SLNB. Functional well-being and quality of life improved over the 2years following the procedure.Conclusions. SLNB has low complication rates. The procedure is associated with a short-term impact on patient quality of life and well-being. The vast majority of patients are pleased with the outcomes of this procedure and the information that it provides.

TI  - Resources for the attention of patients with breast cancer in Mexico
T2  - GACETA MEXICANA DE ONCOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multicenter studies on breast cancer require inter-institutional collaboration, resources and specialized personnel. In Mexico, many institutions provide these services, but their information is not accessible; to mitigate it, the Mexican Society of Oncology formed the Mexican Cooperative Research Groups in Oncology. Objective: To describe the infrastructure, personnel and activities of hospitals with care of patients with breast cancer in Mexico. Methods: A survey was conducted to 30 breast cancer specialists about resources and services of their institutions. Results: 13 (43.3%) specialists answered the survey, 38.5% of Seguro Popular, 23.1% of Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, and 38.4% of other institutions, with a median of 300 (50-950) new cases per year. All the institutions have oncological surgery, breast radiology, palliative care, pathology, nutrition and multidisciplinary sessions. All have ultrasound with breast transducer, 92.3% digital mammography, and 53.8% tomosynthesis and/or magnetic resonance. They do sentinel lymph node detection with dye (92.3%) or radionuclide (61.5%). Tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab are available in 92.3%, and other target therapies in < 40%. Genetic signatures are done in 21.3% and 61.5% analysis of hereditary cancer. Conclusions: The institutional capacity to participate in multicenter studies is heterogeneous; the few resources in several institutions limit their inclusion to studies of breast cancer.

TI  - Scale matters: sea ice and breeding success of Adelie penguins
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Ocean ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to sea-ice changes occurring at different spatial and temporal scales. Variability in the sea-ice conditions strongly influence the survival and reproduction of animals that are synchronized with the seasonality of sea ice. Although the linkages between Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and sea-ice conditions are well established, the spatial and temporal scales at which sea ice affects individuals and populations are poorly known. Using 23years of penguin breeding success and remote-sensing data of sea ice, we investigate the spatial and temporal scales at which sea-ice changes best explain variations in the reproductive success of Adelie penguins at Pointe Geologie, East Antarctica. The best spatial scale encompassed all foraging areas exploited and all the sea-ice conditions encountered by penguins over a breeding season. There was a consistent influence of sea-ice concentration during the guard stage on the overall breeding success. We demonstrate the importance of considering sea ice at a fine temporal scale rather than using an average value over the breeding season to best explain reproductive success in Adelie penguins.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Influenza is a common respiratory infectious disease affecting population worldwide yearly. The aim of this work is to describe the 2017-2018 influenza season and how it affected elderly population in Catalonia despite moderate vaccine coverage among this age group.METHODS: Influenza surveillance based on a primary care sentinel surveillance, virological indicators systematic sampling of ILI attended and severe influenza confirmed cases (SHLCI) admitted to hospital.Analysis of data by Chi-squared, ANOVA, multiple regression and negative control test or case to case for vaccine effectiveness assessment in primary care and SHLCI respectively.RESULTS: Moderate-high intensity and early onset season with predominance of influenza B virus (IVB) (63%) followed by an increase of circulation of influenza A virus (IVA). A total of 419 IV from primary care samples. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in primary care setting was 14% (95%CI: 0-47%). 1306 severe cases (adjusted cumulative incidence 18.54/100,000 inhabitants (95%CI: 17.54-19.55)). The highest proportion of severe cases were in the >64 (65.1%) (aOR 15.70; 95%CI: 12.06-20.46; p<0.001) followed by 45-64yo (25.4%) (aOR 6.03; 95%CI: 4.57-7.97). VE in preventing intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 35% (95%CI: 10-54%). Final outcome death while hospitalized occurred in 175 SHLCI cases with a case fatality rate of 13.4%.CONCLUSIONS: 2017-2018 influenza season was an unusual epidemic season with an early onset, great predominance of influenza B (Yamagata strain) virus with a high hospitalization rate of severe cases among elderly stressing the need to upgrade vaccine uptake in this age group.

TI  - Using PS-InSAR with Sentinel-1 Images for Deformation Monitoring in Northeast Algeria
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Constantine city, Algeria, and its surroundings have always been affected by natural and human-induced slope instability and subsidence. Neogene clay-conglomeratic formations, which form the largest part of Constantine city, are extremely sensitive to the presence of water, which makes them susceptible to landslides. Fast and accurate identification and monitoring of the main areas facing existing or potential hazardous risks at a regional scale, as well as measuring the amount of displacement is essential for the conservation and sustainable development of Constantine. In the last three decades, the application of radar interferometry techniques for the measurement of millimeter-level terrain motions has become one of the most powerful tools for ground deformation monitoring due to its large coverage and low costs. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PS-InSAR) has a demonstrated potential for monitoring a range of hazard event scenarios and tracking their spatiotemporal evolution. We demonstrate the efficiency of Sentinel-1 data for deformation monitoring in Constantine located in the northeast of Algeria, and how an array of information such as geological maps and ground-measurements are integrated for deformation mapping. We conclude this article with a discussion of the potential of advanced differential radar interferometry approaches and their applicability for structural and ground deformation monitoring, including the advantages and challenges of these approaches in the north of Algeria.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Linear Regression Model in Deriving Bio-Optical Relationships: The Implications on Ocean Carbon Estimations
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear regression is widely used in applied sciences and, in particular, in satellite optical oceanography, to relate dependent to independent variables. It is often adopted to establish empirical algorithms based on a finite set of measurements, which are later applied to observations on a larger scale from platforms such as autonomous profiling floats equipped with optical instruments (e.g., Biogeochemical Argo floats; BGC-Argo floats) and satellite ocean colour sensors (e.g., SeaWiFS, VIIRS, OLCI). However, different methods can be applied to a given pair of variables to determine the coefficients of the linear equation fitting the data, which are therefore not unique. In this work, we quantify the impact of the choice of regression method (i.e., either type-I or type-II) to derive bio-optical relationships, both from theoretical perspectives and by using specific examples. We have applied usual regression methods to an in situ data set of particulate organic carbon (POC), total chlorophyll-a (TChla), optical particulate backscattering coefficient (b(bp)), and 19 years of monthly TChla and b(bp) ocean colour data. Results of the regression analysis have been used to calculate phytoplankton carbon biomass (C-phyto) and POC from: i) BGC-Argo float observations; ii) oceanographic cruises, and iii) satellite data. These applications enable highlighting the differences in C-phyto and POC estimates relative to the choice of the method. An analysis of the statistical properties of the dataset and a detailed description of the hypothesis of the work drive the selection of the linear regression method.

TI  - Fatal intracranial aneurysm rupture after thrombolytic treatment for ischemic stroke: a case report and literature review
T2  - ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Intravenous thrombolysis is a proven treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Its complications include intracranial hemorrhage; the risk may be increased in the presence of an unruptured aneurysm. We present a case report of a patient who suffered fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage after thrombolysis from a known aneurysm. A history of recent previously inexperienced headaches was revealed retrospectively, suggestive of sentinel bleedings. A similar patient was identified in the literature; we thus propose that this history should be excluded in patients harboring an aneurysm considered for thrombolytic treatment.

TI  - Aerosol vertical distribution, optical properties and dust transport in the Western Mediterranean basin (case study: Summer, 2012)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we have analyzed an intense dust event at the end of June 2012 crossing the western Mediterranean basin and reaching southern Europe. The geographical distribution of the dust event, its origins, microphysical and optical properties as well as its vertical distribution have been investigated using satellite data, AERONET sun photometer retrievals and lidar soundings. On average for the summer 2012, all satellite AOD derived from MODIS, MISR, SEVIRI and OMI are consistent, while OMI tends to overestimate the AOD. During late June and early July 2012, a major dust outbreak occurred over the North Atlantic and has moved toward East to cross the Mediterranean up to Northern Italy. Satellite and Sun photometer AOD time series have captured this event. Dust event is clearly identified in the AERONET observations using a classification of the coarse mode AOD and the total AOD. The size distributions of this event observed at the different AERONET stations from Northern Africa to Europe don't show a significant change due to sedimentation and the optical properties correspond to an aged dust event, as confirmed by the backtrajectories. The vertical distribution of the aerosol extinction coefficient reveals a complex structure with a large dust layer between 1.8 and 4.8 km AMSL having a rather constant extinction coefficient between 0.12 and 0.15 km(-1).

TI  - Using A-Train Observations to Evaluate Cloud Occurrence and Radiative Effects in the Community Atmosphere Model during the Southeast Asia Summer Monsoon
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of clouds and their radiative effects in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), are compared to A-Train satellite data in Southeast Asia during the summer monsoon. Cloud radiative kernels are created based on populations of observed and modeled clouds separately in order to compare the sensitivity of the TOA radiation to changes in cloud fraction. There is generally good agreement between the observation- and model-derived cloud radiative kernels for most cloud types, meaning that the clouds in the model are heating and cooling like clouds in nature. Cloud radiative effects are assessed by multiplying the cloud radiative kernel by the cloud fraction histogram. For ice clouds in particular, there is good agreement between the model and observations, with optically thin cirrus producing a moderate warming effect and cirrostratus producing a slight cooling effect, on average. Consistent with observations, the model also shows that the median value of the ice water path (IWP) distribution, rather than the mean, is a more representative measure of the ice clouds that are responsible for heating. In addition, in both observations and the model, it is cirrus clouds with an IWP of 20 g m(-2) that have the largest warming effect in this region, given their radiative heating and frequency of occurrence.

TI  - Tumefactive Demyelination versus Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma on <SUP>18</SUP>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Twist in the Tale
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Demyelinating lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) are classically known to be hypometabolic on T-18-Flunadeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (F-18-FDG PET). However, demyelinating lesions may show increased tracer uptake on F-18-FDG PET and can radiologically mimic neoplasm. Delayed tracer uptake on FDG PET is one of the diagnostic hallmarks of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). Here, we present two cases in which the brain lesions showed increased FDG uptake on delayed integrated PET Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which were pathologically proven as CNS demyelination. Such demyelinating lesions may also act as "sentinel lesions" and potential harbinger of PCNSL on follow-up.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate the long-term outcomes of young early stage cervical cancer patients wishing to preserve their childbearing potential.Methods. Data of young (aged <40 years) patients with early stage cervical cancer were prospectively collected. All patients with stage IA2,IB1 and IB2 cervical cancer were included; they have cervical conization and pelvic node dissection performed via minimally invasive surgery. Survival outcomes were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier model.Results. Overall, 32 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean (SD) age of the population included was 33 (+/- 4). According to the FIGO 2018 staging system, the stage of disease was IA2, IB1 and 182 in 9 (28%), 21 (66%) and 2 (6%) cases, respectively. All patients included had cervical conization and laparoscopic pelvic node assessment, including systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy (N = 30, 94%) and sentinel node mapping (N = 2, 6%). In six (19%) patients the planned conservative treatment was discontinued. Median follow-up was 75 (range, 12-184) months. No recurrent disease was diagnosed among patients undergoing conservative treatment; while 2 out of 6 patients having definitive surgical or radiotherapy treatments developed recurrent disease. Five-year disease free and overall survivals were 94% and 97%, respectively. Considering reproductive outcomes, 11 (69%) out of 16 patients who attempted to conceive got pregnantConclusions. Cervical conization and pelvic nodes assessment could be considered a valid treatment modality for early-stage cervical cancer patients who are wishing to preserve their childbearing potential.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is a widespread invasive mosquito vector species with a distribution including tropical and temperate climates; its range is still expanding. Aedes albopictus populations were recently detected in Morocco and Algeria, the countries neighboring Tunisia, but never in Tunisia. In 2018, we initiated an intensive field study using BG-Sentinel Traps, ovitraps, larval surveys, and citizens' reports to determine whether Ae. albopictus populations exist in Tunisia. In October 2018, we collected adults and larval stages of Ae. albopictus in Carthage, Amilcar, and La Marsa, less than 20 km, northeast of Tunis, the Tunisian capital. These Ae. albopictus larvae were primarily collected from Phoenician funeral urns at the archeological site of Carthage. This is, to our knowledge, the first detection of Ae. albopictus in Tunisia.

TI  - Soil Texture Estimation Using Radar and Optical Data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the combined use of remotely sensed optical and radar data for the estimation and mapping of soil texture. The study is based on Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data acquired between July and early December 2017, on a semi-arid area about 3000 km(2) in central Tunisia. In addition to satellite acquisitions, texture measurement samples were taken in several agricultural fields, characterized by a large range of clay contents (between 13% and 60%). For the period between July and August, various optical indicators of clay content Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands and soil indices) were tested over bare soils. Satellite moisture products, derived from combined S-1 and S-2 data, were also tested as an indicator of soil texture. Algorithms based on the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods are proposed for the classification and mapping of clay content and a three-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate both approaches. The classifications with the best performance are achieved using the soil moisture indicator derived from combined S-1 and S-2 data, with overall accuracy (OA) of 63% and 65% for the SVM and RF classifications, respectively.

TI  - Breast cancer treatment-related lymphedema (BCRL): An overview of the literature and updates in microsurgery reconstructions
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Dharmais hospital. The treatment can give rise to breast cancer treatment-related lymphedema (BCRL) that will cause significant morbidities. Based on author's (BB) patient series in Dharmais hospital, BCRL occurred in 27.7% after axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND). The development of diagnostic modalities as well as lymphatic microsurgery have become promising instruments for lymphedema treatment. To date, modern approach of lymphedema care and surgical intervention have not been recognized and established in Indonesia. A literature review in this field is needed to overcome our limitation in BRCL or lymphedema management.

TI  - Combination of ground and remote sensing data to assess carbon stock changes in the main urban park of Florence
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical and LiDAR datasets taken by airborne platforms are informative on important forest attributes, and particularly on growing stock volume (GSV), which is related to woody biomass and carbon storage. This paper presents the integration of such datasets with information collected on the ground for assessing the GSV variation that occurred in the Cascine urban park (Florence, Italy) mostly as a consequence of an extreme wind storm in March 2015. Two LiDAR acquisitions taken before and after the disastrous event (2007 and 2017) were combined with conventional forest observations derived from a complete inventory of the park area and from restricted ground surveys conducted around the first and second study dates. The dataset of the first period was used to evaluate the applicability of an area-based estimation approach to the second dataset and consequently assess the magnitude of the GSV change. In particular, the change was statistically characterized based only on the recently collected ground samples and on the combination of these with LiDAR data through a ratio estimator. The combination of the LiDAR and ground data increased the precision of the estimates obtained, highlighting a significant GSV decrease during the study decade (about 20%), that was concentrated in two of four park sectors. This GSV decrease, which can be mostly attributed to the effect of the 2015 wind storm, corresponds to a total loss of carbon stored in the park of around 2700 tons.

TI  - Methods for the Evaluation of the Stochastic Properties of the Ionosphere for Earthquake Prediction-Random Matrix Theory
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seismo-ionospheric coupling is a field of great interest and is currently subject to rigorous study; using both ground and satellite data and many phenomenological features, the ionospheric precursors of earthquakes were identified. In this work, we present methods to study the stochastic properties of the lower ionosphere, derived from the data obtained with very low frequency (VLF) receivers at frequencies in the range of 19.6 to 37.5 kHz. Two main approaches are described: auto-correlation and random matrix theory treatments of amplitude time series data. It is shown that before shallow earthquakes with magnitudes greater than four, there are measurable changes that can be used in earthquake prediction. Although the exact form of the causal chain that leads to these changes are currently subject to diligent study, we believe that the investigations described herein are worth adding to the repertoire of ionospheric precursors.

AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States, and its incidence is rising. Although there have been significant recent advances in our understanding of endometrial cancer biology, many aspects of treatment remain mired in controversy, including the role of surgical lymph node assessment and the selection of patients for adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. For the subset of women with microsatellite-instable, metastatic disease, anti- programmed cell death protein 1 immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and numerous trials are attempting to build on this early success.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - Continuity to the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) will be provided by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on-board the Sentinel-3 missions. To ensure its utility in a wide range of scientific and operational applications, validation efforts are required. In the past, direct validation has been constrained by the need for costly airborne hyperspectral data acquisitions, due to the lack of freely available high spatial resolution imagery incorporating appropriate spectral bands. The Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2 missions now offers a promising alternative. We explored the synergetic use of MSI data for validation of the OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) over the Valencia Anchor Station, a large agricultural site in the Valencian Community, Spain. Using empirical and machine learning techniques applied to MSI data, in situ measurements were upscaled to the moderate spatial resolution of the OTCI. An RMSECV of 0.09 g.m(-2) (NRMSECV = 20.93%) was achieved, highlighting the valuable information MSI data can provide when used in synergy with OLCI data for land product validation. Good agreement between the OTCI and upscaled in situ measurements was observed (r = 0.77, p < 0.01), providing increased confidence to users of the product over vineyard dominated Mediterranean environments.

TI  - Vicarious Calibration of Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious calibration methods use well-characterized surface sites to complement other on-orbit radiometric calibration techniques. Since 2009, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and Japan's Greenhouse gasses Observing SATellite teams have conducted annual campaigns at Railroad Valley, NV, USA, for this purpose. These sensors pose special challenges due to their large footprint sizes and view angles. OCO-2 sweeps the playa surface during a targeted overpass of the test site, and records data at a number of viewing angles. The smallest of these is selected for processing, thereby minimizing the off-nadir correction. Surface reflectances at nadir are recorded by the field team, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product is used to provide the small, off-nadir correction. Another MODIS product, the Level 1B top-of-atmosphere radiance product, is used to validate the results and to provide input into the OCO-2 calibration uncertainty estimate. From 11 experiments, the ratio of radiances reported by the OCO-2 Level 1B data product to those from the field campaigns is 1.01, 1.04, and 1.01 for the three OCO-2 spectral bands. These analyses validate the data product absolute calibration, to within the 5% requirement. The need for executing these experiments will be of continued importance to OCO-3. This sensor has an on-hoard calibrator that provides a dark signal and lamps for response trends but does not have the on-board solar-diffuser present on OCO-2, and thus cannot track degradations relative to the Sun.

AB  - Background: It is customarily perceived that in Africa, decisions around research participation may be based not only on individual reflection but also on discussions with others. Some authors have argued that such decision making is reflective of a more traditional communitarian African worldview; one critique of such a perspective is that it is lacking an empirical grounding. In this study, we explore decision making around enrollment in sickle cell genomics research in three countries in Africa, namely, Ghana, Cameroon, and Tanzania. Particularly, we focus on exploring the role of shared decision making with regard to participating in genomic studies. Results: We involved 64 participants in 15 individual interviews or in 49 focus-group discussions with research participants in rural and urban Tanzania (n=20), Ghana (n=30), and Cameroon (n=14). We used a vignette to explore decision making around enrollment of children in sickle cell genomics research. Data were imported in NVivo11 and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Our findings indicate that the majority of the participants from both rural and urban settings prefer to make their own individual decisions and not consult with extended family or community leaders. Shared decision making was only considered necessary for individuals who were perceived to be in some way vulnerable. Conclusion: We found very limited support for shared decision making as the primary process for decision making about research participation. While consultation was considered important to support individual decision making, particularly when parents were perceived as vulnerable, there was no suggestion in our data that shared decision making would be a more important or valuable means of seeking consent for research participation in the African research context.

TI  - Methylation analysis highlights novel prognostic criteria in human-metastasized melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma accounts for 90% of the deaths associated with cutaneous neoplasms, and the 5-year survival rate of patients with the advanced stage is about 20%. Many mechanisms are involved in melanoma progression, but dynamic epigenetic changes are likely to be critical contributors, especially for DNA methylation. However, we know little about the methylation events involved in melanoma lymph node metastasis (LNM), a deficit that is of particular concern because it has a growing incidence and mortality. To identify DNA methylated-associated changes involved in the formation of metastatic melanoma, we explored the different methylated genes (DMGs) between primary and LNM melanoma by Illumina Human Methylation 450K BeadArray GSE44661. By integrating DNA methylation and messenger RNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we identified these DNA methylation biomarkers. Pathway analysis highlighted these DMGs, which were closely related to the carcinogenesis of melanoma, such as cell cycle regulation and RNA transcription process. Furthermore, according to the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, we constructed a four-DMG prognostic signature model, which could precisely predict the outcome of melanoma in a more exact way. In summary, this four-DMG based risk score model successfully predicts the survival of melanoma. It is independent of other clinical characteristics and is good for prognosis prediction.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Machine-Learning Techniques for Land Use and Land Cover Classification of the Brazilian Tropical Savanna Using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Polarimetric Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a workflow for land use and land cover (LULC) classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) images of the Brazilian tropical savanna (Cerrado) biome. The following LULC classes were considered: forestlands; shrublands; grasslands; reforestations; croplands; pasturelands; bare soils/straws; urban areas; and water reservoirs. The proposed approach combines polarimetric attributes, image segmentation, and machine-learning procedures. A set of 125 attributes was generated using polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images, including the van Zyl, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, and Cloude-Pottier target decomposition components, incoherent polarimetric parameters (biomass indices and polarization ratios), and HH-, HV-, VH-, and VV-polarized amplitude images. These attributes were classified using the Naive Bayes (NB), DT J48 (DT = decision tree), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The RF, MLP, and SVM classifiers presented the most accurate performances. NB and DT J48 classifiers showed a lower performance in relation to the RF, MLP, and SVM. The DT J48 classifier was the most suitable algorithm for discriminating urban areas and natural vegetation cover. The proposed workflow can be replicated for other SAR images with different acquisition modes or for other types of vegetation domains.

TI  - Evaluation of remotely sensed rainfall products over Central Africa
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - An intercomparison of seven gridded rainfall products incorporating satellite data (ARC, CHIRPS, CMORPH, PERSIANN, TAPEER, TARCAT, TMPA) is carried out over Central Africa, by evaluating them against three observed datasets: (a) the WaTFor database, consisting of 293 (monthly records) and 154 (daily records) rain-gauge stations collected from global datasets, national meteorological services and monitoring projects, (b) the WorldClim v2 gridded database, and (c) a set of stations expanded from the FAOCLIM network, these two latter sets describing climate normals. All products fairly well reproduce the mean rainfall regimes and the spatial patterns of mean annual rainfall, although with some discrepancies in the east-west gradient. A systematic positive bias is found in the CMORPH product. Despite its lower spatial resolution, TAPEER shows reasonable skills. When considering daily rainfall amounts, TMPA shows best skills, followed by CMORPH, but over the central part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, TARCAT is amongst the best products. Skills ranking is however different at the interannual time-scale, with CHIRPS and TMPA performing best, though PERSIANN has comparable skills when only fully independent stations are used as reference. A preliminary study of Southern Hemisphere dry season variability, from the example of Kinshasa, shows that it is a difficult variable to capture with satellite-based rainfall products. Users should still be careful when using any product in the most data-sparse regions, especially for trend assessment.

TI  - Effects of broad bandwidth on the remote sensing of inland waters: Implications for high spatial resolution satellite data applications
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution satellite sensors provide opportunities to observe spatial variations of biogeochemical properties of small- and medium-sized inland water bodies. However, high spatial resolution sensors are usually equipped with wider spectral bandwidth (> 50 nm) that diminishes the features of the spectrum. Therefore, the effects of the border bandwidth issue need to be evaluated prior to application in aquatic environments. Based on the in situ optical data [remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and absorption coefficients] and the radiative simulations of hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance and using band specifics of common sensors (e.g., OLCI, VIIRS, MSI, OLI, ETM+ and WFV) as examples, the effects of bandwidth on optical properties of inland waters were analyzed. The results showed the followings. (1) The difference between values at center-wavelength and band-averaged values increased with increasing bandwidth for R-rs and the absorption coefficients. The difference was wavelength-dependent. The difference of R-rs at the visible band was within 0.25% but greater than 0.5% for the spectral bands near 710 nm and 665 nm. (2) The accuracy of the total absorption coefficient derived from QAA-750E, spectral match technique (SMT) and deep neural network (DNN) decreased with increasing bandwidth. The QAA-750E was more sensitive to bandwidth than SMT and DNN. Otherwise, the empirical algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations were significantly affected by bandwidth. The performance of algorithms for estimating cyanobacterial phycocyanin (PC) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations changed slightly with a wider bandwidth. Finally, the maximum bandwidth requirement for optical remote sensing in inland waters was proposed. For bandwidth options, it should be within 20 nm for 700-710 nm, similar to 30 nm maximum for similar to 560 nm and similar to 665 nm, 60 nm for similar to 620 nm, and similar to 80 nm for similar to 443 nm and similar to 490 nm, respectively. The difference between the R-rs of narrow bands (10-20 nm) and the R-rs of the bands with the recommended bandwidth was within 0.25%. The corresponding bandwidth from MSI and OLI sensors meet this criterion for Chla and SPM. However, the lack of spectral coverage near 700-710 nm may present a challenge to retrieve Chla concentration from OLI images. This study provided helpful theoretical and practical references for the retrieval of inland water parameters by high spatial resolution satellite sensors and its prospective development.

TI  - Validation of Satellite, Reanalysis and RCM Data of Monthly Rainfall in Calabria (Southern Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Skills in reproducing monthly rainfall over Calabria (southern Italy) have been validated for the Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) satellite data, the E-OBS dataset and 13 Global Climate Model-Regional Climate Model (GCM-RCM) combinations, belonging to the ENSEMBLES project output set. To this aim, 73 rainfall series for the period 1951-1980 and 79 series for the period 1981-2010 have been selected from the database managed by Multi-Risk Functional Centre of the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection (Regione Calabria). The relative mean and standard deviation errors, and the Pearson correlation coefficient have been used as validation metrics. Results showed that CHIRPS satellite data (available only for the 1981-2010 validation period) and RCMs based on the ECHAM5 Global Climate performed better both in mean error and standard deviation error compared to other datasets. Moreover, a slight appreciable improvement in performance for all ECHAM5-based models and for the E-OBS dataset has been observed in the 1981-2010 time-period. The whole validation-and-assessment procedure applied in this work is general and easily applicable where ground data and gridded data are available. This procedure might help scientists and policy makers to select among available datasets those best suited for further applications, even in regions with complex orography and an inadequate amount of representative stations.

TI  - Assessment of Water Harvesting impacts on water conservation by integrating Landsat 7 and CHIRPS datasets in Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - RENDICONTI ONLINE SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Computational capabilities of online cloud-based platforms offered a dramatic increase of the possibilities in the field of geosciences. The novel Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is among the most powerful and innovative tools, making available both a cloud computational system and wide collections of available satellite remote sensing datasets. This paper presents the GEE analysis of the impacts of Landscape Restoration and Water Harvesting (LRWH) on water conservation potential of a pilot catchment in Tigray Region, Ethiopia. A synthetic Water Conservation Index (WCI) was defined as a function of monthly average Normalized Different Infrared Index (NDII), obtained by Landsat 7 Tier 1 8-Day Composites, and the rainfall amount of June, July and August, calculated from pentadal Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) dataset. Results showed a substantial increase of the WCI after the rainy season for September, with a statistical significance of p<0.01, and for October and November WCI, with a lower statistical significance. Results showed the increase in water conservation obtained through LRWH for Enabered watershed and made clear the new possibilities offered by available ICT structures and cloud-based systems for geosciences, in particular for supporting environmental analysis and land planning in remote and data-scarce areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work evaluates the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Water Stress Index (CWSI) in tuna crops, located in the Guano Canton of Chimborazo Province, Ecuador. The area of interest (AOI) included the parishes of San Andres and Guano, in which the texture of the soil was determined with the existing data in Ecuador's National Information System (SNI); a satellite image of Sentinel 2A from June 16 2018 was used. Raster functions were applied to obtain an approximate and referential mean of NDV the reflectance received from both the soil and the tuna crop (SAVI), and the perspiration corresponding to the water stress (CSWI) of the tuna plots. Finally, we obtained approximate and referential NDV1 data with a value of 0.31, SAVI values reflecting soil and crop data, and a very low CWSI, showing that perspiration is minimal, so it can be concluded that drip irrigation is a suitable technique for increasing tuna production.

M3  - Article
AB  - Lebanon is part of the hot spot of Mediterranean biodiversity and is well known for its large number of living species, particularly terrestrial ones. Uncontrolled urbanisation is the main cause of fragmentation of the habitats of these species. This research proposes GIS and landscape analysis as tools for understanding the process of fragmentation in the Metropolitan Area of Beyrouth over the last thirty years. Satellite images taken in 1985 and 2016 were processed by GIS and fragmentation indices were calculated using Fragstat4.2. Five sites were studied at a fine scale so as to identify the causes of this parcelling, which is on the increase. The results show increasing fragmentation of green spaces, considerable segregation between these patches and the breakdown of their connections. The aim of this study is to offer efficient mitigation methods for the protection of the remaining species.

TI  - Immune Cell Trafficking to the Liver
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The human liver is an organ with a diverse array of immunologic functions. Its unique anatomic position that leads to it receiving all the mesenteric venous blood, combined with its unique micro anatomy, allows it to serve as a sentinel for the body's immune system. Hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells express key molecules that recruit and activate innate and adaptive immunity. Additionally, a diverse array of lymphoid and myeloid immune cells resides within and traffics to the liver in specific circumstances. Derangement of these trafficking mechanisms underlies the pathophysiology of autoimmune liver diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver transplantation. Here, we review these pathways and interactions along with potential targets that have been identified to be exploited for therapeutic purposes.

TI  - Assimilating multi-source data into a three-dimensional hydro-ecological dynamics model using Ensemble Kalman Filter
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately predicting spatio-temporal patterns of algal bloom is important and also challenging. This study developed a three-dimensional hydro-ecological dynamics model (3DHED) to predict cyanobacterial biomass in lakes and applied Ensemble Kalman Filter to assimilate multi-source data into 3DHED for model improvement. The model was applied in Lake Taihu, using in-situ measurements and remote sensing (RS) retrievals. Two data assimilation experiments (named EnKF1 and EnKF2) were conducted. EnKF1 assimilated only in-situ measurements, while EnKF2 assimilated both in-situ measurements and RS data. The results revealed that 3DHED simulated the spatio-temporal patterns of cyanobacterial biomass in Taihu with an acceptable Index of Agreement (IOA). EnKF1 significantly improved the model fitness and increased the IOA of 85% measurement sites to 0.85, especially better captured the peak values. Compared with EnKF1, EnKF2 gave more improvements in spatial patterns besides model fitness, implying that assimilating multi-source data was helpful to improving the model performance.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling Methods of Soil Moisture Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data and Its Application
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important indicator that is widely used in meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. Two key problems must be addressed in the process of downscaling soil moisture: the selection of the downscaling method and the determination of the environmental variables, namely, the influencing factors of soil moisture. This study attempted to utilize machine learning and data mining algorithms to downscale the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km and compared the advantages and disadvantages of the random forest model and the Cubist algorithm to determine the more suitable soil moisture downscaling method for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB). At present, either the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or a digital elevation model (DEM) is selected as the environmental variable for the downscaling models. In contrast, variables, such as albedo and evapotranspiration, are infrequently applied; nevertheless, this study selected these two environmental variables, which have a considerable impact on soil moisture. Thus, the selected environmental variables in the downscaling process included the longitude, latitude, elevation, slope, NDVI, daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST_D and LST_N, respectively), albedo, evapotranspiration (ET), land cover (LC) type, and aspect. This study achieved downscaling on a 16-day timescale based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A comparison of the random forest model with the Cubist algorithm revealed that the R-2 of the random forest-based downscaling method is higher than that of the Cubist algorithm-based method by 0.0161; moreover, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is reduced by 0.0006 and the mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced by 0.0014. Testing the accuracies of these two downscaling methods showed that the random forest model is more suitable than the Cubist algorithm for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km in the MLRYRB, which provides a theoretical basis for obtaining high spatial resolution soil moisture data.

TI  - A machine learning approach to estimate surface ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> from satellite measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface seawater partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) is a critical parameter in the quantification of air-sea CO2 flux, which further plays an important role in quantifying the global carbon budget and understanding ocean acidification. Yet, the remote estimation of pCO(2) in coastal waters (under influences of multiple processes) has been difficult due to complex relationships between environmental variables and surface pCO(2). To date there is no unified model to remotely estimate surface pCO(2) in oceanic regions that are dominated by different oceanic processes. In our study area, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), this challenge is addressed through the evaluation of different approaches, including multi-linear regression (MLR), multi-nonlinear regression (MNR), principle component regression (PCR), decision tree, supporting vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN), and random forest based regression ensemble (RFRE). After modeling, validation, and extensive tests using independent cruise datasets, the RFRE model proved to be the best approach. The RFRE model was trained using data comprised of extensive pCO(2) datasets (collected over 16 years by many groups) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) estimated sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), surface chlorophyll concentration (Chl), and diffuse attenuation of downwelling irradiance (Kd). This RFRE-basedpCO(2) model allows for the estimation of surface pCO(2) from satellites with a spatial resolution of 1 km. It showed an overall performance of a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 9.1 mu atm, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.95, a mean bias (MB) of - 0.03 mu atm, a mean ratio (MR) of 1.00, an unbiased percentage difference (UPD) of 0.07%, and a mean ratio difference (MRD) of 0.12% for pCO(2) ranging between 145 and 550 mu atm. The model, with its original parameterization, has been tested with independent datasets collected over the entire GOM, with satisfactory performance in each case (RMSD of <= similar to 10 mu atm for open GOM waters and RMSD of <= similar to 25 mu atm for coastal and river-dominated waters). The sensitivity of the RFRE-based pCO(2) model to uncertainties of each input environmental variable was also thoroughly examined. The results showed that all induced uncertainties were close to, or within, the uncertainty of the model itself with higher sensitivity to uncertainties in SST and SSS than to uncertainties in Chl and Kd. The extensive validation, evaluation, and sensitivity analysis indicate the robustness of the RFRE model in estimating surface pCO(2) for the range of 145-550 mu atm in most GOM waters. The RFRE model approach was applied to the Gulf of Maine (a contrasting oceanic region to GOM), with local model training. The results showed significant improvement over other models suggesting that the RFRE may serve as a robust approach for other regions once sufficient field measured pCO(2) data are available for model training.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified the land surface thermal environment during urbanization of the main urban area of Fuzhou by extracting the land use/land cover (LULC) based on Landsat series remote sensing data and retrieving the land surface temperature (LST). The results showed that there were dramatic changes in LULC of Fuzhou from 1993 to 2013, with the reduction of urban green space (UGS) including forest/grass, water and wetland and the significant increase of built-up land. The LST of different LULC had significant differences. The build-up land and bare land had positive contribution to the LST, while the UGS had negative effect on LST, with the order of water > wetland > forest/grass. During the evolution process of different types of UGS, there was a diversified temperature pattern. The LST caused by UGS loss was the most obvious, followed by the UGS exchange and the UGS extension regions. The relationship between evolution direction of different UGS types and temperature effect was quantified by TVX. Our results might help understand the mitigation effect of different UGS types on urban heat island effect and provide useful reference to the conservation of green space in coastal cities.

TI  - Generation and Evaluation of LAI and FPAR Products from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation are two of the essential biophysical variables used in most global models of climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. Most LAI/FPAR products are retrieved from non-geostationary satellite observations. Long revisit times and cloud/cloud shadow contamination lead to temporal and spatial gaps in such LAI/FPAR products. For more effective use in monitoring of vegetation phenology, climate change impacts, disaster trend etc., in a timely manner, it is critical to generate LAI/FPAR with less cloud/cloud shadow contamination and at higher temporal resolution-something that is feasible with geostationary satellite data. In this paper, we estimate the geostationary Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) LAI/FPAR fields by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with Himawari-8 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI/FPAR products for each biome type. Daily cycles of the estimated AHI LAI/FPAR products indicate that these are stable at 10-min frequency during the day. Comprehensive evaluations were carried out for the different biome types at different spatial and temporal scales by utilizing the MODIS LAI/FPAR products and the available field measurements. These suggest that the generated Himawari-8 AHI LAI/FPAR fields were spatially and temporally consistent with the benchmark MODIS LAI/FPAR products. We also evaluated the AHI LAI/FPAR products for their potential to accurately monitor the vegetation phenology-the results show that AHI LAI/FPAR products closely match the phenological development captured by the MODIS products.

TI  - Monitoring permafrost deformation in the upstream Heihe River, Qilian Mountain by using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 InSAR dataset
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in active layer thickness (ALT) over permafrost regions lead to a large-scale ground deformation, affecting infrastructure stability and hydrogeological conditions. Therefore, accurate measurements of such deformation are urgently needed for characterizing the seasonal freeze-thaw process. In this paper, we present a time-series InSAR method for monitoring permafrost deformation, named "DSs-SBAS", which combines both cut-edge algorithms for identification of radar distributed scatters (DSs) and eigenvalue-decomposition-based optimization of DS interferometric phases to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of deformation measurements. Taking into account difficulty in selecting reference points for the InSAR analysis in the permafrost region, we introduce a new strategy based on the relationship between ground temperature and deformation to improve the reliability of the selected reference point. This DSs-SBAS InSAR method is applied to investigate ground deformation over permafrost regions at the upstream west branch of the Heihe River, Qilian Mountain. A total of 27 Sentinel-1 SAR images are employed to derive deformation time series and annual deformation rates between 2014 and 2016. In addition, the Stefan model constrained by the ground temperatures is adopted to calculate the seasonal deformation amplitude. The results indicate that (1) most of the permafrost in the study area was stable (-1. 0 similar to+1. 0 cm.a(-1)), and large deformations occurred in the southern slope and the bottom part of the upper reaches of the Yeniugou River, (2) there are two main temporal processes of deformation with annual cycles, namely seasonal cycle deformation and seasonal subsidence. The largest deformation rate and maximum deformation amplitude were up to 6. 0 cm and -3. 0 cm.a(-1), respectively, (3) a significant heterogeneous pattern in freeze-thaw cycles and permafrost deformation is found, which is mainly controlled by permafrost landscapes, soil types and ALT. This proposed DSs-SBAS InSAR method has a great potential for monitoring large-scale deformation and retrieving ALT variations over permafrost regions in the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Forest Type Classification Based on Integrated Spectral-Spatial-Temporal Features and Random Forest Algorithm-A Case Study in the Qinling Mountains
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral, spatial, and temporal features play important roles in land cover classification. However, limitations still exist in the integrated application of spectral-spatial-temporal (SST) features for forest type discrimination. This paper proposes a forest type classification framework based on SST features and the random forest (RF) algorithm. The SST features were derived from time-series images using original bands, vegetation index, gray-level correlation matrix, and harmonic analysis. Random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) was used to optimize high-dimensional and correlated feature space, and determine the optimal SST feature set. Then, the classification was carried out using an RF classifier and the optimized SST feature set. This method was applied in the Qinling Mountains using Sentinel-2 time-series images. A total of 21 SST features were obtained through the RF-RFE method, and their importance was evaluated using the Gini index. The results indicated that spectral features contribute the most to separating shrubs, spatial features are more suitable for discrimination among evergreen forest types, and temporal features are more useful for evergreen forest, deciduous forest, and shrub types. The forest type map was generated based on the optimal SST feature set and RF algorithm, and evaluated based on an agreement with the validation dataset. The results showed that this integrated method is reliable, with an overall accuracy of 86.88% and kappa coe ffi cient of 0.86, and can support forest type sustainable management and mapping at the local scale.

TI  - Charting Dynamic Areas in the Mackenzie River with RADARSAT-2, Simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission and Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mariners navigating within Canadian waters rely on Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) navigational charts to safely reach their destinations. To fulfil this need, CHS charts must accurately reflect the current state of Canadian coastal regions. While many coastal regions are stable, others are dynamic and require frequent updates. In order to ensure that important and potentially dangerous changes are reflected in CHS products, the organization, in partnership with the Canadian Space Agency, is exploring coastal change detection through satellite remote sensing (SRS). In this work, CHS examined a hybrid shoreline extraction approach which uses both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data. The approach was applied for a section of the Mackenzie River, one of Canada's most dynamic river systems. The approach used RADARSAT-2 imagery as its primary information source, due to its high positioning accuracy (5 m horizontal accuracy) and ability to allow for low and high water line charting. Landsat represented the primary optical data source due to its long historical record of Earth observation data. Additional sensors, such as Sentinel-2 and WorldView, were also used where a higher resolution was required. The shoreline extraction process is based on an image segmentation approach that uses both the radar and optical data. Critical information was collected using the automated approach to support chart updates, resulting in reductions to the financial, human and time factors present within the ship-based hydrographic survey techniques traditionally used for chart improvements. The results demonstrate the potential benefit of wide area SRS change detection within dynamic waterways for navigational chart improvements. The work also demonstrates that the approach developed for RADARSAT-2 could be implemented with data from the forthcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), which is critical to ensure project continuity.

TI  - Deciphering plant richness using satellite remote sensing: a study from three biodiversity hotspots
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral variation hypothesis (SVH)' assumes spectral variability as a result of variation in species richness. In the present study, we explore the potential of satellite datasets in identifying the patterns in species richness in part of three global biodiversity hotspots falling in India viz., Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats. We used generalized linear models to correlate remote sensing based vegetation indices (VIs) and physiographic indices (PIs) with plant richness calculated using 1264, 1114, and 1004 field plots across 21 different forest vegetation classes in Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats respectively. Three different vegetation indices ranked highest in explaining the variance in plant richness in the three hotspots. The variance in species richness explained by models based on only VIs was highest (69%, P<0.01) for Bamboo vegetation in Indo Burma hotspot with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, followed by that for dry deciduous forest in Western Ghats (57%, P<0.001) with Normalized Difference Water Index, and for grasslands (54%, P<0.05) in Himalaya by Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index. The explained variance increased with combined models that are based on PIs and VIs to up to 85% (P<0.05). Overall, we observed very high correlation between VIs and plant richness in open canopy vegetation classes with low species richness such as grasslands, scrubs, and dry deciduous forests, followed by vegetation classes with moderately dense canopy. Our study provides crucial insights on utility of satellite datasets as a proxy for estimating plant richness for better conservation of diverse ecosystems.

TI  - Relationship between Land Surface Temperature and Land Use in Nakhon Ratchasima City, Thailand
T2  - ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and land use in Nakhon Ratchasima was studied using data gathered from three satellite images from Landsat-5 (30th January 1992), Landsat-8 (9 May 2016) and THEOS (17th February 2016). There were four categories of land use: built-up area, green area, bare land and water sources. The split-window concept was used to estimate the LST. In 1992, Nakhon Ratchasima city in Thailand comprised 47.76% built-up area, 37.45% green area, 13.19% bare land and 1.60% water sources. By 2016, the built-up area had increased by 23.04%, the green area had decreased by 16.66%, bare land had decreased by 6.81%, but water sources had increased by 0.43%. Moreover, in 1992 the mean LST was 25.43 degrees C for built-up areas, 24.44 degrees C for green areas, 24.97 degrees C for bare land and 24.75 degrees C for water sources. However, by 2016 the LSTs had increased for each category: 28.74 degrees C for built-up areas (+3.31 degrees C), 27.20 degrees C for green areas (+2.76 degrees C), 28.11 degrees C for bare land (+3.14 degrees C) and 27.72 degrees C for water sources (+2.97 degrees C). The findings indicated that the LSTs increased with the pace of urbanization and changes in land use. Linear regression analysis revealed that built-up land had a positive correlation with LST, where a 1% increase in built-up area increased its LST by 0.146594 degrees C.

TI  - Agriculture Phenology Monitoring Using NDVI Time Series Based on Remote Sensing Satellites: A Case Study of Guangdong, China
T2  - OPTICAL MEMORY AND NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the use of the Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series based change detection method for agriculture phenology monitoring. NDVI make use of the multi-spectral remote sensing data band combinations techniques to find out landscape such as agriculture, vegetation, land use/cover, water bodies and forest. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology is becoming an essential tool to combing multiple maps and information from different sources as satellite, field and socio-economic data. Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data were used to generate NDVI time series from Sep. 2017 to Nov. 2018. This research work was the procedure by pre-processing, signal filtering and interpolation of monthly NDVI time series that represent a complete crop phonological cycle. NDVI method is applied according to its specialty range from -1 to +1. We divided whole agriculture area into five part according to NDVI Values such as no agriculture, low agriculture, medium agriculture, high agriculture and very high agriculture area. The simulation results show that the NDVI is highly useful in detecting the surface feature of the area, which is extremely beneficial for sustainable development of agriculture and decision making. The methodology of reform NDVI time series had been providing feasible to improve crop phenology mapping.

TI  - A comparison of diet estimates of captive beluga whales using fatty acid mixing models with their true diets
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) are sentinel species for Arctic environmental change; however, whether belugas are resilient to anticipated changes in prey dynamics remains uncertain, partly due to a lack of dietary information. Mixing models are promising tools to evaluate the diets of marine mammals, using dietary tracers such as fatty acid signatures. Additionally, captive feeding trials are useful to test the effectiveness of these tools for application to wild populations. In our study, we compared the ability of two models, quantitative fatty acid signature analysis in R (QFASAR) and Fatty Acid Source Tracking Algorithm in R (FASTAR) to reconstruct the diets of captive beluga whales that had been fed a long-term diet consisting mostly of Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi), and in smaller proportions, capelin (Mallotus villosus) and squid (Doryteuthis opalescens). To account for fatty acid metabolism, we compared a suite of calibration coefficients derived from captive feeding trials of American mink (Mustela vison), harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina richards, and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) fed monotypic diets. For both methods, diets estimated using calibration coefficients derived from feeding trials of mink fed herring and/or seal oil were able to correctly identify herring as the dominant prey source of belugas. In addition, there was higher precision among diet estimates using these calibration coefficients in comparison to those generated using calibration coefficients derived from feeding trials of pinnipeds or mink fed poultry. QFASAR more accurately approximated the diet proportions of the whales than FASTAR, possibly because of the greater robustness to errors in the calibration coefficients. Based on QFASAR, diet estimates best reflect the whales' true dietary proportions consumed approximately two weeks to one month prior to sampling, similar to timeframes seen in previous studies of harbour seals. We recommend caution when using these models with prey that have high within-species variability in fatty acid signatures or small sample sizes, as well as prey with similar fatty acid signatures. The application of mixing models is promising to identify the prey of wild beluga whales and other marine mammals.

AB  - Land cover changes may have very different nature, e.g., vegetation development, soil erosion, variation of humidity, or damage of buildings, only to enumerate few cases. In addition, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are a doppelganger of the scene, imaging the scene signature rather than the scene itself. To overcome these challenges, SAR change detection methods generally adapt to the particular situations. We present seamless methods based on normalized compression distance (NCD) estimation. NCD is a similarity metric applied directly to the data, thus with no biases induced by feature estimators or classifiers. Since the diversity of changes is huge and extremely hard to derive typical classes, we introduce paradigm based both on an unsupervised and a supervised method. The change detection procedure mainly consists in dividing image dataset in patches, computing a collection of similarities for pairs of tiles formed differently in each case, and usage of this collection in unsupervised and supervised forms to generate a change map. Both the threshold based histogram, unsupervised method, and the k-NN classifier algorithm, supervised method, have a distinct flow to obtain the change map. To use the NCD operator according to our proposed methods, a speckle resistance test is involved. The experimental results for the two methodologies are computed using two TerraSAR-X images over Sendai and surrounding areas, Japan.

TI  - Space-temporal dynamics of the landscape and population structure of <i>Euterpe precatoria</i> Mart. in forest fragment in the municipality of Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso state, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Euterpe precatoria Mart., is used in the cosmetic and food industry and has been increasingly exploited in the Amazonian environment. The objective of this work is to analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of the landscape and the effect of fragmentation on the structure and pattern of spatial distribution of Euterpe precatoria, using a forest fragment in the municipality of Alta Floresta, MT state. Orbital images of Landsat-2/MSS satellite from 1975, Landsat-3/MSS from 1979, Landsat-5/TM from 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 and from Landsat-8/OLI from 2017 were used. From the data generated by means of remote sensing, the Anthropic Transformation Index -ITA and Linear Regression were calculated. Two plots of 200 m x 25 m were drawn in the edge-inland direction. The horizontal and vertical structure of the species was characterized by means of the analyzes: number of individuals, density, basal area, diameter distribution and spatial distribution. The spatial distribution pattern was estimated by the Morisita index, with a significance level of 5%. The first anthropic activities around the study fragment began in 1984 with the opening of the MT-325 highway. The intensification of land use contributed to the reduction of vegetation, which most critical period occurred between 1990 and 2000. We sampled 102 individuals in plot A and 218 in plot B. The density was higher in plot B. The two plots had a larger number of individuals distributed in the first diametric class. The analyzed population presented two spatial distribution patterns, random pattern in plot A and aggregate pattern in the B. Euterpe precatoria plot is balanced on the process of succession and the recruitment of individuals, since the values of the 'q' ratio show that there are a large number of individuals in the first height classes and DAP.

AB  - The retention of items within a patient after surgery is considered to be a serious issue within the health care community. Termed a "sentinel event", a retained surgical item (RSI) is one of eight reportable adverse events deemed to have the potential to seriously undermine the health care system in the eyes of the public. Yet despite the gravity of these events, there has been little opportunity for the courts to examine the liability issues surrounding RSIs. This article reviews the limited case law in this area and analyses the key legal issues which arise in claims for redress, including civil, criminal and disciplinary liability, involving those who have suffered harm from RSIs.

TI  - Urban Landscape Change Analysis Using Local Climate Zones and Object-Based Classification in the Salt Lake Metro Region, Utah, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas globally are vulnerable to warming climate trends exacerbated by their growing populations and heat island effects. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) typology has become a popular framework for characterizing urban microclimates in different regions using various classification methods, including a widely adopted pixel-based protocol by the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) Project. However, few studies to date have explored the potential of object-based image analysis (OBIA) to facilitate classification of LCZs given their inherent complexity, and few studies have further used the LCZ framework to analyze land cover changes in urban areas over time. This study classified LCZs in the Salt Lake Metro Region, Utah, USA for 1993 and 2017 using a supervised object-based analysis of Landsat satellite imagery and assessed their change during this time frame. The overall accuracy, measured for the most recent classification period (2017), was equal to 64% across 12 LCZs, with most of the error resulting from similarities among highly developed LCZs and non-developed classes with sparse or low-stature vegetation. The observed 1993-2017 changes in LCZs indicated a regional tendency towards primarily suburban, open low-rise development, and large low-rise and paved classes. However, despite the potential for local cooling with landscape transitions likely to increase vegetation cover and irrigation compared to pre-development conditions, summer averages of Landsat-derived top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures showed a pronounced warming between 1992-1994 and 2016-2018 across the study region, with a 0.1-2.9 degrees C increase among individual LCZs. Our results indicate that future applications of LCZs towards urban change analyses should develop a stronger understanding of LCZ microclimate sensitivity to changes in size and configuration of urban neighborhoods and regions. Furthermore, while OBIA is promising for capturing the heterogeneous and multi-scale nature of LCZs, its applications could be strengthened by adopting more generalizable approaches for LCZ-relevant segmentation and validation, and by incorporating active remote sensing data to account for the 3D complexity of urban areas.

TI  - On the Effect of Polarization and Incidence Angle on the Estimation of Significant Wave Height From SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant wave height is an extremely important descriptor of the ocean wave field. We have implemented the CWAVE algorithm using linear regression, with elastic net term selection, and single-layer feed-forward neural network using buoy observations and RADARSAT-2 Fine Quad image data as model inputs. We used a number of standard performance metrics and found that the neural network models comprehensively outperformed the regression models. We explored the effect of incidence angle and polarization on model performance and found that the most accurate models were implemented within incidence angle bins between 1 degrees and 2 degrees, rather than including incidence angle as an independent variable. We found that the performance of copol (horizontal-horizontal, vertical-vertical, and RL) and hybrid-pol (right-circular-horizontal and right-circular-vertical) channels was comparable, and that these channels outperformed cross-pol channels (horizontal-vertical and right-circular-right-circular). The accuracy of our H-s estimates was significantly higher than other published linear regression and neural network results. We demonstrate that a major factor in improving the accuracy of H-s estimation is to use buoy observations rather that operation wave model hindcasts as training data. We demonstrate an application of our model by creating two high-resolution H-s maps.

TI  - Monitoring of remedial works performance on landslide-affected areas through ground- and satellite-based techniques
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques have repeatedly proved to be an effective tool for built environments monitoring in areas affected by geological hazards. This paper describes how the Coherent Pixel Technique (CPT) approach has been successfully applied to assess the response of an unstable slope to the different phases of remedial works following a landslide event, The CPT technique was performed on 59 COSMO-SkyMed images obtained between May 2011 and August 2016 and centred on the Quercianella settlement (a small hamlet of Livorno municipality, Tuscany, Italy), where the reactivation of a dormant shallow slide had occurred in March 2011 and, hereafter, a geotechnical intervention, designed with the aim of mitigating the risks, has been conducted from August 2013, lasting thirteen months. The time series of CPT results show a deformation pattern with sudden accelerations (up to 21 mm in few months) corresponding to the beginning of the interventions, during which the area has been excavated to install a drainage well, followed by mild decelerations resulting from the stabilization of the area after the conclusion of the works. In particular, the integration of ground-based subsurface monitoring (inclinometers and piezometers) and DInSAR superficial data has provided consistent results for landslide characterization and helped defining the state of activity and the areal distribution of the sliding surface. Moreover, the performance of remedial works in the landslide-affected area has been observed, showing stabilization in the upper part of the hamlet and the ongoing movement in the lower part. The combined monitoring system also led the geotechnical company in charge of remedial works to design further stabilization works in order to preserve buildings and roads in the moving area. Therefore, the integration of remote sensing techniques and in situ instruments represents a timely and costefficient solution for intervention works monitoring, opening new perspectives on designing engineering solutions for the stabilization of unstable slopes.

TI  - Instrument predevelopment activities for FLEX mission
T2  - OPTICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fluorescence imaging spectrometer (FLORIS) is the payload of the fluorescence explorer mission (FLEX) of the European Space Agency. The mission objective is to perform quantitative measurements of the solar-induced vegetation fluorescence aiming at monitoring photosynthetic activity. FLORIS works in a push-broom configuration, and it is designed to acquire data in the 500 to 780 nm spectral range with a sampling of 0.1 nm in the oxygen bands (759 to 769 nm and 686 to 697 nm) and 0.5 to 2.0 nm in the red edge, chlorophyll absorption, and photochemical reflectance index bands. FLEX will fly in formation with Sentinel-3 to benefit from the measurements made by Sentinel-3 instruments, OLCI, and SLSTR, particularly concerning the cloud screening, the proper characterization of the atmospheric state, and the determination of the surface temperature. The instrument concept is based on a common telescope and two modified Offner spectrometers with reflective concave gratings both for the high resolution (HR) and low resolution (LR) spectrometers. In the frame of the instrument predevelopment, Leonardo Company (Italy) has built and tested an elegant breadboard of the instrument consisting of the telescope and the HR spectrometer. OHB System AG (Germany) is in charge of the development of the LR spectrometer. The main objectives of the activity are to anticipate the development of the instrument and provide early risk retirement of the critical components; evaluate the system performances such as imaging quality parameters, straylight, ghost, polarization sensitivity, and environmental influences; verify the adequacy of critical tests such as spectral characterization and straylight; and define and optimize instrument alignment procedures. Following a brief overview of the FLEX mission, we will cover the design and the development of the optics breadboard with emphasis on the results obtained during the tests and the lessons learned for the flight unit.

TI  - The sentinel stent? A systematic review of the role of prophylactic ureteric stenting prior to colorectal resections
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposeProphylactic' ureteric stents potentially reduce rates, and facilitate intraoperative recognition, of iatrogenic ureteric injury (IUI) during colorectal resections. A lack of consensus surrounds the risk-benefit equation of this practice, and we aimed to assess the evidence base.MethodsA systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched using terms ureteric/ureteral/JJ/Double J stent' or ureteric/ureteral catheter' and colorectal/prophylactic/resection/diverticular disease/diverticulitis/iatrogenic injury'. Primary outcomes were rates of ureteric injuries and their intraoperative identification. Secondary outcomes included stent complication rates.ResultsWe identified 987 publications; 22 papers met the inclusion criteria. No randomised controlled trials were found. The total number of patients pooled for evaluation was 869,603 (102,370 with ureteric stents/catheters, 767,233 controls). The most frequent indications for prophylactic stents were diverticular disease (45.38%), neoplasia (33.45%) and inflammatory bowel disease (9.37%). Pooled results saw IUI in 1521/102,370 (1.49%) with, and in 1333/767,233 (0.17%) without, prophylactic ureteric stents. Intraoperative recognition of IUIs occurred in 10/16 injuries (62.5%) with prophylactic stents, versus 9/17 (52.94%) without stents (p=0.579). The most serious complications of prophylactic stent use were ureteric injury (2/1716, 0.12%) and transient ureteric obstruction following stent removal (13/666, 1.95%).ConclusionsPlacement of prophylactic ureteric stents has a low complication rate. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that stents decrease ureteric injury or increase intraoperative detection of IUIs. Apparently higher rates of IUI in stented patients likely reflect use in higher risk resections. A prospective registry with harmonised data collection points and stratification of intraoperative risk is needed.

TI  - Application of remote sensing to water environmental processes under a changing climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing, as a crucial method to obtain information on water environmental processes, has become a major source of data, particularly of water environment and water resources, which are sensitive to global climate change. The bibliometric analysis provided here shows the research characteristics and developments of remote sensing-based observations of water environmental processes under a changing climate from 2000 to 2018. Visualized knowledge mapping is introduced to investigate the development status, scientific collaboration, involved disciplines, research hotspots and emerging trends of this field. The breadth and depth of remote sensing application in water environmental process studies have improved significantly as the number of related publications rose at an average annual growth rate of 15.97% in the 21st century. The United States and China were the leading contributors with the largest number of publications and all of the top 15 most active institutions. In addition, this field is a highly interdisciplinary field that covers a wide range of interests, from water resources to environmental science, geology, engineering, ecology, and agriculture. The application of remote sensing technology has significantly promoted the estimation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture, thereby offering a more complete perspective to the understanding of the water cycle. Additionally, climate change and its complex interactions with water environmental processes, including the occurrence of drought events, are of great significance and require special attention.

TI  - The early geological history of the Moon inferred from ancient lunar meteorite Miller Range 13317
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Miller Range (MIL) 13317 is a heterogeneous basalt-bearing lunar regolith breccia that provides insights into the early magmatic history of the Moon. MIL 13317 is formed from a mixture of material with clasts having an affinity to Apollo ferroan anorthosites and basaltic volcanic rocks. Noble gas data indicate that MIL 13317 was consolidated into a breccia between 2610 +/- 780Ma and 1570 +/- 470Ma where it experienced a complex near-surface irradiation history for similar to 835 +/- 84Myr, at an average depth of similar to 30cm. The fusion crust has an intermediate composition (Al2O3 15.9 wt%; FeO 12.3 wt%) with an added incompatible trace element (Th 5.4 ppm) chemical component. Taking the fusion crust to be indicative of the bulk sample composition, this implies that MIL 13317 originated from a regolith that is associated with a mare-highland boundary that is KREEP-rich (i.e., K, rare earth elements, and P). A comparison of bulk chemical data from MIL 13317 with remote sensing data from the Lunar Prospector orbiter suggests that MIL 13317 likely originated from the northwest region of Oceanus Procellarum, east of Mare Nubium, or at the eastern edge of Mare Frigoris. All these potential source areas are on the near side of the Moon, indicating a close association with the Procellarum KREEP Terrane. Basalt clasts in MIL 13317 are from a very low-Ti to low-Ti (between 0.14 and 0.32 wt%) source region. The similar mineral fractionation trends of the different basalt clasts in the sample suggest they are comagmatic in origin. Zircon-bearing phases and Ca-phosphate grains in basalt clasts and matrix grains yield Pb-207/Pb-206 ages between 4344 +/- 4 and 4333 +/- 5Ma. These ancient Pb-207/Pb-206 ages indicate that the meteorite has sampled a range of Pre-Nectarian volcanic rocks that are poorly represented in the Apollo, Luna, and lunar meteorite collections. As such, MIL 13317 adds to the growing evidence that basaltic volcanic activity on the Moon started as early as similar to 4340Ma, before the main period of lunar mare basalt volcanism at similar to 3850Ma.

TI  - Integrating Sentinel-2 Imagery with AquaCrop for Dynamic Assessment of Tomato Water Requirements in Southern Italy
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A research study was conducted in an open field tomato crop in order to: (i) Evaluate the capability of Sentinel-2 imagery to assess tomato canopy growth and its crop water requirements; and (ii) explore the possibility to predict crop water requirements by assimilating the canopy cover estimated by Sentinel-2 imagery into AquaCrop model. The pilot area was in Campania, a region in the south west of Italy, characterized by a typical Mediterranean climate, where field campaigns were conducted in seasons 2017 and 2018 on processing tomato. Crop water use and irrigation requirement were estimated by means of three different methods: (i) The AquaCrop model; (ii) an irrigation advisory service based on Sentinel-2 imagery known as IRRISAT and (iii) assimilating the canopy cover estimated by Sentinel-2 imagery into AquaCrop model Sentinel-2 imagery proved to be effective for monitoring canopy growth and for predicting irrigation water requirements during mid-season stage of the crop, when the canopy is fully developed. Conversely, the integration of the Sentinel-2 imagery with a crop growth model can contribute to improve the irrigation water requirement predictions in the early and development stage of the crop, when the soil evaporation is not negligible with respect to the total evapotranspiration.

TI  - Mapping leaf chlorophyll content from Sentinel-2 and RapidEye data in spruce stands using the invertible forest reflectance model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll plays an essential role in controlling photosynthesis, physiological activities and forest health. In this study, the performance of Sentinel-2 and RapidEye satellite data and the Invertible Forest Reflectance Model (INFORM) radiative transfer model (RTM) for retrieving and mapping of leaf chlorophyll content in the Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands of a temperate forest was evaluated. Biochemical properties of leaf samples as well as stand structural characteristics were collected in two subsequent field campaigns during July 2015 and 2016 in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany, parallel with the timing of the RapidEye and Sentinel-2 images. Leaf chlorophyll was measured both destructively and nondestructively using wet chemical spectrophotometry analysis and a hand-held chlorophyll content meter. The INFORM was utilised in the forward mode to generate two lookup tables (LUTs) in the spectral band settings of RapidEye and Sentinel-2 data using information obtained from the field campaigns. Before generating the LUTs, the sensitivity of the model input parameters to the spectral data from RapidEye and Sentinel-2 were examined. The canopy reflectance of the studied plots were obtained from the satellite images and used as input for the inversion of LUTs. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square errors (RMSE), and the normalised root mean square errors (NRMSE), between the retrieved and measured leaf chlorophyll, were then used to examine the attained results from RapidEye and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. The use of multiple solutions and spectral subsets for the inversion process were further investigated to enhance the retrieval accuracy of foliar chlorophyll. The result of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the simulated canopy reflectance of Sentinel-2 is sensitive to the alternation of all INFORM input parameters, while the simulated canopy reflectance from RapidEye did not show sensitivity to leaf water content variations. In general, there was agreement between the simulated and measured reflectance spectra from RapidEye and Sentinel-2, particularly in the visible and red-edge regions. However, examining the average absolute error from the simulated and measured reflectance revealed a large discrepancy in spectral bands around the near-infrared shoulder. The relationship between retrieved and measured leaf chlorophyll content from the Sentinel-2 data had a higher coefficient of determination with a higher NRMSE (NRMSE = 0.36 mu g/cm(2), R-2 = 0.45) compared to those obtained using the RapidEye data (NRMSE = 0.31 mu g/cm(2) and R-2 = 0.39). Using the mean of the ten best solutions (retrieved chlorophyll) the retrieval error for both Sentinel-2 and RapidEye data decreased (NRMSE = 0.34, NRMSE = 0.26, respectively), as compared to only selecting the single best solution. When the Sentinel-2 red edge bands were used as the spectral subset, the retrieval error of leaf chlorophyll decreased indicating the importance of red edge, as well as properly located spectral bands, for leaf chlorophyll estimation. The chlorophyll maps produced by the inversion of the two LUTs effectively represented the variation of foliar chlorophyll in BFNP and confirmed our earlier findings on the observed stress pattern caused by insect infestation.Our findings emphasise the importance of multispectral satellites which benefits from red edge spectral bands such as Sentinel-2 as well as RapidEye for regional mapping of vegetation foliar properties, particularly, chlorophyll using RTMs such as INFORM.

TI  - Assessment of rehabilitation projects results of a gold mine area using landscape function analysis
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activity is indispensable for the current stage of progress of our civilization. Although it is a temporary activity, its impacts are remarkable, especially with respect to landscape modifications. To mitigate such impacts, the implementation of monitored environmental recovery projects is of fundamental importance. Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) is a multicriteria analysis using remote sensing data and field information, suitable for monitoring the performance of recovery projects in areas degraded by the mining activity. In this work, LFA was used to evaluate the results of 20 years of environmental recovery projects in a gold mine. Ten base maps were developed: Declivity, Vegetation/Physiognomy Stratification, Fractures and faults, Compaction degree/soil structure, Erosion features, Geotechnical stability, Local hydrogeology, Degree of fragment isolation, Soils and Drainage. These were combined in order to give rise to three intermediate maps: Erosion and soil stability, Vegetation and Water. With the union of these three maps, it was possible to create the map with the final analysis of the environmental recovery performance. The technique used allowed the separation of native areas (which obtained the highest scores), recovered and self-sustaining areas (old mine dumps and waste piles) and areas still deficient in environmental recovery, with stability and erosion problems (mining sites and active mine dumps). In addition to allowing the analysis of large areas, the presentation of LFA results on maps facilitates decision-making and the dissemination and understanding of results by the different stakeholders involved.

TI  - Monitoring Ground Instabilities Using SAR Satellite Data: A Practical Approach
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite interferometric data are widely exploited for ground motion monitoring thanks to their wide area coverage, cost efficiency and non-invasiveness. The launch of the Sentinel-1 constellation opened new horizons for interferometric applications, allowing the scientists to rethink the way in which these data are delivered, passing from a static view of the territory to a continuous streaming of ground motion measurements from space. Tuscany Region is the first worldwide example of a regional scale monitoring system based on satellite interferometric data. The processing chain here exploited combines a multi-interferometric approach with a time-series data mining algorithm aimed at recognizing benchmarks with significant trend variations. The system is capable of detecting the temporal changes of a wide variety of phenomena such as slow-moving landslides and subsidence, producing a high amount of data to be interpreted in a short time. Bulletins and reports are derived to the hydrogeological risk management actors at regional scale. The final output of the project is a list of potentially hazardous and accelerating phenomena that are verified on site by field campaign by completing a sheet survey in order to qualitatively estimate the risk and to suggest short-term actions to be taken by local entities. Two case studies, one related to landslides and one to subsidence, are proposed to highlight the potential of the monitoring system to early detect anomalous ground changes. Both examples represent a successful implementation of satellite interferometric data as monitoring and risk management tools, raising the awareness of local and regional authorities to geohazards.

AB  - This paper analyzes the worldview of the narrator of The Time of the Hero based on the cathartic effect, distinguished by achieving identification with the characters or scenarios represented in the text. To obtain that sensibility desired in the reader, knowledge of the mechanisms that involve the association of related patterns is essential. Therefore, concepts from Mario Perniola, Slavoj Zizek, among others, will be used to determine the development of this idealized reading project. Considering that possibility, it is assumed that during this process assimilation and rejection of information is present ; moreover, a critical attitude is erected and even a repulsion for unethical acts (violence). The same will happen with respect to the approach of the representation of the story in the novel as a plot, because the reader requires a logical sequence that he can understand (he will bask logical sequences, although these are technically dispersed or confused); for that reason, the requirement based on his attention and his catchment will be necessary (so can be deny or accept an exhibited proposal, question it or ignore it).

TI  - Depth of invasion in patients with early stage oral cancer staged by sentinel node biopsy
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To investigate if depth of invasion (DOI) can predict occult nodal disease in patients with cT1-2N0 (7th TNM) oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) staged by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Methods In 199 OSCC patients, DOI measurements and SLNB were performed. Results Metastases were found in 64 of 199 patients (32%). Of these 64 patients, the mean DOI was 6.6 mm compared to 4.7 mm in patients without metastases (P = .003). The ROC-curve showed an area under the curve of 0.65 with a most optimal cutoff point of 3.4 mm DOI (sensitivity 83% and specificity 47%). Regional metastases were found in 15% of patients with DOI <= 3.4 mm. Conclusion DOI seems to be a poor predictor for regional metastasis in patients with cT1-2N0 OSCC. Therefore, staging of the neck using SLNB in patients with early stage oral cancer should also be performed in tumors with limited DOI and probably in T3 (8th TNM) OSCC <= 4 cm diameter.

M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: This study evaluates the lymphatic drainage patterns and determines the accuracy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients diagnosed with a cT1-2N0 OSCC and a history of neck surgery or radiotherapy in three Dutch head and neck centers.Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 53 cT1-2N0 OSCC patients, who underwent SLNB between 2007 and 2016, after a history of neck surgery or radiotherapy. Ten patients had previous treatment of the neck only contralateral from the current tumour. These ten patients were not used for the analysis of lymphatic drainage patterns. The 43 patients with previous ipsilateral or bilateral treatment of the neck had a history of ipsilateral SLN extirpation (n = 9; 21%), neck dissection (n = 16; 37%), radiotherapy (n = 10; 23%), or combined neck dissection and radiotherapy (n = 8; 19%).Results: SLNs were detected in 45 patients, resulting in an identification rate of 85% (45/53). Three patients (7%) had at least one positive SLN. One patient (1/45; 2%) was diagnosed with regional recurrence during the follow-up after a negative SLNB (sensitivity 75%, negative predictive value 98%). The first SLN was detected in level I-III in 58% of the patients, unexpected drainage patterns were observed in 30% (first SLN level IV 9% and level V 5% and contralateral neck in well-lateralized tumours 16%). In 12% no lymphatic drainage pattern was visible.Conclusions: SLNB seems to be a reliable procedure for neck staging of cT1-2N0 OSCC patients with a previously treated neck. SLNB determines the individual lymphatic drainage patterns, enabling visualization of unexpected drainage pattern variability in 30% of these patients.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite Sign and Island Sign in Predicting Hematoma Growth and Poor Outcome in Patients with Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Satellite sign (SS) and island sign (IS) are novel noncontrast computed tomography (CT) predictors of hematoma growth. The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic performance of IS and SS in predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).METHODS: The study included patients with ICH who underwent baseline CT scan within 6 hours of symptom onset and follow-up CT scan within 36 hours after initial CT between July 2012 and April 2017. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of IS and SS in predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome were assessed. Accuracy of the 2 signs in predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Association between the presence of IS and SS and ICH growth was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.RESULTS: Of 307 patients with ICH, IS was observed in 46 patients (15.0%), and SS was observed in 151 patients (49.2%). Rates of hematoma growth were 40.4% in SS+ patients, 91.3% in IS+ patients, 18.4% in SS-IS- patients, 21.1% in SS+IS- patients, 100% in SS-IS+ patients, and 90.5% in SS+ IS+ patients. After adjusting for potential confounders, IS remained an independent predictor for hematoma growth and poor functional outcome. The area under the curve of IS was significantly larger than the area under the curve of SS in predicting hematoma growth (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: IS seems to be an optimal shape irregularity imaging marker for predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome in patients with ICH.

TI  - Relationship between Gully Erosion and Agricultural Landscape Pattern in the Typical Black Soil Region of Northeast China
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - The black soil region of Northeast China is an important grain producing area that faces a serious erosion problem. We used SPOTS remote sensing imagery from 2008 to establish the gully distribution in a typical black soil region located in the Wuyuer and Nemoer River basin, and Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to designate landscape patterns. Ninety-three sub-basins were determined based on digital elevation model data using a hydrological analysis module for which landscape pattern metrics and gully density were obtained using FRAGSTATS software and the Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis function, respectively. The results show a gully density of 4,219.2 m(2)/km(2) with 10,149.5 ha of eroded dry land and 25,261.2 ha of destroyed dry land. Correlation analysis between gully density and the landscape percentage of dry land and forest, perimeter-area fractal dimension, contagion index, and Shannon's diversity index indicate that regulation of the proportion of forest, dry land, and grass, and reasonable optimization of landscape arrangement is very important for soil erosion management and control. Additionally, the findings indicate that landscape differences between each sub-basin are not the principal reason for differences in gully erosion. Further research on gully formation should integrate the effect of natural forces and human activities.

TI  - Examining the Deep Belief Network for Subpixel Unmixing with Medium Spatial Resolution Multispectral Imagery in Urban Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed pixels in medium spatial resolution imagery create major challenges in acquiring accurate pixel-based land use and land cover information. Deep belief network (DBN), which can provide joint probabilities in land use and land cover classification, may serve as an alternative tool to address this mixed pixel issue. Since DBN performs well in pixel-based classification and object-based identification, examining its performance in subpixel unmixing with medium spatial resolution multispectral image in urban environments would be of value. In this study, (1) we examined DBN's ability in subpixel unmixing with Landsat imagery, (2) explored the best-fit parameter setting for the DBN model and (3) evaluated its performance by comparing DBN with random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). The results illustrated that (1) DBN performs well in subpixel unmixing with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.06 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0077. (2) A larger sample size (e.g., greater than 3000) can provide stable and high accuracy while two-RBM-layer and 50 batch sizes are the best parameters for DBN in this study. Epoch size and learning rate should be decided by specific applications since there is not a consistent pattern in our experiments. Finally, (3) DBN can provide comparable results compared to RF, SVM and MESMA. We concluded that DBN can be viewed as an alternative method for subpixel unmixing with Landsat imagery and this study provides references for other scholars to use DBN in subpixel unmixing in urban environments.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF THE NORTHERN GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE (3PN, 4RS) ATLANTIC COD STOCK IN 2018.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Science Advisory Report
M3  - Article
M3  - Meeting paper
AB  - The first total allowable catch (TAC) of the Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence Atlantic cod stock (NAFO subdivision 3Pn and divisions 4R and 4S; Figure 1) was 55,000 t in 1977. It reached a maximum of 100,000 t between 1983 and 1985. This fishery was then placed under two moratoriums (1994 to 1996 and 2003). Between 1974 and 1993, this stock was fished by Canadian fleets using fixed and mobile gears, as well as by some foreign fleets using mobile gear. Since 1997, landings have been carried out by the Canadian fleet and mostly by fixed gear (gillnets, longlines and handlines). A recreational fishery is conducted on this stock and its harvest was estimated only in 2006 and 2008. The Northern Gulf cod spawning stock biomass has been in the critical zone, well below the limit reference point, since 1990. In 2010, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) designated the Laurentian North (3Pn, 4RS and 3Ps) cod population, part of which consists of Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (3Pn, 4RS) cod, as endangered, based essentially on the extent of the decline (78-89%) in adult abundance over three generations (30 years). This resource is managed mainly by an annual total allowable catch (TAC). Several other management measures (number and types of gear, area closures during spawning and in winter (3Pn), observers, dockside monitoring, minimum size, bycatch monitoring, rules for the recreational fishing, etc.) are also enforced. Since 1999, the management year has started on May 15 of the current year and ended on May 14 of the following year. This stock is assessed every two years using mainly data from commercial fisheries, sentinel programs (fixed and mobile gear) and DFO research survey. This Science Advisory Report is from the February 21 and 22, 2019 meeting on the assessment of northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (3Pn, 4RS) cod. Additional publications from this meeting will be posted on the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Science Advisory Schedule as they become available.

TI  - Satellite Pre-Failure Detection and In Situ Monitoring of the Landslide of the Tunnel du Chambon, French Alps
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies using satellite data have shown a growing interest in detecting and anticipating landslide failures. However, their value for an actual landslide prediction has shown variable results. Therefore, the use of satellite images for that purpose still requires additional attention. Here, we study the landslide of the Tunnel du Chambon in the French Alps that ruptured in July 2015, generating major impacts on economic activity and infrastructures. To evaluate the contribution of very high-resolution optical satellite images to characterize and potentially anticipate the landslide failure, we conduct here a retro analysis of its evolution. Two time periods are analyzed: September 2012 to September 2014, and May to July 2015. We combine Pleiades optical images analysis and geodetic measurements from in situ topographic monitoring. Satellite images were correlated to detect pre-failure motions, showing 1.4-m of displacement between September 2012 and September 2014. In situ geodetic measures were used to analyze motions during the main activity of the landslide in June and July 2015. Topographic measurements highlight different areas of deformations and two periods of strong activity, related to the last stage of the tertiary creep and to anthropic massive purges of unstable masses. The law of acceleration toward the rupture observed in June and July 2015 over the topographic targets also fits well the satellite observation between 2012 and 2014, showing that the landslide probably already entered into tertiary creep 2.5 years before its failure.

T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Missionaries were an important part of the colonizing mission. While the colonial armies committed massacres and subdued the militarily inferior Natives, the missionaries did a long lasting damage to the Native societies by obliterating their cultures. They not only converted the people, but also changed their worldview that was so important to them and the lands they lived in. The de-culturation of Natives is not only responsible for environmental problems, but also social problems like domestic violence and drinking. Recent studies have indicated that de-culturation of Natives is also responsible for endemic psycho-somatic problems of the Natives. The Native writers have understood that improvement in mental health of the Natives is directly associated with the resuscitation and restoration of Native culture. The literature written by the Natives works like an antidote against the atrocities committed by the whites. Leslie Marmon Silko's novel Ceremony is an important work of literature that tries to resuscitate the native culture. The current paper is a study of Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping procedure in T1 colorectal cancer A systematic review of published studies
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: to investigate the role of sentinel lymph node mapping procedure in T1 Colorectal cancer.Background: The incidence of T1 Colorectal cancer is increasing thanks to screening and awareness campaigns. The issue concerning T1 is when to consider a local treatment curative or when it is necessary a radical resection. The histopathological features of resected polyps are able to predict the nodal spread but the value of specificity is increasingly a problem of these predictors. The sentinel lymph node procedure could be a solution.Methods: A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines and using "sentinel node", "lymph nodes", and "colorectal cancer" as search terms in PubMed and Embase databases. References from included studies, review articles, and editorials were cross-checked. The risk of bias and quality of the included studies were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. The primary outcome was sentinel lymph node accuracy rate and the secondary outcome was sentinel lymph node detection rate for T1 Colorectal cancer.Results: A total of 12 studies (108 patients) met inclusion and exclusion criteria, 8 were monocentric cohort studies and 4 were multicentric cohort studies. The rate of sentinel lymph node accuracy in T1 colorectal cancer varies from 89% to 100%. Only 1 false negative was found. In 7 of these 12 studies (71 patients) the detection rate of T1 colorectal cancer was reported and showed a variation from 92% to 100%. Even in this case, only 1 case of failed procedure was found.Discussion: The literature on this topic agrees on that sentinel lymph node mapping, differently from breast cancer and melanomas should not be used for therapeutic purposes in colorectal cancer, but mainly to refine staging. The reason is the low sensitivity of this procedure with an accompanying high false negative rate. However, the data refers mainly to advanced stages of the disease because there are few data available on the earlier stages and in particular related to T1. Isolating the data related only to T1, the false negative rate seems to be very low. Additional studies are necessary, but a decisional role of sentinel lymph node mapping on the treatment of T1 Colorectal cancer is possible in the future.

TI  - Innovative pheno-network model in estimating crop phenological stages with satellite time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale remote monitoring of crop phenological development is vital for scheduling farm management activities and estimating crop yields. Tracking crop phenological progress is also crucial to understand agricultural responses to environmental stress and climate change. During the past decade, time series of remotely sensed imagery has been increasingly employed to monitor the seasonal growing dynamics of crops. A variety of curve-fitting based phenological methods have been developed to estimate critical phenological transition dates. However, those phenological methods are typically parametric by making mathematical assumptions of crop phenological processes and usually require year-long satellite observations for parameter training. The assumption and constraint make those methods inadequate for phenological monitoring in heavy cloud-contaminated regions or in complex agricultural systems. The objective of this study is to estimate crop phenological stages with satellite time series using a complex network-based phenological model (i.e., "pheno-network"). The innovative pheno-network model is non-parametric without mathematically defined phenological assumptions and can be constructed with partial-year remote sensing data. Rooted in network theory, the pheno-network model characterizes the complex phenological process with spectrally defined nodes and edges. It provides an innovative network representation to model the temporal dynamics of spectral reflectance of crops throughout the growing season. With corn and soybean in Illinois as a case study, the pheno-network model was devised to estimate their phenological transition dates along the leaf senescence trajectory from 2002 to 2017. Results indicated that the estimated transition dates of corn had strong correlation with its ground-observed mature stage. As for soybean, the estimated transition dates were closely associated with its dropping leaves stage. The pheno-network model shows marked potential to advance phenological monitoring in complex agricultural diversified and intensified systems.

TI  - Mapping of Soil Salinity Using the Landsat 8 Image and Direct Field Measurements: A Case Study of the Tadla Plain, Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization from arid to semiarid climate is a serious environmental problem. In some countries, salinization is considered a real threat to food security and food quality because it lowers crop yields and can irretrievably damage land. In the irrigated area of the plain of Tadla (Central Morocco), the intensive use of groundwater and saline surfaces lead to the degradation of soil quality. Experimental methods of monitoring soil salinity by direct real-time measurements are in high demand, but also very limited in terms of spatial coverage. The objective of this paper is to map soil salinity in the arid and semiarid zone of the Tadla plain in Morocco, based on optical remote sensing data and field measurements of sodium absorption ratio. The first results of work were devoted to the evaluation and validation of salinity models in the study area. Observations on the site, correlation, verification and validation of the model enabled us to map the salinity. All these use the soil salinity map based on non-saline soil content, light saline soil, moderate saline soil and highly saline soil. The map obtained from our model allowed us to identify the distribution of salinity in the study area. The values of the electrical conductivity in the study area range from less than 2 ds/m (non-saline soil) to more than 8 ds/m (highly saline soil) with a significant variation between the different levels of soil salinity in the study area.

TI  - Evaluation of the Snow Albedo Retrieved from the Snow Kernel Improved the Ross-Roujean BRDF Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The original kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models were developed based on soil-vegetation systems. To further improve the ability of the models to characterize the snow surface scattering properties, a snow kernel was derived from the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) model and used in the kernel-driven BRDF model framework. However, there is a need to further evaluate the influence of using this snow kernel to improve the original kernel-driven models in snow albedo retrieval applications. The aim of this study is to perform such an evaluation using a variety of snow BRDF data. The RossThick-Roujean (RTR) model is used as a framework for taking in the new snow kernel (hereafter named the RTS model) since the Roujean geometric-optical (GO) kernel captures a neglectable hotspot effect and represents a more prominent dome-shaped BRDF, especially at a small solar zenith angle (SZA). We obtained the following results: (1) The RTR model has difficulties in reconstructing the snow BRDF shape, especially at large SZAs, which tends to underestimate the reflectance in the forward direction and overestimate reflectance in the backward direction for various data sources. In comparison, the RTS model performs very well in fitting snow BRDF data and shows high accuracy for all data. (2) The RTR model retrieved snow albedos at SZAs = 30 degrees-70 degrees are underestimated by 0.71% and 0.69% in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, respectively, compared with the simulation results of the bicontinuous photon tracking (bic-PT) model, which serve as "real" values. However, the albedo retrieved by the RTS model is significantly improved and generally agrees well with the simulation results of the bic-PT model, although the improved model still somewhat underestimates the albedo by 0.01% in the red band and overestimates the albedo by 0.05% in the NIR band, respectively, at SZAs = 30 degrees-70 degrees, which may be negligible. (3) The albedo derived by these two models shows a high correlation (R-2 > 0.9) between the field-measured and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) data, especially for the black-sky albedo. However, the albedo derived using the RTR model is significantly underestimated compared with the RTS model. The RTR model underestimates the black-sky albedo (white-sky albedo) retrievals by 0.62% (1.51%) and 0.93% (2.08%) in the red and NIR bands, respectively, for the field-measured data. The shortwave black-sky and white-sky albedos derived using the RTR model for the POLDER data are underestimated by 1.43% and 1.54%, respectively, compared with the RTS model. These results indicate that the snow kernel in the kernel-driven BRDF model frame is more accurate in snow albedo retrievals and has the potential for application in the field of the regional and global energy budget.

TI  - Evaluation of Vegetation Biophysical Variables Time Series Derived from Synthetic Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of vegetation biophysical variables (leaf area index (LAI), fraction canopy cover (FCOVER), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), and canopy water content (CWC)) were estimated from interpolated Sentinel-2 (S2-LIKE) surface reflectance images, for an agricultural region located in central Canada, using the Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P). S2-LIKE surface reflectance data were generated by blending clear-sky Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (S2-MSI) images with daily BRDF-adjusted Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer images using the Prediction Smooth Reflectance Fusion Model (PSFRM), and validated using thirteen independent S2-MSI images (RMSE <= 6%). The uncertainty of S2-LIKE surface reflectance data increases with the time delay between the prediction date and the closest S2-MSI image used for training PSFRM. Vegetation biophysical variables from S2-LIKE products are validated qualitatively and quantitatively by comparison to the corresponding vegetation biophysical variables from S2-MSI products (RMSE = 0.55 for LAI, similar to 10% for FCOVER and FAPAR, and 0.13 g/m(2) for CCC and 0.16 kg/m(2) for CWC). Uncertainties of vegetation biophysical variables derived from S2-LIKE products are almost linearly related to the uncertainty of the input reflectance data. When compared to the in situ measurements collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2016 field campaign, uncertainties of LAI (0.83) and FCOVER (13.73%) estimates from S2-LIKE products were slightly larger than uncertainties of LAI (0.57) and FCOVER (11.80%) estimates from S2-MSI products. However, equal uncertainties (0.32 kg/m(2)) were obtained for CWC estimates using SL2P with either S2-LIKE or S2-MSI input data.

TI  - The Inter-Calibration of the DSCOVR EPIC Imager with Aqua-MODIS and NPP-VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) through the earth polychromatic imaging camera (EPIC) continuously observes the illuminated disk from the Lagrange-1 point. The EPIC sensor was designed to monitor the diurnal variation of ozone, clouds, aerosols, and vegetation, especially those features that benefit from observation near-backscatter conditions. The EPIC sensor does not contain any onboard calibration systems. This study describes the inter-calibration of EPIC channels 5 (0.44 mu m), 6 (0.55 mu m), 7 (0.68 mu m), and 10 (0.78 mu m) with respect to Aqua-MODIS and NPP-VIIRS. The calibration is transferred using coincident ray-matched reflectance pairs over all-sky tropical ocean (ATO) and deep convective cloud (DCC) targets. A robust and automated image-alignment technique based on feature matching was formulated to improve the navigation quality of the EPIC images. The EPIC V02 dataset exhibits improved navigation over V01. As the visible channels display similar spatial features, a single visible channel can be used to co-register the remaining visible bands. The VIIRS-referenced EPIC ATO and DCC ray-matched calibration coefficients are within 0.3%. The EPIC four-year calibration trends based on VIIRS are within 0.15%/year. The MODIS-based EPIC calibration coefficients were compared against the Geogdzhayev and Marshak 2018 published calibration coefficients and were found to be within 1.6%.

TI  - Breast MRI radiomics for the pretreatment prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in node-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate breast MRI radiomics in predicting, prior to any treatment, the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with invasive lymph node (LN)-positive breast cancer for two tasks: (1) prediction of pathologic complete response and (2) prediction of post-NAC LN status. Our study included 158 patients, with 19 showing post-NAC complete pathologic response (pathologic TNM stage T0,N0,MX) and 139 showing incomplete response. Forty-two patients were post-NAC LN-negative, and 116 were post-NAC LN-positive. We further analyzed prediction of response by hormone receptor subtype of the primary cancer (77 hormone receptor-positive, 39 HER2-enriched, 38 triple negative, and 4 cancers with unknown receptor status). Only pre-NAC MRIs underwent computer analysis, initialized by an expert breast radiologist indicating index cancers and metastatic axillary sentinel LNs on DCE-MRI images. Forty-nine computer-extracted radiomics features were obtained, both for the primary cancers and for the metastatic sentinel LNs. Since the dataset contained MRIs acquired at 1.5 T and at 3.0 T, we eliminated features affected by magnet strength using the Mann-Whitney U-test with the null-hypothesis that 1.5 T and 3.0 T samples were selected from populations having the same distribution. Bootstrapping and ROC analysis were used to assess performance of individual features in the two classification tasks. Eighteen features appeared unaffected by magnet strength. Pre-NAC tumor features generally appeared uninformative in predicting response to therapy. In contrast, some pre-NAC LN features were able to predict response: two pre-NAC LN features were able to predict pathologic complete response (area under the ROC curve (AUC) up to 0.82 [0.70; 0.88]), and another two were able to predict post-NAC LN-status (AUC up to 0.72 [0.62; 0.77]), respectively. In the analysis by a hormone receptor subtype, several potentially useful features were identified for predicting response to therapy in the hormone receptor-positive and HER2-enriched cancers.

TI  - Global Patterns of Submesoscale Surface Salinity Variability
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface salinity variability on O(1-10) km lateral scales (the submesoscale) generates density variability and thus has implications for submesoscale dynamics. Satellite salinity measurements represent a spatial average over horizontal scales of approximately 40-100 km but are compared to point measurements for validation, so submesoscale salinity variability also complicates validation of satellite salinities. Here, we combine several databases of historical thermosalinograph (TSG) measurements made from ships to globally characterize surface submesoscale salinity, temperature, and density variability. In river plumes; regions affected by ice melt or upwelling; and the Gulf Stream, South Atlantic, and Agulhas Currents, submesoscale surface salinity variability is large. In these regions, horizontal salinity variability appears to explain some of the differences between surface salinities from the Aquarius and SMOS satellites and salinities measured with Argo floats. In other words, apparent satellite errors in highly variable regions in fact arise because Argo point measurements do not represent spatially averaged satellite data. Salinity dominates over temperature in generating submesoscale surface density variability throughout the tropical rainbands, in river plumes, and in polar regions. Horizontal density fronts on 10-km scales tend to be compensated (salinity and temperature have opposing effects on density) throughout most of the global oceans, with the exception of the south Indian and southwest Pacific Oceans between 20 degrees and 30 degrees S, where fronts tend to be anticompensated.

TI  - Multicomponent Satellite Assessment of Drought Severity in the Contiguous United States From 2002 to 2017 Using AMSR-E and AMSR2
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 sensors (AMSR) have provided multifrequency microwave measurements of the global terrestrial water cycle since 2002. A new AMSR surface wetness index (ASWI) was developed by analyzing the near-surface atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), surface volumetric soil moisture (VSM), and land surface fractional open water (FW) time series from an established AMSR Land Parameter Data Record (LPDR). The ASWI allows for multicomponent and independent satellite assessments of near-surface drought conditions by exploiting the weighted anomalies of VPD, VSM, and FW. Comparisons between ASWI and more traditional drought metrics, including the Palmer moisture anomaly index (PDSI-Z) and the U.S. Drought Monitor, showed generally consistent classifications of drought severity for three major droughts over the Contiguous United States since 2002. The AWSI showed moderate (0.3 <= R <= 0.7 for 56% of area) to strong (R > 0.7 for 29% of area) correlations with the PDSI-Z during the summer months (June-August) from 2002 to 2017. ASWI and PDSI-Z differences were attributed to AMSR retrieval uncertainties and the different aspects of drought represented by the indices. Comparisons between ASWI and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment drought severity index (GRACE-DSI) showed strong correspondence (R = 0.61) in regions where possible long-term total water storage changes occurred. The sole reliance of the ASWI on satellite microwave remote sensing and continuing AMSR2 operations enables effective global monitoring of drought conditions while providing new information on the atmosphere, soil, and surface water components of drought.Plain Language Summary Extreme hydrologic events affect the economy, environment, and society. The anomalies of the water cycle components are associated with drought events. Considering the capability of multifrequency microwave remote sensing in observing multiple water cycle components, this study developed a new surface wetness index by analyzing near-surface atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, volumetric soil moisture, and land surface water inundation time series from an established satellite data record. The new index showed consistent assessment of major drought events relative to traditional drought monitors while providing enhanced information on the water cycle components of drought. A combined analysis of the index with satellite total water storage measurements provides complementary information on the different aspects of droughts, including relatively dynamic surface water changes and slower evolving groundwater conditions. The index enables independent and continuous satellite assessment of global drought conditions.

TI  - SIFSpec: Measuring Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Observations for Remote Sensing of Photosynthesis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is regarded as a proxy for photosynthesis in terrestrial vegetation. Tower-based long-term observations of SIF are very important for gaining further insight into the ecosystem-specific seasonal dynamics of photosynthetic activity, including gross primary production (GPP). Here, we present the design and operation of the tower-based automated SIF measurement (SIFSpec) system. This system was developed with the aim of obtaining synchronous SIF observations and flux measurements across different terrestrial ecosystems, as well as to validate the increasing number of satellite SIF products using in situ measurements. Details of the system components, instrument installation, calibration, data collection, and processing are introduced. Atmospheric correction is also included in the data processing chain, which is important, but usually ignored for tower-based SIF measurements. Continuous measurements made across two growing cycles over maize at a Daman (DM) flux site (in Gansu province, China) demonstrate the reliable performance of SIF as an indicator for tracking the diurnal variations in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and seasonal variations in GPP. For the O-2-A band in particular, a high correlation coefficient value of 0.81 is found between the SIF and seasonal variations of GPP. It is thus concluded that, in coordination with continuous eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements, automated and continuous SIF observations can provide a reliable approach for understanding the photosynthetic activity of the terrestrial ecosystem, and are also able to bridge the link between ground-based optical measurements and airborne or satellite remote sensing data.

TI  - The Effect of Mini-Latissimus Dorsi Flap (MLDF) Reconstruction on Shoulder Function in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of mini latissimus dorsi flap (MLDF) reconstruction on ipsilateral shoulder functions.Materials and Methods: Those included in the study are the patients aged between 23 and 73, who were operated with the diagnosis of early breast cancer (cT1-3)N0). The first group includes the patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with partial mastectomy. The second group consists of the patients who had axillary lymph nodule dissection (ALND) with partial mastectomy. The third group includes the patients who had SLNB and MLDF with partial mastectomy. The fourth group includes the patients who had ALND and MLDF with partial mastectomy. Patients' Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Q-DASH) score work model point were recorded.Results: 174 patients were included in this study. According to Q-DASH score, no functional change was detected in 69.5% of the patients, whereas slight functional loss was identified in 23.6%, moderate functional loss in 5.7%, severe functional loss 1.1%. In the comparison of Q-DASH scores in surgery groups, while these four groups were being analyzed, a significant difference was determined (p=0.007). When dual analyses were made, it was also established that the difference resulted from the group to which ALND and MLDF were applied together.Conclusion: We conclude that MLDF application for reconstruction purposes after breast surgery has a negative impact on shoulder functions of the patients who had both of partial mastectomy and ALND.

TI  - Environmental analysis of soil characteristics in El-Fayoum Governorate using geomatics approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims at identifying the impact of wastewater irrigation on soil characteristics of El-Fayoum Governorate using Landsat images and geo-statistical techniques integrated with field investigation and soil analyses. Soil samples were collected from 40 representative sites during November/December 2016 and analyzed for pH, electric conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), Ca, K, Na, and Mg. Landsat images were processed to produce spectral indices of water (MNDWI), vegetation (NDVI), salinity (NDSI), and urban areas (NDBI). Inverse distance weighting in ArcGIS 10.1 was used for mapping soil characteristics. Results refereed to a fluctuation in soil characteristics among different districts, as a result of variation and severity of activities. High levels of OC (3.5-5.21%) were recorded in several scattered parts while northern parts showed high levels of TP and TN recording 0.8-1.7mg/g and 1.7-2.4mg/g respectively. A great fluctuation in salinity, Ca, K, and Na levels were detected among the collected soil samples. Southern and eastern borders of the governorate showed high levels of Ca (>17.7mg/g). The most alkaline soil samples (>8) were mostly recorded in El-Fayoum and Tamia districts. Variation of soil characteristics is greatly impacted by irrigation using wastewater particularly from El-Bats and El-Wadi drains. A strong positive correlation (0.94) was observed between urbanization (NDBI) and land salinization (NDSI) which ensures the negative impact of residential areas on agricultural lands. It can be concluded that the agricultural land problems have greatly been impacted by the lack of sufficient water supply. Geospatial techniques along with soil analyses facilitate studying such problems.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Clear-Sky Periods From Irradiance Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent degradation studies have highlighted the importance of considering cloud cover when calculating degradation rates, finding more reliable values when the data are restricted to clear sky periods. Several automated methods of determining clear sky periods have been previously developed, hut parameterizing and testing the models has been difficult. In this paper, we use clear sky classifications determined from satellite data to develop an algorithm that determines clear sky periods using only measured irradiance values and modeled clear sky irradiance as inputs. This method is tested on global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data from ground collectors at six sites across the United States and compared against independent satellite-based classifications. First, 30 separate models were optimized on each individual site at GHI data intervals of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min (sampled on the first minute of the interval). The models had an average F-0.5 score of 0.949 +/- 0.035 on a holdout test set. Next, optimizations were performed by aggregating data from different locations at the same interval, yielding one model per data interval. This paper yielded an average F-0.5 of 0.946 +/- 0.037. A final, "universal" optimization that was trained on data from all sites at all intervals provided an F-0(.5) score of 0.943 +/- 0.040. The optimizations all provide improvements on a prior, unoptimized clear sky detection algorithm that produces F-0.5 scores that average to 0.903 +/- 0.067. Our paper indicates that a single algorithm can accurately classify clear sky periods across locations and data sampling intervals.

M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, methodologies for evaluating agricultural production do not allow precision tracking or monitoring of the production. The state Merida in Venezuela contributes to the country with more than 515,000 MT in agricultural goods. Lack of the above mentioned methodologies hinder the truthful capture of agricultural production data; alternative technologies are being used to overcome such deficiency. Panelera cane (Saccharum officinarum sp) has been monitored through Sentinel 2A satellite images captured from 27/03/2016 to 01/04/2017; and processed with QGIS-2.18 software. Agrarian records were used to establish training and verification areas of the supervised classification 379 hectares (ha) of crop were identified by 27/03/2016; and 361 ha by 01/04/2017. The present evaluation identified 51.6% (129 ha) of additional area as that reported by the official institutions of Merida for the year 2016; production is estimated to exceed by more than 50% in 2017 because institutions has not consolidated the information.

TI  - Monitoring Coastal Lagoon Water Quality through Remote Sensing: The Mar Menor as a Case Study
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mar Menor is a hypersaline coastal lagoon located in the southeast of Spain. This fragile ecosystem is suffering several human pressures, such as nutrient and sediment inputs from agriculture and other activities and decreases in salinity. Therefore, the development of an operational system to monitor its evolution is crucial to know the cause-effect relationships and preserve the natural system. The evolution and variability of the turbidity and chlorophyll-a levels in the Mar Menor water body were studied here through the joint use of remote sensing techniques and in situ data. The research was undertaken using Operational Land Imager (OLI) images on Landsat 8 and two SPOT images, because cloudy weather prevented the use of OLI images alone. This provided the information needed to perform a time series analysis of the lagoon. We also analyzed the processes that occur in the salt lagoon, characterizing the different spatio-temporal patterns of biophysical parameters. Special attention was given to the role of turbidity and chlorophyll-a levels in the Mar Menor ecosystem with regard to the programs of integral management of this natural space that receives maximum environmental protection. The objective of the work has been fulfilled by answering the questions of the managers: when did the water quality in the Mar Menor begin to change? What is happening in the lagoon? Is remote sensing useful for monitoring the water quality in the Mar Menor? The answers to these questions have allowed the generation of a methodology and monitoring system to track the water quality in the Mar Menor in real-time and space. The tracking system using satellite images is open to the incorporation of images provided by new multispectral sensors.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We used remote sensing data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite to identify the mineral properties and geothermal anomalies related to hot springs in the Tuzla area, including the fault system with NW-SE trend, which is located southwest of Canakkale, NW Turkey. In the study area, the lithological units of the Tuzla geothermal field and the surrounding area consist of Miocene volcanic (trachyandesite, trachyte, and ignimbrites) and Pliocene sedimentary (conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone) rocks with siliceous, argillaceous, and ferrous alteration linked to the geothermal fluid. ASTER visible/near-infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and TIR bands were analyzed by different approaches in order to highlight hot springs in the study area. From these approaches, band ratios were constructed from ASTER VNIR, SWIR, and TIR bands for obtaining geological properties of the region. The geothermal areas were defined by the minimum noise fraction (MNF) and principal component analysis (PCA) methods that was extracted from 5 thermal infrared (TIR) bands as well. Land surface temperatures (LST) support the results from MNF and PCA that were estimated for 5 TIR bands using the inversion of Planck function method. Four days of data including daytime and nighttime satellite images from ASTER were used for the analysis. The used procedure displayed a good match with the ground reality based on field observations in the Tuzla Region.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of "Nonsolid" Microscopic Metastasis in Merkel Cell Carcinoma Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our recent work regarding Merkel cell carcinoma sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis found that "solid" pattern microscopic metastasis conferred worse prognosis than the "nonsolid" ones. The goals of the present study were to (1) compare the prognostic significance/outcomes of 2 diagnostic groups-patients with a nonsolid pattern of SLN metastasis and those with diagnostically negative SLN biopsies (SLNB), and (2) evaluate the durability of SLN metastasis after extensive sectioning. Five-level, step-wise sectioning at 250-mu m intervals was performed in all SLN blocks with an immunohistochemical stain for CK20 on all levels. The presence and pattern of metastases were recorded and analyzed as were corresponding patient and tumor parameters. Median follow-up durations for all patients (n=38), positive SLNB (n=16) and negative SLNB (n=22) groups were 56.3, 50.4, and 66.8 months, respectively. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) did not differ between the 2 diagnostic groups (OS P=0.65, DSS P=0.37) but did differ by immune status (immunocompetent vs. immunosuppressed, OS P=0.03, DSS P=0.005) and primary tumor category (OS P<0.0001, DSS P=0.001). On deeper sectioning, all 16 diagnostically positive SLNB continued to show nonsolid microscopic metastasis, and 32% (7/22) diagnostically negative SLNB revealed nonsolid metastasis. DSS was worse for sinusoidal-pattern metastasis versus all others (P=0.02). Five of 38 patients (13%) died of disease; the only immunocompetent patient had sinusoidal-pattern metastasis discovered in a diagnostically negative SLNB. Our data suggest that outcome for nonsolid metastasis is similar to that of negative SLNB with the exception of the sinusoidal pattern, which was associated with worse outcome. Larger studies are warranted to quantify and compare microscopic metastatic tumor burden by pattern and confirm whether the sinusoidal pattern confers an intermediate prognostic risk between solid and other nonsolid microscopic metastases.

TI  - Child abuse and the pediatric surgeon: A position statement from the Trauma Committee, the Board of Governors and the Membership of the American Pediatric Surgical Association
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The pediatric surgeon is in a unique position to assess, stabilize, and manage a victim of child physical abuse (formerly nonaccidental trauma (NAT]) in the setting of a formal trauma system.Methods: The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) endorses the concept of child physical abuse as a traumatic disease that justifies the resource utilization of a trauma system to appropriately evaluate and manage this patient population including evaluation by pediatric surgeons.Results: APSA recommends the implementation of a standardized tool to screen for child physical abuse at all state designated trauma or ACS verified trauma and children's surgery hospitals. APSA encourages the admission of a suspected child abuse patient to a surgical trauma service because of the potential for polytrauma and increased severity of injury and to provide reliable coordination of services. Nevertheless, APSA recognizes the need for pediatric surgeons to participate in a multidisciplinary team including child abuse pediatricians, social work, and Child Protective Services (CPS) to coordinate the screening, evaluation, and management of patients with suspected child physical abuse. Finally, APSA recognizes that if a pediatric surgeon suspects abuse, a report to CPS for further investigation is mandated by law.Conclusion: APSA supports data accrual on abuse screening and diagnosis into a trauma registry, the NTDB and the Pediatric ACS TQIP (R) for benchmarking purposes and quality improvement.

TI  - Complications and Sequelae After Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Melanoma: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - ACTAS DERMO-SIFILIOGRAFICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a staging, not a therapeutic, procedure. The benefits of SLN biopsy have been more modest than expected and could be outweighed by the risks, which remain unclear. The aim of this study was to describe complications and sequelae observed in patients with melanoma who underwent routine SLN biopsy at our hospital.Patients and methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we performed a chart review of all patients with melanoma who underwent SLN biopsy at our hospital in Vigo, Spain, between January 2011 and July 2017.Results: In the period analyzed, 124 SLN biopsies were performed. Over a mean follow-up of 52.7 months (range 10.8-88.7 months). A percentage of 37.9 of the patients experienced complications. The complication rate after excluding patients who underwent lymph node dissection was 30.9%. In the full chort group, there were 14 scar-related complications (11.3%), 13 surgical wound infections (10.5%), 12 lymphedemas (9.7%), 11 seromas (8.9%), 4 hematomas (3.2%), 4 wound dehiscences (3.2%), 2 cases of lymphorrhagia (1.6%), 2 cases of sensitivity alteration (1.6%), and one urinary tract infection (0.8%). The most common sequela was lymphedema. Sequelae were on record for 15.3% of patients in the full cohort (7.5% of the patients who did not undergo lymphadenectomy). Smoking was associated with a 33 to 73% increased risk of complications. The main limitation of this study is the risk of information bias due to incomplete follow-up.Conclusions: SLN biopsy is a melanoma staging procedure that causes complications and sequelae. Recommendations for its use in clinical practice guidelines should be revised and the risks and benefits carefully evaluated in each case. Smokers in particular seem to have a high risk of complications. Patients with melanoma could benefit greatly from the development of less invasive staging tools. (C) 2019 AEDV.

TI  - Downslope Winds and Dust Storms in the Salton Basin
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The Salton basin is a closed, subsea level basin located in extreme southeastern California. At the center of the basin lies the Salton Sea, the state's largest inland lake, which is surrounded by a desert landscape characterized by paleo lakebed surfaces, dry washes, alluvial fans, and interdunes. Dust storms are common occurrence in this region. However, despite the regularity of dust outbreaks here, little is known about the meteorological processes responsible for these storms. Here I use observations and output from reanalysis to elucidate the meteorological controls on dust emission events in the Salton basin during 2015-18. Analysis of surface and upper-air observations, satellite data, and reanalysis, suggest that the largest dust storms in the region are associated with an upper-level low centered near the coastline of western Canada, which directs a zonal low-level jet over the region. Flow blocking by a coastal mountain range results in isentropic drawdown of air in the lee of these mountains. Once surface warming at the floor of the Salton basin is sufficient such that the density of the descending air is greater than that of the ambient air at the surface, the downslope windstorm reaches the desert floor and initiates dust emission. This process may also be accompanied by a downwind propagating hydraulic jump. These processes appear to be similar to those responsible for the strongest dust events in the Owens Valley, and may represent the main mechanisms for emission from other closed basins.

TI  - Use of FDA's Sentinel System to Quantify Seizure Risk Immediately Following New Ranolazine Exposure
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Neurological complications including seizures have been reported with ranolazine. We sought to quantify the risk of seizure-related hospitalizations or emergency department events following ranolazine exposure in the Sentinel System (2006-2015).Study Design and Setting Eligibility criteria were new use of ranolazine after 183 days washout period and absence of seizure diagnoses, anti-epileptic drugs, or seizure-related disorders during the baseline period.Results Among 52,155 ranolazine users, we identified 28 seizures in the 1-32 days after new ranolazine dispensing: 12 occurring in days 1-10 (high-risk window), 11 in days 11-20 (moderate-risk window) and 5 in the control window (days 21-32). Assuming an equal likelihood of seizure events across the 32-day observation window, we estimate an attributable risk of 0.9 excess cases per 10,000 exposed users. Using a self-controlled risk interval design with exact logistic regression, seizures were elevated in the high-risk window (relative risk [RR] 2.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-8.33) compared with the control window. No significant increased risk was observed in the moderate window. Half of the seizure cases had a diagnosis of renal disease, although seizure risk was not significant (RR 3.20 [CI 0.82-14.01]). A majority of patients in both risk windows were 75 years or older.Conclusion Our study suggests risk among younger ranolazine patients is rare. Given the imprecision of the risk estimates, we interpret the elevated seizure risk following ranolazine exposure with caution. Further analysis in a larger elderly population is warranted.

TI  - <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> Strain ZY-312 Defense against <i>Cronobacter sakazakii</i>-Induced Necrotizing Enterocolitis <i>In Vitro</i> and in a Neonatal Rat Model
T2  - MSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cronobacter sakazakii is an important pathogen associated with the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), infant sepsis, and meningitis. Several randomized prospective clinical trials demonstrated that oral probiotics could decrease the incidence of NEC. Previously, we isolated and characterized a novel probiotic, Bacteroides fragilis strain ZY-312. However, it remains unclear how ZY-312 protects the host from the effects of C. sakazakii infection. To understand the underlying mechanisms triggering the probiotic effects, we tested the hypothesis that there was cross talk between probiotics/probiotics-modulated microbiota and the local immune system, governed by the permeability of the intestinal mucosa, using in vitro and in vivo models for the intestinal permeability. The probiotic effects of ZY-312 on intestinal epithelial cells were first examined, and the results revealed that ZY-312 inhibited C. sakazakii invasion, C. sakazakii-induced dual cell death (pyroptosis and apoptosis), and epithelial barrier dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. The presence of ZY-312 also resulted in decreased expression of an inflammasome (NOD-like receptor family member pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3]), caspase-3, and serine protease caspase-1 in a neonatal rat model. Furthermore, ZY-312 significantly modulated the compositions of the intestinal bacterial communities and decreased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria but increased the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Bacillus in neonatal rats. In conclusion, our findings have shown for the first time that the probiotic B. fragilis ZY-312 suppresses C. sakazakii-induced NEC by modulating the proinflammatory response and dual cell death (apoptosis and pyroptosis).IMPORTANCE Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that can cause necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, the mechanism of pathogenicity of C. sakazakii is largely unknown. Here we have now demonstrated that apoptotic and pyroptotic stimuli are effectors of C sakazakii-induced NEC. Previously, we isolated a novel probiotic strain candidate from fecal samples from healthy infants and characterized it as Bacteroides fragilis strain ZY-312. Functional characterization reveals that ZY-312 inhibited C. sakazakii invasion, restoring epithelial barrier dysfunction, decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and reducing dual cell death (pyroptosis and apoptosis). Furthermore, the presence of ZY-132 was sufficient to hinder the adverse reaction seen with C. sakazakii in a C. sakazakii-induced NEC model. Taking the results together, our study demonstrated the utility of ZY-312 as a promising probiotic agent for the prevention of NEC.

TI  - Passive/active microwave soil moisture change disaggregation using SMAPVEX12 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2012) experiment was conducted during June-July 2012 in Manitoba, Canada with the goal of collecting remote sensing data and ground measurements for the development and testing of soil moisture retrieval algorithms under varying vegetation and soil conditions for the SMAP satellite. The aircraft based soil moisture data provided by the passive/active microwave sensor PALS (Passive and Active L-band System) has a nominal spatial resolution of 1600 m. However, this resolution is not compatible with agricultural, meteorological and hydrological studies that require high spatial resolutions and this issue can be solved by soil moisture disaggregation. The soil moisture disaggregation algorithm integrates radiometer soil moisture retrievals and high-resolution radar observations and it can provide soil moisture estimates at a finer scale than the radiometer data alone. In this study, a change detection algorithm was used for disaggregation of coarse resolution passive microwave soil moisture retrievals with radar backscatter coefficients obtained from the higher spatial resolution UAVSAR (Unmanned Air Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) at crop field scale. The accuracy of the disaggregated change in soil moisture was evaluated using ground based soil moisture measurements collected during SMAPVEX12 campaign. The results showed that soil moisture spatial variabilities were better characterized by the disaggregated change in soil moisture estimates at 5 m/800 m resolution as well as a good agreement between disaggregated estimates and in situ measurements. It also showed that VWC (Vegetation Water Content) did not have a big impact on disaggregation algorithm performance, with R-2 of the disaggregated results ranging 0.628-0.794. The 5 m and 800 m resolution disaggregated soil moisture did no show significant difference in statistical performance variables.

TI  - A Novel Remote Sensing Index for Extracting Impervious Surface Distribution from Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The area of urban impervious surfaces is one of the most important indicators for determining the level of urbanisation and the quality of the environment and is rapidly increasing with the acceleration of urbanisation in developing countries. This paper proposes a novel remote sensing index based on the coastal band and normalised difference vegetation index for extracting impervious surface distribution from Landsat 8 multispectral remote sensing imagery. The index was validated using three images covering urban areas of China and was compared with five other typical index methods for the extraction of impervious surface distribution, namely, the normalised difference built-up index, index-based built-up index, normalised difference impervious surface index, normalised difference impervious index, and combinational built-up index. The results showed that the novel index provided higher accuracy and effectively distinguished impervious surfaces from bare soil, and the average values of the recall, precision, and F1 score for the three images were 95%, 91%, and 93%, respectively. The novel index provides better applicability in the extraction of urban impervious surface distribution from Landsat 8 multispectral remote sensing imagery.

TI  - A Simple Similarity Index for the Comparison of Remotely Sensed Time Series with Scarce Simultaneous Acquisitions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergence of new state-of-the-art technologies has enabled an unprecedented amount of high spatial resolution satellite data having great potential for exploitation of extracted time series for a vast range of applications. Despite the high temporal resolution of time series, the number of real observations of optical data that can be utilized is reduced due to meteorological conditions (such as cloud or haze) prevailing at the time of acquisition. This fact has an effect on the density of the retrieved time series and subsequently on a number of coincidental observations when comparing the similarity of time series from two different data sources for which the simultaneous acquisition date is already scarce. Classical tools for assessing the similarity of such time series can prove to be difficult or even impossible because of a lack of simultaneous observations. In this paper, we propose a simple method in order to circumvent this scarcity issue. In the first step, we rely on an interpolation in order to produce artificial time series on the union of the original acquisition dates. Then, we extend the theory of the correlation coefficient (CC) estimator to these interpolated time series. After validation on synthetic data, this simple approach proved to be extremely efficient on a real case study where Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope NDVI time series on parcels in The Netherlands are compared. Indeed, compared to other methods, it reduced the number of undecided cases while also improving the power of the statistical test on the similarity between both types of time series and the precision of the estimated CC.

TI  - Biodegradable Biliverdin Nanoparticles for Efficient Photoacoustic Imaging
T2  - ACS NANO
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging has emerged as a promising imaging platform with a high tissue penetration depth. However, biodegradable nanoparticles, especially those for photoacoustic imaging, are rare and limited to a few polymeric agents. The development of such nanoparticles holds great promise for clinically translatable diagnostic imaging with high biocompatibility. Metabolically digestible and inherently photoacoustic imaging probes can be developed from nanoprecipitation of biliverdin, a naturally occurring heme-based pigment. The synthesis of nanoparticles composed of a biliverdin network, cross-linked with a bifunctional amine linker, is achieved where spectral tuning relies on the choice of reaction media. Nanoparticles synthesized in water or water containing sodium chloride exhibit higher absorbance and lower fluorescence compared to nanoparticles synthesized in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer. All nanoparticles display high absorbance at 365 and 680 nm. Excitation at near-infrared wavelengths leads to a strong photoacoustic signal, while excitation with ultraviolet wavelengths results in fluorescence emission. In vivo photoacoustic imaging experiments in mice demonstrated that the nanoparticles accumulate in lymph nodes, highlighting their potential utility as photoacoustic agents for sentinel lymph node detection. The biotransformation of these agents was studied using mass spectroscopy, and they were found to be completely biodegraded in the presence of biliverdin reductase, a ubiquitous enzyme found in the body. Degradation of these particles was also confirmed in vivo. Thus, the nanoparticles developed here are a promising platform for biocompatible biological imaging due to their inherent photoacoustic and fluorescent properties as well as their complete metabolic digestion.

TI  - Machine learning-based integration of remotely-sensed drought factors can improve the estimation of agricultural drought in South-Eastern Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is a natural hazard arising from insufficient crop water supply. Many drought indices have been developed to characterize agricultural drought, relying on either ground-based climate data or various remotely-sensed drought proxies. Ground-based drought indices are more accurate but limited in coverage, while remote sensing drought indices cover large areas but have poor precision. Application of advanced data fusion approaches based on remotely-sensed data to estimate ground-based drought indices may help fill this gap. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether various remotely-sensed drought factors could be effectively used for monitoring agricultural drought in south-eastern Australia. In this study, thirty remotely-sensed drought factors from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors were used to reproduce a ground-based drought index, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) during 2001-2017 for the New South Wales wheat belt in south-eastern Australia. Three advanced machine learning methods, i.e. bias-corrected random forest, support vector machine, and multi-layer perceptron neural network, were adopted as the regression models in this procedure. A station-based historical climate dataset and observed wheat yields were used as reference data to evaluate the performance of the model-predicted SPEI in reflecting agricultural drought. Results show that the bias-corrected random forest model outperformed the other two models for SPEI prediction, as quantified by the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R-2 values (< 0.28 and similar to 0.9, respectively). Drought distribution maps produced by the bias-corrected random forest model were then compared with the station-based drought maps, showing strong visual and statistical agreement. Furthermore, the model-predicted SPEI values were more highly correlated with observed wheat yields than the station-based SPEI. The method used in this study is effective and fast, and based on data that are readily available. It can be easily extended to other cropping areas to produce a rapid overview of drought conditions and to enhance the present capabilities of real-time drought monitoring.

T2  - REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Except for influenza pandemics, different observational studies have failed to demonstrate differences in mortality between various etiologies in adult patients hospitalized for respiratory infections. Aim: To compare clinical and mortality differences between different viral pathogens associated with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in hospitalized adults. Material and Methods: One-year prospective study in a sentinel center. We included 132 patients with SARI hospitalized for any of the nine viruses under study by PCR. Clinical variables were compared, excluding cases of coinfection. Results: A viral coinfection was identified in 12% and influenza infection in 56% of cases. Eighty percent of patients were aged >= 65 years, with a high frequency of comorbidities, 27% were bedridden. Twenty four percent were admitted to critical care units, 20% required ventilatory assistance and 16% died. Cases occurred throughout the year, with an expected seasonal peak between autumn and spring and a predominance of infections not associated with influenza during summer months. In the multivariate analysis, only being bedridden was significantly associated with mortality at discharge (Odds ratio 23.46; 95% confidence intervals 3.33-165.12, p < 0.01), without association with age, comorbidity, viral pathogen involved, laboratory parameters, clinical presentation or CURB65 score. No major clinical dissimilarities were found between different viral pathogens. Conclusions: In our series of patients, mostly elderly, only bedridden status was significantly associated with mortality at discharge in patients hospitalized for SARI. Viral pathogens were not relevant.

TI  - Use of Satellite Data for the Estimation of the Specific Growth Rate of Phytoplankton in the Surface Layer of the Black Sea
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A regional model is proposed for the estimation of the specific growth rate of phytoplankton in the sea surface layer using satellite data. The model is based on phytoplankton photosynthesis rate and biomass in organic carbon units. The phytoplankton photosynthesis rate was calculated based on ecological and physiological characteristics that were previously obtained for the Black Sea. The input parameters of the model are the chlorophyll concentration in the surface layer, water temperature, the intensity of the photosynthetic active radiation falling on the sea surface, the depth of the mixed layer, and the diffuse light attenuation coefficient. Seasonal variations in specific growth rate of phytoplankton were estimated for deep-water and near-Danube areas. The maximum values were found in the coastal area in May-June, the minimum values were observed in deep waters before the spring maximum of phytoplankton. The maximum and minimum values differed by a factor 5. The measured and calculated values of phytoplankton specific growth rate at individual stations and in selected extensive areas of the sea were fairly close. The model can be used for rapid estimation of the specific growth rate of phytoplankton in the sea surface layer using satellite data.

TI  - Phenology and Seasonal Ecosystem Productivity in an Amazonian Floodplain Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have explored the linkages between phenology and ecosystem productivity across the Amazon basin. However, few studies have focused on flooded forests, which correspond to c.a. 14% of the basin. In this study, we assessed the seasonality of ecosystem productivity (gross primary productivity, GPP) from eddy covariance measurements, environmental drivers and phenological patterns obtained from the field (leaf litter mass) and satellite measurements (enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer/multi-angle implementation correction (MODIS/MAIAC)) in an Amazonian floodplain forest. We found that ecosystem productivity is limited by soil moisture in two different ways. During the flooded period, the excess of water limits GPP (Spearman's correlation; rho = -0.22), while during non-flooded months, GPP is positively associated with soil moisture (rho = 0.34). However, GPP is maximized when cumulative water deficit (CWD) increases (rho = 0.81), indicating that GPP is dependent on the amount of water available. EVI was positively associated with leaf litter mass (Pearson's correlation; r = 0.55) and with GPP (r = 0.50), suggesting a coupling between new leaf production and the phenology of photosynthetic capacity, decreasing both at the peak of the flooded period and at the end of the dry season. EVI was able to describe the inter-annual variations on forest responses to environmental drivers, which have changed during an observed El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year (2015/2016).

TI  - A surface temperature and moisture intercomparison study of the Weather Research and Forecasting model, in-situ measurements and satellite observations over the Atacama Desert
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Good knowledge of the environmental conditions of deserts on Earth is relevant for climate studies. The Atacama Desert is of particular interest as it is considered to be the driest region on Earth. We have performed simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the Atacama Desert for two week-long periods in the austral winter season coincident with surface temperature and relative humidity in-situ observations at three sites. We found that the WRF model generally overestimates the daytime surface temperature, with biases of up to 11 degrees C, despite giving a good simulation of the relative humidity. In order to improve the agreement with observed measurements, we conducted sensitivity experiments in which the surface albedo, soil moisture content and five tuneable parameters in the Noah Land Surface Model (namely soil porosity, soil suction, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, the b parameter used in hydraulic functions and the quartz fraction) are perturbed. We concluded that an accurate simulation is not possible, most likely because the Noah Land Surface Model does not have a groundwater table that may be shallow in desert regions. The WRF-predicted land surface temperature is also evaluated against that estimated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. While at night the satellite-derived and ground-based measurements are generally in agreement, during the day MODIS estimates are typically lower by as much as 17 degrees C. This is attributed to the large uncertainty in the MODIS-estimated land surface temperatures in arid and semi-arid regions. The findings of this work highlight the need for ground-based observational networks in remote regions such as the Atacama Desert where satellite-derived and model products may not be very accurate.

TI  - New evidence of glacier darkening in the Ortles-Cevedale group from Landsat observations
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier darkening, or the decrease in glacier albedo over time, has been reported for glaciers in several parts of the world. In this study, we use data from the Landsat archive spanning back to 1984 to investigate the long-term evolution of surface albedo in the ablation area of 15 selected glaciers in the Ortles-Cevedale group, Central Italian Alps, and determine rates and magnitude of darkening. We calculate albedo trends using all available images acquired between 1984 and 2011, by filtering for cloud and snow cover. To confirm that the trends are robust, we perform tests on three pseudo-invariant calibration sites located outside glaciers, ruling out an influence of sensor degradation or varying solar geometry. All 15 investigated glaciers show a decrease in the albedo, which is significant at the 95% (99%) confidence level for 14 (12) glaciers. Albedo trends range between - 0.001 y(-1) and - 0.006 y(-1), with an average of - 0.003 y(-1).We compare our results with previous research in the study area to evaluate the effects of increasing supraglacial debris and climate change on the decrease in albedo; the first appears particularly important for some glaciers and we hypothesize glacier darkening might be caused by a combination of these two factors.

TI  - Detection and Simulation of Urban Expansion and Socioeconomic Segregation in the Greater Paramaribo Region, Suriname
T2  - TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses built-up area expansion and socioeconomic segregation within the Greater Paramaribo Region, Suriname. Built-up expansion between 1987 and 2015 was assessed via time-series analysis of Landsat images. By identifying visible spatial residential characteristics in Google Earth (c) images, the residential built-up area was differentiated into rich, middle, middle to low, and poor residences, signifying different socioeconomic groups. Results show that the built-up expansion of the region is primarily controlled by the distance to the previously built-up area, city centre, and roads, as well as land price. The observed expansion mainly consisted of middle and middle to low residences. Dissimilarity indices demonstrate an increasing socioeconomic segregation, especially between rich and poor. A business-as-usual model simulation for 2030 indicates that this segregation is likely to remain.

TI  - Infinitive Techniques in the Poetry by Joseph Brodsky (On the Example of the Analysis of the Poem "Zofia")
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the following article is to prove that the infinitive as a non-conjugated form lacking major grammatical categories of verb expressed at the morphological level (modality, temporality, person), has a potential to express all mentioned categories syntactically. The focus of this article is to review infinitive techniques applied in the poetic texts by Joseph Brodsky. The research is devoted to the identification and analysis of the features of expression of the category of modality and temporality in the infinitive constructions drawing on the example of the fragments of the poem "Zofia". Existential modal and time models of the poem are analyzed. The special semantic effect of internal speech, which allows reflecting the distinctive author's worldview taking into account the applied infinitive techniques, is revealed. The authors managed to demonstrate that the semantic potential of the infinitive is at its highest in the poetic text. This confirms the position of A.K. Zholkovsky who investigated groups of infinitives in poetic texts and revealed a peculiar poetic function of infinitive constructions which he metaphorically described as "infinitive writing". Infinitive writing aims to promote a special "meditative modality" in the poetic context, which creates a particular mood of a poetic persona. In one of his articles, Zholkovsky focuses on a group of infinitives found in the poem "Zofia" by Joseph Brodsky. Further, the article provides an insight into two fragments of Brodsky's "Zofia"; special attention is paid to the semantics, modal and temporal meanings of the infinitive constructions. Analyzing the fragments of the poem, the authors have determined the influence of the change of the poetic text's syntactic structure on the general modal and temporal meaning of infinitive groups. In the analyzed stanzas, the predicative center of the sentence is represented by groups of infinitives of imperfective and perfective aspects dependent on the repeating modal verb with a negative particle "ne sledovalo" and collocation "s toy raznitsey". At the same time, the modality of advice and the modal meaning of impossibility are expressed, and dependent infinitives refer to the past forms of the modal verb. However the syntactic construction changes. It is supported by the full stop at the end of the stanza of the second fragment and the conjunction "no" at the beginning of the next stanza. There is a contextual change of temporal and modal perspectives: the past shifts to the syntactic present with the meaning of future and the modality of obligation with a hint of advice is transformed to the modality of obligation with a hint of necessity. Consequently, the authors of the article come to the conclusion that the infinitive techniques presented in Brodsky's poems allow reflecting the specific author's worldview by means of creating distinctive modal and time models and a particular semantic effect of internal speech (stream of consciousness).

TI  - Lifetime exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the risk of multiple sclerosis in the US radiologic technologists cohort study
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Low exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from sunlight may be a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Possible pathways may be related to effects on immune system function or vitamin D insufficiency, as UVR plays a role in the production of the active form of vitamin D in the body. Objective: This study examined whether lower levels of residential UVR exposure from sunlight were associated with increased MS risk in a cohort of radiologic technologists. Methods: Participants in the third and fourth surveys of the US Radiologic Technologists (USRT) Cohort Study eligible (N = 39,801) for analysis provided complete residential histories and reported MS diagnoses. MS-specialized neurologists conducted medical record reviews and confirmed 148 cases. Residential locations throughout life were matched to satellite data from NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) project to estimate UVR dose. Results: Findings indicate that MS risk increased as average lifetime levels of UVR exposures in winter decreased. The effects were consistent across age groups Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that UVR exposure reduces MS risk and may ultimately suggest prevention strategies.

TI  - Performance assessment of CHIMERE and EURAD-IM' dust modules
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how two different atmospheric 3D modelling systems, with different dust modules, simulate a Saharan dust episode, using satellite data and in-situ observations to validate their performances. The episode occurred during 19-23 February 2016 and impacted the Iberian Peninsula. The two numerical modelling systems applied are the CHIMERE and the EURAD-IM chemistry transport models with different dust modules, both forced by the same WRF meteorological input. A common domain and resolution (27 x 27 km(2)) was adopted for the modelling setup. The comparison and evaluation of the two modelling results have shown that both models are able to capture the occurrence of the natural event, which was initiated by a cut-off low above the coast of Morocco, inducing a strong meridional transport of dust loaded air from Algeria straight towards eastern parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The most notable differences between the two model outputs concern the emission strengths and the emission source regions. In fact, different emission patterns and strengths are simulated by each model despite they use the same soil database, identical clay/silt/sand contribution for each soil type, and the same meteorological simulation. In general, CHIMERE simulates higher PM10, PM2.5, and dust concentrations than EURAD-IM for this event. In the South of Portugal, CHIMERE shows better agreement with observations, while in Central Portugal, EURAD-IM is closer to particle related measurements.

TI  - Satellite Observations of the Recovery of Forests and Grasslands in Western China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Grain for Green Program (GGP), which combats and reverses the landscape-scale habitat degradation by converting agricultural lands to forests and grasslands, was launched in 1999 in western China. An assessment of the extent to which the GGP has altered the vegetation cover and ecological functions in these regions is much needed. The present study initially analyzed land use and cover change of forests and grasslands over western China between 2000 and 2015. A variety of satellite-based ecological indicators, including net primary productivity, normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, carbon use efficiency, and water use efficiency, were used to reflect the biophysical consequences of the GGP in western China. Results indicated that the spatial extent of forests and grasslands increased by 13.97 x 10(3) and 11.13 x 10(3) km(2), respectively, which were mainly converted from deserts and croplands. The ecosystem functions of forests and grasslands showed an asymmetric response in northwestern and southwestern China. The normalized difference vegetation index and water use efficiency of forests, as well as the net primary productivity and water use efficiency of grasslands, increased significantly over this period. The GGP also has led to an increase in leaf area index and carbon use efficiency of forests and grasslands. The Loess Plateau and the Three Rivers Source area represent the most effectively recovered regions in western China. Rising precipitation rates have contributed to vegetation recovery to some extent, especially in northwestern China, whereas the GGP was the prominent reason for the improvement of ecosystem functions across the entire region of western China.Plain Language Summary Land degradation has caused severe environmental problems in many areas worldwide and severely restrains the sustainable development of numerous local economies. Land degradation also undermines the livelihoods and food security of people, especially in the economically underprivileged regions. Western China has experienced land degradation because of both its geological location and climatic conditions. To combat and mitigate this situation, the Chinese government implemented a series of national-scale ecological policies and programs during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nearly 20 years have passed since the implementation of these projects. Therefore, it is appropriate to comprehensively assess the biophysical consequences of these programs. The present study aims to evaluate the extent to which the vegetation of western China recovered during the 2000-2015 period based on a variety of remotely sensed data streams. Results indicated that the spatial extent of forests and grasslands have expanded. The ecosystem functions of forests and grasslands showed an asymmetric response in the southwest and northwest regions of western China. These findings may provide guidelines for government agencies and policy makers involved in initiating adaptation strategies designed to adapt to climate change and to manage vegetation production.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of total suspended matter (TSM) in the Pearl River estuary using MERIS full-resolution (FR) level-2 TSM product
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we first use self-organising map (SOM) and medium-resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) full-resolution (FR) level-2 total suspended matter (TSM) product to identify spatial-distribution patterns of TSM concentration in the Pearl River estuary. Second, the spatial and temporal variation of TSM concentration in the Pearl River estuary was investigated using 9-year (2003-2011) MERIS FR level-2 TSM products. The spatial-distribution patterns of TSM concentration identified by SOM in the Pearl River estuary showed that there are high values in west and north and low values in east and south. On the basis of the analysis of the sample points randomly extracted from the Pearl River estuary, the results showed that the spatial variation of TSM in eight gates varied greatly, and the Lingdingyang Bay from Humen to offshore waters (i.e. Xitan, Zhongtan and Dongtan) presents a decreasing trend. Moreover, extreme climate events (e.g. EI Nino and La Nina) may have a great effect on spatial and temporal variation of TSM concentration in the Pearl River estuary. These results could provide a new insight for a better understanding of the dynamics of TSM concentration in the Pearl River estuary and the effect of soil- and water-conservation measures in the upstream of Pearl River.

TI  - Coral Reef Change Detection in Remote Pacific Islands Using Support Vector Machine Classifiers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the abundance of research on coral reef change detection, few studies have been conducted to assess the spatial generalization principles of a live coral cover classifier trained using remote sensing data from multiple locations. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning classifier for coral dominated benthic cover-type class (CDBCTC) based on ground truth observations and Landsat images, evaluate the performance of this classifier when tested against new data, then deploy the classifier to perform CDBCTC change analysis of multiple locations. The proposed framework includes image calibration, support vector machine (SVM) training and tuning, statistical assessment of model accuracy, and temporal pixel-based image differencing. Validation of the methodology was performed by cross-validation and train/test split using ground truth observations of benthic cover from four different reefs. These four locations (Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Baker Island Atoll, and Howland Island) as well as two additional locations (Kiritimati Island and Tabuaeran Island) were then evaluated for CDBCTC change detection. The in-situ training accuracy against ground truth observations for Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Baker Island Atoll, and Howland Island were 87.9%, 85.7%, 69.2%, and 82.1% respectively. The classifier attained generalized accuracy scores of 78.8%, 81.0%, 65.4%, and 67.9% for the respective locations when trained using ground truth observations from neighboring reefs and tested against the local ground truth observations of each reef. The classifier was trained using the consolidated ground truth data of all four sites and attained a cross-validated accuracy of 75.3%. The CDBCTC change detection analysis showed a decrease in CDBCTC of 32% at Palmyra Atoll, 25% at Kingman Reef, 40% at Baker Island Atoll, 25% at Howland Island, 35% at Tabuaeran Island, and 43% at Kiritimati Island. This research establishes a methodology for developing a robust classifier and the associated Controlled Parameter Cross-Validation (CPCV) process for evaluating how well the model will generalize to new data. It is an important step for improving the scientific understanding of temporal change within coral reefs around the globe.

TI  - Automatic cost-effective method for land cover classification (ALCC)
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for the detection and monitoring of changes in the environment is greater today than ever before. Through classification we can obtain insights into the state of the land surface. No known classification methods are fully automated, and their implementation requires preprocessing and postprocessing. This research provides a novel, fully automatic and cost-effective land cover classification method (ALCC). This novel automatic method does not require prior knowledge of the terrain or the assignment of training samples. The ALCC method is based on unsupervised classification methods, which is performed over the spectral indices rasters and six Landsat-8 30 m spatial resolution bands. The method was tested in three different study areas. Furthermore, all three study areas were classified by common supervised classification methods, namely, the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and the Random Forests (RF) method. For comparison accuracy, assessment of the three applied classification methods, namely, the figure of merit, overall agreement, omission and commission, were used. The results show that the overall agreement of the new automatic classification method for the Rijeka, Zagreb and Sarajevo study areas is 90.0%, 89.5% and 89.9%, respectively, and the overall agreement always falls between the overall agreement of the MLC method (88.1%, 88.9% and 86.7%, respectively) and the overall agreement of the RF method of classification (91.7%, 90.4% and 90.2%, respectively). These results confirm that this new automatic, cost-effective and accurate land cover classification method can be easily applied for numerous remote sensing applications.

TI  - The Nonradiative Effect Dominates Local Surface Temperature Change Caused by Afforestation in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - China is several decades into large-scale afforestation programs to help address significant ecological and environmental degradation, with further afforestation planned for the future. However, the biophysical impact of afforestation on local surface temperature remains poorly understood, particularly in midlatitude regions where the importance of the radiative effect driven by albedo and the nonradiative effect driven by energy partitioning is uncertain. To examine this issue, we investigated the local impact of afforestation by comparing adjacent forest and open land pixels using satellite observations between 2001 and 2012. We attributed local surface temperature change between adjacent forest and open land to radiative and nonradiative effects over China based on the Intrinsic Biophysical Mechanism (IBM) method. Our results reveal that forest causes warming of 0.23 degrees C (+/- 0.21 degrees C) through the radiative effect and cooling of -0.74 degrees C (+/- 0.50 degrees C) through the nonradiative effect on local surface temperature compared with open land. The nonradiative effect explains about 79% (+/- 16%) of local surface temperature change between adjacent forest and open land. The contribution of the nonradiative effect varies with forest and open land types. The largest cooling is achieved by replacing grasslands or rain-fed croplands with evergreen tree types. Conversely, converting irrigated croplands to deciduous broadleaf forest leads to warming. This provides new guidance on afforestation strategies, including how these should be informed by local conditions to avoid amplifying climate-related warming.

AB  - The present study was conducted in the Northern Ethiopia, the most ancient town, Axum to detect urban expansion of for the last 3 decades and predict the trend of urban expansion for the year of 2025. To do so, multi-temporal satellite images of 1985, 2000 and 2015 with other datasets were considered and analyzed to scrutinize level of urban expansion. Maximum likelihood algorithm of supervised classification was applied for each Landsat satellite images to generate land use and land cover map of the study area using ERDAS Imagine software. The levels of accuracy of these classifications were evaluated using confusion matrix to derive the overall accuracy. The finding of this study indicated that in the base year (1985), the largest LULC was occupied by agriculture covered, 60% of the entire area in 1985, 48% in 2000 and 38% in 2015, while the urban area increased by 10%, 19% and 39% in 1985, 2000 and 2015, respectively. The decline of the agricultural area was the fast conversion of the agricultural land into the urban areas. The vegetated area was 19% in 1985, 16% in 2000 and 20% in 2015, and also barren lands were possessed 11% in 1985, 17% in 2000 and 3% in 2015 of the entire study area. Even though many changes have observed among the LULC in the year between 1985 and 2015, the highest rate of changes was observed in urban land which increased by 9.9% in every year and vegetated areas by 0.1% per year. Besides, agricultural and barren lands are also decreased in size by 1.18% and 2.38%, respectively, in 2015 when compared with 1985. Therefore, the built-up area was under fast growing currently and some of the causative factors include population growth of the town and rural to urban migration. Finally, the forecast urban expansion of Axum Town for the year, 2025 was found 1497.9 ha Therefore, urban planning authorities and urban planners should think about the future impact of horizontal urban expansion and population growth of the town in line with possible infrastructures development.

TI  - Using GIS to Develop a Model for Forest Fire Risk Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are the most beautiful natural resources around the world and play a pivotal role in preserving environmental balance. An important measure taken for managing and protecting forest areas as well as for decreasing the potential damages caused by the fire is the detection of regions susceptible to forest fire through forest fire risk mapping with different models and methods. In recent years, a geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) have been successfully applied in the production of forest fire risk maps. In this study, GIS-based analytical network process as MCDA method was employed in order to provide the fire risk map of Noshahr Forests (North Iran) using slope, slope aspect, altitude, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index, annual rainfall, annual temperature, distance to settlements, and distance to road as input data. Furthermore, to prepare the map of the distribution of occurred fires, MODIS fire product and wide-field observations were used. Thereafter, each of these subcriteria of the utilized factors was standardized according to their significance in a forest fire and then with the extracted coefficients in the analytical network process model merged in ArcGIS software. Finally, the fire risk map was generated. Evaluation of the results obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the designed model has good accuracy with a value of under curve area of 0.783. According to the map prepared, 57.45% of the study area (1034.41 km(2)) is located in the high and very high-risk classes.

TI  - Climate Model Evaluation in the Presence of Observational Uncertainty: Precipitation Indices over the Contiguous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate model evaluation is complicated by the presence of observational uncertainty. In this study we analyze daily precipitation indices and compare multiple gridded observational and reanalysis products with regional climate models (RCMs) from the North American component of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) multimodel ensemble. In the context of model evaluation, observational product differences across the contiguous United States (CONUS) are also deemed nontrivial for some indices, especially for annual counts of consecutive wet days and for heavy precipitation indices. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used to directly include this observational spread into the model evaluation procedure, enabling visualization and interpretation of model differences relative to a "cloud" of observational uncertainty. Applying MDS to the evaluation of NA-CORDEX RCMs reveals situations of added value from dynamical downscaling, situations of degraded performance from dynamical downscaling, and the sensitivity of model performance to model resolution. On precipitation days, higher-resolution RCMs typically simulate higher mean and extreme precipitation rates than their lower-resolution pairs, sometimes improving model fidelity with observations. These results document the model spread and biases in daily precipitation extremes across the full NA-CORDEX model ensemble. The often-large divergence between in situ observations, satellite data, and reanalysis, shown here for CONUS, is especially relevant for data-sparse regions of the globe where satellite and reanalysis products are extensively relied upon. This highlights the need to carefully consider multiple observational products when evaluating climate models.

TI  - Spatiotemporal differentiation of forest land conversion on township scale of the loess hilly region in central Gansu: Effectiveness of ecological construction project
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on GIS techniques and Landsat images, the transformation source, extent and speed of forest land use, and the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics of forest land transformation were obtained on the township scale for Anding District, Dingxi City in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. From 1995 to 2015, the total area of forest land transformation was increasing, with the grassland and cultivated land being the main sources. The forest land transformation extent and transition speed showed a tendency of decrease first and then increase from 1995 to 2015. The spatial distribution of forest land transformation differed, and the transformation area of forest land in each town was also different. The change of forest land transformation differed with the increasing slope. Both the net conversion and transformation extent of forest land showed a trend of increase first and then decease, but with opposite transformation speed. The major transformation of forest land occurred in the area with slope larger than 15 degrees.

TI  - Satellite gravity - enhancements from new satellites and new altimeter technology
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reviews the impacts of new satellite altimeter data sets and new technology on the production of satellite gravity. It considers the contribution of the increased data volume, the application of new altimeter acquisition technology and the potential for future developments. Satellite altimeter derived gravity has provided gravity maps of the world's seas since the 1980s, but, from 1995 to 2010, virtually all improvements were in the processing as there were no new satellite data with closely spaced tracks. In recent years, new data from CryoSat-2 (launched in 2010) and the geodetic mission of Jason-1 (2012-2013) have provided a wealth of additional coverage and new technology allows further improvements. The synthetic aperture radar mode of CryoSat-2 uses a scanning approach to limit the size of the altimeter sea surface footprint in the along-track direction. Tests indicate that this allows reliable data to be acquired closer to coastlines. The synthetic aperture radar interferometric mode of CryoSat-2 uses two altimeters to locate sea-surface reflection points laterally away from the satellite track. In a study to generate gravity for freshwater lakes, this mode is found to be valuable in extending the available satellite coverage. The AltiKa altimeter uses higher frequency radar to provide less noisy sea-surface signals and its new orbit mode gives potential for further improvements in satellite gravity. Future developments include the potential for swath mapping to provide further gravity improvements.

TI  - Disparities in the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma. A population-based high-resolution study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Population-based cancer registry data from three Spanish areas were used to assess the patterns of care and adherence to guidelines for cutaneous malignant melanoma. We included 934 cases diagnosed in 2009-2013. Completeness of the pathology reports, imaging for detecting distant metastasis and the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were analysed. The proportion of pathology reports that mentioned the essential pathological features required for T staging was 93%, ranging across geographic areas from 81% to 98% (p < 0.001). The percentage of low-risk patients who underwent no imaging studies, as proposed by guidelines, or only chest imaging ranged among areas from 0.6% to 84% (p < 0.001). Of the patients with clinically node-negative melanoma >1 mm thick and no distant metastases, 68% underwent SLNB, varying by area from 61% to 78% (p = 0.017). This study revealed wide geographic variation in different aspects of melanoma care. The use of a standardised structured pathology report could strengthen the completeness of reporting. Improvement strategies should also include efforts to reduce overuse of imaging in low-risk patients and to increase the adherence to guidelines recommendations on the use of SLNB.

TI  - NDVI for Monitoring of the State of Steppe and Desert Ecosystems of the Gobi
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current state of the dry-steppe, desert-steppe, mountain-steppe, and desert ecosystems of the Gobi Desert (Mongolia) has been studied. In the dry steppes and steppe deserts, not only is there a decrease in the phytocenotic indicators of plant communities and deterioration of the state of dominants, but also a change in their composition has been revealed. Thus, there was a replacement of typical grass species of dry steppes (Stipa krylovii, Agropyron cristatum, etc.) with desert-steppe species (Allium polyrrhizum). In steppe deserts, the role of herbal species (Stipa glareosa and Cleistogenes songorica) in the community structure significantly decreased, and the proportion of desert shrubs (Anabasis brevifolia and Salsola passerina) increased. The vegetation of true and extremely arid deserts turned to be the most resistant to aridization and increased pasture loads. The changes were revealed only in the Sympegma community, where a significant decrease in the abundance of Sympegma regelii was observed. A mismatch has been found between the values of the NDVI index obtained remotely from Landsat 8 images and the phytocoenotic indices determined in field studies. The data from field spectrometry of the dominant species and the surface of soils and plant communities showed that the soil background plays a significant role in formation of spectral images of plant communities, especially with low projective cover.

TI  - Winter Wheat Green-up Date Variation and its Diverse Response on the Hydrothermal Conditions over the North China Plain, Using MODIS Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology plays a critical role in the dynamic response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. However, the relationship between the phenology of winter wheat and hydrothermal factors is inadequate, especially in typical agricultural areas. In this study, the possible effects of preseason climate changes on the green-up date (GUD) of winter wheat over the North China Plain (NCP) was investigated, using the MODIS EVI 8-day time-series data from 2000 to 2015, as well as the concurrent monthly mean temperature (T-m), mean maximum (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) and total precipitation (TP) data. Firstly, we quantitatively identified the time lag effects of winter wheat GUD responses to different climatic factors; then, the major driving factors for winter wheat GUD were further explored by applying multiple linear regression models. The results showed that the time lag effects of winter wheat GUD response to climatic factors were site- and climatic parameters-dependent. Negative temperature effects with about a 3-month time lag dominated in most of the NCP, whereas positive temperature effects with a zero-month lag were most common in some of the southern parts. In comparison, total precipitation had a negative zero-month lag effect in the northern region, but two lagged months occurred in the south. Regarding the time lag effects, the explanation power of climatic factors improved relatively by up to 77%, and the explanation area increased by 41.20%. Additionally, change in winter wheat GUD was primarily determined by temperature rather than by TP, with a marked spatial heterogeneity of the T-max and T-min effect. Our results confirmed different time lag effects from different climatic factors on phenological processes in spring, and further suggested that both T-max and T-min should be considered to improve the performance of spring phenology models.

TI  - Pansacramentalism, Interreligious Theology, and Lived Religion
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Opening with a philosophical definition of sacrament(ality) as a mediator (mediation) of the sacred in the concrete world, this article offers pansacramentalism as a promising worldview-especially for those rooted in or emerging from the Christian traditions (since, for them, the language of sacramentality may have a stronger resonance)-for bringing together interreligious theology and data mined by Lived Religion approaches to the study of religion. After articulating the concept of pansacramentalism and emphasizing interreligious theology as an emerging model for doing theology, growing trends and changing sensibilities among young people's religious and spiritual lives (e.g., the "Nones") is considered insofar as such trends remain relevant for making contemporary theology accessible to the next generation. The article then considers the intersection of pansacramentalism and interreligious theology, especially the issue of determining sacramental authenticity. To explain how this challenge might be met, Abraham Heschel's theology of theomorphism is offered as but one example as a nuanced means for determining sacramental authenticity of the sacred in the world. Turning to "Lived Religion" approaches, rationale is offered for why pansacramentalism and interreligious theology ought to be taken seriously in the contemporary world, especially considering recent data about the nature of contemporary religious identities among young people living in the West.

TI  - Inferences of textual comprehension and genres: A comparative study between Costa Rica and Spain
T2  - REVISTA DE EDUCACION
M3  - Article
AB  - The various theoretical models of reading comprehension have revealed the complexity of the cognitive processes involved. Readers need to construct the meaning of what they are reading, to check what they are reading against their recall of related information, and to build a coherent frame of reference or reference model. This reference model develops from the text-base, as well as from the integration of this text-base with the reader's previous knowledge, derived from those readers' experience, their worldview and their understanding the text's genre in the text-base. Our research analyses the construction of inferences throughout different genres within a sample composed of 3,199 Secondary Education students in Costa Rica and Spain. To this end, TECOLEIN, a test aiming to measure students' level of inferential reading comprehension, was designed and validated. TECOLEIN was composed of four types of inferences in three different genres. The data obtained were analysed using Paired-Samples T-Test and ANOVA and, at the same time, a two-stage cluster analysis was performed. The results obtained in TECOLEIN have allowed, firstly, to observe a gradual progress of the inferential reading comprehension among students aged 12, 14 and 16. Throughout secondary education, the students develop strategies that integrate into the reading comprehension both the knowledge built from the text, and that based on long-term memory. Secondly, the joint analysis of the answers offered by the students to questions of inferential comprehension related to different genres reflects the existence of different degrees of difficulty in the comprehension of a text. Finally, difficulties of reading comprehension in Costa Rica and Spain present scaled results, since both countries present a similar difficulty associated with a type of inferential comprehension.

TI  - Counter-Electrojet Occurrence as Observed From C/NOFS Satellite and Ground-Based Magnetometer Data Over the African and American Sectors
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of the counter-electrojet occurrence (CEJ) during 2008-2014 is presented for the African and American sectors based on local daytime (0700-1700 LT) observations from the Communications and Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) vertical ion plasma drift (equivalent to vertical E x B at an altitude of about 400 km) and ground-based magnetometers. Using quiet time (Kp <= 3) data, differences and/or similarities between the two data sets with reference to local time and seasonal dependence are established. For the first time, it is shown that C/NOFS satellite data are consistent with magnetometer observations in identifying CEJ occurrences during all seasons. However, C/NOFS satellite data show higher CEJ occurrence rate for almost all seasons. With respect to local time, C/NOFS satellite observes more CEJ events than magnetometer observations by average of about 20% and 40% over the American and African sectors, respectively, despite both data sets showing similar trends in CEJ identification. Therefore, when a space weather event occurs, it is important to first establish the original variability nature and/or magnitude of the eastward electric field in equatorial regions before attributing the resulting changes to solar wind-magnetosphere and ionosphere coupling processes since CEJ events can be present even during quiet conditions.

TI  - An observation of primary production enhanced by coastal upwelling in the southwest East/Japan Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal upwelling (CU) is an important process that causes changes in physical and chemical properties, resulting in variation of biological processes in a coastal area. In the southwestern part of the East/Japan Sea (SWES), CU has been alleged as one of the mechanisms responsible for higher net primary production (NPP) than the rest of the East/Japan Sea. We provide, for the first time, high spatial resolution underway observations of sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a fluorescence and Delta(O-2/Ar), revealing the physical and biological characteristics of the upwelled waters in the SWES. The cold, upwelled waters retained high fluorescence and Delta(O-2/Ar), consistent with enhanced phytoplankton biomass and biological O-2 production by CU. The net community production (NCP) in the ambient and upwelled waters were 33 +/- 19 and 77 +/- 41 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The latter should be considered as a lower bound, containing a significant fraction of low O-2 waters from subsurface. Satellite observation indicated that NPP in the upwelled waters were higher than the ambient waters by 51%. This implies that up to half of higher NPP in the SWES than the rest of the East/Japan Sea can be ascribed to CU events.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo develop a radiomic nomogram for preoperative prediction of axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis in breast cancer patients.MethodsPreoperative magnetic resonance imaging data from 411 breast cancer patients was studied. Patients were assigned to either a training cohort (n=279) or a validation cohort (n=132). Eight hundred eight radiomic features were extracted from the first phase of T1-DCE images. A support vector machine was used to develop a radiomic signature, and logistic regression was used to develop a nomogram.ResultsThe radiomic signature based on 12 LN status-related features was constructed to predict LN metastasis, its prediction ability was moderate, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76 and 0.78 in training and validation cohorts, respectively. Based on a radiomic signature and clinical features, a nomogram was developed and showed excellent predictive ability for LN metastasis (AUC 0.84 and 0.87 in training and validation sets, respectively). Another radiomic signature was constructed to distinguish the number of metastatic LNs (less than 2 positive nodes/more than 2 positive nodes), which also showed moderate performance (AUC 0.79).ConclusionsWe developed a nomogram and a radiomic signature that can be used to identify LN metastasis and distinguish the number of metastatic LNs (less than 2 positive nodes/more than 2 positive nodes). Both nomogram and radiomic signature can be used as tools to assist clinicians in assessing LN metastasis in breast cancer patients.Key Points center dot ALNM is an important factor affecting breast cancer patients' treatment and prognosis.center dot Traditional imaging examinations have limited value for evaluating axillary LNs status.center dot We developed a radiomic nomogram based on MR imagings to predict LN metastasis.

TI  - Widespread Initiation, Reactivation, and Acceleration of Landslides in the Northern California Coast Ranges due to Extreme Rainfall
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Episodically to continuously active slow-moving landslides are driven by precipitation. Climate change, which is altering both the frequency and magnitude of precipitation worldwide, is therefore predicted to have a major impact on landslides. Here we examine the behavior of hundreds of slow-moving landslides in northern California in response to large changes in annual precipitation that occurred between 2016 and 2018. We quantify the landslide displacement using repeat-pass radar interferometry and pixel offset tracking techniques on a novel data set from the airborne NASA/JPL Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar. We found that 312 landslides were moving due to extreme rainfall during 2017, compared to 119 during 2016, which was the final year of a historic multiyear drought. However, with a return to below to average rainfall in 2018, only 146 landslides remained in motion. The increased number of landslides during 2017 was primarily accommodated by landslides that were smaller than the landslides that remained active between 2016 and 2018. Furthermore, by examining a subset of 51 landslides, we found that 49 had increased velocities during 2017 when compared to 2016. Our results show that slow-moving landslides are sensitive to large changes in annual precipitation, particularly the smaller and thinner landslides that likely experience larger basal pore-water pressure changes. Based on climate model predictions for the next century in California, which include increases in average annual precipitation and increases in the frequency of dry-to-wet extremes, we hypothesize that there will be an overall increase in landslide activity.

TI  - Analyzing Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Crop Parameters Using Sentinel-1 Backscatter Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge about heterogeneity on agricultural fields is essential for a sustainable and effective field management. This study investigates the performance of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the Sentinel-1 satellites to detect variability between and within agricultural fields in two test sites in Germany. For this purpose, the temporal profiles of the SAR backscatter in VH and VV polarization as well as their ratio VH/VV of multiple wheat and barley fields are illustrated and interpreted considering differences between acquisition settings, years, crop types and fields. Within-field variability is examined by comparing the SAR backscatter with several crop parameters measured at multiple points in 2017 and 2018. Structural changes, particularly before and after heading, as well as moisture and crop cover differences are expressed in the backscatter development. Furthermore, the crop parameters wet and dry biomass, absolute and relative vegetation water content, leaf area index (LAI) and plant height are related to SAR backscatter parameters using linear and exponential as well as multiple regression. The regression performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) and is strongly dependent on the phenological growth stage. Wheat shows R-2 values around 0.7 for VV backscatter and multiple regression and most crop parameters before heading. Single fields even reach R-2 values above 0.9 for VV backscatter and for multiple regression related to plant height with RMSE values around 10 cm. The formulation of clear rules remains challenging, as there are multiple influencing factors and uncertainties and a lack of conformity.

TI  - Potential of thermal remote sensing techniques in monitoring waterlogged area based on surface soil moisture retrieval
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper was to test the capability of thermal remote sensing in monitoring waterlogged areas in Ismailia governorate based on surface soil moisture retrieval. Three landsat satellite images 5, 7 and 8 (TM, ETM + and TIRS) were used for this purpose during three different dates (1998, 2008 and 2015). Soil moisture index (SMI) was produced based on calculated Land surface temperature (LST). Fifty five soil profiles have been dug to measure the depth of water tables of the study area. SMI Validation was carried out in 2015 using surface soil samples from the upper 5 cm in which actual moisture content was estimated. Digital change detection techniques for SMI were applied in order to monitor the change in the surface soil moisture along two time periods (1998-2008), (2008-2015). The results indicated that the spatio-temporal variations of soil moisture content are associated with soil texture, landuse/landcover, soil elevation and water table levels. Correlation between actual and retrieved soil moisture revealed a moderate correlation relationship with R-2 = 0.61. Furthermore, an increase of water table eastern the study area. Also the results illustrated the increasing of water table is a direct relation with soil moisture. In addition, an increase in the surface soil moisture (SSM) recognized in 22.06% of the study area from 1998 to 2008 while, 40.55% of the area showed an increased in the SSM from 2008 to 2015. This continuous increase in the SSM could be prone to the increasing agricultural expansion and water table levels which, led to conversion of sabkhas to water bodies and fish farms. SMI could be an effective tool in mapping waterlogged areas.

TI  - Serological evidence of Ebola virus exposure in dogs from affected communities in Liberia: A preliminary report
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Filoviruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV) cause outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers for which no FDA-approved vaccines or drugs are available. The 2014-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa infected approximately 30,000 people, killing more than 11,000 and affecting thousands more in areas still suffering from the effects of civil wars. Sierra Leone and Liberia reported EBOV cases in every county demonstrating the efficient spread of this highly contagious virus in the well-connected societies of West Africa. In communities, canines are often in contact with people while scavenging for food, which may include sickly bush animals or, as reported from the outbreak, EBOV infected human bodies and excrement. Therefore, dogs may serve as sentinel animals for seroprevalence studies of emerging infectious viruses. Further, due to their proximity to humans, they may have important One Health implications while offering specimens, which may be easier to obtain than human serum samples. Previous reports on detecting EBOV exposure in canines have been limited. Herein we describe a pilot project to detect IgG-responses directed against multiple filovirus and Lassa virus (LASV) antigens in dogs from EBOV affected communities in Liberia. We used a multiplex Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to detect dog IgG binding to recombinant filovirus antigens or LASV glycoprotein (GP) in serum from dogs that were old enough to be present during the EBOV outbreak. We identified 47 (73%) of 64 dog serum samples as potentially exposed to filoviruses and up to 100% of the dogs from some communities were found to have elevated levels of EBOV antigen-binding IgG titers. The multiplex MIA described in this study provides evidence for EBOV IgG antibodies present in dogs potentially exposed to the virus during the 2014-16 outbreak in Liberia. These data support the feasibility of canines as EBOV sentinels and provides evidence that seroprevalence studies in dogs can be conducted using suitable assays even under challenging field conditions. Further studies are warranted to collect data and to define the role canines may play in transmission or detection of emerging infectious diseases.Author summary Ebola Virus (EBOV) and its related species cause hemorrhagic fevers for which there are no FDA- approved treatments. The 2014-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa infected over 30,000 people, killing more than 11,000. This was the largest outbreak to date and Liberia was the unfortunate epicenter. In Liberia, EBOV cases were reported in every county. While preventative and therapeutic agent developments have received much attention, prophylactic measures involving Liberian communities have seen much less attention. In Liberia, dogs may warrant surveillance as they routinely interact with animals of the forest and people within communities. Despite scavenging the excrements and even bodies of infected individuals during the outbreak, dogs reportedly remained asymptomatic for EBOV. In collaboration with the University of Liberia and the Leon Quist Ledlum Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of Liberia, our team used a multiplex Luminex-based assay to detect dog antibodies (IgG) binding recombinant filovirus antigens or LASV glycoprotein in samples from animals that were present during the EBOV outbreak. We identified several communities in which 100% of dogs showed IgG responses reactive to one or more filovirus antigens. This preliminary report establishes the feasibility of conducting EBOV seroprevalence studies in resource poor outbreak sites in Africa using modern and economical serological assay techniques.

TI  - Feasibility study for the use of self-collected nasal swabs to identify pathogens among participants of a population-based surveillance system for acute respiratory infections (GrippeWeb-Plus)-Germany, 2016
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Internet-based participatory surveillance systems, such as the German GrippeWeb, monitor the frequency of acute respiratory illnesses on population level. In order to interpret syndromic information better, we devised a microbiological feasibility study (GrippeWeb-Plus) to test whether self-collection of anterior nasal swabs is operationally possible, acceptable for participants and can yield valid data. Methods We recruited 103 GrippeWeb participants (73 adults and 30 children) and provided them with a kit, instructions and a questionnaire for each sample. In the first half of 2016, participants took an anterior nasal swab and sent it to the Robert Koch Institute whenever an acute respiratory illness occurred. Reporting of illnesses through the GrippeWeb platform continued as usual. We analysed swabs for the presence of human c-myc-DNA and 22 viral and bacterial pathogens. After the study, we sent participants an evaluation questionnaire. We analysed timeliness, completeness, acceptability and validity. Results One hundred and two participants submitted 225 analysable swabs. Ninety per cent of swabs were taken within 3 days of symptom onset. Eighty-nine per cent of swabs had a corresponding reported illness in the GrippeWeb system. Ninety-nine per cent of adults and 96% of children would be willing to participate in a self-swabbing scheme for a longer period. All swabs contained c-myc-DNA. In 119 swabs, we identified any of 14 viruses but no bacteria. The positivity rate of influenza was similar to that in the German physician sentinel. Conclusion Self-collection of anterior nasal swabs proofed to be feasible, was well accepted by participants, gave valid results and was an informative adjunct to syndromic data.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of the influence and significance of different topographic and morphometric parameters of glacier catchments such as size, average slope, median elevation, and aspect upon the spatio-temporally changing characteristics of glaciers belonging to different size classes in Tista river basin of Sikkim Himalaya has been performed. The reference years of 2000 and 2018 were considered and different morphometric techniques showed recessive nature and shape change of the observed main glaciers along with some of the tributary glaciers. Pearson's correlation coefficient and Student's t test were applied to measure the correlation and statistical significance of used parameters to understand the varying morphometric and topographic conditions of the glaciers. LANDSAT TM (thematic mapper), LANDSAT 7 ETM+(enhanced thematic mapper), and LANDSAT 8 (OLI) (operational land imager) imageries and shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) and different automated and semi-automated techniques indicated overall loss of 19.78% over the years 2000 to 2018 of the glaciated area investigated and such decrease in respective years of reference was 2.06% for the year 2000 and 1.65% for the year 2018, respectively, of the total geographic area of Sikkim. TanDem-X DEM (90m) was useful in inferring glacier surface elevation change.

TI  - Retrieval of Grassland Aboveground Biomass through Inversion of the PROSAIL Model with MODIS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), an important indicator of grassland production, is crucial for evaluating livestock carrying capacity, understanding the response and feedback to climate change, and achieving sustainable development. Most existing grassland AGB estimation studies were based on empirical methods, in which field measurements are indispensable, hindering their operational use. This study proposed a novel physically-based grassland AGB retrieval method through the inversion of PROSAIL model against MCD43A4 imagery. This method relies on the basic understanding that grassland is herbaceous, and therefore AGB can be represented as the product of leaf dry matter content (Cm) and leaf area index (LAI), i.e., AGB = Cm x LAI. First, the PROSAIL model was parameterized according to the literature regarding grassland parameters retrieval, then Cm and LAI were retrieved using a lookup table (LUT) algorithm, finally, the retrieved Cm and LAI were multiplied to obtain the AGB. The method was assessed in Zoige Plateau, China. Results show that it could reproduce the reference AGB map, which is generated by upscaling the field measurements, in terms of magnitude (with RMSE and R-RMSE of 60.06 gm(-2) and 18.1%, respectively) and spatial distribution. The estimated AGB time series also agreed reasonably well with the expected temporal dynamic trends of the grassland in our study area. The greatest advantage of our method is its fully physical nature, i.e., no field measurement is needed. Our method has the potential for operational monitoring of grassland AGB at regional and even larger scales.

TI  - Impacts of the 2017 flash drought in the US Northern plains informed by satellite-based evapotranspiration and solar-induced fluorescence
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is increasing in frequency and severity, exacerbating food and water security risks in an era of continued global warming and human population growth. Here, we analyzed a severe summer drought affecting the US Northern Plains region in 2017. We examined the spatial pattern and seasonal progression of vegetation productivity and water use in the region using satellite-based estimates of field-scale (30 m) cropland evapotranspiration (ET), county level annual crop production statistics, and GOME-2 satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). The cropland ET record shows strong potential to track seasonal cropland water demands spatially, with strong correspondence to regional climate variables in the Northern Plains. The GOME-2 SIF record shows significant but limited correlations with finer scale climate variability due to the coarse sensor footprint, but captured an anomalous regional productivity decline coincident with drought related decreases in crop production and ET. The drought contributed to an overall 25% reduction in cropland ET, 6% decrease in crop production, and 11% reduction in SIF productivity over the region from April to September in 2017 relative to the longer (2008-2017) satellite record. More severely impacted agricultural areas indicated by the US Drought Monitor exceptional drought (D4) category represented 11% of the region and showed much larger anomalous ET (20%-81%) and productivity (11%-73%) declines. The regional pattern of drought impacts indicated more severe productivity and ET reductions in the north central and southern counties with extensive agriculture, and less impact in the western counties of the Northern Plains. This study provides a multiscale assessment of drought related impacts on regional productivity and ET over a crop intensive region, emphasizing the use of global satellite observations capable of informing regional to global scale water and food security assessments.

TI  - Using Sounder Data to Improve Cirrus Cloud Height Estimation from Satellite Imagers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern polar-orbiting meteorological satellites provide both imaging and sounding observations simultaneously. Most imagers, however, do not have H2O and CO2 absorption bands and therefore struggle to accurately estimate the height of optically thin cirrus clouds. Sounders provide these needed observations, but at a spatial resolution that is too coarse to resolve many important cloud structures. This paper presents a technique to merge sounder and imager observations with the goal of maintaining the details offered by the imager's high spatial resolution and the accuracy offered by the sounder's spectral information. The technique involves deriving cloud temperatures from the sounder observations, interpolating the sounder temperatures to the imager pixels, and using the sounder temperatures as an additional constraint in the imager cloud height optimal estimation approach. This technique is demonstrated using collocated VIIRS and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) observations with the impact of the sounder observations validated using coincident CALIPSO/CALIOP cloud heights These comparisons show significant improvement in the cloud heights for optically thin cirrus. The technique should be generally applicable to other imager/sounder pairs.

TI  - A Satellite-Based Climatology of Wind-Induced Surface Temperature Anomalies for the Antarctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well-known that katabatic winds can be detected as warm signatures in the surface temperature over the slopes of the Antarctic ice sheets. For appropriate synoptic forcing and/or topographic channeling, katabatic surges occur, which result in warm signatures also over adjacent ice shelves. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice surface temperature (IST) data are used to detect warm signatures over the Antarctic for the winter periods 2002-2017. In addition, high-resolution (5 km) regional climate model data is used for the years of 2002 to 2016. We present a case study and a climatology of wind-induced IST anomalies for the Ross Ice Shelf and the eastern Weddell Sea. The IST anomaly distributions show maxima around 10-15K for the slopes, but values of more than 25K are also found. Katabatic surges represent a strong climatological signal with a mean warm anomaly of more than 5K on more than 120 days per winter for the Byrd Glacier and the Nimrod Glacier on the Ross Ice Shelf. The mean anomaly for the Brunt Ice Shelf is weaker, and exceeds 5K on about 70 days per winter. Model simulations of the IST are compared to the MODIS IST, and show a very good agreement. The model data show that the near-surface stability is a better measure for the response to the wind than the IST itself.

TI  - Aircraft and Ship Velocity Determination in Sentinel-2 Multispectral Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 satellites in the Copernicus program provide high resolution multispectral images, which are recorded with temporal offsets up to 2.6 s. Moving aircrafts and ships are therefore observed at different positions due to the multispectral band offsets, from which velocities can be determined. We describe an algorithm for detecting aircrafts and ships, and determining their speed, heading, position, length, etc. Aircraft velocities are also affected by the parallax effect and jet streams, and we show how the altitude and the jet stream speed can be determined from the geometry of the aircraft and/or contrail heading. Ship speeds are more difficult to determine as wakes affect the average ship positions differently in the various multispectral bands, and more advanced corrections methods are shown to improve the velocity determination.

AB  - In this paper, we present a patch-based land use and land cover classification approach using Sentinel-2 satellite images. The Sentinel-2 satellite images are openly and freely accessible, and are provided in the earth observation program Copernicus. We present a novel dataset, based on these images that covers 13 spectral bands and is comprised of ten classes with a total of 27 000 labeled and geo-referenced images. Benchmarks are provided for this novel dataset with its spectral bands using state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks. An overall classification accuracy of 98.57% was achieved with the proposed novel dataset. The resulting classification system opens a gate toward a number of earth observation applications. We demonstrate how this classification system can be used for detecting land use and land cover changes, and how it can assist in improving geographical maps. The geo-referenced dataset EuroSAT is made publicly available at https://github.com/phelber/eurosat.

TI  - Feeling alone in your subjectivity: Introducing the State Trait Existential Isolation Model (STEIM)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychologists have devoted substantial attention to social isolation and to loneliness but only recently have psychologists begun to consider existential isolation. Existential isolation is a unique form of interpersonal isolation, related to, but distinct from loneliness and social isolation. Feeling existentially isolated is the subjective sense one is alone in one's experience, and that others cannot understand one's perspective. In the current paper, we propose a conceptual model of existential isolation and review relevant evidence. The model proposes that the experience of existential isolation can be situational, context dependent, or a trait-like pervasive sense that others do not validate one's subjective experience. The model posits acute and chronic causes of existential isolation and consequences of the state and trait forms of it. Reactions to state existential isolation produce momentary and short-term effects whereby an individual's sense of validation of their worldview is threatened and attempts are made to eliminate this feeling. In contrast, trait existential isolation leads to reduced identification with cultural sources of meaning and withdrawal from seeking rewarding relationships, which leads to more long-term consequences such as chronic need depletion and deficits in well-being. We briefly discuss potential moderators that may affect whether and when individuals experience existential isolation and possible strategies for reducing existential isolation, and recommend directions for future research.

TI  - Integration of ground survey and remote sensing derived data: Producing robust indicators of habitat extent and condition
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of suitable habitat is a key predictor of the changing status of biodiversity. Quantifying habitat availability over large spatial scales is, however, challenging. Although remote sensing techniques have high spatial coverage, there is uncertainty associated with these estimates due to errors in classification. Alternatively, the extent of habitats can be estimated from ground-based field survey. Financial and logistical constraints mean that on-the-ground surveys have much lower coverage, but they can produce much higher quality estimates of habitat extent in the areas that are surveyed. Here, we demonstrate a new combined model which uses both types of data to produce unified national estimates of the extent of four key habitats across Great Britain based on Countryside Survey and Land Cover Map. This approach considers that the true proportion of habitat per km(2) (Z(i)) is unobserved, but both ground survey and remote sensing can be used to estimate Z(i). The model allows the relationship between remote sensing data and Z(i) to be spatially biased while ground survey is assumed to be unbiased. Taking a statistical model-based approach to integrating field survey and remote sensing data allows for information on bias and precision to be captured and propagated such that estimates produced and parameters estimated are robust and interpretable. A simulation study shows that the combined model should perform best when error in the ground survey data is low. We use repeat surveys to parameterize the variance of ground survey data and demonstrate that error in this data source is small. The model produced revised national estimates of broadleaved woodland, arable land, bog, and fen, marsh and swamp extent across Britain in 2007.

TI  - Click Chemistry in the Design and Production of Hybrid Tracers
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybrid tracers containing both fluorescent and radioactive imaging labels have demonstrated clinical potential during sentinel lymph node procedures. To combine these two labels on a single targeting vector that allows tumor-targeted imaging, end-labeling strategies are often applied. For alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin-targeting hybrid tracers, providing an excellent model for evaluating tracer development strategies, end-labeling-based synthesis provides a rather cumbersome synthesis strategy. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the use of heterobifunctional cyanine dyes in a click-chemistry-based synthesis strategy for RGD-based hybrid tracers. The triazole-based hybrid tracers DTPA center dot DBCO center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA center dot BCN center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] were obtained in fewer steps than DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] and had partition coefficients of log P-(o/w) = -2.55 +/- 0.10, -1.45 +/- 0.03, and -2.67 +/- 0.12, respectively. Both tracers were chemically stable, and the brightnesses of DTPA center dot DBCO center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA center dot BCN center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] were, respectively, 23 x 10(3) and 40 x 10(3) M-1 cm(-1); lower than that of the reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)Cys-c[RGDyK] (50 x 10(3) M-1 cm(-1)).Assessment of serum protein binding revealed no statistically significant difference (44 +/- 2 and 40 +/- 2% bound for DTPA center dot DBCO center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA center dot BCN center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], respectively; 36 +/- 5% bound for DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK]; p > 0.05). DTPA center dot DBCO center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (K-D = 17.5 +/- 6.0) had a statistically significantly higher affinity than the reference compound DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c [RGDyK] (K-D = 30.3 +/- 5.7; p < 0.0001), but DTPA center dot BCN center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] had a statistically significantly lower affinity (K-D = 76.5 +/- 18.3 nM; p < 0.0001). Both [In-111] DTPA center dot DBCO center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [In-111]DTPA center dot BCN center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] enabled in vivo visualization of the 4T1 tumor via fluorescence and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.Biodistribution data (% ID/g) revealed a significant increase in nonspecific uptake in the kidney, liver, and muscle for both [In-111] DTPA center dot DBCO center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [In-111]DTPA center dot BCN center dot N-3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]. As a result of the higher background activity, the tumor-to-background ratio of the click-labeled RGD analogues was twofold lower compared to the end-labeled reference compound. The use of click chemistry labeling did not yield a pronounced negative effect on serum protein binding, in vitro stability, and receptor affinity; and tumors could still be visualized using SPECT and fluorescence imaging. However, quantitative in vivo biodistribution data suggest that the triazole and strained cyclooctyne moieties associated with this type of click chemistry negatively influence the pharmacokinetics of RGD peptides. Nevertheless, the design might still hold promise for other targets/targeting moieties.

TI  - Optimal imaging time for Tc-99m phytate lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with breast cancer
T2  - TZU CHI MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling has become a standard practice in managing early-stage breast cancer. Lymphoscintigraphy is one of the major methods used. The radioactive tracer used in Taiwan is Tc-99m phytate. However, this agent is not commonly used around the world and the optimal imaging time has not been studied. Thus, we investigated the optimal imaging time of Tc-99m phytate lymphoscintigraphy for SLN mapping in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed SLN Tc-99m phytate lymphoscintigraphies in 135 patients with breast cancer between August 2013 and November 2017. The time for the first SLN to be visualized after radiotracer injection was recorded to determine the optimal imaging time. If no SLN was identified on imaging, the scan was continued to 60 min. We also recorded the presurgical technical and clinical factors to analyze the risk factors for nonvisualization of SLN. Each patient's postoperative axillary lymph node status was also recorded. Results: Axillary SLNs were identified on imaging in 94.8% of the patients. All first SLNs presented within 30 min. In 6 of 7 patients with negative imaging, SLNs were identified during surgery using either blue dye or a hand-held gamma probe. Nonvisualization of SLNs on lymphoscintigraphy was significantly associated with a lower injection dose (1.0 mCi vs. 2.0 mCi), 4-injection protocol (compared to 2-injection), and injection around an outer upper quadrant tumor. In addition, patients with axillary lymph node metastasis had a higher percentage of SLN image mapping failure, with a marginally significant difference. Conclusion: Based on our study, 30 min after Tc-99m phytate injection is the optimal time for lymphoscintigraphy and delayed imaging beyond 30 min is not necessary. In addition, a lower injection dose, the 4-injection method, and an injection near the outer upper quadrant tumor should be avoided to minimize nonvisualization of SLNs.

TI  - Source or Sink? A comparison of Landfire- and FIA-based estimates of change in aboveground live tree carbon in California's forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a central role in addressing climate change, and accurate estimates of forest carbon are critical for the development of actions that reduce emissions from forests and that maximize sequestration by forests. Methodological challenges persist regarding how best to estimate forest carbon stocks and flux at regulatory-relevant scales. Using California, USA as a case study, we compare two approaches to stock-difference forest carbon estimation for aboveground live trees: one based on ground inventories and one on land cover classification of remotely-sensed data. Previous work using ground inventory data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) showed net aboveground carbon (AGC) sequestration by live trees in California forests, while estimates using land cover classification from the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (Landfire) showed net reductions in live tree AGC over a similar time period. We examined the discrepancy by re-analyzing the FIA inventory data through the lens of a category-change analysis based on Landfire. This analysis showed more than 50% of the live tree AGC in fewer than 4% of Landfire-equivalent categories and that the overwhelming majority (>80%) of forest area did not change height category between measurement periods. Despite the lack of categorical change, the majority of FIA plots increased in both 95th percentile tree height and in live tree AGC. These findings suggest that an approach based on observing categorical changes risks undercounting AGC sequestration resulting from growth and thus overstating the relative importance of AGC reductions that result from disturbances. This would bias AGC flux estimates downward, leading us to validate the conclusion that live trees in California were a net sink of aboveground carbon in the decade ending in 2016. Our findings suggest an inventory-based or hybrid approach is preferable to methods that depend on categorical bins for estimating AGC in disturbance-prone forest ecosystems.

TI  - CoSpace: Common Subspace Learning From Hyperspectral-Multispectral Correspondences
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With a large amount of open satellite multispectral (MS) imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8), considerable attention has been paid to global MS land cover classification. However, its limited spectral information hinders further improving the classification performance. Hyperspectral imaging enables discrimination between spectrally similar classes but its swath width from space is narrow compared to MS ones. To achieve accurate land cover classification over a large coverage, we propose a cross-modality feature learning framework, called common subspace learning (CoSpace), by jointly considering subspace learning and supervised classification. By locally aligning the manifold structure of the two modalities, CoSpace linearly learns a shared latent subspace from hyperspectral-MS (HS-MS) correspondences. The MS out-of-samples can be then projected into the subspace, which are expected to take advantages of rich spectral information of the corresponding hyperspectral data used for learning, and thus leads to a better classification. Extensive experiments on two simulated HS-MS data sets (University of Houston and Chikusei), where HS-MS data sets have tradeoffs between coverage and spectral resolution, are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - The Synod on Young People, Missionary Discipleship, and the Decolonial Option
T2  - INTERNATIONAL BULLETIN OF MISSION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pope Francis has emphasized the importance of embracing the universal call to be "missionary disciples." In calling for the 2018 Synod of Bishops on the theme of young people, he highlighted the need for church leaders to renew their understanding of and approach to young people as they discern how to embrace their call to be missionary disciples. The final document of the synod reveals that many church leaders still do not understand the pope's vision or the reality of young adults. To overcome this interpretative bias, church leaders must reconstitute their worldview and embrace the decolonial option.

TI  - Cryptosporidium infection in rural gambian children: Epidemiology and risk factors
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cryptosporidium is a major pathogen associated with diarrheal disease in young children. We studied Cryptosporidium diarrhea in children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in rural Gambia.Methods We recruited children <5 years of age with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) for 3 years (2008-2010), and children with either MSD or less severe diarrhea (LSD) for one year (November 2011-November 2012) at sentinel health centers. One or more randomly selected controls were matched to each case. Stool samples were tested to identify Cryptosporidium by immunoassay. A subset of randomly selected case-controls pairs were tested for Cryptosporidium species. We investigated the epidemiology of, and evaluated possible risk factors for, Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea.Results We enrolled 1938 cases (1381 MSD, 557 LSD) and 2969 matched controls; 231/1929 (12.0%) of diarrhea cases and 141/2962 (4.8%) of controls were positive for Cryptosporidium. Most Cryptosporidium diarrhea cases (85.7%, 198/231) were aged 6-23 months, and most (81.4%, 188/231) occurred during the rainy season. Cryptosporidium hominis (C. hominis) was the predominant (82.6%) species. We found associations between increased risk of Cryptosporidium-positive MSD or LSD, or both, with consumption of stored drinking water and certain animals living in the compound-cow, cat (MSD only) and rodents (LSD only). Larger households, fowl living in the compound, and the presence of Giardia infection were associated with decreased risk of Cryptosporidium MSD and LSD.Conclusion Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea is prevalent in this setting, especially at 6-23 months of age. The preponderance of Cryptosporidium infection in the rainy season and increased risk of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea with consumption of stored drinking water suggest water-borne transmission. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of animals and contamination of stored drinking water in Cryptosporidium transmission.Author summary Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite, is one of the most common diarrheal pathogens in young children living in developing countries. We describe the prevalence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium diarrhea in under-five children in The Gambia using data from the Global Enteric Study (GEMS), conducted in seven developing countries in Asia and Africa (2008-2012). We enrolled 1938 diarrhea cases and 2969 matched controls. We found that 12.0% of diarrhea cases and 4.8% controls were positive for Cryptosporidium. Most (85.7%) Cryptosporidium diarrhea cases were aged 6-23 months, and most (81.4%) occurred during the rainy season. Cryptosporidium hominis was the predominant species (82.6%). We found that consumption of stored drinking water and animals (cow, cat, rodents) living in the compound are potential risk factors for Cryptosporidium diarrhea. Improved drinking water storage may reduce the burden of Cryptosporidium diarrhea in a resource poor hygienic and sanitation setting.

TI  - Sampling Density in Regional Exploration and Environmental Geochemical Studies: A Review
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - A variety of factors contribute to the proper and efficient evaluation of geochemical programs including sampling medium, sample size and sample fraction, sampling density, digestion procedure, and analytical techniques. Among the aforementioned factors, sampling density is of great importance, affecting project ability to detect anomalous sites, which are either economically viable or environmentally hazardous. It is quite critical to have a sufficient number of samples to delineate geochemical anomalies or baselines and to reveal the relative variations in elemental concentrations in a study area. The resolution of the subsequent maps obtained by sampling greatly depends on sampling density. While a large number of samples may generate redundant data, a small number of samples smooth out the patterns and may completely miss anomalies. This review provides a platform for applied geochemists who desire to design a sampling scheme for a regional geochemical program and do not have the financial resources to perform an orientation survey, which will give them the necessary information for designing, according to project objectives, a cost-effective regional geochemical survey for their study area. It is advisable to integrate during the desktop study all available information, such as geological, structural, geophysical, remote sensing data and topographical data by using different data fusion algorithms to arrive at a sampling density fit-for-purpose of the target area. This in turn facilitates an effective spatial positioning of sample locations. Quantitative analyses of the efficiency of different sampling densities for delineating geochemical patterns have not been well documented, warranting more attention and research.

M3  - Article
AB  - There was a case of 57-year-old female who was done the natural orifices transvaginal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease. However, her biopsy result was Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and she was incidentally diagnosed as endometrial cancer. She was uneventful apart from that finding. She underwent the sentinel pelvic lymph node dissection with indocyanine green-guided NOTES approach for complete staging. This technique may be helpful to maximize the complete staging in early endometrial cancer as well as it can minimize the morbidity-related lymphadenectomy. In conclusion, in spite of a new technique for NOTEs, it can be safe and cost-effective for patients.

TI  - Satellite-based high-resolution mapping of ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over East China using a spatiotemporal regression kriging model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical modeling using ground-based PM2.5 observations and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data is a promising means of obtaining spatially and temporally continuous PM2.5 estimations to assess population exposure to PM2.5. However, the vast amount of AOD data that is missing due to retrieval incapability above bright reflecting surfaces such as cloud/snow cover and urban areas challenge this application. Furthermore, most previous studies cannot directly account for the spatiotemporal autocorrelations in PM2.5 distribution, impacting the associated estimation accuracy. In this study, fixed rank smoothing was adopted to fill the data gaps in a semifinished 3 km AOD dataset, which was a combination of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 3 km Dark Target AOD data and MODIS 10 km Deep Blue AOD data from the Terra and Aqua satellites. By matching the gap-filled 3 km AOD data, ground-based PM2.5 observations, and auxiliary variable data, sufficient samples were screened to develop a spatiotemporal regression kriging (STRK) model for PM2.5 estimation. The STRK model achieved notable performance in a cross-validation experiment, with a R square of 0.87 and root-mean-square error of 16.55 mu g/m(3) when applied to estimate daily ground-level PM(2.5 )concentrations over East China from March 1,2015 to February 29,2016. Using the STRK model, daily PM2.5 concentrations with full spatial coverage at a resolution of 3 km were generated. The PM2.5 distribution pattern over East China can be identified at a relatively fine spatiotemporal scale. Thus, the STRK model with gap-filled high-resolution AOD data can provide reliable full-coverage PM2.5 estimations over large areas for long-term exposure assessment in epidemiological studies.

TI  - Directional variation in surface emissivity inferred from the MYD21 product and its influence on estimated surface upwelling longwave radiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface emissivity (LSE) in the MYD21 product contains the effects of viewing zenith angle. The influence of the angular variation of LSE on the surface upwelling longwave radiation (SULR) estimation is still unexplored at the satellite scale. We performed statistical analyses of MYD21 emissivity retrievals over different land surface types for three longwave bands centred around 8.55 pm (Band 29), 11 mu m (Band 31) and 12 pm (Band 32), respectively. A look-up table was generated to describe the angular variations for both single-band and broadband emissivities. The results showed that the angular variation of directional emissivity in Band 29 could reach up to 0.03, but was < 0.01 for Bands 31 and 32. The angular variation in broadband emissivity was intermediate to that for individual bands. In all cases, the directional emissivity was greatest and symmetric around nadir. By integrating the directional broadband emissivity, the influence of angular variation of the LSE on estimated SULR was quantified using simulation and measurements at seven stations from the US surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD). The difference between the directional and integrated hemispheric broadband emissivity was within 0.01. As a result, the influence of angular variation of LSE on the SULR estimation was modest. For the SURFRAD stations, the differences of root-mean-square error (RMSE) before and after considering the angular variation of LSE were generally < 1 W m(-2). We conclude that the angular variation of broadband emissivity is not pronounced because of the small linear weight for Band 29 in the calculation of broadband emissivity. Ignoring the anisotropy of emissivity does not introduce large errors in SULR estimation generally.

TI  - Human-induced changes of surface albedo in Northern China from 1992-2012
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is a key radiative forcing factor in Earth radiation budget, and its variation is highly related to land surface processes, such as land cover change. This study aimed to identify the contribution of human induced albedo to regional land surface albedo change by analyzing the relationship between albedo and land cover change in northern China from 1992 to 2012. We first employed the time series decomposition method (TSDM) to decompose the satellite-based albedo to three components: seasonal cycle, trend, and residual information. We then analyzed the regional albedo characters over different land cover types and their corresponding variations induced by land cover conversion. The multi-year averaged albedo in northern China was 0.2285 +/- 0.0646. The albedo over changed and unchanged area was 0.2435 +/- 0.0840 and 0.2276 +/- 0.0633, respectively. The contribution of human-induced albedo change to overall changes reached about 86%, which was mainly due to cultivation and urbanization. Trend analysis indicated that the albedo slightly increased in northern China, which may decrease regional solar radiation absorption. Fractional increases in croplands showed a positive correlation with albedo variation (R-2 = 0.51). Human-induced albedo change would cause negative radiative forcing (-0.705 W/m(2)) and thus further promote cooling effects in northern China.

TI  - A Full-Coverage Daily Average PM<sub>2.5</sub> Retrieval Method with Two-Stage IVW Fused MODIS C6 AOD and Two-Stage GAM Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current PM2.5 retrieval maps have many missing values, which seriously hinders their performance in real applications. This paper presents a framework to map full-coverage daily average PM2.5 concentrations from MODIS C6 aerosol optical depth (AOD) products and fill missing pixels in both the AOD and PM2.5 maps. First, a two-stage inversed variance weights (IVW) algorithm was adopted to fuse the MODIS C6 Terra and Aqua AOD products, which fills missing data in MODIS standard AOD data and obtains a high coverage daily average. After that, using the fused MODIS daily average AOD and ground-level PM2.5 in all grid cells, a two-stage generalized additive model (GAM) was implemented to obtain the full-coverage PM2.5 concentrations. Experiments on the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in 2013-2016 were carefully designed to validate the performance of our proposed framework. The results show that the two-stage IVW could not only improve the spatial coverage of MODIS AOD against the original standard product by 230%, but could also keep its data accuracy. When compared with the ground-level measurements, the two-stage GAM can obtain accurate PM2.5 concentration estimates (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 19.177 mu g/m(3), and RPE = 28.9%). Moreover, our method performs better than the inverse distance weighted method and kriging methods in mapping full-coverage daily PM2.5 concentrations. Therefore, the proposed framework provides a good methodology for retrieving full-coverage daily average PM2.5 concentrations from MODIS standard AOD products.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of D3 Lymph Node for Survival in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of D3 lymph node (TSLN) for the survival of patients with colorectal cancer.Methods: A total of 156 patients with R0 resected colorectal cancer were selected from 2011 to 2015 to carry out a retrospective study. The survival rate according to the groups of positive lymph node number (N: 1-3, N2: 4-6, N3: >= 7) and TSLN (TSLN [-], TSLN [+]) was analyzed. The influences of covariates on the 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) were determined by the Cox proportional risk model of backward stepwise analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to draw survival curves between and within groups.Results: During the median follow-up period (44.0 months), the 5-year DFS rate and OS rate were 45.0% and 46.0%, respectively. Survival analysis of the TSLN group showed that the 5-year OS rate and 5-year DFS rate in the TSLN (+) group (20.0 and 16.2%, respectively) were significantly lower than those in the TSLN (-) group (68.3 and 51.6%, respectively) (P < 0.001). The 5-year OS rate and DFS rate of the TSLN (+) and TSLN (-) subgroups in the N1 group were 16.7%, 33.3%, 56.7%, and 55.7%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that positive lymph node, TSLN, and Pathological T stage were independent prognostic factors of DFS and OS for 5 years. Patients in the TSLN (+) group had a poorer prognosis.Conclusions: TSLN metastasis is an independent factor influencing the prognosis of patients, and patients with TSLN (+) have a poor prognosis. As an independent prognostic factor, this factor should be considered when evaluating the prognosis of patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Decoupling the effects of vegetation dynamics and climate variability on watershed hydrological characteristics on a monthly scale from subtropical China
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological characteristics are expected to be affected by climate variability and vegetation dynamics which are interconnected and coupled in most cases. Few studies have decoupled the effects of vegetation dynamics and climate variability on hydrological characteristics, a process that benefit both water resources management and agricultural water allocation. In this study, we used partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to decouple the effects of climate variability and vegetation on the temporal variations in hydrological characteristics on a monthly scale in the Upper Du watershed (8973 km(2)) in subtropical China. Monthly hydrometeorological and vegetation cover data were collected from 2000 to 2010. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived vegetation indices were used to represent the vegetation status of the watershed. The results showed that vegetation dynamics and climate variability account for up to 67% of the temporal variation in runoff, whereas the combined effects of vegetation, climate and runoff explain 62% of the variation in sediment. Climate variability both directly affects monthly hydrological characteristics and indirectly affects these characteristics through its effects on vegetation. Vegetation is negatively correlated with both runoff and sediment, and the net effect of vegetation on the sediment load (total effect = -0.20) is greater than its effect on runoff (total effect = -0.12). Our results indicate that the direct effect of vegetation on sediment (direct effect = -0.09) is smaller than the indirect effect (indirect effect = -0.11) of vegetation on sediment through its influence on runoff; thus, vegetation reduces both the sediment concentration and the sediment load mainly by reducing runoff. Compared to conventional multivariate statistical methodologies, PLS-SEM provides additional valuable information, including the direct and indirect impacts of climatic factors and vegetation on hydrological characteristics.

AB  - This paper illustrates a fusion approach to jointly exploit Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data to detect urban areas. The proposed procedure is designed to automatically and effectively exploit the specific characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral data, so that it can be safely applied to different urban environments with satisfying results. To this aim, it starts from two previously developed algorithms for urban extent extraction designed for multispectral or SAR spaceborne data. They are first adapted to use S1 and S2 datasets, and then coupled to a novel procedure that merges the two processing chains with the goal to exploit the spectral properties of man-made materials as well as the double bounce backscatter effect that is common in built-up environments. Experimental results in urban areas all around the world show that the proposed approach is successful at combining S1 and S2 information by reducing the errors of the two original techniques.

TI  - The potential contribution to long wavelength magnetic anomalies from the lithospheric mantle
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-wavelength magnetic anomalies (LWMA) are broad scale variations of the magnetic field that are usually observed at high altitudes with amplitudes ranging up to about 20 nT. The source of these anomalies has typically been assumed to reside within the crust with negligible contributions from the lithospheric mantle. Recent work on the magnetization of mantle xenoliths suggests a possible lithospheric mantle contribution to LWMA, depending on tectonic setting and local geotherm. Here, we investigate the potential contribution of the lithospheric mantle to LWMA across two contrasting lithospheric geotherms: cratons and hotspots. To constrain the range of possible mantle contributions to satellite-observable LWMA in these settings, we develop a Monte Carlo suite of forward models of magnetic anomalies patterned after the mantle portions of the Siberian craton, the Hawaii hotspot, and the French Massif Central plume. The models incorporate the current geotherms, the pressure dependence of the Curie temperature of magnetite, and the statistical distributions of rock magnetic data from mantle xenoliths in the specific regions. The Siberian craton shows the highest potential contribution of the mantle to LWMA with amplitudes of a few nT over wavelengths scaling to the long-axis of the craton. The Hawaii hotspot region displays a potential contribution from the lithospheric mantle to satellite-measured magnetic anomalies on the order of 1 nT, while the Massif Central plume regions shows an insignificant contribution to satellite magnetic anomalies from lithospheric mantle. When compared with observed lithospheric total field anomalies derived from Swarm satellite data, the results show that the lithospheric mantle may contribute a few tens of percent to LWMA observed at satellite altitudes in specific regions depending on the average remanent magnetization in mantle minerals, the thickness of magnetized mantle (which depends on the geotherm), and the spatial extent of the region under consideration.

AB  - Cutaneous melanoma (CM) causes more deaths than any other skin tumor, and incidence and mortality rates have risen in recent years, especially in patients of advanced age. There are differences in the biological behavior of CM tumors in the elderly as well as differential management of the disease, evidently influenced by such factors as limited life expectancy, the high incidence of concomitant conditions in older patients, and issues of quality of life unrelated to CM itself. We review relevant current literature on the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, and immunology of CM as well as research on the clinical features, prevention, and management of these tumors in the elderly.

TI  - Travel Cost Savings and Practicality for Low-Vision Telerehabilitation
T2  - TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Veterans with low vision who live in rural communities have limited access to low-vision rehabilitation services, unless they are able to travel several miles to a specialty low-vision clinic. A low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a thorough assessment of patient's functional vision. Following each low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a low-vision telerehabilitation initial assessment with a blind rehabilitation therapist. Our objective was to estimate the acceptance and practicality of low-vision telerehabilitation and investigate the travel cost and time savings. Methods: Utilizing Google Maps (TM), round-trip travel mileage and travel time can be estimated between the veteran's home and the Buffalo Veterans Affairs (VA) and compared with the round-trip mileage and travel time between the veteran's home and local community-based outpatient center (CBOC) or local VA for low-vision telerehabilitation services. The difference is the savings in travel miles and time. Cost saving can be calculated by multiplying difference in travel miles by cost per mile. Results: Veterans who chose not to schedule face-to-face low-vision rehabilitation at the Buffalo VA due to an average round-trip travel distance of 151 miles scheduled a low-vision telerehabilitation at a local CBOC or local VA with an average round-trip travel distance of 29 miles. Adding low-vision telerehabilitation services from fiscal year (FY) 13 to FY 17 resulted in a 24% increase in low-vision patient care. The median saving of travel miles for rural veterans was 122 miles per veteran, and the median saving of travel time was 2.09 h per veteran. Overall, the median saving of the travel cost was $65.29 per veteran. Conclusions: This study shows and supports low-vision telerehabilitation as an accepted, practical, time-saving, and cost-saving alternative option to traditional face-to-face consultations with a low-vision optometrist and blind rehabilitation therapist.

TI  - The Use of Satellite Information (MODIS/Aqua) for Phenological and Classification Analysis of Plant Communities
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices derived from remote sensing measurements are commonly used to describe and monitor vegetation. However, the same plant community can have a di ff erent NDVI (normalized di ff erence vegetation index) depending on weather conditions, and this complicates classification of plant communities. The present study develops methods of classifying the types of plant communities based on long- term NDVI data (MODIS /Aqua). The number of variables is reduced by introducing two integrated parameters of the NDVI seasonal series, facilitating classification of the meadow, steppe, and forest plant communities in Siberia using linear discriminant analysis. The quality of classification conducted by using the markers characterizing NDVI dynamics during 2003- 2017 varies between 94% (forest and steppe) and 68% (meadow and forest). In addition to determining phenological markers, canonical correlations have been calculated between the time series of the proposed markers and the time series of monthly average air temperatures. Based on this, each pixel with a definite plant composition can be characterized by only four values of canonical correlation coe ffi cients over the entire period analyzed. By using canonical correlations between NDVI and weather parameters and employing linear discriminant analysis, one can obtain a highly accurate classification of the study plant communities.

TI  - The Andean Condor as bird, authority, and devil: an empirical assessment of the biocultural keystone species concept in the high Andes of Chile
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biocultural keystone species have been suggested for different societies, but there has been little empirical evaluation of their role in the face of rapid socio-environmental changes. The Aymara people of northern Chile have experienced historical and contemporary processes that have modified their culture and relationship with nature. The Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) has previously been proposed as a biocultural keystone species for traditional Andean societies. We evaluate the validity of this assertion in the light of the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of today's Aymara from the high Andes of northern Chile. A three-month ethnographic study was conducted in the Putre municipal district, including semistructured interviews, focus groups, and surveys of the district's Aymara inhabitants. Our results indicate a nonarticulated set of information that can be identified as knowledge about the Andean Condor but is patchy and resembles relics, rather than an ongoing body of TEK that includes daily practices, social institutions, and a worldview shaped by the putative biocultural keystone species. Chileanization, migration, and the integration of evangelical religions into the area's Catholic-Andean setting were identified as three processes that have deeply affected the transmission of TEK and the Aymara-condor relationship, with new generations living in socio-environmental contexts different from those of their ancestors. We suggest that, today, the condor can hardly be considered a biocultural keystone species for the Aymara people of northern Chile. Our study highlights that the role of putative biocultural keystone species is dependent on the vagaries of historical and contemporary socio-environmental processes occurring in the Andes and elsewhere.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - In this study, using in situ measurements at 17 buoy stations off the Korean Peninsula, C-band model (CMOD) functions for Sentinel-1A/B IW mode synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were validated. In total, 395 Sentinel-1A/B IW mode dual-vertical polarized images were used for collocation with in situ measurements from May 1, 2015, to September 30, 2017, and 807 matchup points were obtained. Prior to the validation, preprocessing such as speckle noise reduction and ship and land masking was completed. The in situ wind speeds were converted to a 10-m neutral wind considering atmospheric stability. High-resolution wind speeds were estimated by using the CMOD functions such as CMOD4, CMOD_IFR2, CMOD5, CMOD5.N, and CMOD5.Na. The root-mean-square errors of eachmodel were less than approximately 1.8m.s(-1) (1.83, 1.82, 1.69, 1.68, and 1.65m.s(-1), respectively). The biases of all models were higher in the western coastal region than those in the eastern coastal region. The results showed the advantages and disadvantages of each model in the estimation of wind speeds in the coastal region around the Korean Peninsula as proposed in a concept of combined errors. The wind speeds derived from the SAR data also presented a tendency for water depth to be overestimated over shallow bathymetry and to be underestimated at high wind speeds. In addition, this study assessed potential sources of wind speed errors such as the effects originating from wind direction input, different platforms of Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B and their calibration, and from radar interference or regional oceanic characteristic environments.

TI  - Ground-Based MAX-DOAS Observations of CHOCHO and HCHO in Beijing and Baoding, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glyoxal (CHOCHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) trace gases were successfully retrieved from a multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) system in Beijing (39.95 degrees N, 116.32 degrees E) and Baoding (39.15 degrees N, 115.40 degrees E), China. The measurements of these trace gases span the period from May 2017 to April 2018. Higher levels of trace gases were observed in Beijing most likely due to increased transport and industrial activities compared to Baoding. Different time scales were analyzed from seasonal to daily levels. Seasonal variation categorized by wintertime maximum and summertime minimum was observed for CHOCHO, while for HCHO maximum values were recorded during summer at both observation points. Variations in the diurnal cycle of trace gases were examined. The results are consistent with strong links to photo-oxidations of VOCs for HCHO production, whereas the CHOCHO diurnal variation can be related to anthropogenic effects in the evening. Weekends didn't have any significant effect on both HCHO and CHOCHO. We investigated the temperature dependency of HCHO and CHOCHO. HCHO shows positive correlation with air temperature, which strengthened the argument that HCHO production is linked to photo-oxidation of VOCs. CHOCHO is anti-correlated with air temperature. This suggests that photolysis is a major sink for CHOCHO in Beijing and Baoding. We also investigated the relationship between CHOCHO and HCHO VCDs with enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data obtained from MODIS, which represents a direct relation with biogenic emissions. The positive correlations were observed among monthly mean HCHO VCDs and monthly mean EVI at both monitoring stations. The strong correlation of HCHO with EVI found, suggests that oxidation of isoprene and HCHO production is strongly related, while negative correlation was observed among CHOCHO VCDs and EVI.

TI  - Is aquaculture abandonment a threat to sustainable coastal resource use? - A case study of Andhra Pradesh, India, with options for reuse
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of important ecosystems and land used for other purposes to aquaculture and abandonment after short-term use threatens coastal resources. The spatial extent and location of abandoned aquaculture farms were explored in this study based on land use change detection and trajectories in the Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh, India, as a case study using the Geographic Information System (GIS), satellite data, spatial analysis techniques, and field verification. Satellite image interpretation keys for abandoned aquaculture were identified. The brackishwater aquaculture area increased by 387% from 1990 to 2000, then decreased by 19% in 2006, and further decreased by 47% in 2009. As a result, 6648 ha of shrimp farms were abandoned in 2006. This number further increased to 13,493 ha in 2009. The introduction of the Penaeus vannamei culture in 2009 has increased the shrimp farm growth by 35% in 2015 and revived 11% of the unused aquaculture farms. Considering the rise and fall of the extent of shrimp farms, overall 30.6% of the shrimp farms were abandoned in 2015. Markov chain analysis indicates that the abandoned aquaculture area will be 11,512 ha in 2021 and that the conversion of agricultural land into shrimp farms continues. The soil characteristics of abandoned shrimp ponds and the water quality of source waterbodies near unused areas indicate the potential of the reuse for shrimp farming based on suitable management practices. Identification of the prior land use of abandoned shrimp farms such as mangroves, agricultural land, has given the options for reuse. Efforts need to be made to revive abandoned shrimp farms; otherwise, they may lead to unsustainable resource use in major shrimp-growing countries worldwide.

TI  - Improving the Transferability of Suspended Solid Estimation in Wetland and Deltaic Waters with an Empirical Hyperspectral Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The deposition of suspended sediment is an important process that helps wetlands accrete surface material and maintain elevation in the face of sea level rise. Optical remote sensing is often employed to map total suspended solids (TSS), though algorithms typically have limited transferability in space and time due to variability in water constituent compositions, mixtures, and inherent optical properties. This study used in situ spectral reflectances and their first derivatives to compare empirical algorithms for estimating TSS using hyperspectral and multispectral data. These algorithms were applied to imagery collected by NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) over coastal Louisiana, USA, and validated with a multiyear in situ dataset. The best performing models were then applied to independent spectroscopic data collected in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada, and the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary, USA, to assess their robustness and transferability. A derivative-based partial least squares regression (PLSR) model applied to simulated AVIRIS-NG data showed the most accurate TSS retrievals (R-2 = 0.83) in these contrasting deltaic environments. These results highlight the potential for a more broadly applicable generalized algorithm employing imaging spectroscopy for estimating suspended solids.

TI  - Estimating Live Fuel Moisture Using SMAP L-Band Radiometer Soil Moisture for Southern California, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture (LFM) is a field-measured indicator of vegetation water content and a crucial observation of vegetation flammability. This study presents a new multi-variant regression model to estimate LFM in the Mediterranean ecosystem of Southern California, USA, using the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band radiometer soil moisture (SMAP SM) from April 2015 to December 2018 over 12 chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) LFM sites. The two-month lag between SMAP SM and LFM was utilized either as steps to synchronize the SMAP SM to the LFM series or as the leading time window to calculate the accumulative SMAP SM. Cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs) were also employed to address the impact from heat. Models were constructed separately for the green-up and brown-down periods. An inverse exponential weight function was applied in the calculation of accumulative SMAP SM to address the different contribution to the LFM between the earlier and present SMAP SM. The model using the weighted accumulative SMAP SM and CGDDs yielded the best results and outperformed the reference model using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Visible Atmospherically Resistance Index. Our study provides a new way to empirically estimate the LFM in chaparral areas and extends the application of SMAP SM in the study of wildfire risk.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the prevalence, ocular characteristics, and associated risk factors of moderate to high hyperopia in early childhood.Design: Pooled analysis of individual participant data from population-based studies.Participants: Six-to 72-month-old multiethnic children who participated in 4 population-based studies of pediatric eye diseases.Methods: The pooled studies conducted comparable parental interviews and ocular examinations including cycloplegic autorefraction. Presence of hyperopia was defined based on cycloplegic refractive error in the worse eye. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association of potential risk factors with hyperopia risk.Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence and odds ratios of moderate to high hyperopia (>= 4.0 diopters [D]).Results: Cycloplegic refraction was completed in 15 051 children 6 to 72 months of age. Among these children, the overall prevalence of moderate to high hyperopia (>= 4.0 D) in the worse eye was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.9%-3.5%), accounting for 15.6% of all hyperopia (>= 2.0 D). Among children with moderate to high hyperopia, both eyes were affected in 64.4%, 28.9% showed spherical anisometropia of 1.0 D or more, and 19.5% showed astigmatism of 1.5 D or more. Among 36- to 72-month-old children with moderate to high hyperopia, 17.6% wore glasses. Prevalence of moderate to high hyperopia was slightly less in 12- to 23-month-old children and was relatively stable in children 24 months of age and older. Non-Hispanic and Hispanic white race and ethnicity, family history of strabismus, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and being a participant in the United States studies were associated with a higher risk of moderate to high hyperopia (P < 0.05).Conclusions: By assembling similarly designed studies, our consortium provided robust estimates of the prevalence of moderate to high hyperopia in the general population and showed that in 6-to 72-month-old children, moderate to high hyperopia is not uncommon and its prevalence does not decrease with age. Risk factors for moderate to high hyperopia differ from those for low to moderate hyperopia (2.0-< 4.0 D) in preschool children, with family history of strabismus and maternal smoking during pregnancy more strongly associated with moderate to high hyperopia than low to moderate hyperopia.

TI  - Using Multisource Satellite Data to Assess Recent Snow-Cover Variability and Uncertainty in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a critical component in the water cycle and regional climate of East Asia. Fractional snow cover (FSC) derived from five satellite sources [the three satellites comprising the multisensor synergy of FengYun-3 (FY-3A/B/C), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS)] were intercompared over the QTP to examine uncertainties in mean snow cover and interannual variability over the last decade. A four-step cloud removal procedure was developed for MODIS and FY-3 data, which effectively reduced the cloud percentage from about 40% to 2%-3% with an error of about 2% estimated by a random sampling method. Compared to in situ snow-depth observations, the cloud-removed FY-3B data have an annual classification accuracy of about 94% for both 0.04 degrees and 0.01 degrees resolutions, which is higher than other datasets and is recommended for use in QTP studies. Among the five datasets analyzed, IMS has the largest snow extent (22% higher than MODIS) and the highest FSC (4.7% higher than MODIS), while the morning-overpass MODIS and FY-3A/C FSC are similar and are around 5% higher than the afternoon-overpass FY-3B FSC. Contrary to MODIS, IMS shows increasing variability in snow cover and snow duration over the last decade (2006-17). Differences in variabilities of FSC and snow duration between products are greater at 5-6 km than lower elevations, with seasonal snow-cover change showing the largest uncertainty in snowmelt date.

TI  - A new station-enabled multi-sensor integrated index for drought monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are frequently incorporated into drought indices used widely by research and management communities to assess and diagnose current and historic drought events. The integrated drought indices combine multiple indicators and reflect drought conditions from a range of perspectives (i.e., hydrological, agricultural, meteorological). However, the success of most remote sensing based drought indices is constrained by geographic regions since their performance strongly depends on environmental factors such as land cover type, temperature, and soil moisture. To address this limitation, we propose a framework for a new integrated drought index that performs well across diverse climate regions. Our framework uses a geographically weighted regression model and principal component analysis to composite a range of vegetation and meteorological indices derived from multiple remote sensing platforms and in-situ drought indices developed from meteorological station data. Our new index, which we call the station-enabled Geographically Independent Integrated Drought Index (GIIDI_station), compared favorably with other common drought indices such as Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Using Pearson correlation analyses between remote sensing and in-situ drought indices during the growing season (April to October) from 2002 to 2011, we show that GlIDi_station had the best correlations with in-situ drought indices. Across the entire study region of the continental United States, the performance of GIIDI_station was not affected by common environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, land cover and soil conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that GlIDLstation has considerable potential to improve our ability of monitoring drought at regional scales, provided local meteorological station data are available.

TI  - Smallholder maize area and yield mapping at national scales with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurements of maize yields at field or subfield scales are useful for guiding agronomic practices and investments and policies for improving food security. Data on smallholder maize systems are currently sparse, but satellite remote sensing offers promise for accelerating learning about these systems. Here we document the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build "wall-to-wall" 10 m resolution maps of (i) cropland presence, (ii) maize presence, and (iii) maize yields for the main 2017 maize season in Kenya and Tanzania. Mapping these outcomes at this scale is extremely challenging because of very heterogeneous landscapes, lack of cloud-free satellite imagery, and the low quantity of quality ground-based data in these regions.First, we computed seasonal median composites of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 optical reflectance measures for each pixel in the region, and used them to build both crop/non-crop and maize/nonmaize Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Several thousand crop/non-crop labels were collected through an in-house GEE labeler, and thousands of crop type labels from the 2015-2017 growing seasons were obtained from various sources. Results show that the crop/non-crop classifier successfully identified cropland with over 85% out-of sample accuracy in both countries, with Sentinel-1 being particularly useful for prediction. Among the cropped pixels, the maize/non-maize classier had an accuracy of 79% in Tanzania and 63% in Kenya.To map maize yields, we build on past work using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) that utilizes simulations from a crop model to train a regression that predicts yields from observations. Here we advance past approaches by (i) grouping simulations by Global Agro-Environmental Stratification (GAES) zones across the two countries, in order to account for landscape heterogeneity, (ii) utilizing gridded datasets on soil and sowing and harvest dates to setup model simulations in a scalable way; and (iii) utilizing all available satellite observations during the growing season in a parsimonious way by using harmonic regression fits implemented in GEE. SCYM estimates were able to capture about 50% of the variation in the yields at the district level in Western Kenya as measured by objective ground-based crop cuts.Finally, we illustrated the utility of our yield maps with two case studies. First, we document the magnitude and interannual variability of spatial heterogeneity of yields in each district, and how it varies for different parts of the region. Second, we combine our estimates with recently released soil databases in the region to investigate the most important soil constraints in the region. Soil factors explain a high fraction (72%) of variation in predicted yields, with the predominant factor being soil nitrogen levels. Overall, this study illustrates the power of combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the GEE platform, and advanced classification and yield mapping algorithms to advance understanding of smallholder agricultural systems.

TI  - The Key Role of Warm Rain Parameterization in Determining the Aerosol Indirect Effect in a Global Climate Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate models (GCMs) have been found to share the common too-frequent bias in the warm rain formation process. In this study, five different autoconversion schemes are incorporated into a single GCM, to systematically evaluate the warm rain formation processes in comparison with satellite observations and investigate their effects on the aerosol indirect effect (AIE). It is found that some schemes generate warm rain less efficiently under polluted conditions in the manner closer to satellite observations, while the others generate warm rain too frequently. Large differences in AIE are found among these schemes. It is remarkable that the schemes with more observation-like warm rain formation processes exhibit larger AIEs that far exceed the uncertainty range reported in IPCC AR5, to an extent that can cancel much of the warming trend in the past century, whereas schemes with too-frequent rain formations yield AIEs that are well bounded by the reported range. The power-law dependence of the autoconversion rate on the cloud droplet number concentration beta is found to affect substantially the susceptibility of rain formation to aerosols: the more negative beta is, the more difficult it is for rain to be triggered in polluted clouds, leading to larger AIE through substantial contributions from the wet scavenging feedback. The appropriate use of a droplet size threshold can mitigate the effect of a less negative beta. The role of the warm rain formation process on AIE in this particular model has broad implications for others that share the too-frequent rain-formation bias.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> Prediction Based on Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, air pollution has become an important public health concern. The high concentration of fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is known to be associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can help governments warn people at high risk, thus mitigating the complications. Although attempts have been made to predict PM2.5 concentrations, the factors influencing PM2.5 prediction have not been investigated. In this work, we study feature importance for PM2.5 prediction in Tehran's urban area, implementing random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning machine learning (ML) approaches. We use 23 features, including satellite and meteorological data, ground-measured PM2.5, and geographical data, in the modeling. The best model performance obtained was R-2 = 0.81 (R = 0.9), MAE = 9.93 mu g/m(3), and RMSE = 13.58 mu g/m(3) using the XGBoost approach, incorporating elimination of unimportant features. However, all three ML methods performed similarly and R-2 varied from 0.63 to 0.67, when Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution was included, and 0.77 to 0.81, when AOD at 3 km resolution was excluded. Contrary to the PM2.5 lag data, satellite-derived AODs did not improve model performance.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Does Not Improve Post-mastectomy Overall or Disease-Free Survival among Breast Cancer Patients with 1-3 Positive Nodes
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeAxillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be avoidable for breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive lymph nodes (LN) after breast-conserving therapy. However, the effects of ALND after mastectomy remain unclear because radiation is not routinely used. Herein, we compared the benefits of post-mastectomy ALND versus sentinel node biopsy (SNB) alone for breast cancer patients with 1-3 metastatic LNs.Materials and MethodsA total of 1,697 patients with pN1 disease who underwent mastectomy during 2000-2015 were identified from an institutional database. Outcomes were compared using the inverse probability of treatment weighted method.ResultsPatients who underwent SNB tended to have smaller tumors, a lower histology grade, a lower number of positive LNs, and better immunohistochemical findings. After correcting all confounding factors regarding patient, tumor, and adjuvant treatment, the SNB and ALND groups did not differ in terms of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence. The 10-year DFS and OS rates were 83% and 84%, respectively, during a median follow-up period of 93 months.ConclusionALND did not improve post-mastectomy survival outcomes among patients with N1 breast cancer, even after adjusting for all histopathologic and treatment-related factors.

TI  - The Integration of Multi-source Remotely-Sensed Data in Support of the Classification of Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play a key role in regional and global environments, and are critically linked to major issues such as climate change, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, water quality protection, and global carbon and methane cycles. Remotely-sensed imagery provides a means to detect and monitor wetlands on large scales and with regular frequency. In this project, methodologies were developed to classify wetlands (Open Bog, Treed Bog, Open Fen, Treed Fen, and Swamps) from multi-source remotely sensed data using advanced classification algorithms. The data utilized included multispectral optical and thermal data (Landsat-5) and Radar imagery from RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1. The goals were to determine the best way to combine the aforementioned imagery to classify wetlands, and determine the most significant image features. Classification algorithms investigated in this study were Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Based on the test results in the study area in Northern Ontario, Canada (49 degrees 31'.34N, 80 degrees 43'37.04W), a RF based classification methodology produced the most accurate classification result (87.51%). SVM, in some cases, produced results of comparable or better accuracy than RF. Our work also showed that the use of surface temperature (an untraditional feature choice) could aid in the classification process if the image is from an abnormally warm spring. This study found that wetlands were best classified using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetative Index) calculated from optical imagery obtained in the spring months, radar backscatter coefficients, surface temperature, and ancillary data such as surface slope, computed through either an RF or SVM classifier. It was also found that preselection of features using Log-normal or RF variable importance analysis was an effective way of identifying low quality features and to a lesser extent features which were of higher quality.

CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays an important role in a wide variety of scientific studies. Several methodologies to retrieve LST and correct the atmospheric effects for thermal infrared satellite imagery have been developed and all of them require prior knowledge of the land surface emissivity (LSE). The techniques developed for LSE and LST retrieval need to be validated with field measurements. However, in situ measurements are a challenge, being essential to investigate the particularities of each instrument to verify the best approach to collect data and validate the algorithms. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer has been widely used to obtain emissivity of different targets and calculate temperature. The instrument may be used to validate remote sensing data. Moreover, FT-IR allows to collect both emissivity and temperature at the laboratory, thus being an alternative to field validation. We investigated the emissivity dependence of the temperature. In addition, we evaluated the possibility of replacing in situ measurements by laboratory-controlled measurements. We have chosen two single-channel methods to calculate LST and perform the analysis in a Landsat 8 image. We also performed field measurements at the same time as the satellite overpass. FT-IR showed great potential to validate remotely sensed data. However, the instrument requires some time to acquire stability and attention in the calibration process. Laboratory measurements can replace field data, producing approximately 2% of the difference in the LSE. Both single-channel methods provide good accuracy for LST retrieval. Nonetheless, the improved single-channel has superior performance for the study area conditions.

TI  - Added value of regional reanalyses for climatological applications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional reanalyses constitute valuable new data sources for climatological applications by providing consistent meteorological parameter fields commonly requested, e.g., wind speed, solar radiation, temperature and precipitation. Within the European project Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional ReAnalyses (UERRA) three different numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been employed to generate different European regional reanalyses and subsequent surface reanalysis products. The uncertainties of the individual reanalysis products and of the combined UERRA multi-model ensemble are investigated by comparing against observations. Here, we provide guidance on the meteorological parameters and spatial-temporal scales where regional reanalyses add value to global reanalyses. The reanalysis fields are compared to station measurements and derived gridded fields, as well as satellite data. In general, reanalyses are especially valuable in data sparse areas, where the NWP models are superior in transporting information compared to the traditional gridding procedures based on station observations. For wind speed at heights relevant for wind energy, where little conventional observations exist, regional reanalyses can provide higher resolution horizontally, vertically, and in time, adding value to global reanalyses. Solar radiation fields capture the variability in general, however, they are prone to model-dependent biases. Temperature fields were generally found to be in good agreement with station observations, with biases for the (moderately) extreme values causing potential pitfalls for threshold applications such as climate indices. Comparisons of the precipitation fields in different areas of Europe demonstrate that various reanalyses excel in different regions. The multi-model ensemble of regional reanalyses was found to provide better uncertainty estimates than an ensemble realisation from one reanalysis system alone. The freely available regional reanalyses provide a new, high resolution data source, which might be attractive for many applications, especially when conventional data are sparse or restricted by data policies.

AB  - Multispectral imaging is increasingly used in specialty crops, but its benefits in assessment of disease severity and improvements in conventional scouting practice are unknown. Multispectral imaging was conducted using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and data were analyzed for five flights from Florida and Georgia commercial watermelon fields in 2017. The fields were rated for disease incidence and severity by extension agents and plant pathologists at randomized locations (i.e., conventional scouting) followed by ratings at locations that were identified by differences in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and stress index (i.e., UAV-assisted scouting). Diseases identified by the scouts included gummy stem blight, anthracnose, Fusarium wilt, Phytophthora fruit rot, Alternaria leaf spot, and cucurbit leaf crumple disease. Disease incidence and severity ratings were significantly different between conventional and UAV-assisted scouting (P < 0.01, Bhapkar/exact test). Higher severity ratings of 4 and 5 on a scale of 1 to 5 from no disease to complete loss of the canopy were more consistent after the scouts used the multispectral images in determining sampling locations. The UAV-assisted scouting locations had significantly lower green, red, and red edge NDVI values and higher stress index values than the conventional scouting areas (P < 0.05, ANOVA/Tukey), and this corresponded to areas with higher disease severity. Conventional scouting involving human evaluation remains necessary for disease validation. Multispectral imagery improved watermelon field scouting owing to increased ability to identify disease foci and areas of concern more rapidly than conventional scouting practices with early detection of diseases 20% more often using UAV-assisted scouting.

TI  - Identifying habitats and corridors of an invasive plant, Ageratina altissima, in an urban forest
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of invasive plants in urban forests is of great concern to land managers and ecologists. Here, we analyse the distribution pattern and potential occurrence of a problematic invasive plant, Ageratina altissima, on Mt. Umyeon, in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea, using multiple species distribution modelling with geographic information system layers and a time series of Landsat 8 satellite imagery data. Also, we identify this species' potential dispersal corridors using a network-based landscape lattice approach. All five species distribution models performed well with a range of test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.843-0.899 with an average of 0.876. Distance from trails had the greatest effect on its occurrence probability, and generally exerted a negative influence within ca. 20m of trails, indicating that urban forest trails facilitate the spread of invasive plants. Of the remote sensing-based predictors used, 7 August 2016 tasselled cap brightness index was an important variable having a negative effect on the presence of A. altissima. Elevation generally had a positive effect on its presence, although it was less important than tasselled cap brightness index. We explicitly detected the distribution pattern of high invasion risk corridors, mostly located on or around trails, which follow the central ridgeline of the study area. The results and approaches employed here can be useful for understanding, monitoring, and predicting invasive plant distribution and spread for the management of urban natural resources and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Field-level crop yield mapping with Landsat using a hierarchical data assimilation approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information on crop yields is essential for farmers and agricultural agencies to make well-informed decisions. One approach to estimate crop yield with remote sensing is data assimilation, which integrates sequential observations of canopy development from remote sensing into model simulations of crop growth processes. However, it remains challenging to efficiently scale this approach to large areas while maintaining reliable prediction at field scales. In this paper, we explored the factors limiting the generalization of the data assimilation approach and found that the accuracy of crop model prediction and the systematic model errors can significantly affect the performance of data assimilation and the yield estimation. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical data assimilation framework, which enables maize yield estimation at field levels across large areas for the Midwestern US with no a priori knowledge about the management of individual fields. This approach applies data assimilation algorithms at two spatial scales. At the county scale, we adopted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to recalibrate uncertain and sensitive model parameters based on aggregated Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series derived from Landsat images and county-level yield statistics. Using the county-specific models, we assimilated LAI time series into crop model simulations using Ensemble Kalman Filter for individual fields or pixels. This method was validated by multiple field-level maize yield datasets across major production states in the US Midwest. The Root Mean Squared Error ranges from 1.4 to 2.3 ton/ha, and the percentage error is between 9% and 21%. The hierarchical data assimilation framework provides a novel solution that downscales county-level yield statistics to 30-meter resolution yield maps, which can inform between and within field maize yield variability. This study contributes valuable insights towards practical large-scale crop yield mapping at high resolutions.

TI  - A Satellite Observation-based Analysis of Aerosol-cloud-precipitation Interaction during the February 2016 Unseasonal Heatwave Episode over the Indian Region
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud-precipitation (ACP) interaction during the February 2016 unseasonal heatwave episode over India is analyzed and presented. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets from the Aqua satellite are used to examine the relationship between aerosol and cloud parameters, viz., the aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), cloud fraction, ice and liquid cloud effective radius, cloud optical depth, cloud top temperature, and ice and liquid cloud water path. Furthermore, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) dataset is used to analyze the rainfall during the dissipating phase of the heatwave episode. The prevailing meteorological conditions during the premature, mature, and dissipating phases of the episode are identified by analyzing the near-surface temperature, relative humidity, and vertically integrated moisture flux convergence via 0.25 degrees-resolution ERA-Interim datasets. Back-trajectory analysis is conducted to determine the origin of air masses and transported aerosols. Hot and dry westerly winds dominate during the pre-mature and mature phases, and consequently, significant aerosol transport is observed. The AOD reaches a maximum of 1.6 during the three phases, with the AE being in the range of 0.8-1.7, indicating the presence of both fine-and coarse-mode aerosols. Due to microphysical processes, clouds respond fairly strongly to aerosols in the presence of favorable dynamic and thermodynamic atmospheric conditions. The suppression of precipitation during the pre-mature and mature phases is primarily attributable to weak aerosol-cloud interaction. A major rainfall event in the region comprising northern Odisha, eastern Jharkhand, and most parts of West Bengal, which is situated north of the minimum vertically integrated moisture flux zone, occurs during the dissipating phase. This rainfall event results from the unseasonal transport of moisture from the neighboring Bay of Bengal, the presence of appreciable aerosol loading, and the consequent ACP interaction.

TI  - Evaluating the utilization of the red edge and radar bands from sentinel sensors for wetland classification
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most important ecosystems, wetlands are threatened from both natural and anthropogenic activities. Mapping wetland is one of the curtail needs in order to prevent further loss. Since the beginning of the Remote Sensing revolution, different approaches using satellite images have been used for mapping and monitoring wetlands.In this paper we investigate the potential of the recently launched Sentinel satellites, both separate and in combination, for accurately mapping of different wetland classes using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) learning classifier. For investigating the influence of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands, and the radar bands from Sentinel-1, three different datasets have been analyzed.The results showed that for more accurate mapping of different wetland classes, different datasets should be used. Thus, the red-edge bands have significant influence over the intensive vegetated wetland classes such as swamps, and the radar bands have significant influence over partially decayed vegetated wetland areas such as bogs. For future studies, in addition to the analyzed datasets, we recommend adding and investigating several vegetation indices for mapping and monitoring wetland areas.

TI  - Evaluation and modification of SARA high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm during high dust loading conditions over bright desert surfaces
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have been carried out for the validation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieved using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data at the spatial resolution of several to several tens of km. Most of the validation efforts have focused on urban areas with fewer studies focused on deserts with high amounts of dust. On the other hand, calculating AOD at a high spatial resolution over desert surfaces is of high interest to identify local and accurate dust source regions. In this study, two different high-resolution MODIS AOD retrieval algorithms were evaluated to investigate the nature of high dust loading events over the Middle East region. These algorithms include the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) at 500 m resolution based on the MOD09 Level 2 daily (original SARA(MOD09)) and MCD43A4 16 day (modified SARA(MCD43)) surface reflectance products. These algorithms were validated using AERONET AOD observations at Kuwait University, and accuracy was evaluated using descriptive statistics and Expected Error (EE) over land. Also, the results of these algorithms were evaluated with the Collection 6 (C6) Deep Blue algorithm at 10 km spatial resolution (DB10km). Results show that the SARA(MCD43) and SARA(MOD09) AOD retrievals are well correlated (r) with AERONET data (SARA(MCD43) = 0.89 and SARA(MOD09) = 0.84), with a larger number of retrievals falling within the Expected Error (SARA(MCD43) = 86% and SARA(MOD09) = 77%) than the DB (DB10km = 60%) AOD product. The SARA(MCD43) AOD exhibited good agreement with DB10km AOD over desert surfaces areas during high aerosol loading events, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.92, RMSE of 0.09, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.08. While SARA(MOD09) AOD over background desert areas is similar to SARA(MCD43), significant differences were observed over high aerosol loading areas and SARA(MOD09) dramatically underestimates AOD. The results demonstrate that: (i) the SARA algorithm (regardless of surface reflectance data used) is more robust than the MODIS AOD products (both DT and DB), and is better able to represent spatial dust aerosol conditions with an accurate AOD over desert areas over a range of low to high dust pollutant levels; (ii) SARA(MCD43) is well correlated with the DB AOD observations and provides AOD with much greater accuracy and reliability than SARA(MOD09) over desert areas during severe dust loading events.

M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeMany authors have described clinicopathologic parameters as factors related to cervical lymph node metastasis development in (C)N0 stage lip cancer. However, predictive factors for occult lymph node metastasis and criteria for elective neck dissection, especially for early tumour, remain undefined.MethodsA multi-institutional study with 193 consecutive patients with early lip SCC treated from January 1990 to March 2006 was carried out retrospectively to determine factors predicting occult metastasis.ResultsThe overall late LNM rate was 13% (25/193). In the multivariate logistic regression study, tumour size and pattern of tumour invasion were factors related to the occurrence of late LNM with rates of sensitivity, specifity and accuracy for occult LNM prediction of 50%, 89.5% and 87%, respectively.ConclusionOur results indicate that patients with stage I and II SCC of the lip with tumour size greater than 18mm and more aggressive pattern of invasion must be considered a high-risk group for LNM and an END should be performed.

AB  - Current and planned space missions will produce aboveground biomass density data products at varying spatial resolution. Calibration and validation of these data products is critically dependent on the existence of field estimates of aboveground biomass and coincident remote sensing data from airborne or terrestrial lidar. There are few places that meet these requirements, and they are mostly in the northern hemisphere and temperate zone. Here we summarize the potential for low-altitude drones to produce new observations in support of mission science. We describe technical requirements for producing high-quality measurements from autonomous platforms and highlight differences among commercially available laser scanners and drone aircraft. We then describe a case study using a heavy-lift autonomous helicopter in a temperate mountain forest in the southern Czech Republic in support of calibration and validation activities for the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation. Low-altitude flight using drones enables the collection of ultra-high-density point clouds using wider laser scan angles than have been possible from traditional airborne platforms. These measurements can be precise and accurate and can achieve measurement densities of thousands of points m(-2). Analysis of surface elevation measurements on a heterogeneous target observed 51days apart indicates that the realized range accuracy is 2.4cm. The single-date precision is 2.1-4.5cm. These estimates are net of all processing artifacts and geolocation errors under fully autonomous flight. The 3D model produced by these data can clearly resolve branch and stem structure that is comparable to terrestrial laser scans and can be acquired rapidly over large landscapes at a fraction of the cost of traditional airborne laser scanning.

AB  - Ecofeminism critiques the common Greco-diaspora worldview, which focuses on divisions and hierarchy, and is shared by millions of people in industrialized nations. Not surprisingly, given this worldview, environmental and animal activists are keenly aware of their differences, both philosophical and practical, and therefore envision their causes and their work as separate and distinct. Asian philosophy, indigenous traditions, and science offer alternative visions, presenting a more interrelational, interconnected, interdependent, unified, and egalitarian sense of the universe. If this alternative worldview is viable for earth and animal advocacy, it must shed light on pressing problems and indicate workable solutions, particularly with regard to the most pressing problems of the day. When applied to climate change and population/consumption, this alternative vision of an interrelational, interconnected, interdependent, unified, and egalitarian universe proves effective for identifying core concerns that are shared and indicating viable joint solutions.

TI  - The Tragi-Comic Lives of Theory: Values of a Simmelian Existence
T2  - DIGITHUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel made repeated efforts throughout his career to address the crisis of modern culture by drawing on a wide repertoire of scholarly discourses and imaginative fictions. An overlooked and unique feature of his early works include humorous vignettes and free-verse poems in pseudonymous pieces published in the avant-garde journal Jugend. In later writings, he advances his own life-philosophy through an idiosyncratic use of Goethe's scientific, autobiographical, and literary works in an attempt to articulate what is distinctive about the modern worldview. Focussing on these lesser-known writings reveals the tragicomic character of his approach to modern individuality in a variety of cultural spheres, and in the life of theory itself. Like Simmel's vitalist quest for the archetype or "primary phenomenon (Urphanomen) [...] of the idea of Goethe" and in his formulation of "the values of Goethean Life", this essay offers a kind of theorizing about the "spiritual meaning (geistige Sinn) of Simmelian existence" in its many forms of expression. Although Simmel's ideas may seem antiquated to us now, recovering what might be called his 'theory-fictions' is essential if the humanities and social sciences are to address the most pressing problems we face in the 21st century.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To examine sentinel lymph node pathology and describe relationships to uterine pathology, non sentinel pelvic lymph nodes, and para-aortic lymph nodes.Methods. Patients with apparent uterine-confined endometrial cancer underwent robotic hysterectomy, SLN mapping, completion pelvic lymphadenectomy (LND), and para-aortic (PaLND) directed by frozen section. Patients were risk stratified by histology: low-risk (LR) endometrioid <50% depth-of-invasion (DOI), intermediate-risk (IR) endometrioid 50% DOI, and high-risk (HR) type II histology for comparison to other pelvic/aortic metastases.Results. 414 patients were stratified: 275 LR, 80 IR, and 59 HR cases. PaLND was performed in 84.2% of IR/HR patients and 25.1% LR patients. Pelvic node metastasis was detected in 11.6% LR, 50.0% IR, and 39.0% HR patients. PaLN metastasis was detected in 2.9% LR, 11.3% IR, and 16.9% HR patients. Proportionally, isolated tumor cells (ITC) SLNs were more common in LR or IR vs. HR group (51.6% and 44.7% vs. 15.0%, p < 0.05). The SLN false negative rates (FNR) were 0% LR, 2.5% IR, and 5.1% HR. Non-sentinel pelvic node metastases were present in 28 (31.5%) of all SLN+ cases, but only 3(8.3%) of SLN with ITC. PaLN metastasis was found in 18.8% LR, 11.8% IR, and 33.3% HR cases with ITC SLNs. After controlling for DOI, LVSI, and grade, ITC-positive SLNs had a significant association with non-sentinel pelvic and aortic metastasis (p = 0.03 and p = 0.008, respectively).Conclusions. Patients with HR histology have more micro/macro-metastases in both SLNs and non-SLN metastases compared to LR/IR patients. SLN ITCs were associated with a clinically significant incidence of PaLN metastasis across all histology risk groups. There were no cases of isolated aortic node metastasis in this study. SLN mapping had an increased, although clinically acceptable FNR in the HR cohort compared to LR patients. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Role of African Emerging Space Agencies in Earth Observation Capacity Building for Facilitating the Implementation and Monitoring of the African Development Agenda: The Case of African Earth Observation Program
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - AU-Agenda 2063 was adopted at the 24th Ordinary Session of the African Heads of State and Government in 2015 as the blueprint for the future development of the continent. Built upon the continent's past experiences, challenges, and successes, AU-Agenda 2063 comprehensively describes the strategic path for Africa's future development in the next 50 years. Thus, the monitoring of its implementation in various African states is critical for ensuring sustainable development and track progress. However, the higher cost of collecting data for accurately and reliably monitoring the implementation of Agenda 2063 may hinder the progress towards achieving these goals. Satellite Earth observation provides ample data, and thus has provided opportunities for the development of novel products and services with the potential to support implementation, monitoring and reporting for AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. However, it has been limitedly exploited in Africa, as evidenced by lower research outputs and investments. This calls for increased capacity building in the use of available EO data and products for various users including decision makers to advance national, regional and continental priorities. The use of such data products is often hampered by the capability to understand the products and thus their value for addressing socio-economic challenges. This paper discusses the potential of Earth observation capacity building for supporting the implementation, monitoring of, and reporting towards achieving AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. Specifically, this paper identifies existing capacity building resources, including the role of open and free Earth observation data, open-source software, and product dissemination platforms that can be leveraged for supporting national development, service delivery and the achievement of AU-Agenda 2063 targets. Furthermore, the paper recognizes the importance of bilateral and multilateral partnerships in leveraging existing know-how, technology and other resources for advancing strategic goals of African emerging space agencies and promoting sustainable development, with examples from South African National Space Agency (SANSA). Then, the challenges and opportunities for capacity building and the wide adoption of EO in Africa are discussed in the context of AU-Agenda 2063. The paper thus concludes that EO capacity building is essential to address the skills and data gaps and increase the use of EO-based solutions for decision making in various sectors, critical for achieving AU-A2063.

TI  - Determinants of composition, diversity and structure in a seasonally dry forest in Myanmar
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonally dry forest with a deciduous canopy is a widespread ecosystem in Southeast Asia. Debate continues about whether this vegetation is forest or savanna. Savannas have tree cover <60%, C-4-dominated ground vegetation, and frequent fires. Forests have tree cover >70%, C-3-dominated ground vegetation, and infrequent fires. We studied three community types previously identified in seasonally dry forests in Myanmar, High Indaing, Low Indaing (both types of deciduous Dipterocarp-dominated forest) and Mixed Deciduous Forest (usually dominated by non-Dipterocarp species). We wanted to know whether their herbaceous layer communities were also compositionally distinctive, whether their structure (% tree cover, C-4 abundance) identified them as savannas or forests, and whether they differed with respect to soil nutrients, and fire frequency.We sampled fifteen 50 m x 50 m plots thought to represent the 3 community types (5 plots of each community type). In each plot we measured basal area, abundance and richness of trees with DBH >= 5 cm, and percentage cover, abundance and richness of herbaceous layer species, and classified each species as C-3/C-4. We estimated tree cover along four 50 m line transects recording canopy openness/closure every 1 m. We pooled six 0-15 cm soil cores to estimate soil parameters (N, P, K, pH). We recorded fire frequency in each plot using MODIS fire products for 2001-2017.We found that tree, herbaceous-layer and combined compositional data generated similar community clusters. Low Indaing had open tree canopies and high abundance of C-4 plants relative to Mixed Deciduous Forest. High Indaing had a wider range of tree covers but also high C-4 abundance. Fire was common in all three communities. Low Indaing could be differentiated from Mixed Deciduous forest by soil K and P (lower for Low Indaing), with High Indaing having intermediate values.Low Indaing appears to be a type of savanna whereas Mixed Deciduous Forest is a type of forest, but with the propensity to burn. In our data, High Indaing showed characteristics of both savanna and forest. Although soils underlie the transitions between these Asian communities, they do not show the clear physiognomic boundaries observed in African and South American savanna-forest transitions.

TI  - Fractional Cover Mapping of Invasive Plant Species by Combining Very High-Resolution Stereo and Multi-Sensor Multispectral Imageries
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant species are major threats to biodiversity. They can be identified and monitored by means of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. This study aimed to test the potential of multiple very high-resolution (VHR) optical multispectral and stereo imageries (VHRSI) at spatial resolutions of 1.5 and 5mto quantify the presence of the invasive lantana (Lantana camara L.) and predict its distribution at large spatial scale using medium-resolution fractional cover analysis. We created initial training data for fractional cover analysis by classifying smaller extent VHR data (SPOT-6 and RapidEye) along with three dimensional (3D) VHRSI derived digital surface model (DSM) datasets. We modelled the statistical relationship between fractional cover and spectral reflectance for a VHR subset of the study area located in the Himalayan region of India, and finally predicted the fractional cover of lantana based on the spectral reflectance of Landsat-8 imagery of a larger spatial extent. We classified SPOT-6 and RapidEye data and used the outputs as training data to create continuous field layers of Landsat-8 imagery. The area outside the overlapping region was predicted by fractional cover analysis due to the larger extent of Landsat-8 imagery compared with VHR datasets. Results showed clear discrimination of understory lantana from upperstory vegetation with 87.38% (for SPOT-6), and 85.27% (for RapidEye) overall accuracy due to the presence of additional VHRSI derived DSM information. Independent validation for lantana fractional cover estimated root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 11.8% (for RapidEye) and 7.22% (for SPOT-6), and R2 values of 0.85 and 0.92 for RapidEye (5 m) and SPOT-6 (1.5 m), respectively. Results suggested an increase in predictive accuracy of lantana within forest areas along with increase in the spatial resolution for the same Landsat-8 imagery. The variance explained at 1.5 m spatial resolution to predict lantana was 64.37%, whereas it decreased by up to 37.96% in the case of 5 m spatial resolution data. This study revealed the high potential of combining small extent VHR and VHRSI-derived 3D optical data with larger extent, freely available satellite data for identification and mapping of invasive species in mountainous forests and remote regions.

TI  - Improved DInSAR time-series reconstruction in the presence of phase unwrapping errors using Huber-norm
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series reconstruction in differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) requires solving a regression problem and can be used to monitor surface deformation. In this study, the authors present an improved time-series reconstruction for DInSAR using Huber-norm minimisation. The Huber-norm combines l(2)-norm and l(1)-norm based on a threshold retaining features of both norms. Unlike existing techniques based on either l(2)-norm or l(1)-norm minimisation, their proposed technique has better reconstruction performance in the presence of both outlier-like phase unwrapping errors and additive Gaussian noise, as a Huber density can model these errors. They first validate the proposed technique using real European Remote Sensing satellite data. To further analyse the performance, they simulate phase data according to different deformation models with phase unwrapping errors and additive Gaussian noise. They show via Monte-Carlo simulations that their method has superior performance, compared to the existing approaches. They further verify the performance of the proposed technique with respect to the threshold parameter and for a varying percentage of phase unwrapping errors.

TI  - Prospective Observational Study of the Clinical Prognoses of Patients with Bloodstream Infections Caused by Ampicillin-Susceptible but Penicillin-Resistant <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical impacts of ampicillin-susceptible but penicillin-resistant (ASPR) phenotypes of Enterococcus faecalis on clinical outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection (BSI). A total of 295 patients with an E. faecalis BSI from six sentinel hospitals during a 2-year period (from May 2016 to April 2018) were enrolled in this study. Putative risk factors, including host-, treatment-, and pathogen-related variables, were assessed to determine the associations with the 30-day mortality rate of patients with an E. faecalis BSI. The proportion of ASPR E. faecalis isolates was 22.7% (67/295). ASPR isolates (adjusted odds ratio, 2.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 5.02) exhibited a significant association with an increased 30-day mortality rate, and a significant difference in survival was identified in a group of patients treated with ampicillin- and/or piperacillin-based regimens who were stratified according to the penicillin susceptibility of the causative pathogen (P = 0.011 by a log rank test). ASPR E. faecalis BSIs resulted in a >2-fold-higher 30-day mortality rate (26.9%; 18/67) than for the BSIs caused by penicillin-susceptible strains (12.3%; 28/228). The differences in mortality rates of patients stratified by penicillin susceptibility were likely due to the treatment failures of ampicillin and/or piperacillin in patients with an ASPR E. faecalis BSI.

TI  - Effectiveness of therapeutic inflatable ball self-exercises for improving shoulder function and quality of life in breast cancer survivors after sentinel lymph node dissection
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThe survival rate of breast cancer survivors (BCSs) is >90%. Particular issues are upper arm dysfunction caused by surgery and treatments. Physical activity has been recommended to improve shoulder function and quality of life (QoL) in BCSs. However, rehabilitation programs tend not to be continuous.PurposeTo explore the effectiveness of therapeutic inflatable ball self-exercise for improving shoulder function and QoL in breast cancer survivors (BCSs) following breast cancer surgery.Patients and methodsSeventy-two BCSs were allocated to two groups, conventional self-exercise (CSE; n=34; age, 48.97.2years) and therapeutic inflatable ball self-exercise (IBE; n=38; age, 47.78.9years); 22 in the CSE and 23 in the IBE group completed the interventions. Both groups performed intervention for 12weeks, three times per week and 15min a day at least. Measurement was performed three times for shoulder range of motion (ROM), handgrip strength, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B).Result Flexion and extension ofshoulder ROM showed significant differences between the two groups at 12weeks. Flexion and extension of shoulder ROM showed significant differences for t1-t2 (p=0.02) and t0-t1 (p=0.04). Abduction showed a significant difference for t0-t1 (p=0.03), t1-t2 (p=0.02), and t0-t2 (p=0.01). CSE (7 points) and IBE (20 points) satisfied the MDC in FACT-B total score. The MDC of the SPADI total score was 13 points in the CSE group and 9 points in the IBE group.Conclusion IBE would be more appropriate to start the rehabilitation for BCSs and CSE would be effective after the pain has improved.

TI  - Determination by MODIS satellite-based methods of recent global trends in land surface aridity and degradation
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aridity Index (AI; the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation), is an indirect, essentially climatic index that has been used to identify global distributions of arid regions. Since the turn of the century, the increasingly widespread availability of satellite data has led many researchers to use it to assess desertification. In this study we used a satellite-based aridity index (SbAI) to investigate global changes of land surface aridity from 2000 to 2017. Degraded land areas were identified by using SbAI and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Here, degraded land include existing desert and the land having both permanent and temporal dust erodibility. Our results showed that actual land condition by SbAI became dryness than that derived from the climatic AI indicator in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid regions and that the dryness was reflected in an increase in the extent of areas classified as hyper-arid. From 2000 to 2017, however, the annual extent of the wetter areas within arid regions (semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions) increased, and that of drier areas (hyper-arid and arid regions) decreased. The global area of degraded land decreased slightly between 2000 and 2017, and the annual average area for that period was 13.5 x 10(6) km(2) (9.2% of total land area).

TI  - Solar Influence on Fire Radiative Power Retrieved With the Bispectral Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire radiative power (FRP) is a key product to quantify active fires, which indicates fuel consumption and fire emissions. In the case of the bispectral method, it can be calculated from remote sensing data if a midinfrared (3.8 mu m) and thermal infrared channel (similar to 10 mu m) are available. While different uncertainty sources have been investigated, the quantitative evaluation of the FRP error as a function of reflected solar radiation is still missing. The ground-reflected solar radiance adds an unknown signal component to the at-sensor radiance during the daytime, which influences the fire detection algorithm as well as the FRP product. FRP errors can reach up to 5%-15% for smoldering fire temperatures of 400-500 K, which is a systematic bias. Errors decrease with increasing temperature and for temperatures higher than 700 K, i.e., flaming fires, the FRP bias is less than 2%. The evaluation is performed for the TET-1 instrument of DLR's FireBIRD mission using the bispectral method.

TI  - Road expansion and persistence in forests of the Congo Basin
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Roads facilitate development in remote forest regions, often with detrimental consequences for ecosystems. In the Congo Basin, unpaved logging roads used by timber firms, as well as paved and unpaved public roads, have expanded greatly. Comparing old (before 2003) and new (2003-2018) road datasets derived from Landsat imagery, we show that the total length of road networks inside logging concessions in Central Africa has doubled since 2003, whereas the total length of roads outside concessions has increased by 40%. We estimate that 44% of roads in logging concessions were abandoned by 2018, as compared to just 12% of roads outside concessions. Annual deforestation rates between 2000 and 2017 near (within 1 km) roads increased markedly and were highest for old roads, lowest for abandoned roads and generally higher outside logging concessions. The impact of logging on deforestation is partially ameliorated by the nearly fourfold higher rate of road abandonment inside concessions, but the overall expansion of logging roads in the Congo Basin is of broad concern for forest ecosystems, carbon storage and wildlife vulnerable to hunting. Road decommissioning after logging could play a crucial role in reducing the negative impacts of timber extraction on forest ecosystems.

TI  - The Use of UAV Mounted Sensors for Precise Detection of Bark Beetle Infestation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The bark beetle (Ips typographus) disturbance represents serious environmental and economic issue and presents a major challenge for forest management. A timely detection of bark beetle infestation is therefore necessary to reduce losses. Besides wood production, a bark beetle outbreak affects the forest ecosystem in many other ways including the water cycle, nutrient cycle, or carbon fixation. On that account, (not just) European temperate coniferous forests may become endangered ecosystems. Our study was performed in the unmanaged zone of the Krkonoe Mountains National Park in the northern part of the Czech Republic where the natural spreading of bark beetle is slow and, therefore, allow us to continuously monitor the infested trees that are, in contrast to managed forests, not being removed. The aim of this work is to evaluate possibilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted low-cost RGB and modified near-infrared sensors for detection of different stages of infested trees at the individual level, using a retrospective time series for recognition of still green but already infested trees (so-called green attack). A mosaic was created from the UAV imagery, radiometrically calibrated for surface reflectance, and five vegetation indices were calculated; the reference data about the stage of bark beetle infestation was obtained through a combination of field survey and visual interpretation of an orthomosaic. The differences of vegetation indices between infested and healthy trees over four time points were statistically evaluated and classified using the Maximum Likelihood classifier. Achieved results confirm our assumptions that it is possible to use a low-cost UAV-based sensor for detection of various stages of bark beetle infestation across seasons; with increasing time after infection, distinguishing infested trees from healthy ones grows easier. The best performance was achieved by the Greenness Index with overall accuracy of 78%-96% across the time periods. The performance of the indices based on near-infrared band was lower.

TI  - Classification and identification of plant species based on multi-source remote sensing data: Research progress and prospect
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Species classification and identification is the basis of biodiversity monitoring, and is critical to deal with almost all ecological questions. In this paper, we aim to understand the current status and existing problems in plant species classification and identification using multi-source remote sensing data. We summarized the studies in this field since the year 2000, and found that most of these studies focus on temperate or boreal forests in Europe and North America, or African savanna. Airborne hyperspectral data is the most widely used remote sensing data source, and the LiDAR, as a supplementary data, significantly improves the classification accuracy through the information of single tree segmentation and three-dimensional vertical structure. Support vector machine and random forest are the most widely used non-parametric classification algorithms with an average classification accuracy of 80%. With the development of computer technology and machine learning, artificial neural network has developed rapidly in species identification. Based on the literature-based analysis, we propose that the current research in this field is still facing some challenges, including the complexity of classification objects, the effective integration of multi-source remote sensing data, the integration of plant phenology and texture characteristics, and the improvement in plant classification algorithm. The accuracy of plant classification and identification could be greatly improved by using the high-frequency data collection over time, the integration of hyperspectral and LiDAR data, the use of specific spectral information such as short-wave infrared imagery, and the development of novel deep learning techniques.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Consistency Evaluation of XCO<sub>2</sub> Retrievals from GOSAT and OCO-2 Based on TCCON and Model Data for Joint Utilization in Carbon Cycle Research
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global carbon cycle research requires precise and sufficient observations of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) in addition to conventional surface mole fraction observations. In addition, assessing the consistency of multi-satellite data are crucial for joint utilization to better infer information about CO2 sources and sinks. In this work, we evaluate the consistency of long-term XCO2 retrievals from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) in comparison with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and the 3D model of CO2 mole fractions data from CarbonTracker 2017 (CT2017). We create a consistent joint dataset and compare it with the long-term model data to assess their abilities to characterize the carbon cycle climate. The results show that, although slight increasing differences are found between the GOSAT and TCCON XCO2 in the northern temperate latitudes, the GOSAT and OCO-2 XCO2 retrievals agree well in general, with a mean bias +/- standard deviation of differences of 0.21 +/- 1.3 ppm. The differences are almost within +/- 2 ppm and are independent of time, indicating that they are well calibrated. The differences between OCO-2 and CT2017 XCO2 are much larger than those between GOSAT and CT XCO2, which can be attributed to the significantly different spatial representatives of OCO-2 and the CT-transport model 5 (TM5). The time series of the combined OCO-2/GOSAT dataset and the modeled XCO2 agree well, and both can characterize significantly increasing atmospheric CO2 under the impact of a large El Nino during 2015 and 2016. The trend calculated from the dataset using the seasonal Kendall (S-K) method indicates that atmospheric CO2 is increasing by 2-2.6 ppm per year.

TI  - Shalstab mathematical model and WorldView-2 satellite images to identification of landslide-susceptible areas
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural hazards, occurring all over the world, may become a disaster when humans and nature interact. In Brazil, landslides triggered by heavy rainfall are the most common phenomenon that affects the population. Due to the economic and social losses and deaths, the identification and monitoring of risk areas are extremely important. Therefore, this study aims to identify the landslide-susceptible areas in Vila Albertina and Britador neighborhood, located in Campos do Jordao city in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Using the Shalstab mathematical model, which analyzes the slope stability, and satellite images from WorldView-2 sensor with data mining techniques, it was identified the most susceptible areas for this phenomenon and the main characteristics of human occupation that might induce landslides. To achieve this goal, three scenarios were simulated for each neighborhood, changing the values of the geotechnical parameters, used as input on Shalstab. The results of susceptibility areas were consistent with the reality observed in these neighborhoods and the landslide scars corroborate with the assumption that anthropic changes induce landslides. The satellite image allowed the identification of different types of human interaction and its changes in steep slope areas.

TI  - Retrospective Monitoring of Soil Waterlogging on Arable Land of Tambov Oblast in 2018-1968
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A hypothesis about an increase in the area of waterlogged soils on arable lands of Tambov oblast in the recent decades was tested by the methods of retrospective monitoring of the soil and land cover. The period of retrospection was 50 years (2018-1968) according to remote sensing data and more than 60 years according to archival materials. It was found that waterlogging of rainfed soils has a periodic character without definite trend for an increase in their area, i.e., the area of waterlogged soils has not changed over the past 50-60 years. The area of periodic influence of overmoistening on land use of arable land was estimated at 181000 ha, or 8.5% of the arable land area. It was also shown that official statistical data significantly underestimate the area of waterlogged soils, as these soils on arable land are not taken into account. The total area of soil waterlogging reached about 16% of the agricultural land in Tambov oblast, including about 6% of waterlogged soils within the arable land. It was also found that the decrease in the area of arable during that period because of the economic reasons significantly exceeded the influence of natural factors.

TI  - Climate, Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Bandama Basin (Cote D'Ivoire, West Africa) and Incidences on Hydropower Production of the Kossou Dam
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land use/cover changes are potential drivers of change in hydrology and water use. Incidences of these factors on Bandama hydrological basin and Kossou hydropower generation (1981-2016) in West Africa are assessed in this present work. Using Landsat products of United Stated Geological Survey, results show that water bodies areas and land use have increased by 1.89%/year and 11.56%/year respectively, whereas herbaceous savanna, savanna, forest and evergreen forest coverage have been reduced by 1.39%/year, 0.02%/year, 2.39%/year and 3.33%/year respectively from 1988 to 2016. Hydroclimatic analysis reveals that streamflow presents greater change in magnitude compared to rainfall though both increasing trends are not statistically significant at annual scale. Streamflow varies at least four (two) times greatly than the rainfall (monthly and seasonally) annually except during driest months probably due to land use/cover change. In contrast, Kossou hydropower generation is significantly decreasing (p-value 0.007) at both monthly and annual scales possibly due to water abstraction at upstream. Further works are required to elucidate the combined effects of land use/cover and climate changes on hydrological system as well as water abstraction on Kossou generation.

TI  - Exosome mediated differentiation of megakaryocytes: a study on TLR mediated effects
T2  - JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS
M3  - Letter
AB  - Megakaryocytes are large polyploid bone marrow cells whose function is to produce circulatory platelets. Megakaryocytes are also known to release extracellular vesicles (EVs) of varying sizes. Toll like receptors (TLRs), present on the sentinel cells are essential components of the innate immune response, these receptors are also expressed by platelets and megakaryocytes. Our data provide the evidence that TLR-2 induced MKEVs are able to recapitulate TLR-2 signalling in megakaryocytic cell line (Dami cells) and that likely induces megakaryocytic maturation by increasing the production of cytokines involved in MK maturation. TLR-2 induced MKEVs may be involved in replenishment of the immune effector platelets in circulation and its progenitor megakaryocyte in bone marrow for the physiological need of the platelets by inducing the maturation of megakaryocyte.

TI  - Effects of pen location on thermoregulation and growth performance in grow-finish pigs during late summer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of pen location on swine thermoregulation and growth performance were determined over 6 weeks during late summer. A total of 128 mixed sex pigs [Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire)] were randomly assigned to 16 pens in two grow-finish barns (n = 8 pens/barn; 57.43 +/- 1.33 kg initial body weight (BW)). Pen locations were determined based on orientation to ventilation fans and air inlets. Internal pens (IP; n = 4/barn) were in direct line of sight between the fans and air inlets while peripheral pens (PP; n = 4/barn) were located 0.70 +/- 0.29 m to either side of a fan. Two sentinel gilts per pen were selected and vaginal temperature (T-v) was measured in 10-min intervals using T-v data loggers. Additionally, trunk skin temperature (T-s) was measured with an infrared camera and respiration rate (RR) was measured by counting flank movements of the sentinel gilts twice daily (0800 and 1500 hours). Pen airspeed was measured twice daily (0800 and 1500 hours) at pig level with an anemometer. Individual pen ambient temperature (T-A) and relative humidity (RH) were recorded daily in 10-min intervals. Feed consumption and BW were determined every 2 weeks. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS 9.4. Although airspeed was reduced overall (P = 0.01; 11%) in PP compared with IP, no differences (P > 0.10) in T-A (27.53 +/- 1.73 degrees C) or RH (68.47 +/- 5.92%) were detected. An overall increase (P <= 0.02) in T-v (0.23 degrees C), minimum T-v (0.18 degrees C), and maximum T-v (0.29 degrees C) was detected in PP versus IP housed pigs. Similarly, from 0800 to 1900 hours and 2000 to 0700 hours, T-v was greater overall (P <= 0.01; 0.22 and 0.25 degrees C, respectively) in PP compared with IP housed pigs. An overall decrease in T-s (P = 0.04) was observed in PP (37.39 +/- 0.14 degrees C) compared with IP (37.61 +/- 0.14 degrees C) housed pigs. No RR differences (P > 0.10; 76 +/- 4 breaths per minute) were detected with any comparison. While no average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) differences were detected (P > 0.10; 0.74 +/- 0.03 kg/d and 2.26 +/- 0.08 kg/d, respectively), gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) was decreased (P = 0.02; 6%) in PP compared with IP housed pigs. In summary, pigs located in PP had greater body temperature and reduced G:F despite similarities in T-A and RH between all pens.

TI  - Assessment of seasonal cloud properties in the United Arab Emirates and adjoining regions from geostationary satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study mainly focuses on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and adjoining areas, in the Arabian Peninsula, coming under the arid/semi-arid climatic conditions. The extremely intermittent rainfall strongly hinders the economic growth of this region. The freshwater primarily comes from the desalination of seawater along with other resources such as groundwater in the UAE region. Nevertheless, the declining groundwater reserves and expensive desalination approach have made to search for alternative sources for rain enhancement and one such approach is through the cloud seeding. However, there are barely few studies concentrated on the occurrence frequency of clouds and seasonal variability including their natural microphysics and dynamics that is crucial for precipitation augmentation through cloud seeding. Hence, the present study uses two geostationary satellites, namely, Meteosat-8 and Meteosat-10, due to their higher spatiotemporal observations in this region. The two geostationary satellites scan the UAE and adjoining regions in different view angles due to their positioning in different longitudes. Therefore, the Meteosat-8 has more advantage than Meteosat-10 in terms of the biases associated with the angular view and spatial resolution over the UAE and adjoining regions. Hence, the present study also evaluates the biases related to cloud occurrence due to different view angles.The winter (February March) and summer (June August) seasons indicate the frequent occurrence of clouds with distinct spatial distribution in these arid/semi-arid areas. The Arabian Gulf shows a higher percentage of clouds during winter while frequent convective clouds are noticed during summer over the Al Hajar Mountains. The evaluation of liquid and ice clouds also indicates that the warm cloud percentage is higher over the mountainous regions. However, the ice cloud distribution is higher over the Arabian Gulf during winter while they are highly confined along the Al Hajar Mountains in summer. The evaluation of cloud cover from Meteosat-10 and Meteosat-8 indicates the former shows higher occurrence percentage than the later. The significant biases are noted in warm cloud occurrence along the-mountainous regions from both the satellites. The fractional occurrence of rain is also estimated for different seasons based cloud liquid water path that provides key information to the seedable convective clouds. Therefore, the present study finds significant implications to the rain enhancement over arid and semi-arid regions in the Arabian Peninsula.

TI  - Assessing vulnerability of forest ecosystem in the Indian Western Himalayan region using trends of net primary productivity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan ecosystem is one of the sensitive and fragile ecosystems with rich biodiversity that provides major ecosystem services. The study was conducted to measure the extent of vulnerability across forested grids of Uttarakhandone of the States of Indian Western Himalayan (IWH) region. The forests of the state are exposed to various anthropogenic and natural climatic pressures, thus making them vulnerable. In this paper, we demonstrate how to map vulnerability of forest ecosystem by analyzing variability and trends of net primary productivity (NPP). The vulnerability of the forest ecosystem was evaluated through trends of sensitivity and adaptability of NPP. The sensitivity of a system was considered as the response degree of the system to climatic variability whereas adaptability was considered as the ability to maintain, recover or improve its structure in the face of climatic stresses. In our study, NPP was considered as the receptor of shock and stresses of climatic variability and human disturbances. We discuss the method and results with reference to productivity changes under the influence of changing climate for the forested landscape of a mountainous region. The results have been summarized to rank vulnerability at the level of administrative boundary of governance, i.e. district. Average value of vulnerability for all NPP pixels of forests grids in a district was used to compute the vulnerability at district level. The study will help forest managers in decision making for efficiently allocating resources and to prioritize management options in the identified regions to improve productivity in coming times.

TI  - Assimilation of Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index into the Noah-MP Land Surface Model: Impacts on Water and Carbon Fluxes and States over the Continental United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate representation of vegetation states is required for the modeling of terrestrial water-energy-carbon exchanges and the characterization of the impacts of natural and anthropogenic vegetation changes on the land surface. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of assimilating remote sensing-based leaf area index (LAI) retrievals over the continental United States in the Noah-MP land surface model, during a time period of 2000-17. The results demonstrate that the assimilation has a beneficial impact on the simulation of key water budget terms, such as soil moisture, evapotranspiration, snow depth, terrestrial water storage, and streamflow, when compared with a large suite of reference datasets. In addition, the assimilation of LAI is also found to improve the carbon fluxes of gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Most prominent improvements in the water and carbon variables are observed over the agricultural areas of the United States, where assimilation improves the representation of vegetation seasonality impacted by cropping schedules. The systematic, added improvements from assimilation in a configuration that employs high-quality boundary conditions highlight the significant utility of LAI data assimilation in capturing the impacts of vegetation changes.

TI  - Sentinel vascular access monitoring after endovascular intervention predicts access outcome
T2  - JOURNAL OF VASCULAR ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: The vascular access pressure ratio test identifies dialysis vascular access dysfunction when three consecutive vascular access pressure ratios are >0.55. We tested whether the magnitude of the decline in vascular access pressure ratio 1-week post-intervention could alert of subsequent access failure. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: The retrospective study included all vascular access procedures at one institution from March 2014 to June 2016. Data included demographics, comorbidities, vascular access features, %Delta VAPR = ((Pre-Post)/Pre] x 100% assessed within the first 2 weeks post-percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty, time-to-next procedure, and patency. The log-rank test compared the area under the curve, receiver operating curve, Kaplan-Meier arteriovenous graft and arteriovenous fistula survival curves. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard (CP) model was used to determine the association of %Delta VAPR with access patency. Results: Analysis of 138 subjects (females 51%; Black 87%) included 64 arteriovenous fistulas with 104 angioplasties and 74 arteriovenous grafts with 134 angioplasties. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for fistula failure at 3 months was 0.59, with optimal screening characteristics of 33.3%, sensitivity of 56.1%, and specificity of 63.2%. Arteriovenous fistula with 33.3% required earlier subsequent procedure (136 vs 231 days), lower survival on Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.01), and twofold greater risk of failure (P = .006). Area under the receiver operating characteristic for arteriovenous graft failure at 3 months had a sensitivity of 52.3% and specificity of 67.4%. Arteriovenous graft with a post-intervention vascular access pressure ratio decline of <28.8% also required earlier subsequent procedure (144 vs 189 days), lower survival on Kaplan-Meier (P = 0.04), and a 59% higher risk for failure. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for combined access failure (arteriovenous fistula + arteriovenous graft) at 3 months had an optimal cut-point value of 31.2%, a sensitivity of 54.6%, and a specificity of 63.1%. Access with a <31.2% drop had a 62% increase in the risk of failure (hazard ratio 1.62; confidence interval 1.16, 2.27; P = 0.005). Conclusion: The magnitude of post-intervention reduction in vascular access pressure ratio provides a novel predictive measure of access outcomes.

TI  - Detection of axillary lymph node recurrence in patients with personal history of breast cancer treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB): results of postoperative combined ultrasound and mammography screening over five consecutive years
T2  - ACTA RADIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been accepted as the standard treatment for axillary evaluation for invasive breast cancer with a clinically negative axilla and the low rate of recurrence after SLNB was reported. Purpose To evaluate the performance of screening ultrasound (US) for breast and axillary recurrence detection in breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB. Material and Methods We identified 2807 examinations of 562 breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB and received annual screening US combined with mammography (MG) for five years. The cancer detection rate, recall rate, and positive predictive value (PPV3) of biopsies in breasts and breast plus axillae were calculated separately. Results During the five-year follow-up period, 21 patients had recurrences of breast cancer (9.8 per 1000 person-year; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.0-14.9), including three axillary recurrences (1.4 per 1000 person-year; 95% CI = 0.3-4.1). Screening breast US detected 12 breast cancers. The axillary scanning detected none of the axillary recurrences, but yielded 11.8 recalls per 1000 US screenings; the PPV3 for the breast and breast plus axillae were 18.3% and 15.1%, respectively. Conclusion Axillary recurrence was very rare in patient who underwent SLNB; additional axillary scanning did not provide axillary recurrence detection, but only increased the number of false-positive recalls and biopsies.

TI  - Resolving Teleseismic Earthquake Catalog and InSAR Data Discrepancies in Absolute Space to Explore Rupture Complexity Along the Ecuadorian Megathrust Fault
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 M-W 7.8 Pedernales, Ecuador, megathrust earthquake produced notable crustal deformation and generated an extensive aftershock sequence that included two M6.5+ events. We combine an improved teleseismic earthquake catalog for Ecuador with analysis of coseismic interferometric synthetic aperture radar data derived from the Sentinel-1A satellite to better delineate the spatial and temporal slip history of the megathrust fault in absolute space. The revised teleseismic catalog spans 1961-2016 and incorporates catalog phase onset times and waveform correlation derived differential times to locate earthquakes. Using teleseismic double-difference (DD) tomography to simultaneously solve for an updated regional 3-D compressional velocity model and locations yields earthquakes shifted similar to 25 km southwest relative to rapidly available teleseismic catalogs. The DD catalog better compares in absolute space to the Ecuadorian local catalog and better models the measured deformation fields of the 2016 Pedernales mainshock and largest aftershocks. Additionally, the DD mainshock location agrees with local-scale seismic and geodetic studies that show the 2016 event had concentrated slip on a highly coupled asperity that likely participated in the 1942 Ecuador megathrust earthquake. The two large aftershocks also ruptured on the megathrust where moderate to strong interseismic coupling is observed. The DD catalog contains moderate-sized aftershocks that concentrate outside high slip regions, primarily in areas that produced earthquakes during the interseismic cycle, and outside areas of aseismic slip. Development of rapid relative location approaches linking new seismicity to better constrained global catalogs could aid with near real-time hazard assessment in areas lacking local data.

This study examines reactions to punishment in the punished group. Specifically, it examines how members of an online community responded when law enforcement shut down their websites. Drawing on data from three discussion forums, the author argues that the crackdown produced solidarity and enhanced a particular moral worldview that strengthened the community and enabled it to survive by migrating en masse to new websites.

TI  - Effects of population, land cover change, and climatic variability on wetland resource degradation in a Ramsar listed Ghodaghodi Lake Complex, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands support livelihoods of millions of people in developing countries. However, wetland land cover change, as a result of growing population and subsequent anthropogenic activities, has been evident at a global scale, and ongoing micro-climate alteration has further deteriorating its ecological condition. Nepal is equally vulnerable to wetland changes that can have direct effects on the sustenance of local wetland-dependent people. This study thus attempts to look at how wetland areas of Nepal are undergoing changes, taking a case of Ghodaghodi Lake Complex (GLC). Remote sensing technique, climate, and population data were used in the analysis aided by focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Results showed that total population of the study area has been increased drastically in recent decades. Landsat image analysis for 25 years (1989-2016) depicts changes in the GLC in its land cover, with maximum expansion observed in settlement followed by river and banks, whereas maximum reduction was observed in forests, followed by areas of agricultural land and lake. Similarly, diurnal temperature is increasing while total annual rainfall is slightly decreasing during the same period. Locals have perceived ecological degradation in the GLC due to both anthropogenic pressure and climatic variability. The study outlines linkage of drivers for GLC degradation and finally makes recommendations to achieve longer term sustainability of the lake complex.

TI  - Causal analysis in control-impact ecological studies with observational data
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Randomized experiments have long been the gold standard in determining causal effects in ecological control-impact studies. However, it may be difficult to address many ecologically and policy-relevant control-impact questions-such as the effect of forest fragmentation or protected areas on biodiversity through experimental manipulation due to scale, costs and ethical considerations. Yet, ecologists may still draw causal insights in observational control-impact settings by exploiting research designs that approximate the experimental ideal. Here, we review the challenges of making causal inference in non-experimental control-impact scenarios as well as a suite of statistical tools specifically designed to overcome such challenges. These tools are widely used in fields where experimental research is more limited (i.e., medicine, economics), and could be applied by ecologists across numerous sub-disciplines. Using hypothetical examples, we discuss why bias is likely to plague observational control-impact studies in ways that do not surface with experimental manipulations, why bias is generally the barrier to causal inference, and different methods to overcome this bias. Satellite-, survey- and citizen-science data hold great potential for advancing key questions in ecology that would otherwise be prohibitive to pursue experimentally. However, to harness such data to understand causal impacts of land, environmental and policy changes, we must expand our toolset such that we can improve inference and more confidently advance ecological understanding and science-informed policy.

TI  - The bifurcation of the Nigerian cybercriminals: Narratives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) agents
T2  - TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - While this article sets out to advance our knowledge about the characteristics of Nigerian cybercriminals (Yahoo-Boys), it is also the first study to explore the narratives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) officers concerning them. It appraises symbolic interactionist insights to consider the ways in which contextual factors and worldview may help to illuminate officers' narratives of cybercriminals and the interpretations and implications of such accounts. Semi-structured interviews of forty frontline EFCC officers formed the empirical basis of this study and were subjected to a directed approach of qualitative content analysis. While prior studies, for example, indicated that only a group of cybercriminals deploy spiritual and magical powers to defraud victims (i.e. modus operandi), our data analysis extended this classification into more refined levels involving multiple features. In particular, analysis bifurcates cybercriminals and their operations based on three factors: educational-attainment, modus-operandi, and networks-collaborators. Results also suggest that these cybercriminals and their operations are embedded in "masculinity-and-material-wealth". These contributions thus have implications for a range of generally accepted viewpoints about these cybercriminals previously taken-for-granted. Since these criminals have victims all over the world, insights from our study may help various local and international agencies [a] to understand the actions/features of these two groups of cybercriminals better and develop more effective response strategies. [b] to appreciate the vulnerabilities of their victims better and develop more adequate support schemes. We also consider the limitations of social control agents' narratives on criminals.

TI  - Community greenness and neurobehavioral health in children and adolescents
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neighborhood greenness appears to be beneficial to human health. However, there are few studies on the relationship between greenness of children's residential communities and their neurobehavioral health.Objective: In this cross-sectional study, we examined the association between neighborhood greenness of children's residential area and their neurobehavioral health.Methods: We used a population-representative sample of school children (n = 1817) from 2012 and 2013 in South Korea. Parents or guardians of children completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess their children's neurobehavioral health. As a measurement for greenness, the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) at a 30-m resolution was retrieved from the Landsat satellite data operated by NASA. The MSAVI values were categorized into tertiles (low, moderate, high greenness) and each child was assigned the mean MSAVI within a 1.6-km radius of residence. We applied survey regressions of the CBCL transformed scores on the 3 levels of greenness, controlling for age, sex, physical activity, monthly family income, exposure to second-hand smoke, exposure to NO2, and blood lead level.Results: High greenness was associated with a lower Total CBCL score compared to low greenness ( -2.33, 95% CI, -4.10 to -0.56). Externalizing Behavior showed a slightly stronger association with greenness than did Internalizing Behavior. The inverse relationship with greenness was strongest for Attention Problems (-1.32; 95% CI: -2.58, -0.06). The magnitudes of the association were strongest when the buffer distance was 1600 m.Conclusions: Greenness of residential neighborhood was associated with lower problematic behavior scores in children, especially aggressive behaviors and attention problems.

TI  - Sea ice detection from persistent single-channel shortwave infrared satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The US Air Force has demonstrated an interest in deriving imagery products from classified military remote sensing platforms and making them available for civil and commercial operations. The US Air Forces Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) is one such satellite constellation. A novel aspect of OPIR imagery is its near-continuous capture of single channel shortwave infrared data over the Arctic. Although traditionally used for missile warning and strategic defense, the exceptionally high temporal resolution of the OPIR data stream makes it an attractive source for Arctic remote sensing, particularly as the Arctic has warmed at a rate nearly double that of lower latitudes. This work assesses the feasibility of using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - 16 (GOES-16) data as a proxy for OPIR imagery in the Arctic. Specifically, we seek to determine whether a single channel shortwave infrared (SWIR) approach can be used to detect and chart Arctic sea ice. We used a series of 32-image daily sets (4 images per hour x 8 h) over four-day periods acquired by GOES-16 in late April 2016 (as well as mid-March, mid-May, and mid-June) to chart sea ice, clouds and water in Hudson Bay, Canada. To do this, we applied image enhancement techniques to raw data imagery and then employed a time-based classification algorithm to the enhanced data cube. Overall, our method successfully discriminated sea ice from water and clouds when all conditions were present with improved discrimination over current daily products for sea ice charting in the Northern Hemisphere. The simple methodology of the developed algorithm is critical to ensuring the temporal resolution of the sensor is capitalized. The rapid timeline for production of this type of data is essential to the relevancy to military operations as well as emergency response/preparedness operations in the Arctic as it becomes more accessible in coming years. Our results make a compelling argument for the application of Air Force Missile Warning data to assist in the mapping, tracking, and assessment of sea ice in the high Arctic.

TI  - Investigating Spatiotemporal Patterns of Surface Urban Heat Islands in the Hangzhou Metropolitan Area, China, 2000-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has resulted in a serious urban heat island effect in the Hangzhou Metropolitan Area of China during the past decades, negatively impacting the area's sustainable development. Using Landsat images from 2000 to 2015, this paper analysed the spatial-temporal patterns in a surface urban heat island (SUHI) and investigated its relationship with urbanization. The derived land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) were used to quantify the SUHI effect. Spatial analysis was employed to illustrate the spatial distribution and evolution of a SUHI. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was implemented to identify statistically significant factors that influenced the change of SUHII. The results show that hot and very hot spot areas increased from 387 km(2) in 2000 to 615 km(2) in 2015, and the spatial distribution changed from a monocentric to a polycentric pattern. The results also indicate that high-LST clusters moved towards the east, which was consistent with urban expansion throughout the study period. These changes mirrored the intensive development of three satellite towns. The statistical analysis suggests that both population density (e.g., changes in population density, CPOPD) and green space (e.g., changes in green space fraction, CGSF) strongly affected the changes in SUHII at different stages of the urbanization process. Increasing in population density has a lastingly effect on elevating the SUHII, whereas increasing green space has a constantly significant effect in mitigating the SUHII. These findings suggest that urban planners and policymakers should protect the cultivated lands in suburbs and exurbs, and make efforts to improve the utilization efficiency of construction land by encouraging the migrating population to live within the existing built-up regions.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of limited irrigation on crop water productivity and reducing deep groundwater exploitation in the North China Plain using an agro-hydrological model: I. Parameter sensitivity analysis, calibration and model validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The agro-hydrological Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant-WOrld-FOod-STudy (SWAP-WOFOST) model in a distributed manner represents an important tool for evaluating agro-hydrological cycles and irrigation strategies at different spatiotemporal scales. The reliability of the model simulations and evaluations is dependent on the generation of the distributed simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors, as well as parameter calibration and model validation. In this study, we focused on the most typical overexploited deep groundwater area in the North China Plain (NCP). First, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) was used to conduct global sensitivity analyses for three modules in the SWAP-WOFOST model to identify the parameters that significantly influence the objective variables for calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area. On this basis, the parameters were calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed data from each station. The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values for soil water content, soil salt concentration, winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), winter wheat aboveground biomass, winter wheat yield, summer maize LAI, summer maize aboveground biomass and summer maize yield were 14.93%, 27.20%, 24.60%, 25.27%, 23.12%, 24.55%, 21.33% and 17.94%, respectively, during the calibration period; and the corresponding NRMSE values were 16.26%, 29.36%, 24.20%, 22.75%, 21.77%, 22.03%, 24.38% and 18.62%, respectively, during the validation period. The model provided a good simulation for the soil water contents and summer maize yields and a fair simulation for the other objective variables. Furthermore, a distributed SWAP-WOFOST model was generated by overlaying 12 maps involving meteorology, soil, crops, land use, water resources and administrative divisions, yielding 2809 simulation units. Finally, the simulation accuracy of the distributed model was evaluated under the current irrigation conditions. The results showed that the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize were consistent with the statistical values, and the simulated evapotranspiration matched the remote sensing data with acceptable precision. In summary, the distributed SWAP-WOFOST model could be used as an effective tool for simulating crop water productivity in time and space under limited irrigation scenarios and for evaluating the effect of optimized limited irrigation schemes on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region.

TI  - Satellite-based prediction of daily SO<sub>2</sub> exposure across China using a high-quality random forest-spatiotemporal Kriging (RF-STK) model for health risk assessment
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China has been suffered from the severe sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution in the past decades. The spatiotemporal estimation and health effect assessment of SO2 using two-stage machine learning models have not been performed yet. In this study, a high-quality model named random forest coupled with spatiotemporal Kriging (RF-STK) model was developed to estimate the daily SO2 concentration across the entire China from May 2014 to May 2015 based on the satellite data and geographic covariates. Compared with other statistical methods, the RF-STK model showed the better explanatory performance, with the 10-fold cross-validation R-2 = 0.62 (root mean-square error (RMSE) = 10.36 mu g/m(3)) for daily estimations. The annually mean population-weighted SO2 concentration was estimated to be 30.49 +/- 10.83 mu g/m(3) (mean standard deviation). The SO2 levels displayed the remarkably seasonal variation with the peak in winter (47.27 +/- 22.64 mu g/m(3)), followed by ones in autumn (28.41 +/- 10.41 mu g/m(3)) and spring (25.92 +/- 7.95 mu g/m(3)), and in summer (21.33 +/- 6.51 mu g/m(3)). At the national scale, only 20.31% of the population lived in the safe regions (population-weighted SO2 concentration < 20 mu g/m(3)). The higher population-weighted SO2 concentrations were mainly concentrated on some provinces of North China Plain (NCP) (e.g., Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong), followed by the provinces of Northeast China, and the lowest one in Hainan (8.31 +/- 1.38 mu g/m(3)). The mean all-cause mortalities due to excessive SO2 exposure were estimated to be 131,957 cases, accounting for 0.009% of the whole Chinese population. Among all of the diseases, the mortalities per year were in the order of respiratory disease (RD) (11913 cases) > cardiovascular disease (CVD) (11386 cases) > chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (8112 cases) > cerebrovascular disease (CEVD) (2188 cases). The statistical modelling of SO2 at a national scale provided the valuable data for epidemiological research and air pollution prevention.

TI  - Comparisons of the vertical distributions of aerosols in the CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem datasets in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we compared the aerosol profiles derived from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) over China with those simulated by the Global 3-D Atmospheric Chemical Transport model (GEOS-Chem) for the period of 2007-2014. Multiple steps were implemented in the data analysis. First, we validated CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem aerosol optical depth (AOD) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, both CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem AOD were found to 30%similar to 50% underestimations in eastern China and 60%similar to 80% underestimations in western China. Second, MODIS AOD was introduced to normalize the aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) of both CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem in each 1-km layer below 10 km to achieve a uniform comparison. Linear regression analysis between the normalized CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem AECs yielded better correlation coefficients and lower mean relative differences than the direct comparisons from the original data. Finally, we investigated the vertical distributions of aerosol components over the North, South, Northwest and Tibet regions of China. Our findings are summarized based on different aerosol components as the following. Dust aerosols: The percentages of CALIPSO polluted dust to total dust in the North and South regions (50%similar to 68% in different seasons) are higher than those in the Northwest and Tibet regions (25%similar to 45%). Thus, the polluted dust classification significantly affects our comparisons in the North and South. For CALIPSO pure dust, its concentrations in the higher layers are larger than those of GEOS-Chem. Continental/sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) aerosols: The percentages of CALIPSO continental aerosols to total aerosols are almost negligible throughout the four regions (<10%). Even including the polluted dust in the continental aerosol, their combined contributions remain similar to 10% lower than GEOS-Chem SNA. Thus, we found that the current CALIPSO aerosol classification scheme is limited in the detection of anthropogenic aerosols in China. Soot aerosols: The GEOS-Chem soot aerosol values are a factor of 2-4 times lower than those of CALIPSO. The omission of small agricultural field burnings in the GEOS-Chem emission inventory might have resulted in the soot aerosol underestimations.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is described as one of the most important environmental parameters of the land surface biophysical process. Commonly, the remote-sensed LST products yield a tradeoff between high temporal and high spatial resolution. Thus, many downscaling algorithms have been proposed to address this issue. Recently, downscaling with machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), etc., have gained more recognition with fast operation and high computing precision. This paper intends to make a comparison between machine learning algorithms to downscale the LST product of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer from 990 to 90 m, and downscaling results would be validated by the resampled LST product of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer. The results are further compared with the classical algorithm-thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP), using images derived from two representatives kind of areas of Beijing city. The result shows that: 1) all machine learning algorithms produce higher accuracy than TsHARP; 2) the performance of TsHARP on urban area is unsatisfactory than rural because of the weak indication of impervious surface by normalized difference vegetation index, however, machine learning algorithms get the desired results on both two areas, in which ANN and RF models perform well with high accuracy and fast arithmetic, SVM also gets a good result but there is a smoothing effect on land surface; and 3) additionally, machine learning algorithms are promising to achieve a universal framework which can downscale LST for any area within the training data from long spatiotemporal sequences.

TI  - The variation of vegetation productivity and its relationship to temperature and precipitation based on the GLASS-LAI of different African ecosystems from 1982 to 2013
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many studies have focused on the changes of partial or single African ecosystems and the drivers of those changes. However, focusing only on partial or single ecosystems has limited the understanding of the relationships between the vegetation and climate changes in all of the African ecosystems. In this study, the temporal trends of the satellite-derived annual mean leaf area index (GLASS-LAI) were analyzed, and the inter-annual relationships were developed between the annual mean LAI and the climate variables (precipitation and temperature) for the time period ranging from 1982 to 2013. Additionally, this study applied seasonal curves and step-wise multiple regression methods to investigate the relationships between intra-annual LAI and climate changes. It was found that the GLASS-LAI over half of Africa had shown general significant greening or browning trends during the period from 1982 to 2013. From the results of inter-annual analysis, with mean annual precipitation lower than 600mm, the greening of the savannas and grasslands in the Sahel was found to highly correspond with the increased precipitation. In contrast, the evergreen broadleaf forests in the Gulf of Guinea and Congo Basin showed strongly positive responses to the annual temperature when the mean annual temperature was below 25 degrees C. In regard to the intra-annual responses, the precipitation with 1-month lags was found to be helpful for the vegetation growth, with the exception of the evergreen broadleaf. The results of this research study indicated that the different land-covers in Africa had displayed clear differences in their annual trends during the examined 32-year period and had responded differently to the inter- and intra-annual climate drivers. This difference was evident by the characteristics of the vegetation covers and the geographic distributions. Therefore, further examinations of these differences can potentially improve the understanding of the land surface-atmosphere interactions among the different African ecosystems.

TI  - Thin cloud removal with residual symmetrical concatenation network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin cloud removal is important for enhancing the utilization of optical remote sensing imagery. Different from thick cloud removal, the pixels contaminated by thin clouds still preserve some surface information. Therefore, thin cloud removal methods usually focus on suppressing the cloud influence instead of replacing the cloudy pixels. In this paper, we proposed a deep residual symmetrical concatenation network (RSC-Net) to make end-to-end thin cloud removal. The RSC-Net is based on the encoding-decoding framework consisting of multiple residual convolutional layers and residual deconvolutional layers. The feature maps of each convolutional layer are copied and concatenated to the symmetrical deconvolutional layer. We used real cloud-contaminated and cloud-free Landsat-8 data very close in time for both training and testing. The RSC-Net is trained to take cloudy images as input and directly produce corresponding cloud-free images as output with all the bands together except the cirrus band and the panchromatic band. Compared with other traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning based methods, the experimental results show that our method has significant advantages in removing thin cloud contaminations in different bands.

TI  - Using multi-indices approach to quantify mangrove changes over the Western Arabian Gulf along Saudi Arabia coast
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves habitat present an important resource for large coastal communities benefiting from activities such as fisheries, forest products and clean water as well as protection against coastal erosion and climate related extreme events. Yet they are increasingly threatened by natural pressure and anthropogenic activities. We observed an inaccurate distribution of mangroves over the Western Arabian Gulf (WAG) which is a vital habitat and resource for the local ecosystem, according to the United Stated Geological Survey (USGS) mangrove database through spectral analysis. Change detection analysis is conducted on mangrove forests along the Saudi Arabian coast of the WAG for the years 2000, 2010 and 2018 using Landsat 7 & 8 data. Three supervised classification methodologies are employed for mangrove mapping, including Supported Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), referred to as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF). CART's accuracy was recorded to be > 95% while other classifiers were > 90%. The CART supervised learning classifier, mapping mangroves' distribution and biomass using Google Earth Engine (GEE) online platform, indicates an overall increase in the northern Tarut Bay and Tarut Island, by 0.21 km(2) from 2000 to 2010 and by 1.4 km(2) from 2010 to 2018. The increase might be due to mitigation strategies such as mangrove breeding and plantation. It can be challenging to detect changes in certain regions due to the inadequate resolution of Landsat where submerged mangroves can be confused with salt marshes and macro algae. We employed a new method to identify and analyze submerged mangrove forests distribution via a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in Abu Ali Island. Our results show the robustness of SMRI as an effective indicator to detect submerged mangroves in both high and medium spatial resolution satellite images. NDVI values differentiated submerged mangroves from tidal flats between Landsat 7 & 8 as well as during conditions of low and high tides. High resolution WorldView-2 image showed agreement of mangroves distribution with the SMRI and NDVI results.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping With a Local Spatial-Temporal Dependence Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mixed pixel problem is common in remote sensing. A soft classification can generate land cover class fraction images that illustrate the areal proportions of the various land cover classes within pixels. The spatial distribution of land cover classes within each mixed pixel is, however, not represented. Super-resolution land cover mapping (SRM) is a technique to predict the spatial distribution of land cover classes within the mixed pixel using fraction images as input. Spatial-temporal SRM (STSRM) extends the basic SRM to include a temporal dimension by using a finer-spatial resolution land cover map that pre- or postdates the image acquisition time as ancillary data. Traditional STSRM methods often use one land cover map as the constraint, but neglect the majority of available land cover maps acquired at different dates and of the same scene in reconstructing a full state trajectory of land cover changes when applying STSRM to time-series data. In addition, the STSRM methods define the temporal dependence globally, and neglect the spatial variation of land cover temporal dependence intensity within images. A novel local STSRM (LSTSRM) is proposed in this paper. LSTSRM incorporates more than one available land cover map to constrain the solution, and develops a local temporal dependence model, in which the temporal dependence intensity may vary spatially. The results show that LSTSRM can eliminate speckle-like artifacts and reconstruct the spatial patterns of land cover patches in the resulting maps, and increase the overall accuracy compared with other STSRM methods.

TI  - Spatial patterns and driving factors of surface urban heat island intensity: A comparative study for two agriculture-dominated regions in China and the USA
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) effect causes tremendous ecological and environmental consequences. A better understanding of its spatial pattern and driving factors is highly required for designing effective mitigation strategies and adaptation measures. This study compared spatial patterns of surface UHI intensity (SUHII) and their driving factors between two agriculture-dominated regions (i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), China and Illinois-Indiana-Ohio (IIO), the USA) based on the MODIS land surface temperature dataset. The results showed that: (1) IIO had significantly stronger daytime SUHII than BTH, while the nighttime SUHII showed an opposite phenomenon. (2) SUHIIs of different time were positively correlated in IIO, but the winter daytime SUHII was negatively correlated with the nighttime SUHII in BTH. (3) Spatial variations of summer SUHII were better predicted in IIO than that in BTH, but the opposite result was found for winter SUHII. (4) Some regression coefficients of the multiple linear regression models when modeling winter daytime SUHII were opposite between IIO and BTH. Findings of this study indicated different dominant surface energy processes in controlling the spatial pattern of SUHII in these two regions of different countries and recommended varied adaptation measures and mitigation strategies.

TI  - Estimation of winter wheat yield based on coupling remote sensing information and WheatSM model
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - WheatSM, a wheat growth model developed for different types of winter wheat in China, is applied in scientific research and public service. The coupling of remote sensing information with crop growth model has important application value in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation in large area. Hebi City in Henan Province is a main winter wheat producing area of China. With Hebi as the study area, the optimized reconstructed time series MODIS LAI data from 2013 to 2017 was coupled with WheatSM model with both SCE-UA optimal assimilation and EnKF assimilation methods to estimate the yield of winter wheat at both site and regional scales. The results showed that the introduction of remote sensing data with uncertainties did not improve the simulation accuracy of the crop model on the premise of strictly calibrating the parameters of WheatSM at site scale. The quality of remote sensing observation data had greater effects on the results of EnKF assimilation method than that of SCE-UA optimal assimilation method. At regional scale, the accuracy of data assimilation results with both SCE-UA and EnKF methods were higher than that without data assimilation. RMSE between simulated yield and statistical yield decreased from 2036.0 kg " hm-2 to 1641 kg " hm-2 with SCE-UA method and to 1587.7 kg " hm-2 with EnKF method, with a reduction of 19.4% and 22.0%, respectively. The efficiency of EnKF assimilation method was higher than that of SCE-UA optimal assimilation method. Our results could provide a basis for the selection of data assimilation strategies coupling WheatSM with remote sensing data.

TI  - The study of regional thermal environments in urban agglomerations using a new method based on metropolitan areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban agglomerations (UAs) are an outcome of regional urbanization reaching relatively advanced stages of development. The advancement of UAs in regional-spatial organization has been recognized worldwide. However, due to dense regional urbanization. UAs are threatened by various regional eco-environmental stresses. The topic of UAs is a hotspot of geo-science and sustainability science, which seek to analyse whether UAs may be a solution to regional eco-environmental problems. This study proposes a new method of analysing the regional thermal environment (RTE) of 3 world-class UAs in China based on Remote sensing and Geographic Information System (RS&GIS) technology using the metropolitan area (MA) as the basic unit and by using data obtained from MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products from 2000 to 2015. The results showed that MAs caused the LST of their influenced range (including the interior of the MA and its surface urban heat island footprint (FP)) to increase from 0.45 to 223 degrees C with a few built-up areas. The threat of the FP to the RTE was caused mainly by large-area warming areas, but the threat was small in terms of the temperature increase. We found that 23% of the influence of MAs on the RTE was caused by fringe areas and that this heat was superimposed on the FPs of core areas, which caused FPs to significantly increase in capacity of heat island and area. In this study, the influence of the spatial organization of UAs was emphasized. We believe that this result is more consistent with actual conditions in research on the thermal environment of UAs. Meanwhile, the authors hope that these findings will serve as a reference for sustainable development research on UAs all over the world. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article

CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Numerous studies on environmental modeling and ecological process lay emphasis on the fundamental information of the impervious surface area (ISA). However, accurate ISA extraction from high-resolution satellite images remains challenging due to both the high diversity of land covers and shadow effects from tall buildings and trees. To address the problem, a discriminative Optical-SAR-LiDAR dictionary sparse representation classification (OSLD-SRC) method was proposed using high-resolution WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, TerraSAR-X, and airborne LiDAR data. First, it used multisource data and fuzzy samples by low-pass filtering (LPF) to solve the problem of roads and buildings misclassification; second, it learned the Optical-SAR-LiDAR dictionary for nonshadow and shadow classes, and then used discriminative sparse coding method for classification to reduce the shadow effects and improve the ISA extraction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Subsidence and Morphologic Variations in Mexico City Generated by the Earthquakes of September 2017
T2  - GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Two earthquakes that occurred in southwest Mexico generated subsidence and morphologic changes in the area of Mexico City. To study the subsidence, an interferometric procedure was carried out using four interferometric pairs acquired from the radar satellite Sentinel-1 in IW (Interferometric Wide Swath) TOPS (Terrain Observation by Progressive Scan) SLC (Single Look Complex) mode. Four interferograms and four displacement maps were generated. To quantify the morphologic changes, a synergism of the Sentinel-1 radar bands in IW GRD (Ground Range Detected) mode and the SPOT 6/7 optical bands was considered. The synergism consists of a hybrid image formed by the radar bands and the optical bands. Principal component analysis was applied to the bands of the hybrid image. The first three components were retained, and a divergence operator was then applied to the vector field formed by these components, producing a texture map. The texture map was evaluated in conjunction with the interferogram and displacement map for the September 2017 earthquakes. Results indicated a complex pattern of subsidence and morphologic changes. The interferogram and subsidence of September 2017 correlated with a map of earthquake damages.

TI  - Multi-decadal trends and influences on dissolved organic carbon distribution in the Barataria Basin, Louisiana from in-situ and Landsat/MODIS observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Barataria Basin, a deltaic marsh-estuary system in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), is an important source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the coastal ecosystem. To assess DOM dynamics, monthly measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and colored DOM (CDOM; an optical proxy for DOC) absorption were obtained over a three-year period (2008-2011) along a transect encompassing the upper, middle and lower regions of the Barataria Basin estuary. While CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a(g)355) generally decreased and spectral slope at 275-295 nm (S275-295) increased along the transect from the upper to lower basin, deviations were observed associated with hydrologic and meteorological influences. An application of wavelet analysis to the time-series of a(g)355 and various freshwater sources revealed a spatiotemporal resonance of ag355 with freshwater input from the Mississippi River (MR), the controlled freshwater discharge from the Davis Pond freshwater diversion, and rainfall in the lower, middle and upper basins, respectively. Field measurements and Landsat/MODIS data spanning across different seasons between 2008 and 2011 were used to develop optimized a(g)355 empirical algorithms for the high river flow, cold front, and normal conditions. Power law models relating a band ratio (green/red) of a satellite sensor to a(g)355 showed good performance for the MODIS-Aqua (R-2 similar to 0.81-0.83, N = 581) and Landsat-5 TM (R-2 similar to 0.72-0.79, N = 304) imagery. a(g)355-DOC relationships (R-2 similar to 0.77-0.84, N = 306) applied to historical Landsat-5 TM (1985-2011) and MODIS-Aqua imagery (2002-2012) showed strong environmental influences on multi-decadal CDOM and DOC spatiotemporal trends. Satellite-derived DOC agreed reasonably well with in-situ measured DOC (averaged R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 2.13). While the time-series DOC showed seasonality and decreasing gradients from the upper to lower basin, an overall increase in DOC was observed in the upper and middle basins from 1985 to 2012. However, in the lower basin, DOC increased from 1985 to 2006 but decreased from 2007 to 2012, likely due to the impact of two major hurricanes in 2005. Furthermore, relationships between satellite-derived DOC and land cover variations (1985-2011) along the wetland-estuary interfaces derived from Landsat-5 TM supervised classification showed an increase in DOC with corresponding increase in developed area in the upper basin, while in the lower basin, DOC increased by 41% (R-2 = 0.54) between 1985 and 2006 corresponding to a 17% decrease in salt marsh area, suggesting strong land use/land loss impact on the long-term DOC trends in Barataria Basin.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Built-Up Areas by Fusing VIIRS Nighttime Lights and Landsat-8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world urbanizes and builds more infrastructure, the extraction of built-up areas using remote sensing is crucial for monitoring land cover changes and understanding urban environments. Previous studies have proposed a variety of methods for mapping regional and global built-up areas. However, most of these methods rely on manual selection of training samples and classification thresholds, leading to low extraction efficiency. Furthermore, thematic accuracy is limited by interference from other land cover types like bare land, which hinder accurate and timely extraction and monitoring of dynamic changes in built-up areas. This study proposes a new method to map built-up areas by combining VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) nighttime lights (NTL) data and Landsat-8 multispectral imagery. First, an adaptive NTL threshold was established, vegetation and water masks were superimposed, and built-up training samples were automatically acquired. Second, the training samples were employed to perform supervised classification of Landsat-8 data before deriving the preliminary built-up areas. Third, VIIRS NTL data were used to obtain the built-up target areas, which were superimposed onto the built-up preliminary classification results to obtain the built-up area fine classification results. Four major metropolitan areas in Eurasia formed the study areas, and the high spatial resolution (20 m) built-up area product High Resolution Layer Imperviousness Degree (HRL IMD) 2015 served as the reference data. The results indicate that our method can accurately and automatically acquire built-up training samples and adaptive thresholds, allowing for accurate estimates of the spatial distribution of built-up areas. With an overall accuracy exceeding 94.7%, our method exceeded accuracy levels of the FROM-GLC and GUL built-up area products and the PII built-up index. The accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method have significant potential for global built-up area mapping and dynamic change monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of hydroclimatic variables for maize yield estimation using crop model and remotely sensed data assimilation
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer-Cropping System Model (DSSAT) and data assimilation scheme (DSSAT-DA) to estimate maize (i.e., corn) yield and to evaluate the sensitivity of maize yield to hydroclimatic variables (i.e., precipitation, air temperatures, solar radiation, soil water). The remotely sensed soil moisture products, which includes Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, were assimilated to DSSAT model by using the Ensemble Kalman Filtering approach. It was observed that both DSSAT and DSSAT-DA models can able to capture the annual trend of maize yield, although they overestimate the observed maize yield. The DSSAT-DA scheme assimilated with remotely sensed products slightly improves the model performance. The antecedent hydroclimatic information can influence the subsequent maize yield. The maize yield is sensitive to the soil water availability and precipitation amount, especially at the antecedent 1 month time to sowing and the subsequent second and third month's growing period.

TI  - Determining switching threshold for NIR-SWIR combined atmospheric correction algorithm of ocean color remote sensing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate atmospheric correction is decisive for ocean color remote sensing applications. Near infrared (NIR)-based algorithm performs well for clear waters; while shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based algorithm can obtain good results for turbid waters, however, it tends to produce noisy patterns for clear waters. A practical strategy is to apply NIR- and SWIR-based algorithm for clear and turbid waters, respectively, which is called NIR-SWIR combined atmospheric correction algorithm. However, the currently applied switching scheme for the NIR-SWIR algorithm undermines the atmospheric correction performance. This study aimed to find an applicable switching scheme for NIR-SWIR algorithm. Four MODIS land bands were used to switch the NIR- and SWIR-based algorithms. A simulated dataset was used to evaluate atmospheric performance of NIR- and SWIR-based algorithm. The switching threshold for each MODIS land band was determined as an R-rs value at which SWIR-based algorithm performed better than NIR-based algorithm. The switching scheme was evaluated using matchups of simultaneous MODIS Aqua images and AERONET-OC data, and then tested with a MODIS Aqua image over the western Pacific Ocean. Results showed that the switching threshold for R-rs(469), R-rs(555), R-rs(645) and R-rs(859) were 0.009, 0.016, 0.009 and 0.0006 sr(-1), respectively; R-rs(645) with a threshold of 0.009 sr(-1) and R-rs(555) with a threshold of 0.016 sr(-1) worked well for NIR-SWIR algorithm, while R-rs(469) and R-rs(859) produced worse performance. Therefore, R-rs(555) > 0.016 sr(-1) or R-rs(645) > 0.009 sr(-1) was recommended as the switching scheme for NIR-SWIR algorithm. Considering contrasted estuarine, coastal and some inland waters, combining NIR- and SWIR-based atmospheric correction algorithm with the proposed switching scheme should be useful for remote sensing monitoring over these waters.

AB  - In order to further improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-SiO2 composite aerogels under the irradiation of visible light, F/W coped TiO2-SiO2 (F-y-W0.02TiO2-SiO2) composite aerogel was prepared by ambient pressure drying with solvothermal assisted crystallization process. The microstructure and photocatalytic activity of the composite aerogels under visible light irradiation were investigated. The results indicate that the obtained F-y-W0.02TiO2-SiO2 composite aerogels exhibited typical mesoporous structure with higher specific surface area 105-223 m(2)/g and pore volume 0.51-0.66 cc/g. Adding appropriate amount of HF into the composite sol is favorable for enlarging the pore volume and pore size of the aerogel products, and the F-y-W0.02TiO2-SiO2 composite aerogels with F/W molar ratio = 0.1 exhibited the highest removing efficiency for the pollutant rhodamine B in the water. In addition, the quantum efficiency of the samples was investigated by assembling a dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) using the F-y-W0.02TiO2-SiO2 composite aerogel coating as the photoanode, and it was found that the F-y-W0.02TiO2-SiO2 composite aerogel with F/W molar ratio = 0.1 exhibited higher photoelectron conversion efficiency.

TI  - Top Cloud Motion Field of Typhoon Megi-2016 Revealed by GF-4 Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-4 (GF-4) is the first high-resolution geostationary satellite of China, launched on December 29, 2015. Its visible-near infrared optical sensor is capable of imaging the earth at 50 m resolution, covering a 512 km x 512 km area with a minimum imaging interval of 20 s. More than 300 GF-4 images, taken in four sequences with imaging rates of 36 and 69 s per scene, captured the development of Typhoon Megi-2016-from its peak in the afternoon of September 26, 2016 to its dispersion two days later on September 28. These consecutive images recorded the motion field of the typhoon's top clouds nearly continuously. By using advanced image matching technology, the motion has been estimated for every pixel, at subpixel accuracy from image pairs with 179 and 206 s intervals. The process has generated time series of atmospheric motion vector (AMV) fields at 50 m spatial resolution for the whole imaged area. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that such high-resolution and nearly continuous AMV data of a typhoon system have been produced. The data provide accurate measurements of the typhoon top cloud motion speed and direction, and reveal quantitative details of the motion field spatiotemporal evolution at high altitude. The finding that the high altitude top cloud motion speed is significantly lower than that recorded at low altitude below the planetary boundary layer is of scientific value and further exploitation of the motion data can lead to a better understanding of typhoon dynamics and thus improve cyclone modeling.

AB  - Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have particle diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) are hazardous to public health whose concentration has been either measured on the ground or inferred from satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD). The latter is subject to numerous sources of errors, making the satellite retrievals of PM2.5 highly uncertain. This study developed an ensemble machine-learning (ML) algorithm for estimating PM2.5 concentration directly from Advanced Himawari Imager satellite measured top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances in 2016 integrated with meteorological parameters. The algorithm is demonstrated to perform well across China with high accuracies at different temporal scales. The model has an overall cross-validation coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.86 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 17.3 mu g m(-3) for hourly PM2.5 concentration estimation. Such accuracies of the estimation on PM2.5 concentration by using TOA reflectance directly are comparable with those of the common methods on estimating PM2.5 concentration by using satellite-derived AODs, but the former has a relatively stronger predictive power relating to spatial-temporal coverages than the latter. Annual and seasonal variations of PM2.5 concentration over three major the developed regions in China are estimated using the model and analyzed. The relatively stronger predictive ability of developed model in this study may help provide information about the diurnal cycle of PM2.5 concentrations as well as aid in monitoring the processes of regional pollution episodes and the evolution of PM2.5 concentration.

TI  - Modelling Reservoir Turbidity Using Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery by Gene Expression Programming
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to develop a reliable turbidity model to assess reservoir turbidity based on Landsat-8 satellite imagery. Models were established by multiple linear regression (MLR) and gene-expression programming (GEP) algorithms. Totally 55 and 18 measured turbidity data from Tseng-Wen and Nan-Hwa reservoir paired and screened with satellite imagery. Finally, MLR and GEP were applied to simulated 13 turbid water data for critical turbidity assessment. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (R-RMSE) calculated for model performance evaluation. The result show that, in model development, MLR and GEP shows a similar consequent. However, in model testing, the R-2, RMSE, and R-RMSE of MLR and GEP are 0.7277 and 0.8278, 0.7248 NTU and 0.5815 NTU, 22.26% and 17.86%, respectively. Accuracy assessment result shows that GEP is more reasonable than MLR, even in critical turbidity situation, GEP is more convincible. In the model performance evaluation, MLR and GEP are normal and good level, in critical turbidity condition, GEP even belongs to outstanding level. These results exhibit GEP denotes rationality and with relatively good applicability for turbidity simulation. From this study, one can conclude that GEP is suitable for turbidity modeling and is accurate enough for reservoir turbidity estimation.

TI  - Derivation of Vegetation Optical Depth and Water Content in the Source Region of the Yellow River using the FY-3B Microwave Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses the brightness temperature at the given microwave frequency (18.7 GHz) from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on-board the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) satellite to improve the tau-omega model by considering the radiative contribution from waterbody in the pixels over the wetland of the Yellow River source region, China. In order to retrieve vegetation optical depth (VOD), a dual-polarization slope parameter is defined to express the surface emissivity in the tau-omega model as the sum of soil emissivity and waterbody emissivity. In the regions with no waterbody, the original tau-omega model without considering waterbody impact is used to derive VOD. With use of the field observed vegetation water content (VWC) in the source region of the Yellow River during the summer of 2012, a regression relationship between VOD and VWC is established and then the vegetation parameter b is estimated. The relationship is employed to derive the spatial VWC during the entire vegetation growing period. The VOD retrieved is invalid and failed in some part of the study area by using the previous tau-omega model, while the results from the improved tau-omega model indicate that the VOD is in the range of 0.20 to 1.20 and the VWC is in the range of 0.20kg/m(2) to 1.40kg/m(2) in the entire source region of the Yellow River in 2012. Both VOD and VWC exhibit a pattern of low values in the west part and high values in the east part. The largest regional variations appear along the Yellow River. The comparison between the remote-sensing-estimated VWC and the ground-measured VWC gives the root mean square error of 0.12kg/m(2). These assessments reveal that with considering the fractional seasonal wetlands in the source region of the Yellow River, the microwave remote sensing measurements from the FY-3B MWRI can be successfully used to retrieve the VWC in the source region of the Yellow River.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Based Breast Cancer Nodal Metastasis Detection
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context.-Nodal metastasis of a primary tumor influences therapy decisions for a variety of cancers. Histologic identification of tumor cells in lymph nodes can be laborious and error-prone, especially for small tumor foci.Objective.-To evaluate the application and clinical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (LYmph Node Assistant or LYNA) for detection of metastatic breast cancer in sentinel lymph node biopsies.Design.-Whole slide images were obtained from hematoxylin-eosin-stained lymph nodes from 399 patients (publicly available Camelyon16 challenge dataset). LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility.Results.-LYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 "normal" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles.Conclusions.-Artificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results).

TI  - Inversion of Lake Bathymetry through Integrating Multi-Temporal Landsat and ICESat Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake bathymetry provides valuable information for lake basin planning and treatment, lake watershed erosion and siltation management, water resource planning, and environmental protection. Lake bathymetry has been surveyed with sounding techniques, including single-beam and multi-beam sonar sounding, and unmanned ship sounding. Although these techniques have high accuracy, most of them require long survey cycles and entail a high degree of difficulty. On the contrary, optical remote sensing inversion methods are easy to implement, but tend to provide less accurate bathymetry measures, especially when applied to turbid waters. The present study, therefore, aims to improve the accuracy of bathymetry measurements through integrating Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite's Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICESat/GLAS) data, and water level data measured at hydrological stations. First, the boundaries of a lake at multiple dates were derived using water extraction, initial boundary extraction, and Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+) strip removal processing techniques. Second, ICESat/GLAS data were introduced to obtain additional topographic information of a lake. The striped topography of a lake's area was then obtained through eliminating and correcting erroneous points and interpolating the values of unknown points. Third, the entire bathymetry of the lake was obtained through interpolating water level values of lake boundary points in various dates. Experiments show that accurate bathymetry (+/- 1 m) can be successfully derived.

TI  - Identifying Alternative Wetting and Drying (AWD) Adoption in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta: A Change Detection Approach
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Alternative wetting and drying (AWD) is an increasingly popular water-saving practice in rice production in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta, especially considering the impact of projected climate change and reduced water availability. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to determine adoption without deploying thousands of costly household surveys. This research used European Space Agency Sentinel-1a and 1b radar data, combined with in-situ moisture readings, to determine AWD adoption through change detection of a time series wetness index (WI). By using a beta coefficient of the radar data, the WI avoided the pitfalls of cloud cover, surface roughness, and vegetative interference that arise from the sigma coefficient data. The analysis illustrated an AWD adoption likelihood scale across the delta and it showed potential for the use of remotely sensed data to detect adoption. Trends across the Vietnamese delta showed higher adoption rates inland, with lower adoption of AWD in the coastal provinces. These results were supported by a simultaneous effort to collect household level adoption data as part of the same project. However, correlation between the WI values and in situ soil moisture meter readings were most accurate in alluvial soils, illustrating a particularly strong relationship between soil type and WI model robustness. The research suggests that future change detection efforts should focus on retrieving a multi-season dataset and employing a power density analysis on the time series data to fully understand the periodicity of dry down patterns.

TI  - Remote sensing-based mapping of the destruction to Aleppo during the Syrian Civil War between 2011 and 2017
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of damage caused by conflict can be difficult to determine from ground-based surveys, particularly in the context of violence and unsafe conditions. Earth Observation data provides a non-invasive method for rapid damage assessment over wide geographic areas. In this study we use Landsat Imagery captured between 2011 and 2017 to assess the damage in Aleppo, Syria caused by conflict during the Syrian Civil War. Extracting temporal changes in urban environments is complex and the capabilities of traditional spectral-based methodologies are limited. We examined the effectiveness of the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and two texture-based metrics (correlation and homogeneity) at classifying changes in reflectance characteristics within urban environments caused by building damage and consequent changes in surface orientation. Homogeneity was a more effective texture measure than correlation (overall accuracy of 79% vs 50%). Results indicated that between 45% and 57% of Aleppo was damaged during the study period, including up to 57% of former rebel held areas and between 34% and 46% of government areas and their surrounds. We used SPOT-6 imagery for accuracy assessment. Damage to Aleppo has yet to be fully quantified and several parts of the city remain unsafe and inaccessible. The results of this study highlight the potential offered by texture analysis for mapping damage to urban areas with freely available imagery and can be readily applied to natural disasters such as earthquakes and the aftermath of extreme weather events.

AB  - Agricultural activities conducted in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya show a significant decline of productivity levels. This phenomenon is mainly related to limited availability of water resources, lack of supporting irrigation, and harvesting techniques ineffectiveness. Production risks reduction is closely related with a better use of water resources and a better understanding of the effects resulting from the multiple interactions between climate, agricultural vegetation, soil type, and crops management techniques. In this paper, a remote and automatic agricultural monitoring system is presented as an effective alternative to the most traditional in situ measurements and observations. We investigated the use of phenological information extracted from satellite imagery combined with crop calendar and supported by agro-ecological zoning (AEZ) in accurate crop classification and monitoring. Vegetation indices extracted from Landsat 8 imagery are capable to track the vegetation development through the year, then phenological profiles can be extracted and implemented into a multitemporal automatic classification process to detect agricultural areas and to discriminate among different crop species. The phenological profiles extracted by satellite imagery are compared with crop calendar data compiled by FAO for the area of interest. The classification procedure is supported by AEZs based on crop modeling and environmental matching procedures in order to identify crop-specific environmental limitations under assumed levels of inputs and management conditions. The FAO crop water productivity model AquaCrop is calibrated for wheat and maize yield mapping in the central highland of Kenya, handling both environmental and phenological data. The combined use of phenological data and AEZs results in a robust methodology with a classification overall accuracy of 91.35%. A good model performance is obtained relative to yield predictions, with R of 0.69 and 0.72.

AB  - We investigated dengue virus (DENV) and asymptomatic DENV infections in rural villages of Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia, during 2012 and 2013. We conducted perifocal investigations in and around households for 149 DENV index cases identified through hospital and village surveillance. We tested participants 0.5-30 years of age by using nonstructural 1 rapid tests and confirmed DENV infections using quantitative reverse transcription PCR or non-structural 1-capture ELISA. We used multivariable Poisson regressions to explore links between participants' DENV infection status and household characteristics. Of 7,960 study participants, 346 (4.4%) were infected with DENV, among whom 302 (87.3%) were < 15 years of age and 225 (65.0%) were <= 9years of age. We identified 26 (7.5%) participants with strictly asymptomatic DENV infection at diagnosis and during follow-up. We linked symptomatic DENV infection status to familial relationships with index cases. During the 2-year study, we saw fewer asymptomatic DENV infections than expected based on the literature.

TI  - Green growth efficiency of Chinese cities and its spatio-temporal pattern
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the panel data of 285 Chinese cities at prefecture level from 2005 to 2016, remote sensing data and socio-economic data were used to establish a green growth efficiency analysis database. Additionally, the TOPSIS model, super-efficient SBM model, and exploratory spatial analysis method supported by the entropy technology were applied to test and analyze the input-output index, comprehensive evaluation index, spatio-temporal pattern of green growth efficiency, spatial correlation effect, and the shift of the barycenter of green growth of Chinese cities. The following results were obtained: (1) There are obvious spatial differences between Chinese cities in terms of resources investment, socio-economic benefits, and environmental impact index of green growth; the efficiency of urban resource conversion is low, and there is much scope for improvement. (2) In 2005, 2010, and 2016, the comprehensive evaluation index of green growth of Chinese cities increased first and then decreased, and the regional gap was small but was gradually expanding. The green growth efficiency decreased first and then increased with significant spatial differences. (3) In 2005, 2010, and 2016, the Moran's I of China's green growth efficiency was 0.1888, 0.0745, and 0.0584, respectively. There was a positive correlation but a weakening trend spatially, featuring "small agglomeration and large dispersion." (4) From 2005 to 2016, the center of gravity of China's green growth efficiency moved toward the southwest-the moving track was from Suiping County to Biyang County, and to Suizhou City. The research results could improve China's green growth efficiency and provide scientific support and a practical reference for narrowing the imbalance of green growth between the regions.

M3  - Article

CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The clumping index (CI) is a canopy structure parameter that describes the dispersion or grouping of leaves. Previously, it has been estimated based on the normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot (NDHD), which is derived from multi-angle remote sensing data. However, currently it is impossible to derive CI from NDHD for a large area at a spatial resolution finer than 275 m since such fine multi-angle data are unavailable. In this study, an algorithm of the mixed-pixel clumping index (MPCI) was implemented, and an MPCI map of China's landmass at 1 km resolution was derived from the HJ-1A/1B data at 30 m resolution. The MPCI map was compared with the previous NDHD CI derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The correlation of these two datasets was greater than 0.9, and the mean bias was approximately 0.1. Indirectly, the MPCI map was applied to an effective leaf area index (LAI) product to derive true LAI. Using the MODIS LAI product as a reference, we found that the coefficient of determination was improved from 0.72 to 0.80, and the root mean squared error was reduced from 0.53 to 0.35 m(2)/m(2) after the effective LAI is corrected by this MPCI map, suggesting that this MPCI map is comparable to the NDHD CI. Although our algorithm is currently tested at 1 km resolution, potentially, it can be applied to higher spatial resolution than 275 m for mapping LAI and carbon cycle modeling before these multi-angle data at higher resolution are available.

TI  - Land Use Changes, Disturbances, and Their Interactions on Future Forest Aboveground Biomass Dynamics in the Northern US
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change (LUC), disturbances, and their interactions play an important role in regional forest carbon (C) dynamics. Here we quantified how these activities and events may influence future aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics in forests using national forest inventory (NFI) and Landsat time series data in the Northern United States (US). Total forest AGB predictions were based on simulations of diameter growth, mortality, and recruitment using matrix growth models under varying levels of LUC and disturbance severity (low (L), medium (M), and high (H)) every five years from 2018 to 2098. Land use change included the integrated e ff ects of deforestation and reforestation / a ff orestation (forest [F] ! agriculture [A], settlements [S, urbanization / other], and A& S ! F), specifically, conversion from F ! A, F ! S, F ! A& S, A ! F, S ! F, and A& S ! F. Disturbances included natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as wildfire, weather, insects and disease, and forest harvesting. Results revealed that, when simultaneously considering both medium LUC and disturbances, total forest AGB predictions of LUC + fire, LUC + weather, LUC + insect & disease, and LUC + harvest indicated substantial increases in regional C stocks ( standard deviation) from 1.88 ( 0.13) to 3.29 ( 0.28), 3.10 ( 0.24), 2.91 ( 0.19), and 2.68 ( 0.17) Pg C, respectively, from 2018 to 2098. An uncertainty analysis with fuzzy sets suggested that medium LUC under disturbances would lead to greater forest AGB C uptake than undisturbed forest C uptake with high certainty, except for LUC + harvest. The matrix models in this study were parameterized using NFI and Landsat data from the past few decades. Thus, our results imply that if recent trends persist, LUC will remain an important driver of forest C uptake, while disturbances may result in C emissions rather than undisturbed forest C uptake by 2098. The combined e ff ects of LUC and disturbances may serve as an important driver of C uptake and emissions in the Northern US well into the 21st century.

TI  - Dynamics of volume, biomass and carbon in the Atlantic Forest by a change detection tool
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is recognized internationally as one of the largest and most important tropical forests in the South American continent and besides its importance for biodiversity, this biome plays important role in the carbon cycle. The objective of this work was to develop and apply a routine of detection of changes in volume, biomass and carbon stocks from 2000 to 2015 in the Iguacu River Basin, State of Parana. They were used Landsat-7 ETM+ images for the year 2000 and Landsat-8 OLI images for the year 2015 totaling ten images for each period. A routine was developed in Python and implemented in ArcGIS 10.4 Software to perform the automation of a calculation process of volume, biomass and carbon estimation for the remnants of natural vegetation. There was an increase of 15.21% in volume, 14.95% in biomass, 14.96% in carbon, not considering successional stages nor subdivision by phytophysiognomy in the Iguacu River basin. Thus concludes that the region of study is collaborating in a positive way for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

TI  - Sustainable Land Use Management Needed to Conserve the Dragon's Blood Tree of Socotra Island, a Vulnerable Endemic Umbrella Species
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable overgrazing is one of the most important threats to the endemic and endangered population of dragon's blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) on Socotra Island (Republic of Yemen). However, there is a lack of information about the exact population size and its conservation status. We estimated the population size of D. cinnabari using remote sensing data. The age structure was inferred using a relationship between crown projection area and the number of branch sections. The conservation importance of each sub-population was assessed using a specially developed index. Finally, the future population development (extinction time) was predicted using population matrices. The total population size estimated consists of 80,134 individuals with sub-populations varying from 14 to 32,196 individuals, with an extinction time ranging from 31 to 564 years. Community forestry controlled by a local certification system is suggested as a sustainable land management approach providing traditional and new benefits and enabling the reforestation of endemic tree species on Socotra Island.

TI  - A Gaussian random field model for de-speckling of multi-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have gained interest for a variety of remote sensing applications, given the capability of SAR sensors to operate independent of solar radiation and day/night conditions. However, the radiometric quality of SAR images is hindered by speckle noise, which affects further image processing and interpretation. As such, speckle reduction is a crucial pre-processing step in many remote sensing studies based on SAR imagery. This study proposes a new adaptive de-speckling method based on a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) model. The proposed method integrates both pixel-wised and contextual information using a weighted summation technique. As a by-product of the proposed method, a de-speckled pseudo-span image, which is obtained from the least-squares analysis of the de-speckled multi-polarization channels, is also produced. Experimental results from the medium resolution, fully polarimetric L-band ALOS PALSAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to other well-known despeckling approaches. The de-speckled images produced by the proposed method maintainthe mean value of the original image in homogenous areas, while preserving the edges of features in heterogeneous regions. In particular, the equivalent number of look (ENL) achieved using the proposed method improves by about 15% and 47% compared to the NL-SAR and SARBM3D despeckling approaches, respectively. Other evaluation indices, such as the mean and variance of the ratio image also reveal the superiority of the proposed method relative to other de-speckling approaches examined in this study.

TI  - Mid-season Crop Classification Using Dual-, Compact-, and Full-Polarization in Preparation for the Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent research on the potential of dual- (DP) and full-polarimetry (FP) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for crop mapping, the capability of compact polarimetry (CP) SAR data has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This is of particular concern, given the availability of such data from RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) shortly. Previous studies have illustrated potential for accurate crop mapping using DP and FP SAR features, yet what contribution each feature makes to the model accuracy is not well investigated. Accordingly, this study examined the potential of the early- to mid-season (i.e., May to July) RADARSAT-2 SAR images for crop mapping in an agricultural region in Manitoba, Canada. Various classification scenarios were defined based on the extracted features from FP SAR data, as well as simulated DP and CP SAR data at two different noise floors. Both overall and individual class accuracies were compared for multi-temporal, multi-polarization SAR data using the pixel- and object-based random forest (RF) classification schemes. The late July C-band SAR observation was the most useful data for crop mapping, but the accuracy of single-date image classification was insufficient. Polarimetric decomposition features extracted from CP and FP SAR data produced relatively equal or slightly better classification accuracies compared to the SAR backscattering intensity features. The RF variable importance analysis revealed features that were sensitive to depolarization due to the volume scattering are the most important FP and CP SAR data. Synergistic use of all features resulted in a marginal improvement in overall classification accuracies, given that several extracted features were highly correlated. A reduction of highly correlated features based on integrating the Spearman correlation coefficient and the RF variable importance analyses boosted the accuracy of crop classification. In particular, overall accuracies of 88.23%, 82.12%, and 77.35% were achieved using the optimized features of FP, CP, and DP SAR data, respectively, using the object-based RF algorithm.

TI  - Inferring critical thresholds of ecosystem transitions from spatial data
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems can undergo abrupt transitions between alternative stable states when the driver crosses a critical threshold. Dynamical systems theory shows that when ecosystems approach the point of loss of stability associated with these transitions, they take a long time to recover from perturbations, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. This generic feature of dynamical systems can offer early warning signals of abrupt transitions. However, these signals are qualitative and cannot quantify the thresholds of drivers at which transition may occur. Here, we propose a method to estimate critical thresholds from spatial data. We show that two spatial metrics, spatial variance and autocorrelation of ecosystem state variable, computed along driver gradients can be used to estimate critical thresholds. First, we investigate cellular-automaton models of ecosystem dynamics that show a transition from a high-density state to a bare state. Our models show that critical thresholds can be estimated as the ecosystem state and the driver values at which spatial variance and spatial autocorrelation of the ecosystem state are maximum. Next, to demonstrate the application of the method, we choose remotely sensed vegetation data (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) from regions in central Africa and northeast Australia that exhibit alternative states in woody cover. We draw transects (8 x 90 km) that span alternative stable states along rainfall gradients. Our analyses of spatial variance and autocorrelation of EVI along transects yield estimates of critical thresholds. These estimates match reasonably well with those obtained by an independent method that uses large-scale (250 x 200 km) spatial data sets. Given the generality of the principles that underlie our method, our method can be applied to a variety of ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states.

TI  - Human and Climate Effects on the Hamoun Wetlands
T2  - WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative impacts of climate change on ecosystems have been increasing, and both the intensification and the mitigation of these impacts are strongly linked with human activities. Management and reduction of human-induced disturbances on ecosystems can mitigate the effects of climate change and enhance the ecosystem recovery process. Here, we investigate coupled human and climate effects on the wetland ecosystem of the lower Helmand basin from 1977 to 2014. Using time series climate-variable data and land-use changes from Landsat time series imagery, we compared changes in ecosystem status between the upstream and downstream regions. Results show that despite a strong and prolonged drought in the region, the upstream region of the lower Helmand basin remained dominated by agriculture, causing severe water stress on the Hamoun wetlands downstream. The loss of available water in wetlands was followed by large-scale land abandonment in rural areas, migration to the cities, and increasing unemployment and economic hardship. Our results suggest that unsustainable land-use policies in the upstream region, combined with synergistic effects of human activities and climate in lower Helmand basin, have exacerbated the effects of water stress on local inhabitants in the downstream region.

TI  - From Grain to Floodplain: Evaluating heterogeneity of floodplain hydrostatigraphy using sedimentology, geophysics, and remote sensing
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stratigraphy is a fundamental component of floodplain heterogeneity and hydraulic conductivity and connectivity of alluvial aquifers, which affect hydrologic processes such as groundwater flow and hyporheic exchange. Watershed-scale hydrological models commonly simplify the sedimentology and stratigraphy of floodplains, neglecting natural floodplain heterogeneity and anisotropy. This study, conducted in the upper reach of the East River in the East River Basin, Colorado, USA, combines point-, meander-, and floodplain-scale data to determine key features of alluvial aquifers important for estimating hydrologic processes. We compare stratigraphy of two meanders with disparate geometries to explore floodplain heterogeneity and connectivity controls on flow and transport. Meander shape, orientation, and internal stratigraphy affected residence time estimates of laterally exchanged hyporheic water. Although the two meanders share a sediment source, vegetation, and climate, their divergent river migration histories resulted in contrasting meander hydrofacies. In turn, the extent and orientation of these elements controlled the effective hydraulic conductivity and, ultimately, estimates of groundwater transport and hyporheic residence times. Additionally, the meanders' orientation relative to the valley gradient impacted the hydraulic gradient across the meanders-a key control of groundwater velocity. Lastly, we combine our field data with remotely sensed data and introduce a potential approach to estimate key hydrostratigraphic packages across floodplains. Prospective applications include contaminant transport studies, hyporheic models, and watershed models. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Joint estimation of Plant Area Index (PAI) and wet biomass in wheat and soybean from C-band polarimetric SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of the Plant Area Index (PAI) and wet biomass from polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data is of paramount importance for in-season monitoring of crop growth. Notably, the joint estimation of biophysical parameters might be effective instead of an individual parameter due to their inherent relationships (possibly nonlinear). The semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) can be suitably utilized to estimate biophysical parameters from PolSAR data. Nevertheless, instability problems could occur during the model inversion process using traditional inversion approaches. Iterative optimization (10) can have difficulty in finding the global minima while look up table (LUT) searches have a lower generalization capability. These challenges reduce the transferability of IO and LUT search inversions in computational efficiency and seldom account for the inter-correlation among the parameters. Alternatively, a machine learning regression technique with a regularization routine may provide a stable and optimum solution for ill-posed problems related to the inversion of the WCM. In the present work, the crop biophysical parameters viz. PAI and wet biomass are estimated simultaneously using the multi-target Random Forest Regression (MTRFR) technique. The accuracy of the retrieval method is analyzed using the in situ measurements and quad-pol RADARSAT-2 data acquired during the SMAPVEX16 campaign over Manitoba, Canada. The inversion process is tested with different polarization combinations of SAR data for wheat and soybean. The validation used ground measured biophysical parameters for various crops, indicating promising results with a correlation coefficient (r) in the range of 0.6-0.8. In addition, the relationship between PAI and wet biomass using the multi-target and single output model is also assessed based on in-situ measurements. The results confirm that the inter-correlation between biophysical parameters is well preserved in the MTRFR based joint inversion technique for both wheat and soybean.

TI  - Black and White-Sky Albedo Values of Snow: <i>In Situ</i> Relationships for AVHRR-Based Estimation Using CLARA-A2 SAL
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship of black-sky and white-sky albedo values of snow-covered terrain is studied using empirical measurements of six BSRN sites and the Finnish Meteorological Institute Sodankyla site, where albedo measurements are carried out both in an open area and above coniferous forest. In addition, a forest model was used to provide simulated albedo values to cover a wider leaf area index range. Linear regression formulas for estimating the monthly mean white-sky albedo value on the basis of the monthly statistics of the black-sky albedo were derived separately for open and forested areas. The statistical parameters used were the mean, median, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. In addition, the monthly mean solar zenith angle value was used as well. The mean absolute difference between the estimated monthly mean white-sky albedo and the empirical value was 0.027 for open areas and 0.015 for forested areas. The derived formulas were applied to the satellite black-sky albedo product CLARA-A2 SAL to generate white-sky albedo maps. Using the open snow area regression for the sea ice area produced values comparable to measured values both around the Antarctic and in the Arctic sea ice area.

TI  - A Spatial Pattern Analysis of Land Surface Roughness Heterogeneity and its Relationship to the Initiation of Weak Tornadoes
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - North Alabama is among the most tornado-prone regions in the United States and is composed of more spatially variable terrain and land cover than the frequently studied North American Great Plains region. Because of the high tornado frequency observed across north Alabama, there is a need to understand how land surface roughness heterogeneity influences tornadogenesis, particularly for weak-intensity tornadoes. This study investigates whether horizontal gradients in land surface roughness exist surrounding locations of tornadogenesis for weak (EFO-EF1) tornadoes. The existence of the horizontal a gradients could lead to the generation of positive values of the vertical components of the 3D vorticity vector near the surface that may aid in the tornadogenesis process. In this study, surface roughness was estimated using parameterizations from the Noah land surface model with inputs from MODIS 500-m and Landsat 30-m data. Spatial variations in the parameterized roughness lengths were assessed using GIS-based grid and quadrant pattern analyses to quantify observed variation of land surface features surrounding tornadogenesis locations across spatial scales. This analysis determined that statistically significant horizontal gradients in surface roughness exist surrounding tornadogenesis locations.

TI  - AltEx: An open source web application and toolkit for accessing and exploring altimetry datasets
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrologic variables, such as streamflow, is important for sustainable development, especially with global population growth and climate variations. Typical monitoring of streamflow is conducted using in situ gauging stations; however, stations are costly to setup and maintain, leading to data gaps in regions that cannot afford gauges. Satellite data, including altimetry data, are used to supplement in situ observations and in some cases supply information where they are lacking. This study introduces an open-source web application to access and explore altimetry datasets for use in water level monitoring, named the Altimetry Explorer (AltEx). This web application, along with its relevant REST API, facilitates access to altimetry data for analysis, visualization, and impact. The data provided through AltEx is validated using thirteen gauges in the Amazon Basin from 2008 to 2018 with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient and root mean square error of 0.78 and 1.2 m, respectively. Access to global water level data should be particularly helpful for water resource practitioners and researchers seeking to understand the long-term trends and dynamics of global water level and availability. This work provides an initial framework for a more robust and comprehensive platform to access future altimetry datasets and support research related to global water resources.

TI  - A New Method to Enhance the Spatial Features of Multitemporal NDVI Image Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel spatiotemporal fusion (STF) method is presented to enhance the spatial features of low-spatialresolution (LR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image series based on single-date high-spatial-resolution (HR) imagery. The method is particularly suitable for areas where the main vegetation types show asynchronous NDVI evolutions whose spatial distribution cannot be properly characterized by a single-date HR image. In contrast with previous STF methods, the new algorithm identifies these vegetation types by automatically decomposing the LR multitemporal data series, which offers a complete description of major seasonal NDVI evolutions. The new method, named Spatial Enhancer of Vegetation Index image Series (SEVIS), is tested in two Italian study areas using annual MODIS NDVI data sets and some Landsat 8 OLI images taken in different seasons. The performances of SEVIS are analyzed in comparison with those of two other STF methods, the classical Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Fusion Model (STARFM) and the more recent Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) algorithm. The results obtained indicate that the three methods perform differently depending mainly on the synchronicity of the NDVI evolutions from the base to the prediction dates. Specifically, SEVIS outperforms the other two methods when the NDVI values evolve differently during the prediction period, i.e., when the base and prediction images are poorly correlated.

TI  - Prediction of land surface temperatures for surface urban heat island assessment over Chandigarh city using support vector regression model
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is one of the primary reasons for changing the local climate, and there is a high impact on the surrounding areas. Chandigarh is one of the fastest developing cities in India showing rapidly urbanizing agglomeration. Due to the rapid urbanization, natural land surfaces are being replaced by the anthropogenic materials which negatively impacts the ecosystem resulting in urban heat island (UHI) effect. Land surface temperature (LST) is the primary and vital step for the analysis of UHI effect. The present study has been conducted to predict the LSTs for the assessment of UHI effect of the area surrounding Chandigarh city. Remote sensing data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) have been used for the prediction of LST. In the study, support vector regression (SVR) model has been developed from LST values of previous three years along with enhanced vegetation index (EVI), road density (RD) and elevation as input parameters to predict LST. The results of the SVR model have been validated using the data of the year 2014. A comparison of the model estimated LST and measured LST indicates that the range of mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) varies between 0.521 K and 0.525 K and 0.181-0.187%, respectively. Hence, SVR model can be used as a significant tool to predict LST for the assessment of heat island effect at any location. From the sensitivity analysis, it is observed that LST was ultimately the most sensitive to the RD compared to EVI and elevation. The SVR model has been compared with artificial neural networks (ANN) model to estimate the skill score factor of the SVR model (Forecasted) with reference to the ANN (Referred) model. Skill scores calculated for the periods show positive values which clearly depicts the efficacy of SVR model compared to ANN model for better LST prediction.

TI  - Is the reported increase in young female hospital-treated intentional self-harm real or artefactual?
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has reported an increased rate of hospital-treated intentional self-harm in young females (2000-2012) in Australia. These reported increases arise from institutional data that are acknowledged to underestimate the true rate, although the degree of underestimation is not known. Objective: To consider whether the reported increase in young females' hospital-treated intentional self-harm is real or artefactual and specify the degree of institutional underestimation. Methods: Averages for age- and gender-standardised event rates for hospital-treated intentional self-harm (national: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare; state: New South Wales Ministry of Health) were compared with sentinel hospital event rates for intentional self-poisoning (Hunter Area Toxicology Service, Calvary Mater Newcastle) in young people (15-24 years) for the period 2000-2012. A time series analysis of the event rates for the sentinel hospital was conducted. Results: The sentinel hospital event rates for young females of 444 per 100,000 were higher than the state (378 per 100,000) and national (331 per 100,000) rates. There was little difference in young male event rates - sentinel unit: 166; state: 166 and national: 153 per 100,000. The sentinel hospital rates showed no change over time for either gender. Conclusion: There was no indication from the sentinel unit data of any increase in rates of intentional self-poisoning for young females. The sentinel and state rates were higher than the national rates, demonstrating the possible magnitude of underestimation of the national data. The reported increases in national rates of hospital-treated self-harm among young females might be due to artefactual factors, such as changes in clinical practice (greater proportion admitted), improved administrative coding of suicidal behaviours or possibly increased hospital presentations of community self-injury cases, but not intentional self-poisoning. A national system of sentinel units is needed for the accurate and timely monitoring of all hospital-treated self-harm.

AB  - National greenhouse gas inventories often use variations of the gain-loss approach whereby emissions are estimated as the products of estimates of areas of land-use change characterized as activity data and estimates of emissions per unit area characterized as emission factors. Although the term emissions is often intuitively understood to mean release of greenhouse gases from terrestrial sources to the atmosphere, in fact, emission factors can also be negative, meaning removal of the gases from the atmosphere to terrestrial sinks. For remote and inaccessible forests for which ground sampling is difficult if not impossible, emission factors may be based on map-based estimates of biomass or biomass change obtained from regional maps. For the special case of complete deforestation, the emission factor for the aboveground biomass pool is simply mean aboveground, live-tree, biomass per unit area prior to the deforestation. If biomass maps are used for these purposes, estimates must still comply with the first IPCC good practice guideline regarding accuracy relative to the true value and the second guideline regarding uncertainty. Accuracy assessment for a map-based estimate entails comparison of the estimate to a second estimate obtained using independent reference data. Assuming ground sampling is not feasible, a map of greater quality than the regional map may be considered as a source of reference data where greater quality connotes attributes such as finer resolution and/or greater accuracy. For a local, sub-regional study area in Minnesota in the USA, the accuracy of an estimate of mean aboveground, live-tree biomass per unit area (AGB, Mg/ha) obtained from a coarser resolution, regional, MODIS-based biomass map was assessed using reference data sampled from a finer resolution, local, airborne laser scanning (ALS)-based biomass map. The rationale for a local assessment of a regional map is that, although assessment of a regional map would be difficult for the entire extent of the map, it can likely be assessed for multiple local sub-regions in which case expected local regional accuracy for the entire map can perhaps be inferred. For this study, the local assessment was in the form of a test of the hypothesis that the local sub-regional estimate from the regional map did not deviate from the local true value. A hybrid approach to inference was used whereby design-based inferential techniques were used to estimate uncertainty due to sampling from the finer resolution map, and model-based inferential techniques were used to estimate uncertainty resulting from using the finer resolution map unit values which were subject to prediction error as reference data. The test revealed no statistically significant difference between the MODIS-based and ALS-based map estimates, thereby indicating that for the local sub-region, the regional, MODIS-based estimate complied with the first IPCC good practice guideline for accuracy.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study the Polychaeta Marphysa sanguinea, was tested to investigate the impact of metal pollution on the environmental state of a coastal Mediterranean lagoon, Tunis Lagoon (Tunisia). A multi-bio-marker approach comprising glutathione-stransferase, cyclooxygenase, lysozyme activity, and lipid class composition of the Polychaeta was employed on a seasonal basis in the present investigation. The multivariate statistical approach (principal component analysis and Pearson correlation) clearly demonstrated different spatial patterns in biomarker values and lipid class concentrations. The phospholipids were the dominant lipid class in M. sanguinea, with the highest value found at the control station. The impact of pollution was most clearly observed on the main storage lipid class, triacylglycerol, which was lowest in the most impacted sites. Our work suggests that M. sanguinea can be used in warmer Mediterranean costal habitats as a sentinel species of contaminated ecosystems.

TI  - Predicting plant species richness with satellite images in the largest dry forest nucleus in South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity assessment is considered an important indicator of ecosystem health by various initiatives worldwide. Satellite remote sensing (SRS) has allowed the development of tools that can assist with the practical search of information related to species richness. The aim of this study was to test whether Landsat satellite spectral variables could be used as indicators of plant species diversity in the Caatinga, the largest nucleus of dry forest in South America. To obtain plant diversity data (richness and Shannon's index), an exhaustive search of plant phytosociological studies carried out in Caatinga was conducted. Pearson's correlation and PCA analysis was used to test the association between spectral variables and plant diversity. Regressions were used to test the models that best explain species richness. The results indicate that a positive correlation exists between richness and the near-infrared (NIR) spectral band (r = 0.744; p < 0.001). This spectral band was also responsible for explaining better the variation of leaf level reflectance among eight species that occur in the region (df = 7; F = 26317.55; p < 0.001). Therefore, the NIR band variable can be used as an indicator of species richness using power and quadratic regression models, because they were one of the best fit association recorded between spectral variable and plant diversity index, when compared to other studies in natural environments. Thus, we provide important information about biodiversity that can be used in different researches, from ecological modeling for theoretical approaches to practical applications in Caatinga. The potential use of Landsat satellite imagery to estimate species richness makes biodiversity assessments easier and provides a continuous source of data for monitoring in Brazilian semiarid region.

TI  - Road-induced fragmentation and the environmental value of roadless areas in a partly protected landscape in Central Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the effect of road development on vegetation fragmentation in and around a protected area network in western Isfahan Province, Central Iran. As the first study in Iran, an attempt was also made using the weighted linear combination-informed ecological value index of roadless area (EVIRA), to evaluate the environmental value of roadless areas based on a set of ecological and anthropogenic factors. Toward these aims, a Landsat 8-OLI image was processed to delineate land use/cover of the region. Road-induced fragmentation was then estimated by comparing the results of a small set of landscape metrics (DIVISION, SPLIT, MESH, LPI, and NP) measured from the original and road-included LULC map. The results showed road-induced increasing DIVISION (by 4.8-85.9%) and SPLIT (by 0.01-23.1%) and decreasing MESH (by 2.7-14%), LPI (by 1.3-32.4%), and NP (by 6-97.8%) values within all protected areas and across the entire study area, indicating a significant rise in landscape fragmentation and habitat loss. Roadless patch area and Thiessen connectivity stood out as the most salient criteria in determining environmentally valuable roadless areas. The results of EVIRA showed that the study region comprises some valuable but unprotected roadless areas which should be protected against road development or any kind of destructive human activities by laying out conservation plans or their inclusion to the current protected area network.

TI  - Modeling Stable Auroral Red (SAR) Arcs at Geomagnetic Conjugate Points: Implications for Hemispheric Asymmetries in Heat Fluxes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable auroral red (SAR) arcs provide opportunities to study inner magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at midlatitudes. An imaging system at a single-site obtains evidence of seasonal variations in SAR arc brightness and occurrence rates using events widely separated in time, as observed during different geomagnetic storms. The first SAR arc observed using two all-sky imagers at geomagnetic conjugate points described seasonal effects at the same time for the same storm (Martinis, Mendillo, et al., 2019, ). Here we report on modeling studies that enable specification of the roles of local "receptor conditions" in each hemisphere, plus the division of driving energy from a single source region into conjugate ionospheres. The geomagnetic storm of 1 June 2013 produced SAR arcs observed by conjugate all-sky imagers yielding 73 Rayleighs (R) at Millstone Hill (L = 2.64) in the summer hemisphere, and 300 R during local winter at Rothera (L = 2.92). With incoherent scatter radar data not available to specify input conditions, we offer a new simulation approach using non-incoherent scatter radar observations to specify local receptor conditions. These include a combination of semiempirical models (International Reference Ionosphere and MSIS) calibrated by local ionosonde and DMSP satellite data. We find that the driving mechanism (heat conduction entering the ionosphere) is not an equal partition of energy from the ring current source region, but one that is weaker in the summer hemisphere where the local receptor conditions are poised to produce fainter SAR arcs. The relationship between SAR arcs and recently discovered STEVE events are discussed and require further study.

TI  - Assessment of the effectiveness of spatiotemporal fusion of multi-source satellite images for cotton yield estimation
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deficiencies in the spatiotemporal resolution of remote sensing (RS) images limit crop yield estimation at the farm and field scale. These deficiencies may be alleviated by fusion of high spatial and temporal resolution images such as MODIS and Landsat. In this study, a new daily MODIS NDVI product (reconstructed MODIS) was generated from 16-day composite images using the Extreme Model, which integrates the NDVI value with the corresponding specific date information at each pixel. The Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) model was then used to create two fused, high-resolution time-series products (fused MODIS and fused reconstructed MODIS) in order to enhance the spatial and temporal effectiveness of satellite images for field-scale applications. Three yield estimation models were then built using time-series data of Landsat NDVI, predicted NDVI from fused MODIS, and predicted NDVI from fused reconstructed MODIS. The methodology was tested on a farm field over the cotton growing season in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Results showed that: (1) the time trend of NDVI over the growing season for the fused reconstructed MODIS was more similar to that of Landsat than were either of MODIS or fused MODIS, indicating that the specific date of MODIS pixels is important for time-series analysis; (2) the NDVI from fused reconstructed MODIS provided the best correlation with Landsat NDVI, with R-2 and RMSE values 15% higher than for fused MODIS; (3) correlation between cotton yield and all three datasets at the pixel level was statistically significant for all image dates, and (4) the accuracy of the cotton yield estimation model using predicted NDVI from fused reconstructed MODIS (R-2 = 0.79; RMSE = 488.01) was higher than with fused MODIS (R-2 = 0.77; RMSE = 513.96) and only slightly lower than with Landsat (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 463.12). This study improved the accuracy of MODIS-based yield estimation using fusion images, and the results can be applied to improve vegetation monitoring and quantitative modeling using MODIS NDVI at the field scale.

TI  - New Insights of the Sicily Channel and Southern Tyrrhenian Sea Variability
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of the Sicily Channel and the southern Tyrrhenian Sea are highly influenced by the seasonal variability of the Mediterranean basin-wide circulation, by the interannual variability of the numerous mesoscale structures present in the Channel, and by the decadal variability of the adjacent Ionian Sea. In the present study, all these aspects are investigated using in-situ (Lagrangian drifter trajectories and Argo float profiles) and satellite data (Absolute Dynamic Topography, Sea Level Anomaly, Sea Surface Temperature, wind products) over the period from 1993 to 2018. The availability of long time series of data and high-resolution multi-sensor surface currents allow us to add new details on the circulation features and on their driving mechanisms and to detect new permanent eddies not yet described in literature. The structures prevailing in winter are mainly driven by wind, whereas those prevailing in summer are regulated by topographical forcing on surface currents. The strength of the surface structures located at the western entrance of the Ionian Sea and of the mesoscale activity along the northern Sicily coast is modulated by the large-scale internal variability. The vertical hydrological characteristics of these mesoscale eddies are delineated using the Argo float profiles inside these structures.

TI  - Assessing land use change and moving sand transport in the western Hodna basin (central Algerian steppe ecosystems)
T2  - FORESTIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of land use and land cover change (LULC) techniques for identifying the state of the environment is both a suitable tool and cost-effective. The study was conducted in the western part of the Hodna Basin (province of M'sila, Algeria). In this study, we combined remotely sensed data and ground truth observations to analyze the trends of LULC and their drivers during the 30 years from 1984 to 2014. In addition, we evaluated the sand transport using wind data. We assessed LULC using the supervised image classification method. The results indicated that rangelands experienced a considerable decrease with 50,000 hectares. This shrinkage in rangelands cover is associated with an expansion in bare soil cover with an increase of 57,000 hectares. Furthermore, woody vegetation and sand experienced a decrease in their cover. However, there is an increase in agriculture area. The analysis of land cover of sand indicated a decrease in the area of this class, and the assessment of wind data revealed that within the study area there is a transition zone of moving sands. The dynamic of LULC was mostly conducted by the anthropogenic and overgrazing factors. These drivers have a considerable role in the patterning of different types of land cover in the investigated landscape. We can conclude that the LULC technique used for the assessment of the environmental state identified a regressive trend of ecosystem values and a process of land degradation which implies the need for implementation of sustainable management practices.

TI  - Development and Field Evaluation of a System to Collect Mosquito Excreta for the Detection of Arboviruses
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are a major public health concern globally and early detection of pathogens is critical to implement vector management and control strategies. Existing methods for pathogen detection include screening sentinel animals for antibodies and analyzing mosquitoes for pathogen presence. While these methods are effective, they are also expensive, labor-intense, and logistically challenging. To address these limitations, a new method was developed whereby mosquito saliva is collected on honey-coated nucleic acid preservation cards which are analyzed by molecular assays for detection of pathogens. However, mosquitoes only expel small amounts of saliva when feeding on these cards, potentially leading to false negatives. Another bodily fluid that is expelled by mosquitoes in larger volumes than saliva is excreta, and recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that a range of mosquito-borne pathogens can be detected in mosquito excreta. In the current study, we have modified light and passive mosquito traps to collect their excreta and assessed their efficacy in field evaluations. From these field-collections, we detected West Nile, Ross River, and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses. Our findings suggest that mosquito traps are easily modified to collect excreta and, that this system has the potential to enhance detection of pathogens.

TI  - Potential Solar Radiation as a Driver for Bark Beetle Infestation on a Landscape Scale
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) forests of the High Tatra Mountains have su ff ered unprecedented tree mortality caused by European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). Analysis of the spatiotemporal pattern of bark beetle outbreaks across the landscape in consecutive years can provide new insights into the population dynamics of tree-killing insects. A bark beetle outbreak occurred in the High Tatra Mountains after a storm damaged more than 10,000 ha of forests in 2004. We combined yearly Landsat-derived bark beetle infestation spots from 2006 to 2014 and meteorological data to identify the susceptibility of forest stands to beetle infestation. We found that digital elevation model (DEM)-derived potential radiation loads predicted beetle infestation, especially in the peak phase of beetle epidemic. Moreover, spots attacked at the beginning of our study period had higher values of received solar radiation than spots at the end of the study period, indicating that bark beetles prefer sites with higher insolation during outbreak. We conclude that solar radiation, easily determined from the DEM, better identified beetle infestations than commonly used meteorological variables. We recommend including potential solar radiation in beetle infestation prediction models.

M3  - Article
AB  - This series of three essays by educators from Georgia, Texas, and Alabama examines teaching Asian Religions in the American South. Through reflection on individual experience, each essay offers concrete strategies for the classroom that can be utilized by fellow educators working in the American South, but can also inform pedagogy in other North American regions. Introducing the idea of the "imagined student," Esaki discusses teaching African American students and tailoring Asian religions courses towards their interests by producing positive buy-in, while also acknowledging their potential isolation from White peers interested in similar topics. Mikles builds on Esaki's idea of the imagined student to discuss her own experience teaching Mexican and Vietnamese American students in Texas, while presenting specific strategies to overcome preconceived educator bias about students in Southern classrooms. Battaglia closes out the series by suggesting the use of a phenomenological approach for students to sympathetically enter into an Asian religious worldview. She offers specific exercises that can help students unpack their own assumptions - their "invisible backpack" - and approach Asian religions on their own terms.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENDOCRINOLOGY METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Paraganglioma (PGL) and pheochromocytoma (PCC) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that were considered to be predominantly sporadic. However, with the identification of novel susceptibility genes over the last decade, it is currently estimated that up to 40% of cases can occur in the context of a hereditary syndrome. We aimed to characterize PGL/PCC families to exemplify the different scenarios in which hereditary syndromes can be suspected and to emphasize the importance for patients and their families of making an opportune genetic diagnosis. Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with PGL/PCC. Germline mutations were studied using next-generation sequencing panels including SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD. Clinical data were collected from clinical records, and all patients received genetic counseling. Results: We describe 4 families with PGL/PCC and germline mutations in SDH complex genes. 2 families have SDHB mutations and 2 SDHD mutations.The clinical presentation of the patients and their families was heterogeneous, with some being atypical according to the literature. Conclusions: PGL/PCC are more commonly associated with a germline mutation than any other cancer type, therefore, all individuals with these types of tumors should undergo genetic risk evaluation. NGS multigene panel testing is a cost-effective approach given the overlapping phenotypes. Individuals with germline mutations associated with PGL/PCC should undergo lifelong clinical, biochemical and imaging surveillance and their families should undergo genetic counseling. For all these reasons, it is critical that all medical staff can suspect and diagnose these inherited cancer predisposition syndromes.

TI  - Varying climate response across the tundra, forest-tundra and boreal forest biomes in northern West Siberia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite studies using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have revealed changes in northern Eurasian vegetation productivity in recent decades, including greening in tundra and browning in the boreal forests. However, apparent NDVI changes and relationships to climate depend on the temporal and spatial sampling and the biome and forest-land cover type studied. Here we perform a consistent analysis of NDVI and climate across four bioclimatic zones (tundra, forest-tundra, northern and middle taiga) in northern West Siberia (NWS), further stratified into eight forest-land cover types. We utilize NDVI data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer and climate reanalysis data from 2000 to 2016, a period including the record warm anomaly in 2016 (+2 degrees C-5 degrees C June-July surface air temperature (SAT) across NWS). Statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) correlations were found for two bivariate relationships at the biome level: between NDVImax and June-July surface air temperature (SAT)(r similar to +0.79), and between middle taiga NDVImax and July precipitation (r similar to +0.48). No significant statistical relationships were found for the northern taiga and forest-tundra biomes. However, within these biomes we found that deciduous needle-leaf (larch) NDVImax is significantly correlated with July temperature (r similar to +0.48). Qualitatively, spatial composites of NDVI and climate variables were effective for revealing insights and patterns of these relationships at the sub-regional scale. The spatial heterogeneity of NDVI patterns indicates divergent reactions of specific types of vegetation, as well as local effects that are clearly important on the background of a regional climate response.

AB  - Water scarcity is a major problem for villagers' survival as it determines the population density and affects the migration pattern in Bara region. In the present study, groundwater resource endowment is studied and correlated with the distributional pattern of population, settlements and economic activity for analysing regional development in the study area. The study has been carried out using geospatial platforms, i.e. Erdas Imagine 2014 and ArcGis 10.2.2 software. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Cartosat-1 DEM data were the major data sources for extracting factor layers. Geomorphology and lineament maps of NRSC, District Resource Map of GSI, topographic maps and Google Earth images along with field surveys were ancillary database. Saaty's 9-point rating scale of analytical hierarchy process was used to extract the GWPI by integrating factor layers of geomorphology, lineament density, slope, geology, rainfall, drainage density and land use land cover according to their relative influence. Final map shows different zones of groundwater prospects in the study region, which is validated from aquifer thickness data. Result shows that 39.19% (291.41 km(2)) of the total area (743.64 km(2)) is classified as high-to-excellent GWP, whereas 27.96% (207.89 km(2)) of the area is under very poor-to-poor GWP. Areas having poor-to-poorest groundwater storage impact on population distribution, as 14% of the total population is lying over these zones. The descriptive statistical analysis showed that CGWPI and built-up area are significantly correlated (F = 18.024 > 4.41*, t = - 4.245 > 2.101, R-2 = 50.03%). CGWPI is also correlated significantly with population density (F = 18.855 > 4.41*, t = - 4.342 > 2.101, R-2 = 50.16%). However, the relationship is not very high on linear regression model as expected since only 50% variations in population distribution can be attributed to CGWPI, for example, the Shankargarh town having the highest population density and the second highest built-up percentage in the whole study area in spite of being endowed with the lowest groundwater potential.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Changes in Land Use/Land Cover Over a Decade (2000-2014) Using Earth Observation Datasets: A Case Study of Varanasi District, India
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes have emerged as a major concern on global as well as on the local stage because of its considerable impact on climate and environment, especially in rapidly developing areas. Therefore, accurate mapping of LULC and ongoing changes over a time period have drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Remote sensing images from Landsat series satellites are a major information source for LULC change analysis. The present study mainly focuses on the evaluation of three classification techniques, namely maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) using multi-temporal Landsat images in order to choose the best method among them. The overall analysis based on accuracy measures indicates that the SVM is superior to ANN and MLC. The classification results achieved by the best recognized technique (SVM) were applied to assess the spatio-temporal changes in LULC that occurred in a fast growing Varanasi district of India over a period of 14years (2001-2014). A paired samples t test was also carried out to determine the statistical significance of changes in LULC between different studied time periods. The results reveal the rapid expansion in built-up area resulted in substantial decrease in agricultural land and other LULC classes. This study also highlights the importance of Landsat images to provide accurate and timely LULC maps that can be used as inputs in a number of land management and planning activities.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of correlation between vegetation cover and precipitation in an arid mountain-oasis river basin in northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are essential for survival of both the ecosystem and human society in arid regions. The impact of precipitation on vegetation cover, especially in arid and semiarid areas, has received increasing interest. Although correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover has been reported in arid and semi-arid areas (with annual precipitation from 50 to 200 mm and from 200 to 400 mm, respectively), it is unclear whether the same correlation holds in extremely arid regions (with annual precipitation less than 50 mm). This study used remote sensing data of precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate their correlation at different temporal and spatial scales in a typical arid mountain-oasis river system located in northwest China. The results showed that precipitation and NDVI are not evenly distributed in space. In the period 1999-2007, precipitation was declining at a rate of 1.1785 mm/year, while during 2008-2015, it has increased at a rate of 2.0516 mm/year. NDVI showed no significant temporal trend in most areas (trend slope = 0.001, Significance > 0.05), except for a slight increase in regions where cropland expanded. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of spatial mean precipitation and NDVI over the whole study area was 0.46 (Significance < 0.01), suggesting strong effects of precipitation on NDVI in the study area. The correlation coefficient between precipitation and NDVI varied spatially with the precipitation pattern in space. Through analysis of phase difference in space and time, it was found that NDVI in the lower reaches of the river system was significantly correlated with accumulative precipitation of the current and previous two months in the upper reaches of the system. Our study shows that the impacts of precipitation on vegetation cover have a clear phase difference in space, and that in an extremely arid area, antecedent precipitation in an adjacent region upstream has strong influences on vegetation cover downstream. Thus, the spatial distribution and antecedent accumulation of precipitation impacts should be taken into consideration when analyzing vegetation dynamics in arid areas.

TI  - Robot-assisted Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping and Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection Using Near-infrared Fluorescence in Vulvar Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The surgical treatment of vulvar cancer has undergone many changes over the last century. The morbidity of open inguinal incisions prompts the search for a minimally invasive approach to lymph node dissection. This study reports the outcomes of 4 patients with vulvar cancer undergoing robotic sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and lymph node (LN) dissection with near-infrared fluorescence. From 2015 to 2017, 3 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva underwent robot-assisted SLN mapping and inguinal LN dissection. One patient with a vulvar melanoma had robotic bilateral SLN mapping only. The da Vinci Xi System with Firefly technology (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) and indocyanine green radiotracer was used in all cases. Eight groins underwent robot-assisted SLN mapping, 6 of which underwent inguinal LN dissection. The average operating time was 234 minutes with vulvectomy. The mean blood loss was 124 mL. The operative time decreased, and the lymph node yield increased with each case. There were no wound separations or long-term negative outcomes, such as persistent lymphedema or recurrence. This case series of robot-assisted SLN mapping and inguinal lymph node dissection shows the safety and feasibility of this new technique in vulvar cancer. It may be a valid approach to reduce short- and long-term morbidity. (C) 2019 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intra-operative assessment of sentinel lymph node status by one-step nucleic acid amplification assay (OSNA) in early endometrial cancer: a prospective study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node mapping has been proposed to reduce surgical side effects, maintaining the accuracy in nodal status assessment for endometrial cancer. Objective To investigate the role of one-step nucleic acid amplification assay (OSNA) analysis, in the intra-operative tailoring of full nodal dissection, and to analyze the correlation between the type of sentinel node metastasis and the risk of non-sentinel node metastasis. Methods Surgical and pathological data were collected from 141 consecutive, clinical stage I patients with endometrial cancer undergoing surgical staging. Patients were excluded if they had previous pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy, chemotherapy, abdominal cancer, pelvic or abdominal lymphadenectomy, or contraindications to indocyanine green. All sentinel nodes were analyzed by OSNA, and full lymphadenectomy was performed in positive cases. Statistical analysis was performed using X-2 and Fisher's exact test to determine whether any of these characteristics could accurately predict the non-sentinel nodes status in positive sentinel node patients. Results A total of 141 patients were included in the analysis. Bilateral sentinel nodes were identified in 104 (73.8%) patients, with a median number of 2 (range 2-6) sentinel nodes per patient. In the remaining 37 patients (26.2%), a unilateral sentinel node was obtained, with a median of 1 (range 1-3) sentinel node per patient. Thirty-three (12.0%) positive nodes were found in 24 (17.0%) patients: micro-metastases and macro-metastases were detected in 22 and 2 patients, respectively. At final pathology, all patients with positive non-sentinel nodes had macro-metastases in the sentinel node, whereas in micro-metastatic sentinel nodes no other positive nodes were found at full lymphadenectomy (p<0.001). Conclusions Our results showed a correlation between the type of metastasis in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and the incidence of positive non-SLNs. These data suggest a potential role of OSNA analysis in the surgical tailoring of patients with early endometrial cancer, with the goal of definitive risk stratification and a better individualization of adjuvant therapy.

AB  - Background Use of worker's compensation (WC) as payer underestimates work-related (WR) injuries. We evaluated three methods to identify WR injuries: WC as payer, ICD-9-CM work-status codes E000.0/E000.1, and other ICD-9-CM external cause codes. Methods We identified injury-related emergency department visits from North Carolina's syndromic surveillance system (2010-2013). Characteristics were compared by indicator. We manually reviewed 800 admission notes to confirm if the visit was WR or non-WR; WR keywords from the review were applied to all visits. Results 133 156 injury-related visits (age, 16 years or older) were identified: WC = 69%, work-status codes = 18%, other ICD-9-CM codes = 13%. Among manually reviewed visits: few visits identified by WC (0.3%) or work-status codes (2%) were non-WR, while 12% of other ICD-9-CM code identified visits were non-WR; 53%, 46%, and 31% of visits identified by WC, work-status codes, and other ICD-9-CM codes were WR, respectively. Conclusions Findings support use of WC and work-status codes to capture WR injuries; other ICD-9-CM codes should be used with caution or in combination with other indicators.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - Many studies have used Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms to make remarkable advances toward understanding and assessing seismic hazards. Next-generation satellites will make abundant L-band SAR data available in the near future, enabling even more progress in earthquake research and disaster response. Because a deep understanding of the performance capabilities and limitations of the only existing L-band satellite, ALOS-2, is crucial for planning future L-band SAR missions, this study produced SAR interferograms using ALOS-2 data for large global earthquakes that occurred between August 2014 and December 2016. All of the interferograms produced (49 from 30 seismic events) exhibited adequate coherence even in densely vegetated areas, where C-band interferograms tend to be unreliable because of severe decorrelation. Interferograms for 23 of the 30 seismic events successfully captured significant coseismic deformation signals. These results indicated that ALOS-2 can be leveraged to detect deformations with a high spatial resolution and a high precision unavailable from other instruments, particularly in tropical areas. In addition to the high coherence and high spatial resolution, ALOS-2 features such as left-looking and rapid emergency observations are also advantageous for earthquake research and disaster response. Although current baseline conditions are not always desirable for ALOS-2 interferograms because of limited observation resources, planned L-band missions (e.g., ALOS-4 and NASA-ISRO SAR), which will offer much wider coverage and higher observation frequency, are expected to improve this situation.

AB  - Pathogens and the potential risk they present to public health in recreational waters are of continual public concern. The focus of this study was a year-long sampling campaign to document the presence of Microsporidia and protozoan pathogens in the Bayou Texar waterway in Pensacola, Florida. We used biofilms as sentinel indicators for trapping pathogens in five different locations in Pensacola, Florida. Of the 34 biofilm samples, 16 were positive for pathogens. Of these samples, 13 were positive for Enchephalitozoon spp. (mostly E. cuniculi), 11 were positive for Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and two were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum. The data demonstrate that Microsporidia were easily recovered and primarily present in water during summer months.

TI  - Angiotropism in primary cutaneous melanoma is associated with disease progression and distant metastases: A retrospective study of 179 cases
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Angiotropism is the histopathological correlate of pericytic mimicry and extravascular migratory metastasis (EVMM), a mechanism of melanoma spread by migration along the external surface of blood and lymphatic vessels. The frequency of angiotropism in primary cutaneous melanoma and the clinical utility of its detection remain unclear. Methods We investigated angiotropism in 179 primary cutaneous melanomas by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), CD31, and S100/D240 stains. Results We detected angiotropism in 31 cases (17%) by H&E. CD31 immunohistochemistry increased detection to 59 cases (33%). When lymphatic vessels were included by using S100/D240 stains, 67 cases (37%) cases were positive. Angiotropism was associated with lymphatic invasion and mitotic rate with all detection methods. There was an association with increased tumor thickness when detected by H&E and CD31. No association with sentinel lymph node status was seen. By H&E and CD31 staining, angiotropism was associated with disease progression and distant metastases by univariate, but not multivariate analysis. Overall survival was not affected by the presence of angiotropism. Conclusions Angiotropism is relatively common in primary melanoma when immunohistochemical stains are used for detection and associated with mitotic rate and intravascular lymphatic invasion. The association with disease progression and distant metastasis suggests that it represents an alternative pathway of metastasis, that is, EVMM/pericytic mimicry vs intravascular spread.

TI  - Digitization in wood supply - A review on how Industry 4.0 will change the forest value chain
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - The term Industry 4.0 (I 4.0) has been shaping the discussion about increasing digitization in industrial and service value chains for several years. The concepts and technologies driving the fourth industrial revolution are increasingly moving to focus on forestry's practice and research. They both are attempting to develop new solutions for the forestry sector by taking advantage of technological spillovers from other industry sectors. Based on an extensive systematic literature review, this article identifies general trends towards a smart wood supply chain and concrete I 4.0 application examples, which are already in practical use or still in the stage of research and development. On a process level, the I 4.0 application examples are described and discussed in detail, ranging from computerized decision support aids to electronic control, machine vision and post-harvest management. A process flow chart visualizes selected findings of the review, showing that the value of I 4.0 mainly lies in the interconnection of process steps along the value chain, with close to unlimited information flow and allocation in an internet of trees and services. This can lead to significant changes and value-adds in harvest planning, harvest organization and control, operations, transport and logistics as well as timber sales. Furthermore, we discuss the latest developments of simulation modelling based on remote sensing data in forestry, which turns out to be the basis for the concept of a virtual forest as digital copy of the reality. With respect to future research, we argue that the benefits of data generation and information flows across organizational borders within an internet of trees and services should be the interest of short and medium-term research. Moreover, we outline that research should not only work on overcoming the technical challenges of I 4.0 in wood supply such as robustness, reliability and accuracy. Socio-economic challenges such as willingness for cooperation, changes in work environments, labor qualification, data autonomy and added value distribution should also be discussed and analyzed. To conclude, with this review we contribute to a scientific discussion about the opportunities of I 4.0 and digitization in wood supply and give an extensive overview of technological developments, applications and challenges that wood supply will face in the future.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure compromised 22% of pixels. Novel procedures were developed estimating missing data from means of pixels present within 2(N)-sized neighbouring blocks whose positions were defined by simultaneously minimizing heterogeneity of source imagery within blocks while satisfying need for sufficiently large size that some pixels remained near defects. Regions used to estimate missing data were defined in a stepwise process in which local standard error cut-offs for accepting particular 2(N)-sized regions of source imagery as representing missing pixels were progressively raised over a series of 51 cycles. For Landsat scenes of interest in western Oregon, averages of 34.7, 68.8, 95.4, and 99.0% of gaps in synthetic data were repaired by cycles 1, 6, 16, and 30. Standard deviations of differences between estimated and real values increased from an average of 9.0 digital numbers at cycle 1 to plateaus near 17.0 by cycle 25. This procedure performed well over a wide range of imagery dates, a consequence of its use of source imagery to identify homologous regions within landscapes rather than directly estimating pixels.

TI  - Early twenty-first century glacier mass losses in the Indus Basin constrained by density assumptions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the upper Indus supply more than half of the river water, are experiencing significant melting with a debated fate. The recent melting rate is still contained by considerable uncertainties, hindering to estimate precise glacier mass change. Here we present geodetic mass balance results for the whole Indus Basin using SRTM and ALOS 30 m elevation data, improved glacier inventory, optimized glacier surface density, and validation through in-situ differential GPS and ICESat data. Our glacier inventory and derived by improving RGI6.0 boundaries and separated into debris cover and debris free parts. The derived surface elevation changes were converted into annual mass balances using separated density assumptions (four criteria) for debris-covered ice (900 +/- 60 kg m(-3)), debris-free ice (below 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) and above 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (600 +/- 60 kg m(-3))), respectively. The resulting mass balance biased between -0.20 and 0.09 m water equivalent (w.e.) a(-1) using an average (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) density assumption throughout the Indus Basin. In the western Himalaya and Hindu Kush, the glacier mass losses are less affected by the average density assumption compared to the Karakoram. The western (Hunza) and central (Shigar) Karakoram glaciers show negligible mass losses of -0.02 +/- 0.12 and -0.01 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) in contrast to the relatively more negative mass balance (-0.26 +/- 0.21 m w.e. a(-1)) in the eastern (Shyok) Karakoram. All the sub-basins exhibit negative mass balances, with the most negative values ranging from -0.34 +/- 0.31 to 0.44 +/- 0.27 m w.e. a(-1) in the Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum sub-basins of the Himalaya. The whole Indus Basin contributes approximately +0.014 +/- 0.016 mm a(-1) to the global mean sea-level equivalent.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variation of land surface temperature of Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia due to seasonal effect by using Thermal Infrared Remote Sensor (TIRS) satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The studies on spatial and temporal variations of Land Surface Temperature (LST) is very essential for understanding the heat energy balance and thermal flux of urban areas. They are also useful for making urban heat transfer models, water resource management, climate change modelling and environmental studies. The present study is to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of the LST of Jubail Industrial City, one of the biggest industrial area in the world. The surface temperature has been estimated by using Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Remote Sensor (TIRS) satellite data through the single-channel (SC) method. The study provides the variations of surface temperature of the industrial city and reveals that the temperature is relatively low ranging from 10 to 26 degrees C during the winter month of January and February. However, some parts of the residential area and the industrial of the city have more temperature than the rest of the area. From the month of March, the temperature increases gradually and reaches high in the summer of month of June and July. During this summer period, the surface temperature in the residential area of the city is high around 40 - 50 degrees C. The temperature in the sub urban areas are moderate, however high temperature (50 - 55 degrees C) have been recorded in the industrial area of the city. The surface temperature gradually decreases from the month of September up to the peak winter period. However, significant heat islands of temperature more than 60 degrees C have been noted near the iron and steel factories of the industrial area in all the periods. Correlation analysis has also been carried out to assess relationship between the seasonal changes of the land surface temperature and air temperature of the city. There is no significant strong relationship has been is noticed to correlate the LST and air-temperature throughout the entire period of the study, however the LST and air-temperature shows good relationship during the summer period than the winter season.

AB  - Opencast mining has huge effects on water pollution for several reasons. Fresh water is heavily used to process ore. Mine effluent and seepage from various mine related areas especially tailing reservoir, increase water pollution immensely. Monitoring and classification of mine water bodies, which have such environmental impacts, have several research challenges. In the past, land cover classification of a mining region detects mine and non mine water bodies simultaneously. Water bodies inside surface mines have different characteristics from other water bodies. In this paper, a novel method has been proposed to differentiate mine and non mine water bodies over the seasons, which does not require to set a threshold value manually. Here, water body regions are detected over the entire scene by any classical water body detection algorithm. Further, each water body is treated independently, and reflectance properties of a bounding box over each water body region are analyzed. In the past, there were efforts to use clay mineral ratio (CLM) to separate mine and non mine water bodies. In this paper, it has been observed that iron oxide ratio (IO) can also separate mine and non mine water bodies. The accuracy is observed to increase, if the difference of CLM and IO is used for segregation. The proposed algorithm separates these regions by taking into account seasonal variations. Means of differences of CLM and IO of each bounding box have been clustered using K-means clustering algorithm. The automation provides precision and recall for mine, and non mine water bodies as [77.83%, 76.55%] and [75.18%, 75.84%], respectively, using ground truths from high-definition Google Earth images.

TI  - Outcomes of Breast Cancer Management from an Urban Specialist Breast Center in South India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND PAEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context and Aims: The disease pattern and presentation of breast cancer in India are thought to differ from the West. The purpose of this study is to describe and to discuss the presentation, clinicopathological data, and survival from an urban specialist breast center in Southern India. Materials and Methods: Prospectively collected data were analyzed for clinicopathological details, treatment variables, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Cumulative survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for patients treated from 2007 to 2011. Results: A total of 1671 patients were operated at our center from January 2007 to December 2016. Average age at diagnosis was 54.2 years. Over 70% had Stage I and Stage II disease, infiltrating duct carcinoma was predominant in 88.2%. Average clinical tumor size was three centimeters. Breast conservation was performed in 22.4%. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 44.6%. Estrogen-receptor positivity was seen in 64.6%, 22.2% were Her2Neu positive. Triple negative disease was seen in 19.1%. Survival analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier curves for 540 patients treated from 2007 to 2011. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 70 months with 10% lost to follow-up. In our study population, the 5 years overall survival rate is 88.3% and disease-free survival is 85.7%. Conclusion: Our study reflects a higher percentage of early breast cancer with outcomes comparable to the West. More research is required to understand the genetic predisposition in our population.

TI  - Ultrastaging of negative pelvic lymph nodes to decrease the true prevalence of isolated paraaortic dissemination in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of occult pelvic lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer (EC) with isolated paraaortic dissemination who underwent pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy.Methods. From 2004 to 2008, patients undergoing surgery for EC at our institution were prospectively treated according to a validated surgical algorithm relying on intraoperative frozen section. For the current study, we re reviewed pathologic slides obtained at the time of diagnosis and performed ultrastaging of all negative pelvic lymph nodes to assess the prevalence of occult pelvic lymph node metastasis.Results. Of 466 patients at risk for lymphatic dissemination, 394 (84.5%) underwent both pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Of them, 10 (2.5%) had isolated paraaortic metastasis. Pathologic review of hematoxylineosin-stained slides identified 1 patient with micrometastasis in 1 of 18 pelvic lymph nodes removed. Ultrastaging of 296 pelvic lymph nodes removed from the 9 other patients (median [range], 32 [20-50] nodes per patient) identified 2 additional cases (1 with micrometastasis and 1 with isolated tumor cells), for a total of 3/10 patients (30%) having occult pelvic dissemination.Conclusions. Ultrastaging and pathologic review of negative pelvic lymph nodes of patients with presumed isolated paraaortic metastasis can identify occult pelvic dissemination and reduce the prevalence of true isolated paraaortic disease. In the era of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm for EC staging, which incorporates ultrastaging of the SLNs removed, these findings demonstrate that use of the SLN algorithm can further mitigate the concern of missing cases of isolated paraaortic dissemination.

TI  - Effects of DEM Source, Spatial Resolution and Drainage Area Threshold Values on Hydrological Modeling
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated computation of hydrological and morphometric parameters of any watershed are not only depended on Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resolution but also affected by their sources and drainage Area Threshold Value (ATV). In present study, the effects of different resolution of freely available DEMs are analysed in QSWAT model at different ATVs. The performance of QSWAT model and processing time were also evaluated. DEM derived from ASTER, CARTOSAT and SRTM were used at 30, 90 and 180 m spatial resolutions with six different ATV's, in QSWAT model. Result shows that DEM resolutions and ATVs have significant impacts on hydrological and morphometric parameters. QSWAT output like sub-basin count and surface runoff were less impacted by DEM resolutions while these components were affected by ATV, while HRU counts and sediment yield were affected by DEM resolution. It was also observed that fine resolution DEM increases processing time at smaller threshold values as compared to coarser resolution DEM. Result of this study could be used for selection of optimum DEM resolution and ATV.

TI  - Indigenous territoriality and water, beyond watersheds
T2  - AGUA Y TERRITORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Water management in Mexico has been organized in river basins (at least on paper, from a planning and not from a reflection on concrete actions), which are territorial units defined by the naturalness of geography. However, there are other types of territorialities that are indigenous, where water plays an important role. The objective of this article is to make an account of the main dimensions of indigenous territoriality in Mexico, considering the anthropological literature and the field work carried out by the author in several indigenous regions in Mexico, for more than 15 years. In the knowledge of indigenous territoriality, elements derived from cultures and the worldview are taken into account, including: the role of mountains and water; a relational or connectivity logic between elements of the landscape and sacred places; the supernatural beings; ritual circuits and territorial dynamism and borders or interpenetration areas. The author advocates for the recognition of these other territorialities within the framework of cultural diversity.

TI  - Healthy African American Families in the 21st Century: Navigating Opportunities and Transcending Adversities
T2  - FAMILY RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To identify pathways through which African American families successfully negotiate and navigate stressful life events to facilitate positive family functioning, relationships, and healthy developmental outcomes in their children. Background Despite the advancement of African Americans since passing of the 1965 Civil Rights Act, racism remains a major stressor that affects everyday life experiences of 21st-century African American families. Little is known about the cascading effects of race-related exposure on processes in African American families, nor about what promotes healthy functioning among African American families. Method Three waves of data on 867 families participating in the Family and Community Health Study were analyzed to identify pathways that forecast family functioning and developmental outcomes of youth as they transitioned from middle childhood to late adolescence. Results Stressful life events heightened maternal depression and anxiety, which were associated with a more cynical and hostile worldview and poorer quality of family relations. Parenting practices and family relationship quality were linked with children's self-pride, which was closely associated with more optimistic worldview. Self-pride was also associated with future aspirations among youth, and future-oriented youth tended to engage in fewer self-harm behaviors as they transitioned from middle childhood to early adolescence. Conclusion Reframing one's life situation, despite exposure to racial discrimination, serves a protective function for African American families. Exerting a sense of agency, internal will, capacity, and strength are effective strategies to transcend adversities. Implications That positive worldview can render more manageable family outcomes for African Americans, regardless of socioeconomic status, is worth considering in research, clinical practice, and preventive interventions.

TI  - Assessment of basin-scale soil erosion within the Congo River Basin: A review
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Review
AB  - This study uses the Global Assessment of Soil Degradation (GLASOD) to map sediment sources and erosion process types within the Congo Basin as part of a scoping study to guide a basin wide sedimentation study. The GLASOD map is validated using information from literature and published sediment concentration data at the Brazzaville gauging station, which includes over 95% of the basin area. Validation is complemented by analysis of timelapse satellite images and surface water transition maps derived from Landsat images. The upper catchments are shown to be the main sources of sediment, with the largest exporter by quantity being the Upper Congo sub-basin followed by the Kasai. In terms of severity, the Kasai has the highest specific sediment production rates at 8.92 t/km(2)/year, followed by the Sangha and Upper Congo at 8.52 t/km(2)/year and 7.61 t/km(2)/year, respectively. The dominant erosion/degradation type is the loss of topsoil through water erosion (sheet erosion), occurring in 32% of the entire Congo Basin area, followed by loss of nutrients and organic matter through chemical degradation, 21% of area. The mapping also shows that a large proportion of the Basin (39%) consists of stable terrain under natural conditions, without any human induced erosion. The erosion levels in the Basin are generally low with the predominant mapped erosion processes occurring mostly infrequently and with low levels of severity. The GLASOD map performs satisfactorily as a tool for mapping erosion sources and process types, but fails to explain the process dynamics within the sub-basins, for example, the high sediment exportation rates published for the Sangha sub-basin despite consisting mainly of stable natural terrain (84%). Analysis of satellite images shows an increase in sediment concentration in the Congo River's waters over the years. However, this temporal increase in sediment concentration is neither reflected in the GLASOD map nor the quantitative studies reviewed for this paper, pointing to the urgent need for future research on sediment dynamics in the Basin. Questions are also raised on the roles of the Malebo Pool and Cuvette Centrale in the sediment transport processes of the Basin. The questions raised, and observations made from this study have been used to identify strategic sampling sites for further field studies.

AB  - This article traces how premillennial theology replaced postmillennialism and prepared the way for evangelical identification with Trump's negative worldview. It suggests, following The Altars Where We Worship, multiple ways postmodern humans meet basic human impulses. It details how such "altars" end up serving in markedly religious ways. Using Ninian Smart's seven categories, it suggests how Trump and those who follow him fit what might be a "new" religion. Finally, the article relates how Moltmann's understanding of resurrection gives Christians a place to stand in this Trumpian era.

TI  - EVIDENCE OF FLUVIAL REARRANGEMENTS IN THE AMAZONAS- ESSEQUIBO INTERFLUVE - NORTHERN AMAZON
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon region stands out, among several reasons, for presenting a mosaic of landscapes in the Amazon River's large fluvial system. However, studies about the northern portion of this region still lack in depth, mainly in geology and geomorphology. In this context, the Branco River basin - located in the State of Roraima, in Brazil, which drains towards the Amazon River but is located in the triple hydrographic divisor with those of the rivers Orinoco (Venezuela) and Essequibo (Guiana) - presents evidence of drainage rearrangement in several of its tributaries, as occurs with the Mau River in the far northeast of the area, at the interflow between the Amazonas and Essequibo basins. Therefore, this study aims to interpret evidence of drainage rearrangement in Mau River's medium/low course, such as river capture and alluvial deposits, by means of remote sensing images and morphometric data obtained from DEM's. The analysis procedures were based on the interpretation of remote sensing images of the satellite SENTINEL-2, 10x10 meters, MSI sensor, together with morphometric data obtained from the MDE's ALOS/PALSAR, 12.5x12.5 meters and SRTM/TOPODATA, 30x30 meters, in order to analyze the drainage network, morphological features and alluvial deposits. The interpreted data indicate that the fluvial system of Mau River's medium/low course suffered little erosion because its regional base level had allowed lateral overflow and formation of a network of distributary paleochannels, constituting features of alluvial fans; the channels being tributaries of the Rupununi River (Essequibo Basin). Subsequently, a change in the regional base level of the Branco River apparently favored the capture of Mau River for the Amazon Hydrographic Basin, reorganizing the local drainage systems and, consequently, promoting changes in the landscape. These conclusions clear the path for future studies that aim to assess the dates of the sedimentary deposits and thus track down the age of the fan systems and the capture of the area drained by the Mau River into the Amazon basin.

TI  - Observation of short-term variations in the clay minerals ratio after the 2015 Chile great earthquake (8.3Mw) using Landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we explore the potential use of available free Landsat sensor data to investigate the short-term variations (STV) in the clay mineral ratio (CMR) following the 2015 Chile great moment magnitude earthquake (8.3Mw). The present investigation was carried out in the absence of ground observation data. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)-based multi-temporal imageries of before, after and non-earthquakes were used to derive the above parameter by applying the band ratio approach of bands 6 and 7, where the before and after imageries were compared with non-seismic event images as well as for validation. For the temporal automatic lineament data extraction and final lineament mapping, band 8 (panchromatic) was used by applying the LINE algorithm technique of PCI Geomatica, and ArcGIS 10.5 software, respectively. All these derived products finally interact with the regional geology, fault line and lineament systems. The results reveal that CMR can easily identify the STV at temporal scales before and after the earthquake, while both are normal during non-earthquake time. However, this variation was observed in all three buffer zones (i.e., 50, 100 and 150km buffer) and highly pronounced especially in the fault adjoining areas. Therefore, we found this research to be effective and could be used as an alternative method for future earthquake studies.

TI  - Identifying Climate and Human Impact Trends in Streamflow: A Case Study in Uruguay
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change is an important driver of trends in streamflow. However, the effects are often difficult to disentangle from climate effects. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that trends in streamflow can be identified by analysing residuals of rainfall-runoff simulations using a Generalized Additive Mixed Model. This assumes that the rainfall-runoff model removes the average climate forcing from streamflow. The case study involves the Santa Lucia river (Uruguay), the GR4J rainfall-runoff model, three nested catchments ranging from 690 to 4900 km<mml:semantics>2</mml:semantics> and 35 years of observations (1981-2016). Two exogenous variables were considered to influence the streamflow. Using satellite data, growth in forest cover was identified, while the growth in water licenses was obtained from the water authority. Depending on the catchment, effects of land use change differ, with the largest catchment most impacted by afforestation, while the middle size catchment was more influenced by the growth in water licenses.

TI  - Performance evaluation of RegCM4 in simulating temperature and precipitation climatology over India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the performance of the Regional Climate Modeling system version 4 (RegCM4) is evaluated over Indian regions through a 30-year climate simulation. The main focus is given on the model bias, correlation between the model simulated and observed results, and the standard error in the model simulations towards the 30-year mean temperature and precipitation climatology and their inter-annual and inter-decadal variability over India and the subregions. We find that the model-simulated temperature climatology has similar to 2 degrees C cold bias and the precipitation climatology has similar to 0.8mm/day dry bias over India. Major cold bias (similar to 3 degrees C) is noticed over South Peninsular India in the temperature climatology and a significant dry bias (similar to 3mm/day) is seen over Northeast India in the precipitation climatology. The performance skill of the model is found best over Northwest India for both temperature and precipitation, while it is found poor over South Peninsular India for temperature, and Northeast India for precipitation. Our overall results indicate that the RegCM4 reproduced the temperature climatology reasonably well over Indian regions, while it underestimated the precipitation climatology over many regions particularly during monsoon season. We find that less availability of moisture in the atmosphere and perhaps a weaker convection due to weaker upward motion of air may lead to decrease the precipitation in the model.

TI  - The effect of climate and land-cover changes on runoff response in Guguf spate systems, northern Ethiopia
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agriculture in the rainfall-deficit semi-arid lowlands of the Raya valley rely on spate systems to produce food crops. Climate and land-cover dynamics upstream are, however, threatening runoff response reaching these spate systems. The objective of this study was thus to analyse the hydrological response of dryland catchments to changing climate and land cover in Guguf spate systems. Thirty-six years of climate data were analysed using Mann-Kendall, Pettitt's test and linear regression methods, and time-series land-cover information extracted from Landsat satellite images in a remote-sensing interface. The Soil Conservation Systems curve number method was then employed to formulate the likely impact of climate and land-cover changes on runoff response, and trends analysed. Results showed that temperature, evapotranspiration and rainfall varied at least by 0.11 degrees C, 15.2 mm and -5.1 mm yr(-1) respectively, intensifying moisture stress. Moreover, improving vegetation cover in the highlands enhanced the water-abstraction capacity of the soil, impeding the runoff curve number by 9.2%. Thus, the combined effects of climate induced moisture stress and land cover led water abstraction upstream has threatened runoff response at a rate of 0.23 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1). In other words, the runoff response reaching Guguf spate systems degenerated by 7.96 x 10(6) m(3) over 36 years. Such unusual highland-lowland hydrological linkage has therefore endangered the availability of surplus water to irrigate spate-based farms downstream. Appropriate policies and strategies would therefore be desirable to address conflicting interests in scarce water resources in the face of climate change. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Is it always necessary to perform an axillary lymph node dissection on patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy? Outcomes of a retrospective study
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some Trials have demonstrated that the rate of false negative results of a sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy is >10%. The aim of this study is to identify the predictive factors of a pathologic complete response in the axilla in order to make a better choice between the performance of an axillary lymphadenectomy or the performance of a sentinel lymph node biopsy.METHODS: All patients diagnosed with positive axillary lymph nodes and achieving a clinical complete response after a neoadjuvant therapy were the object of our study. Radiologic, clinical and histopathological data were collected before and after the neoadjuvant therapy. Data regarding surgery, post-operative period and follow-up were also collected.RESULTS: Clinically negative lymph nodes were reported in 26 patients after they had received a neoadjuvant therapy (59.09%, 26/44). 57.69% of patients, who were clinically cNO after neoadjuvant therapy, were reported to have a nodal disease on histological examination (pN+). Patients with a pathologic complete response in the axilla are more likely to be Her2-positive (58.33% vs 3.13%, p<0.05) whereas a Luminal B phenotype is more frequently reported in those patients with an incomplete response (62.5% vs 1667%, p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The possibility to detect patients with a lower risk of nodal disease before surgery may reduce the rate of false negative results of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients receiving a neoadjuvant therapy.

TI  - Spatial patterns of boom and bust forestry investment development: A case study from Western Australia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use policies interact with biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics to determine land use and land cover (LULC) changes. This paper presents a method for assessing the determinants of plantation land use transitions from 1979 to 2014 from Landsat data for the Warren River Catchment (4,416 km(2)) in Western Australia. This catchment is intrinsically interesting because it is a frontier between agriculture, high biodiversity native forests and commercial forest plantations. Further land use policies have had a strong bearing on LULC. Initial forest clearing in the catchment was the result of agricultural development policy. It was followed by the ban on clearing native vegetation on private land in 1978. The Management Investment Scheme introduced in the 1990s led to a rapid increase in the area of plantation forest on agricultural land. The catchment has two significant environmental problems: first dryland salinity leading to land degradation and the salinization of rivers and streams; and second the protection of high levels of endemic biodiversity. LULC changes from 1979 to 2014 reveal that soil depth, distance to urban centres, surrounding land use, and private land are positively correlated with transitions to plantation forest. The Management Investment Scheme brought the largest changes in LULC as land transitioned into Eucalyptus plantations in the 1990s when the tax incentives were introduced and then gradually out of plantations by clear-felling and conversion to agriculture as tax benefits for the scheme were reformulated and uncertainty about the policy increased. Other evidence on policy effects are that the Forest Management Plans have sustained the area of native forest and the ban on clearing has been effective.

TI  - Wind energy potential analysis using Sentinel-1 satellite: A review and a case study on Mediterranean islands
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - A method for assessing and mapping the wind energy potential of near- and off-shore areas by means of multi sensor satellites (i.e. the recently launched Sentinel 1) is shown in this paper and applied to a case study area in the north-west coast of the Sicily island. The presented method aims at i) preliminary identifying the best sites for wind turbine generators installation and/or ii) estimating the average wind potential in small areas (e.g. archipelagos) for energy planning purposes. Firstly, a detailed literature review of existing techniques for wind speed estimation has been carried out, considering the most traditional methods (e.g. meteorological masts), remote sensing techniques and including a thorough review on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methods integrated with Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) for wind speed retrieval. This review enables to identify CMOD5 (C Geophysical model function 5) as the best performing GMF overcoming the CMOD4 accuracy issues in high wind speed conditions. Thus, the method has been detailly described and showcased through the analysis of the case study. SAR images from the Sentinel 1 satellite have been processed by means of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software. Afterwards, the wind speed and direction have been mapped through a Geographic Information System software. Lastly, the mean wind climate has been extrapolated for a specific Region Of Interest by the Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) 4.8 software. Consequentially, six hot spots characterized by high-energy potential have been identified as possible sites for possible installations of wind turbine generators.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll Fluorescence at Different Scales: A Review
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Measuring chlorophyll fluorescence is a direct and non-destructive way to monitor vegetation. In this paper, the fluorescence retrieval methods from multiple scales, ranging from near the ground to the use of space-borne sensors, are analyzed and summarized in detail. At the leaf-scale, the chlorophyll fluorescence is measured using active and passive technology. Active remote sensing technology uses a fluorimeter to measure the chlorophyll fluorescence, and passive remote sensing technology mainly depends on the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence filling in the Fraunhofer lines or oxygen absorptions bands. Based on these retrieval principles, many retrieval methods have been developed, including the radiance-based methods and the reflectance-based methods near the ground, as well as physically and statistically-based methods that make use of satellite data. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches for sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval are compared and the key issues of the current sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval algorithms are discussed. Finally, conclusions and key problems are proposed for the future research.

TI  - Examining toxic trace element exposure in American alligators
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxic trace element exposure occurs through release of the ubiquitous and naturally occurring elements arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg). The unique environmental conditions of the wetland ecosystems along the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States lead to the accumulation of Hg which is greater than in most other ecosystems in the country. There are also point sources of As, Cd, and Pb in this region. To effectively monitor trace element concentrations, and consequently the potential human exposure, accessible local sentinel species are needed. In this study, concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Hg and six other trace elements (Al, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo) were examined in American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) from seven wetland sites in South Carolina and Florida and assessed for their utility as a sentinel species for human trace element exposure. Alligators were chosen as a potential sentinel as they share a common exposure with the local human population through their aquatic diet, and they are directly consumed commercially and through recreation hunting in this region. Sex was significantly related to the concentration of Zn, Mo, and Al, but not As, Pb, Hg, Cd, Se, or Cu. Site specific differences in element concentrations were observed for As, Pb, Hg, Cd, Se, Zn, and Mo. Size/age was significantly related to the element Hg and Pb concentrations observed. The observed concentration ranges for the four toxic elements, As (6-156 ng/g), Cd (0.3-1.3 ng/g), Pb (3-4872 ng/g), and Hg (39-2765 ng/g), were comparable to those previously reported in diverse human populations. In this region alligators are hunted recreationally and consumed by the local community, making them a vehicle of direct human toxic element exposure. We propose that the similarity in As, Cd, Pb, and Hg concentrations between alligators observed in this study and humans underscores how alligators can serve as a useful sentinel species for toxic element exposure.

TI  - Ecological engineering projects increased vegetation cover, production, and biomass in semiarid and subhumid Northern China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple ecological engineering projects have been implemented in semiarid and subhumid Northern China since 1978 with the purpose to combat desertification, control dust storms, and improve vegetation cover. Although a plethora of local studies exist, the effectiveness of these projects has not been studied in a systematic and comprehensive way. Here, we used multiple satellite-based time-series data as well as breakpoint analysis to assess shifts in leaf area index (a proxy for green vegetation cover), gross primary production, and aboveground biomass in Northern China. We documented increased vegetation growth in northwest and southeastern parts of the region, despite drought anomalies as documented by the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index during 1982-2016. Significant breakpoints in leaf area index were observed for over 72.5% of the southeastern and northwestern regions, and 70.6% of these breakpoints were detected after 1999, which correspond well to the areas with the highest ecological engineering efforts. Areas with negative trends were mainly located in the Inner Mongolian Plateau, Hulun Biur, Horqin Sand Land, and urban areas. The Loess Plateau had the largest increase in vegetation growth, followed by the north parts of Northern China where biomass increased more in the provinces of Shanxi, Liaoning, Shannxi, Hebei, and Beijing than Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, and Qinghai. Our results show that multiple ecological engineering projects in the region have increased vegetation cover, production, and aboveground biomass that have led to improved environmental conditions in the study area.

TI  - Gastric lymphatic flows may change before and after endoscopic submucosal dissection: in vivo porcine survival models
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and study aimStandard gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is recommended following endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) due to the risk of lymph-node metastasis for resected cancers. However, when lymphatic flows remain unchanged after ESD, a minimally invasive function-preserving surgery based on the sentinel node (SN) concept may be applicable. In this study, using porcine survival models, we aimed to investigate whether gastric lymphatic flows were modified following ESD.MethodsTwelve pigs, each with one simulating lesion 3cm in size, were used. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluid was endoscopically injected into the submucosa in four quadrants surrounding the lesion. Following laparoscopic observation of lymphatic flows, the lesions were resected by ESD. After 4weeks, ICG fluid was injected in four quadrants surrounding the scar and lymphatic flows were observed in the same manner as the initial procedure. The distribution of lymphatic flows, including stained SNs, was compared.ResultsIn ten lesions (83.3%), the distribution of flows remained unchanged. However, in one lesion, the flow along the right gastric epiploic artery (R-GEA) disappeared on the lesser curvature of the middle stomach. In addition, in one lesion, the flow along R-GEA emerged on the lesser curvature of the lower stomach.ConclusionsOur study revealed that, despite ESD, lymphatic flows remained unchanged in most parts of the stomach. The SN concept may be applied after ESD, except for lesions on the lesser curvature. However, in the case of the lesser curvature, special care must be given to the SN concept.

TI  - Apocrine papillary lesion: comparison of pathological findings from 22years previously and the present
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Apocrine papillary lesion (APL) is difficult to diagnose as benign or malignant. We experienced an APL remaining in the body for 22years. We present a case of a 71-year-old woman who had undergone excisional biopsy 22years previously at the first hospital that she visited. 1year previously, she had undergone fine-needle aspiration cytology at a second hospital, and the lesion was diagnosed as potentially malignant. She underwent core-needle biopsy at a third hospital, but whether the lesion was benign or malignant could not be definitively diagnosed. We performed right mastectomy and sentinel lymph-node biopsy, because her tumor was suspected to be malignant based on imaging means, and malignancy could not be ruled out on either biopsy or cytology. The histopathological diagnosis was tiny foci of apocrine proliferative lesion with massive hemorrhagic necrosis and no tumor metastasis in two sentinel lymph nodes. Retrospectively, we compared all of the patient's previous specimens with the present ones, and applied the recent pathological diagnostic criteria. Although the biopsy specimen excised 22years ago suggested an encapsulated apocrine papillary carcinoma or a papilloma with apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ, neither infiltration nor metastasis has occurred. Furthermore, neither the pathological findings nor the clinical behavior has changed over time.

TI  - Dam site suitability assessment at the Greater Zab River in northern Iraq using remote sensing data and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few decades, the northern region of Iraq has been severely impacted by climate change, which has created long-term drought, water shortage, and casual flood events. Dam construction in suitable sites is a primary water management strategy to solve flood and drought. Dam site selection depends on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria, such as geology, soil type, and altitude. In this study, appropriate areas of dam site selection for water management were identified using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and multi-criteria decision making techniques. In addition, the proposed method of site suitability was evaluated by comparing it with the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP). A new validation method to evaluate the accuracy of AHP and fuzzy logic according to the preselected location of a darn was previously suggested in the study area (Bekhme darn) by the local government. Remote sensing data (Landsat imageries and ASTER DEM) and field/reference maps were used to derive 12 conditioning factors needed to produce a suitability map for construction. The criteria considered were geological formation, soil type, fault line, tectonic line, altitude, slope, rainfall data (2000-2011), water discharge, land use/cover, road network, and material used for dam construction. Two mathematical models, namely, AHP and fuzzy logic, were applied in this study. The best model was selected by using location and cluster-based accuracy assessment depending on the proposed dam site (i.e., Bekhme dam). Results showed that fuzzy logic is more accurate than AHP. In terms of the surface area of suitable lands identified, the AHP model determined 13,446,900 m(2) as a highly suitable area, whereas the fuzzy model identified 3,409,200 m(2) from the total area of 69,347,700 m(2). Finally, this study identified four sites for intermediate and large dams in the study area. The total water capacities of proposed Dam 1, Dam 2, Dam 3, and Dam 4 are about 81.5, 239.3, 374.6, and 646.5 million m(3), respectively, when the dam height is 60 m. The proposed methods can be easily replicated to other areas for similar applications. The finding reveals that AHP model is distributed and scattered in the whole study area, whereas the fuzzy model is more suitable for clustered areas.

TI  - Lake Sibayi variations in response to climate variability in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The optimal management of natural resources like lakes requires understanding the relationship with other environmental elements. Remote sensing techniques using multi-temporal and multi-sensor images for change detection purposes are important in this regard. This study used a combination of approaches to detect changes in the lake surface area of Lake Sibayi in relation to changes in past climates. Delineation of the study area is achieved using WR2012 endoreic maps and Landsat satellite images from 1992 to 2016. Using data from eight meteorological stations, past climate of the lake catchment was investigated. Thereafter, a multivariate correlation analysis is conducted to examine the relationship between the changes in the lake surface area and the changes in climatic (precipitation, temperature) variables and water levels. Results suggest that the lake surface area has decreased by 20% since 1992. There are significant changes in temperatures, while the annual rainfall totals declined significantly. The correlation between precipitation in the catchment and annual water level changes is 0.88. Statistically, significant increases in the water level and precipitation were experienced in 1993 and 2001. SPI analysis reveals that the study area is getting drier and the probability of recurrence of moderate dryness is 10%. The rate at which the lake is shrinking is not solely climatic related, as anthropogenic aspects are also responsible. To prevent further shrinkage of Lake Sibayi, it will be necessary to develop aggressive restoration policies and action plans aimed at maintaining inflows in the face of compounding climate change and water demand. Recommendations of the nature of further studies that can increase our understanding are included.

This is particularly vital for the water tower ecosystems which are extremely vulnerable. This paper provides a scientific assessment on the extent of land cover change in Mau Water Tower Ecosystem from 1986 to 2015 using satellite images. It analyzes the implications of observed population dynamics and forecasts the extent of land cover change in this resource. The results indicate a sharp increase in the area covered by grassland with a drastic decline in forest cover. Cropland showed marked fluctuations during the entire period. The change in forest cover had a very strong significant negative relationship with the rapid population increase. Forecast on land cover change, based on a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario, indicated further decline in forest cover and an increase in the area covered by grassland. The results of the study suggest that land cover change and population growth within the water towers are closely interlinked and cause significant effects on these ecosystems. These findings lay the foundation for a review of conservation and agricultural policies in order to enhance sustainable management of Mau Water Tower.

TI  - A weighted multivariate spatial clustering model to determine irrigation management zones
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of agricultural fields according to spatial and temporal variability is an important aspect of precision agriculture. Precision management relies on division of a field into areas with homogeneous characteristics, management zones (MZs), which are likely affected by multiple, interrelated factors. We present a method, based on machine learning and spatial statistics, to analyze the spatial relationship between a set of variables and determine management zones in a vineyard. The method involves: (1) fitting a model that quantifies the relationship between multiple variables and yield; (2) fitting a model that quantifies the effect of the spatial variability of multiple variables on yield spatial characteristics; and (3) developing a weighted multivariate spatial clustering model as a method to determine MZs. Twelve variables were sampled for 3893 vines in the wine grape vineyard. These variables included soil properties, terrain characteristics, and environmental impact, as well as crop-condition, using indices calculated from remote sensing images. The predictor variables were spatially characterized using hot-spot analysis (Getis Ord Gi* Z-score values) to assess their spatial variability. A gradient boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm was used to analyze the spatial multivariable effect on yield spatial characteristics. MZs were determined using multivariate K-means clustering, with relative weights given to the predictors, based on their relative influence on yield spatial variability provided by the BRT model. This method was compared to ordinary K-means clustering and K-means with spatial representation of the variables without weights using a dissimilarity index and spatial autocorrelation measures. Model performance was found to be very high and demonstrated that among the evaluated predictors, crop condition indices were the most important regressors for yield and its spatial characteristics. The weighted multivariate spatial clustering was found to perform better in terms of separability of the points and their spatial distribution than the other two clustering techniques. Quantifying yield and its within-field spatial variability, ranking the effects of the predictors and their spatial variabilities, and segmentation of MZs through multivariable spatial analysis, are expected to benefit irrigation management and agricultural decision-making processes.

TI  - Remotely sensed primary productivity shows that domestic and native herbivores combined are overgrazing Patagonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carrying capacity is the maximum animal density an area can sustain without deterioration of its resources. Overgrazing has degraded Patagonia, but sheep stocks decreased and gave way to mixed systems with cattle, goats and guanacos (native wild camelids). The objective of this paper was to develop a method to estimate the carrying capacity based on the remotely sensed data, and to assess wild and domestic herbivore numbers in order to establish if grazing stocks have evolved to balance with carrying capacity. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) MOD17/A3 images and field Aerial Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) data of 66 sites were linearly regressed (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.01), and the slope 0.236 used to convert MOD17/A3 NPP to ANPP. Harvest index (proportion of ANPP that may be sustainably consumed) was estimated as a function of ANPP and carrying capacity as a consumable forage/estimated annual consumption, set at 500 (sheep and goats), 3,200 (cattle) and 750 kg Dry Matter head(-1) year(-1) (guanacos). Regional ANPP +/- SD (2000-2015) was 758 +/- 52 kg Dry Matter ha(-1) year(-1) and Harvest index was 13.7 +/- 0.6%. Regional carrying capacity was 14.8 +/- 1.6 M sheep or goats, 2.3 +/- 0.3 M cattle or 9.9 +/- 1.2 M guanacos. Domestic stock was high from 1920 to 1980, but declined thereafter and remained mostly within 1 SD of mean 2000-2015 carrying capacity. In this century, annual provincial stocks and carrying capacity correlated well (R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.01) with a slope close to 1. Guanacos increased from 0.5 to 2 M between 2000 and 2015, driving linearly combined grazing pressures 36% and 62% above carrying capacity in southern Patagonia provinces in 2015. Synthesis and applications. From the year 2000, after decades of sheep overstocking, domestic stock has shown a regional trend towards a grazing equilibrium, but growth of guanacos might have upset that trend. Participation of guanacos as a critical excess in total grazing pressure is debatable, but management of these populations is necessary and may be increasingly attractive if combined production systems are developed to incorporate wild meat and fibre. Our method, MOD17/A3 enables a carrying capacity evaluation and stock adjustment in these unique mixed grazing systems, preventing further rangeland degradation and loss of ecosystem services.

TI  - Analysis of changes in native vegetation of the APA Lago de Palmas
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to understand the dynamics of Cerrado and Seasonal Forest vegetation, from 2000 to 2017, in 'Lago de Palmas' Environmental Preservation Area (APA). To do so, images from the Landsat satellite and the Spring 5.5.3 free software were used. Two thematic maps of the study area were made to estimate, through comparative analysis, the process of native vegetation replacement. The Maxver and Isoseg methods were used for the following land cover classes: Native Vegetation Dense Forest and Native Vegetation - Campo, exposed soil and watercourse. For the correction and validation, historical images from Google Earth Pro were used. The results indicate there was a loss of 38.56% of native vegetation, the urban center expanded at a ratio of 14 times, and about 10,760.13 ha were flooded by the reservoir of Lajeado plant, resulting in loss of land, trees, and biodiversity. It is inferred that APA does not fulfill the role established by the environmental legislation, because its occupation occurs in a disorderly way, there is no management plan, and the mappings show a systematic replacement of native vegetation by water mass, agricultural areas, and urbanization.

TI  - Aerosol optical depth retrieval over the city of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) using Landsat-8 OLI images
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) products based on orbiting satellites such the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Aerosol Smoke Products (GASP) can provide global and regional daily AOD distributions. Their application to air quality monitoring at local scales such as urban environments is rather limited due to their coarse spatial resolution. Recently, there has been a growing interest in retrieving AOD products based on high resolution optical imagery. The primary objectives of this research study are to assess AOD retrieval over urban city areas using high spatial resolution satellite imagery. With the assumption of Lambertian surface, the principle of AOD retrieval developed is based on the radiative transfer theory using Tanre Equation. To solve the radiative transfer equation, the study adopted the radiative transfer model Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) and constructed a Look-Up-Table (LUT) assuming a continental aerosol model. The land surface reflectance (LSR) over the entire study period using Landsat 8 OLI for the period 2016-2017 showed very little variability. The retrieval of AOD is performed by comparing measured and simulated TOA reflectance. The validation is performed using an AERONET Masdar Institute ground based site located within the study area and the 10 km resolution MODIS Collection (C6) Deep Blue AOD (MOD04) products. The validation shows that AOD retrieval approach yields a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.04, a good correlation with an R-2 equivalent to 67% and that the 58% of the retrieved values fall within the expected error (EE). Also, results show that Landsat-OLI retrieval are better and less biased as compared to MOD04 AOD products and that the used approach can provide much more details compared to the 10 km Deep Blue MODIS AOD products.

TI  - Spatial assessment of drought severity in Cape Town area, South Africa
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, drought has been identified as part of the several regular climate-related hazards happening in many African countries including South Africa, often with devastating implications on food security. Studies have shown that the earth temperature has increased over the recent years which can trigger drought occurrences and other climate-related hazards. Drought occurrence is principally a climate-related event that cannot be totally effaced though it can be managed. This study is aimed at appraising drought severity in Cape Town area, South Africa using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remotely sensed data obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) database between the years 2014 and 2018. The study revealed that the land use dynamics witnessed drastic changes where vegetation, water body and bare surface decreased from 2095 to 141 km(2), 616 to 167 km(2) and 2337 to 1381 km(2) respectively while built up and sparse vegetation increased from 5301 to 8191 km(2) and 7382-7854 km(2) during the period. Vegetation health and drought severity of the study area was assessed using vegetation indices and Normalized Drought Dryness Index (NDDI). The result reveals that Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and other vegetation indices decreased considerably more in recent years (2017 and 2018) which might have triggered drought events during the period compared to the other years (2014-2016). Furthermore, the spatial trend of land surface temperature (LST) and NDDI increased in recent years with NDDI values ranging between moderate drought and severe drought threshold. Consequently, if the increment persists, it can lead to adverse impacts such as food insecurity, land degradation and environmental health deterioration. Evidently, this study reveals the current state of vegetation health regarding drought severity in the area using remotely sensed data.

AB  - Changes in land use and vegetation sustained by planet earth are evermore so relevant in understanding the elements of friction between agricultural communities and terrestrial ecosystems that sustain them. The objective of this study was to analyze changes in land use and vegetation in the indigenous community of Kashaama, Anzoategui State, Venezuela. Digital images derived from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used that contain information on the different land use and vegetation coverage for the years 2001 through 2013. The studied indigenous community presents a significant transformation process from vegetation coverage to anthropic land use, putting at risk the ecosystem's goods and services for the population.

TI  - Quantifying how landscape composition and configuration affect urban land surface temperatures using machine learning and neutral landscapes
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect is an important 21st century issue because it intersects with the complex challenges of urban population growth, global climate change, public health and increasing energy demand for cooling. While the effects of urban landscape composition on land surface temperature (LST) are well-studied, less attention has been paid to the spatial arrangement of land cover types especially in smaller, often more diverse cities. Landscape configuration is important because it offers the potential to provide refuge from excessive heat for both people and buildings.We present a novel approach to quantifying how both composition and configuration affect LST derived from Landsat imagery in Southampton, UK. First, we trained a machine-learning (generalized boosted regression) model to predict LST from landscape covariates that included the characteristics of the immediate pixel and its surroundings. The model achieved a correlation between predicted and measured 1ST of 0.956 on independent test data (n = 102,935) and included predictors for both the immediate and adjacent land use. In contrast to other studies, we found adjacency effects to be stronger than immediate effects at 30 m resolution. Next, we used a landscape generation tool (Landscape Generator) to alter landscape configuration by varying natural and built patch sizes and arrangements while holding composition constant. The generated neutral landscapes were then fed into the machine learning model to predict patterns of LST.When we manipulated landscape configuration, the average city temperature remained the same but the local minima varied by 0.9 degrees C and the maxima by 4.2 degrees C. The effects on LST and heat island metrics correlated with landscape fragmentation indices. Moreover, the surface temperature of buildings could be reduced by up to 2.1 degrees C through landscape manipulation.We found that the optimum mix of land use types is neither at the land-sharing nor land-sparing extremes, but a balance between the two. In our city, maximum cooling was achieved when similar to 60% of land was left natural and distributed in 7-8 patches km(-2) although this could be location dependent and further work is needed. Opportunities for urban cooling should be required in the planning process and must consider both composition and configuration at the landscape scale if cities are to build capacity for a growing population and climate change.

TI  - A Bayesian approach to mapping the uncertainties of global urban lands
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global distribution of urban lands is one of the essential pieces of information necessary for urban planning. However, large disagreement exists among different products and the uncertainty remains difficult to quantify. We applied a Bayesian approach to map the uncertainties of global urban lands. We demonstrated the approach by producing a hybrid global urban land map that synthesized five different urban land maps in ca. 2000 at 1-km resolution. The resulting hybrid map is a posterior probability map with pixel values suggesting the probability of being urban land, which is validated by 30-m higher resolution references. We also quantified the minimum and maximum urban areas in 2000 for each country/continent based on subjective probability thresholds (i.e., 0.9 and 0.1) on our hybrid urban map. Globally, we estimated that the urban land area was between 377,000 and 533,000 km(2) in 2000. The credible interval of minimum/maximum urban area can help guide future studies in estimating urban areas. In addition to providing uncertainty information, the hybrid map also achieves higher accuracy than individual maps when it is converted into a binary urban/non-urban map using a probability threshold of 0.5. This new method has the ability to further integrate discrete site/location-based data, local, regional, and global urban land maps. As more data is sequentially integrated, the accuracy is expected to improve. Therefore, our hybrid map should not be regarded as a final product, but a new prior product for future synthesis and integration toward a "big data" solution.

AB  - Firstly, this article seeks to analyze the concept of reason by proposing good living / living well as an alternative rationality and as a special way of understanding and projecting oneself in the world. Secondly, it examines the indigenous worldview by highlighting its holistic concept of life along with its vision of nature.The principle of relationality is analyzed as an alternative to the substantialist view of the world and, finally, a vital economy is postulated at the service of human life. It is argued that the economy for life derived from good living operates as an alternative to capitalist rationality, as it helps mitigate many of its harmful effects.Finally, some of the practical tensions of the proposal are presented, which hinder their application in today's world. Part of the current research on this new worldview is reviewed and compared with the principles of capitalist logic. Thus, we arrive at a proposal where a vital balance between nature and economy is possible

T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographical patterns of species richness and underlying mechanisms are among the central issues of ecology. The Himalaya, a global biodiversity hotspot, lacks spatially explicit representation of plant richness patterns and predictor environmental covariates. The rugged Himalayan terrain limits large-scale field surveys, we, therefore, disentangle the role of remotely sensed environmental proxies for characterization of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) and prediction of plant richness in an alpine area in WesternHimalaya. Alpine plant richness was recorded in cluster plots (10 random quadrants of 1m(2) in approximately 1-ha area) across 97 sites in Pithoragarh district in part of the Western Himalaya(India). The dominant PFTs were mapped based on support vector machine classification of Landsat 8 image. Thesatellite-derived climate, landscape,and topographic variables were correlated to plant richness using generalized linear model (GLM) with poisson distribution to unravel species richness-environment linkages in the study area. The dominant PFTs mapped were herbaceous meadow, Danthonia grassland, Kobresia sedge meadow, moist scrub, and dry scrub. The GLM based plant richness model explained 70% variation in alpine plant richness. The environmental factorssuch as vegetation vigor, elevation, landscape diversity and moisturewere observed to influence alpine plant richness of the study area. The study presents a valuable baseline spatial database for judicious management of alpine plant resources and climate change studies.

TI  - Forecasting vegetation loss due to urban sprawl in the vicinity of Iquitos, Peru
T2  - CIENCIA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of the Amazon forest caused by the growth of cities directly affects the climate. Heat islands are generated in urban areas and habitats for species of flora and fauna in peri-urban areas are deteriorated or lost completely. Spatial information about the changes in vegetation cover caused by urban growth is scarce, as well as the data about its effects in the medium and long term, even though these changes imply consequence for the planning and management of urban and rural territory. The objective of the study was to forecast a scenario about the loss of forest cover near the city of Iquitos in 2029. For this, data from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Landsat images from 1999 and 2018 were processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE). This allowed us to apply Artificial Neural Networks and Cellular Automaton, to generate a scenario for the year 2029. The main change for the year 2029 corresponds to the categories of "non-intervened vegetation" and "built", forecasting a loss of 375 ha in the first and an increase of 318 ha in the second. It is concluded that GEE allows us to obtain processed data from satellite images that are useful and effective. The scenarios obtained were moderate and substantial, with a tendency to vegetation loss due to an increase in the "built" category in the city of Iquitos and surroundings.

We contrasted pastoralists' perception of summer pasture quality in the Altai Mountains of Central Asia with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) metrics obtained from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor. The spatial relationship between satellite-based assessment of the grassland quality and on-the-ground evaluation by local herders was first assessed for a single year using 49, 1x1km grassland blocks sampled in July 2013. Herder-derived forage value was positively and strongly (63% of variance explained) related to satellite-derived NDVI values (MODIS 1km monthly data, MOD13A3) as well as field estimates of % vegetation cover (62% explained) and to a lesser degree to vegetation height (28% explained). Herders' multi-year perception (i.e., recall ability) was also contrasted with satellite observations of their herding areas over the period of 2006-2016 during which NDVI temporal anomaly explained >11% of variance in estimates of pasture quality recalled. Few herders in Kazakhstan could recall pasture conditions, most herders in Russia and China could but inconsistently (4 and 7% variation explained, respectively), whereas most herders in Mongolia could recall pasture conditions in strong agreement with NDVI anomaly (30% variation explained), patterns reflecting herders' regional dependence on herding as a livelihood. Corroboration of herder-derived estimates and satellite-derived vegetation indices creates opportunity for re-expression of satellite data in map form as TEK-derived indices more compatible with herder perceptions.

TI  - City-Level Comparison of Urban Land-Cover Configurations from 2000-2015 across 65 Countries within the Global Belt and Road
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The configuration of urban land-covers is essential for improving dwellers' environments and ecosystem services. A city-level comparison of land-cover changes along the Belt and Road is still unavailable due to the lack of intra-urban land products. A synergistic classification methodology of sub-pixel un-mixing, multiple indices, decision tree classifier, unsupervised (SMDU) classification was established in the study to examine urban land covers across 65 capital cities along the Belt and Road during 2000-2015. The overall accuracies of the 15 m resolution urban products (i.e., the impervious surface area, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies) derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were 92.88% and 93.19%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84 and 0.85 in 2000 and 2015, respectively. The built-up areas of 65 capital cities increased from 23,696.25 km(2) to 29,257.51 km(2), with an average growth rate of 370.75 km(2)/y during 2000-2015. Moreover, urban impervious surface area (ISA) expanded with an average rate of 401.92 km(2)/y, while the total area of urban green space (UGS) decreased with an average rate of 17.59 km(2)/y. In different regions, UGS changes declined by 7.37% in humid cities but increased by 14.61% in arid cities. According to the landscape ecology indicators, urban land-cover configurations became more integrated (oShannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) = -0.063; oPatch Density (PD) = 0.054) and presented better connectivity (oConnectance Index (CON) = +0.594). The proposed method in this study improved the separation between ISA and bare soil in mixed pixels, and the 15 m intra-urban land-cover product provided essential details of complex urban landscapes and urban ecological needs compared with contemporary global products. These findings provide valuable information for urban planners dealing with human comfort and ecosystem service needs in urban areas.

TI  - A Novel Approach to the Unsupervised Update of Land-Cover Maps by Classification of Time Series of Multispectral Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an unsupervised approach that extracts reliable labeled units from outdated maps to update them using time series (TS) of recent multispectral (MS) images. The method assumes that: 1) the source of the map is unknown and may he different from remote sensing data; 2) no ground truth is available; 3) the map is provided at polygon level, where the polygon label represents the dominant class; and 4) the map legend can be converted into a set of classes discriminable with the TS of images (i.e., no land-use classes that require manual analysis are considered). First, the outdated map is adapted to the spatial and spectral properties of the MS images. Then, the method identifies reliable labeled units in an unsupervised way by a two-step procedure: 1) a clustering analysis performed at polygon level to detect samples correctly associated to their labels and 2) a consistency analysis to discard polygons far from the distribution of the related land-cover class (i.e., having high probability of being mislabeled). Finally, the map is updated by classifying the recent TS of MS image with an ensemble of classifiers trained using only the reference data derived from the map. The experimental results obtained updating the 2012 Corine Land Cover (CLC) and the GlobLand30 in Trentino Alto Adige (Italy) achieved 93.2% and 93.3% overall accuracy (OA) on the validation data set. The method increased the OA up to 18% and 11.5% with respect to the reference methods on the 2012 CLC and the GlobLand30, respectively.

TI  - Assessing the robustness of variable selection methods when accounting for co-registration errors in the estimation of forest biophysical and ecological attributes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of forest attributes using active remote sensing data and sampling designs is a solid scientific discipline oriented to derive structural information from forest ecosystems. In this study, we examined the problem of selecting predictor variables derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) when using stepwise and multiple linear regression, and when using kNN imputation using Random Forests (RF) to select predictor variables. Systems of forest attributes and ecological indicators were estimated using ALS statistics and ground data collected in Central-East Spain, on two Mediterranean pine forest areas. Co-registration errors were simulated by means of altering ground data coordinates. The larger the co-registration error, the higher the variation in the selected ALS-based predictors in the parametric approach, which was less affected than the RF-based selection. In both cases, the final performance of the models was not as affected by co-registration errors as the observed variation in the selection of variables: the impact was around 1% in the parametric approach while the value reached the 8% for both stand basal area and the Gini-index under the non-parametric method. The forest biophysical attributes of the set behaved differently towards altering the co-registration factor in both cases. To control the co-registration factor between remote sensing data sources and ground surveys is an essential step to reduce uncertainty in data interpretation and in the modeling of forest attributes.

TI  - A Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression Model for Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Land Surface Temperatures Over Urban Heterogeneous Regions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable of great concern in various environmental studies over urban heterogeneous regions. An improvement in the spatial resolution of the coarse spatial resolution LST is an effective way to extend its potential uses in applications that have strict requests on both the spatial and temporal resolutions. However, previous statistical downscaling algorithms were proposed mainly by addressing the spatial variability in the LST while neglecting the temporal variability. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model for spatial downscaling of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spec-troradiometer LST data from 1000 to 100 m. The GTWR-based algorithm with temporally and geographically varying regression coefficients can capture both the spatial and temporal variabilities in the LST from the time series data at a coarse spatial resolution for effectively reconstructing the subpixel variability in the LST at fine spatial resolution. In addition, because of a better ability to explain the LST variability over urban heterogeneous regions, a normalized difference built-up index and a digital elevation model were selected as auxiliary variables. Taking Beijing and Lanzhou as examples, the performance of the GTWR-based algorithm was assessed by comparing the results with the TsHARP and GWR-based algorithms and the Landsat-8 LST. The results indicate that the GTWR-based algorithm outper-forms the above-mentioned algorithms with lower mean root mean square error (1.62 degrees C) and mean absolute error (1.28 degrees C) and better agreement between the GTWR downscaled LST and the Landsat-8 LST.

TI  - The commercialization of real estate on plans or under construction. Legal analysis of the figure in Colombian Law
T2  - JUSTICIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising of real state marketing on blueprints in the last two decades, has changed the tendencies of the construction business, establishing itself as a new and interesting figure for the legal field. Therefore, it is necessary to define what is meant by "the sale of property on blueprints" in the collective worldview or the marketing of those blueprints through linkage schemes in mercantile trust and what this legal business implies in strict accordance with the law, in order to realize whether or not the business is as advantageous as it appears in real estate and construction marketing strategies. Noting that, while there is a future expectation of acquiring a property, guaranteed by the contracting party (constructor) or by a third party (fiduciary), who assumes a position as a guarantor by managing the received funds for the development of agreed activities, it is necessary that those involved (buyer, constructor and fiduciary trust) know their legal and contractual implications when concluding this kind of contracts (unnamed) within Colombian Civil Legislation.

TI  - Pelvic Sentinel lymph node detection in High-Risk Endometrial Cancer (SHREC-trial)-the final step towards a paradigm shift in surgical staging
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Study aims: To prospectively assess the diagnostic accuracy of a pelvic sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm in high-risk endometrial cancer (HREC).Patients and methods: Consecutive women with presumed FIGO stage I-II HREC underwent robotic surgery at two academic centres by five accredited surgeons. An anatomically based algorithm was adhered to, following cervical injection of indocyanine green (ICG), with reinjection of tracer in case of non-display of predefined lymphatic pathways. After removal of SLNs, a pelvic and infrarenal para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed. Primary endpoint was sensitivity of the SLN-ICG algorithm. Secondary end-points were sensitivity of the overall SLN algorithm (including macroscopically suspect nodes as SLNs), SLN mapping rates and morbidity of the SLN procedure.Results: Two hundred fifty-seven women were analysed; 54 had pelvic lymph node metastases (LNMs), and 52 of those were correctly identified by the SLN-ICG algorithm. In two women (one with false-negative ICG-SLNs and one non-mapped woman), the pelvic LNMs were identified by the overall SLN algorithm. The SLN-ICG algorithm had a sensitivity of 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89-100) and a negative predictive value of 99.5% (95% CI 97-100). The sensitivity of the overall SLN algorithm was 100% (95% CI 92-100) and the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI 98-100). The bilateral mapping rate was 95%. Two women (1%) had isolated para-aortic metastases. No adverse events occurred during the SLN procedure.Conclusion: With a complete sensitivity to detect pelvic LNMs, the described pelvic SLN algorithm can, in the hands of experienced surgeons, exclude overall nodal involvement in 99% and thereby safely replace a full lymphadenectomy in HREC.

TI  - Four decades of land cover and forest connectivity study in Zambia-An object-based image analysis approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover dynamics in the tropical dry environments of sub-Saharan Africa are not well understood compared to humid environments, especially on a national scale. Previous studies describing land cover in the dry tropics are spatially or temporally constrained. This study presents the first long-term (1972-2016) nationwide land cover dynamics and forest connectivity analyses for Zambia. We employed 300 Landsat images and an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach with the Random Forests (RF) classifier to map nine land covers at six time steps (1972, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2008 and 2016). Post-classification change detection was used to understand the dynamics, while landscape metrics were derived to assess the forest structural connectivity. Overall accuracies ranging from 79 to 86% were achieved. In 1972, 48% of Zambia was covered by primary forest and 16% was covered by secondary forest. By 2016, 62.74% of Zambia had undergone changes, with primary forest decreasing by 32% and secondary forest increasing by 23%. Our results showed that forests have been recovering by 0.03 to 1.3% yr(-1) (53, 000-242, 000 ha yr(-1)); however, these rates are markedly lower than deforestation rates (- 0.54 to - 3.05% yr(-1): 83, 000-453, 000 ha yr(-1)). Annual rates of change varied by land cover, with irrigated crops having the largest increase (+ 3.19 yr(-1)) and primary forest having the greatest decrease (-2.48% yr(-1)). Forest connectivity declined by 22%, with primary forest having the greatest decline, while the connectivity for secondary and plantation forest increased. We showed here that land cover in Zambia is highly dynamic with high rates of change, low forest recovery and decline in forest connectivity. These findings will aid in land use planning, reporting for the forthcoming 2020 Global Forest Resources Assessment, and carbon accounting, especially under the reduction in carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation programme (REDD +).

M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Leptospira spp. in dogs from Fox do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody test was used to detect antibodies anti- Tgondii and anti-N caninum. Immunoenzymatic assay and microscopic serum agglutination were used for screening antibodies antiTgondii and anti-Leptayfim spp., respectively. The results were: 67.02% of the samples reactive for Tgondii and 1.38% for N. caninum, both without statistically significant variables. For Leptospira spp. the results indicated seroprevalence of 23.11%. The analysis of the variables without distinction of serovar showed association for intrinsic characteristics as breed, age, nutritional status and dog category. The extrinsic variables as city region and access to the street presented association (p<0.05). The most prevalent serovars were: Canicola 59.47%; Bratislava 13.07% and Butembo 15.68%. Variables that make up the adjusted multiple analysis model using Leptospira spp. were: age, breed and nutritional status; serovar Canicola, sex, nutritional status and area (p<0.05); serovar Bratislava, lymphadenomegaly and presence of fleas (p<0.05). Given the results obtained, dogs can be used as sentinels for toxoplasmosis and leptospirosis in Foz do Iguacu and other cities with similar outcomes. In addition, preventive measures should be taken by health authorities because they are zoonoses and humans are also at risk.

AB  - The results of satellite monitoring and botanical description of unused agricultural lands during the growing season 2018 are presented. The objects of the study were sod fields of various ages (2, 7 and 20 years) and bare fallow soils which were parcels of Krasnoyarsk Agricultural Research Institute land use. Sentinel-2 satellite image data of high spatial resolution with Level-1C processing (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) were used to provide sod field and bare fallow soils insights. Based on these data, vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and soil indices NDSI (Normalized Difference Soil Index) were calculated. Algorithms and programs for processing Sentinel-2 satellite data were developed. Based on the dynamics of the NDVI, the possibility of identifying and monitoring the state of sod fields and bare fallow soils throughout the vegetation period was shown, as well as the applicability of the NDSI in assessing the suitability of arable land was demonstrated.

TI  - Lymph node dissection in endometrial cancer and clinical outcome: A population-based study in 5546 patients
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. According to current treatment guidelines, comprehensive surgical staging procedures in endometrial cancer confined to the uterus depend on uterine risk factors: a systematic lymph node dissection (LND) is recommended in high risk patients and should be omitted in low risk patients. Its role in intermediate and high intermediate risk patients is inconclusive. The aim of this analysis was to review the implementation of this risk adopted strategy.Materials and methods. Data were provided by the population-based Munich Cancer Registry. Patients with endometrial cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2016 were included.Results. Of 5446 eligible patients, 58.5%, 30.1% and 11.4% belonged to the low risk, intermediate/high-intermediate and high risk group, respectively. Lymph node dissection was performed in 20.2%, 53.0% and 63.7% within these groups. Lymph node involvement was diagnosed in 1.7%, 9.6% and 19.3%, respectively. Within these risk groups, there was no significant difference in the time to local recurrence, lymph node recurrence or distant metastases between patients with and without LND. After adjusting for age and comorbidity-status, no significant difference in overall survival was found.Conclusions. The application of a risk-adopted management of LND in early endometrial cancer in real-life is associated with a high rate of surgical under- and overtreatment. Corresponding survival data do not show a significant benefit of a systematic lymph node dissection. In order to improve the management and outcome of early endometrial cancer in the future, prospective trials, new surgical concepts and prognostic markers will be primary and necessary.

TI  - Observed differences between near-surface air and skin temperatures using satellite and ground-based data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of long-term land surface temperature (T-s) and near-surface air temperature (T-a) at finer spatio-temporal resolutions are crucial for surface energy budget studies, for environmental applications, for land surface model data assimilation, and for climate change assessment and its associated impacts. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard the Aqua satellite provide a unique opportunity to estimate both temperatures twice daily at the global scale. In this study, differences between T-a and T-s were assessed locally over regions of North America from 2009 to 2013 using ground-based observations covering a wide range of geographical, topographical, and land cover types. The differences between T-a and T-s during non-precipitating conditions are generally 2-3 times larger than precipitating conditions. However, these differences show noticeable diurnal and seasonal variations. The differences between T-a and T-s were also investigated at the global scale using the AIRS estimates under clear-sky conditions for the period 2003-2015. The tropical regions showed about 5-20 degrees C warmer T-s than T-a during the day-time, whereas opposite characteristics (about 2-5 degrees C cooler T-s than T-a) are found over most parts of the globe during the night-time. Additionally, T-s estimates from the AIRS and the MODIS sensors were inter-compared. Although large-scale features of T-s were essentially similar for both sensors, considerable differences in magnitudes were observed (>6 degrees C over mountainous regions). Finally, T-a and T-s estimates from the AIRS and MODIS sensors were validated against ground-based observations for the period of 2009-2013. The error characteristics notably varied with ground stations and no clear evidence of their dependency on land cover types or elevation was detected. However, the MODIS-derived T-s estimates generally showed larger biases and higher errors compared to the AIRS-derived estimates. The biases and errors increased steadily when the spatial resolution of the MODIS estimates changed from finer to coarser. These results suggest that representativeness error should be properly accounted for when validating satellite-based temperature estimates with point observations.

M3  - Article
AB  - At the end of 1744 the Spanish Inquisition persecuted the work of the religious Nicholas de Jesus Belando, Historia Civil de Espalia. The origin of the problem was the critic of the author to the action of the Inquisition against Melchor Macanaz. In this article we analyze the interpretation of Macanaz to the inquisitorial process of Belando, an opportunity that allowed him to insist on his personal and political vindication and in his worldview of an Inquisition subordinated to the king and dependent of its juris-diction as means of adaptation of the institution to the absolute State.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper substantiates the use of the nonadditive statistical mechanics equipment to estimate the thermodynamic variables of an ecosystem in terms of the multispectral measurements of reflected solar radiation. The parameter q is accepted as corresponding to the Forster maximum organization conditions. The remote information (Landsat) has been used to calculate the entropy, Kullback information, Forster organization measure, free energy, exergy, related and internal energy, and the energy consumption for evapotranspiration and photosynthesis for the q index measured for each pixel of the satellite images. It is proved that the seasonal dynamics of the q index and the organization measure is fully consistent with the implications arising from the open nonequilibrium system theory, and the thermodynamic variables accurately reflect the current state of the ecosystem.

TI  - Decadal decline of summer precipitation fraction observed in the field and from TRMM satellite data across the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifts in precipitation regimes have been given increased attention along with climate trends in the arid and semiarid Mongolian Plateau (MP), because precipitation is the dominant factor that controls vegetation growth and land-use practices in the region. However, the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of decadal trends in summer precipitation fraction have not been well understood. In this study, the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of annual and summer precipitation change were investigated with the major focus on the summer precipitation fraction across the entire MP, using monthly precipitation data from 141 meteorological stations and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data. The Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's regression, and Spatial Analyst methods were used for time series analysis. Results show that the regional summer precipitation fraction declined significantly at a rate of -1.0%/decade (p<0.05) during 1961-2010, which was supported by TRMM satellite data with a rate of -2.86%/decade over 1998-2016. Interestingly, rates of decrease in the summer precipitation fraction varied by ecoregion. Spatially, trend in summer precipitation fraction was very heterogeneous, with significant decreasing trends in the eastern typical steppe and southeastern agro-pastoral ecotone, but increasing trends in the southwestern desert and Gobi desert region. In conclusion, the summer precipitation fraction declined because of the asymmetric decreasing or increasing rates in summer and non-summer precipitation during both 1961-2010 and 1998-2010. This implies a major shift of precipitation regime in the region. This is likely driven by decadal changes of the East Asia monsoon system.

TI  - Comparative study of indocyanine green combined with blue dye with methylene blue only and carbon nanoparticles only for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The combination of indocyanine green and methylene blue (ICG + MB) was reported to be an efficient tracer method in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, whether this method is superior to MB only or carbon nanoparticles (CN) is controversial. This study was to evaluate the efficacy of the three methods in SLNB for breast cancer, and to analyze its influencing factors.Methods: One hundred eighty patients with early breast cancer were recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups. Each group comprising of 60 patients with SLNB using ICG + MB, MB, and CN, respectively. Then the 3 groups were compared in detection rate, mean number of SLNs, and the detection rates and number of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).Results: The detection rate of SLNs was 100% (60 of 60) in ICG + MB group, 96.7% (58 of 601, and 98.3% 159 of 60) in MB and CN group, respectively, with no significant difference (P = 0.362). Totally, 204 SLNs (mean +/- standard deviation [SD] [range], 3.4 +/- 1.4 [2-8]) were detected in ICG + MB group, 102 (1.7 +/- 0.7 [0-31) and 145 (2.4 +/- 0.7 [0-6]) in MB and CN group, indicating significant difference (P < 0.001). The detection rate of metastatic SLN was 23.3% (14 of 60) in ICG + MB group, which was higher than 18.3% (11 of 601 and 20% (11 of 60) in MB and CN group, respectively, but showed no statistical significance (P = 0.788).Conclusion: ICG + MB method was superior to MB only and CN only methods in the mean number of SLNs, thus predicting axillary lymph node metastasis more accurately. Therefore, in areas where the standard method is not available, ICG + MB may be more suitable as an alternative tracer for SLNB.

TI  - Retrieving Leaf Chlorophyll Content by Incorporating Variable Leaf Surface Reflectance in the PROSPECT Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content plays a vital role in plant photosynthesis. The PROSPECT model has been widely used for retrieving leaf chlorophyll content from remote sensing data over various plant species. However, despite wide variations in leaf surface reflectance across different plant species and environmental conditions, leaf surface reflectance is assumed to be the same for different leaves in the PROSPECT model. This work extends the PROSPECT model by taking into account the variation of leaf surface reflection. In the modified model named PROSPECT-Rsurf, an additional surface layer with a variable refractive index is bounded on the N elementary layers. Leaf surface reflectance (Rs) is characterized by the difference between the refractive indices of leaf surface and interior layers. The specific absorption coefficients of the leaf total chlorophyll and carotenoids were recalibrated using a cross-calibration method and the refractive indices of leaf surface and interior layers were obtained during model inversion. Chlorophyll content (C-ab) retrieval and spectral reconstruction in the visible spectral region (VIS, 400-750 nm) were greatly improved using PROSPECT-Rsurf, especially for leaves covered by heavy wax or hard cuticles that lead to high surface reflectance. The root mean square error (RMSE) of chlorophyll estimates decreased from 11.1 mu g/cm(2) to 8.9 mu g/cm(2) and the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) increased from 0.81 to 0.88 (p < 0.01) for broadleaf samples in validation, compared to PROSPECT-5. For needle leaves, r increased from 0.71 to 0.89 (p < 0.01), but systematic overestimation of C-ab was found due to the edge effects of needles. After incorporating the edge effects in PROSPECT-Rsurf, the overestimation of C-ab was alleviated and its estimation was improved for needle leaves. This study explores the influence of leaf surface reflectance on C-ab estimation at the leaf level. By coupling PROSPECT-Rsurf with canopy models, the influence of leaf surface reflectance on canopy reflectance and therefore canopy chlorophyll content retrieval can be investigated across different spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Present-day tectonic activity along the central section of the Altyn Tagh fault derived from time series InSAR
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) is a large-scale complex tectonic system. In this study, the present-day crustal deformation of the central section of the ATF (90.8 degrees E-91.58 degrees E) was obtained using 14 images on a descending track acquired between 2007 and 2010 from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). To improve the accuracy of the interferograms, ALOS World 3D-30m (AW3D-30) Digital Surface Model (DSM) from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency was used in Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing. The Line of Sight (LOS) deformation map show that there is an obvious zoning feature. With the main ATF as the boundary, the north block is concentrated around -35 similar to-60 mm, and the south block is concentrated around -9 similar to 11 mm. Based on the InSAR velocity map, we inverted for the strike-slip rate and locking depth of the fault using the two-dimensional strike-slip fault buried-dislocation model. The inversion results for the strike-slip rate at three selected cross-section locations perpendicular to the ATF were 6.1 mm/a, 5.3 mm/a and 7.9 mm/a from west to east; the corresponding locking depths were 9.5 km, 6.8 km and 12.3 km from west to east. The location and trend of the fault obtained by inversion are coincides with the Xorkol seismic belt.

TI  - Monitoring Agricultural Expansion in a Newly Reclaimed Area in the Western Nile Delta of Egypt Using Landsat Imageries
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and monitoring land use/land cover (LULC) changes using historical multi-temporal remote sensing data is greatly important for providing an effective and robust assessment of the human-induced impacts on the environmental conditions. It is extremely recommended for LULC studies related to evaluating the sustainability of changing areas over time. The agricultural sector in Egypt is one of the crucial pillars of the national economy. The amount of traditional agricultural land (Old Lands) in the Nile Delta had a significant decline over the past few decades due to urban encroachment. Consequently, several land reclamation initiatives and policies have been adopted by the Egyptian government to expand agricultural land in desert areas (New Lands) adjacent to both fringes of the Nile delta. Tiba district is one of those newly reclaimed areas located in the western Nile Delta of Egypt with a total area of 125 km(2). The primary objective of this article was to identify, monitor and quantify historical LULC changes in Tiba district using historical multi-temporal Landsat imageries for six different dates acquired from 1988 to 2018. The temporal and historical changes that occurred were identified using supervised maximum likelihood classification (MLC) approach. Three major LULC classes were distinguished and mapped: (1) Agricultural land; (2) barren land; and (3) urban land. In 1988, Tiba district was 100% barren land; however, during the 1990s, the governmental reclamation projects have led to significant changes in LULC. The produced LULC maps from performing the MLC demonstrated that Tiba district had experienced significant agricultural land expansion from 0% in 1988 to occupy 84% in 2018, whilst, barren land area has decreased from 100% in 1988 to occupy only 7% in 2018. This reflects the successful governmental initiatives for agricultural expansion in desert areas located in the western Nile Delta of Egypt.

TI  - Understanding Spatio-temporal Pattern of Grassland Phenology in the western Indian Himalayan State
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study has analysed grassland phenology: start of greening (SOG), end of greening (EOG) and length of greening (LOG), and their rate of change in the western Himalaya in India (Himachal Pradesh) using MODIS NDVI time series data (2001-2015). These metrics were inspected at different stratification levels: state, elevation, climatic zones and bio-geographic provinces. Delayed SOG was observed over 44.87% (P<0.1), and delayed EOG over 63.3% (P<0.1) of grassland grids. LOG was shortened in 24.37% (P<0.1) and extended in 58.04% (P<0.1) of the grids. At the state level, when statistically significant pixels (SSP) and all the pixels (AP) are used (given as SSP:AP), SOG is delayed by 20.27:6.28 days year(-15), while EOG is delayed by 38.02:14.97daysyear(-15) and LOG is extended by 35.07:8.70 year(-15) days. Extended LOG is observed over the temperate and cold arid regions, and shortened LOG is observed over sub-alpine and alpine regions. Variations in SOG and EOG are not uniform across different climatic and bio-geographic regions. However, in the sub-alpine and alpine zones, SOG and EOG followed elevation gradients, i.e. late SOG with early EOG over higher elevations, and early SOG with late EOG over lower elevations. Our study has revealed an interesting pattern of translational phenology (i.e. late SOG and late EOG) of grasslands which hints towards shifting winter period. Overall, it is observed that variations in timing of snowfall and snow cover extent are the reasons for inter-annual variations in the grassland phenology.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses land use/land cover (LULC) with Accuracy Assessment (AA) in Chennur mandal of the Kadapa district (Andhra Pradesh), using satellite images and socio-economic data. Spatial and temporal elements of LULC were measured using Landsat 8 OLI/TIS images, following a supervised classification algorithm technique in ERDAS Imagine software. Accuracy of the Landsat-derived LULC maps are about 84%. The study indicated that considerable evolution of built-up areas and barren/waste lands in the study area of the Kadapa district resulted in significant decrease in the area of water bodies, agricultural land and the forest cover. The built-up land growth has been large due to rising population growth. Fast urban development through infilling of low-lying zones and clearing of forest regions affected the environment, as well as its economic development. The major LULC groups include agricultural land (55.28%), water bodies (5.45%), and built-up land (6.65%), forest (2.61%) and wastelands (30.01%). The present study can be used by decision makers to develop economically sustainable plan for the protection of environment.

TI  - Hybrid Dual-Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Compact polarimetry for a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system is reviewed. Compact polarimetry (CP) is intended to provide useful polarimetric image classifications while avoiding the disadvantages of space-based quadrature-polarimetric (quad-pol) SARs. Two CP approaches are briefly described, pi/4 and circular. A third form, hybrid compact polarimetry (HCP) has emerged as the preferred embodiment of compact polarimetry. HCP transmits circular polarization and receives on two orthogonal linear polarizations. When seen through its associated data processing and image classification algorithms, HPC's heritage dates back to the Stokes parameters (1852), which are summarized and explained in plain language. Hybrid dual-polarimetric imaging radars were in the payloads of two lunar-orbiting satellites, India's Earth-observing RISAT-1, and Japan's ALOS-2. In lunar or planetary orbit, a satellite equipped with an HCP imaging radar delivers the same class of polarimetric information as Earth-based radar astronomy. In stark contrast to quad-pol, compact polarimetry is compatible with wide swath modes of a SAR, including ScanSAR. All operational modes of the SARs aboard Canada's three-satellite Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) are hybrid dual-polarimetric. Image classification methodologies for HCP data are reviewed, two of which introduce errors for reasons explained. Their use is discouraged. An alternative and recommended group of methodologies yields reliable results, illustrated by polarimetrically classified images. A survey over numerous quantitative studies demonstrates HCP polarimetric classification effectiveness. The results verify that the performance accuracy of the HCP architecture is comparable to the accuracy delivered by a quadrature-polarized SAR. Four appendices are included covering related topics, including comments on inflight calibration of an HCP radar.

AB  - Over the next 30 years, dermatologists face a rising population of elderly patients, causing a marked increase in the incidence of cutaneous malignancies. For this reason, it is important to review the approach to the management of skin cancer in the elderly. In the current medical environment, there has been debate as to how cutaneous malignancy should be treated in elderly patients, especially those with multiple comorbid conditions. Clinicians should use a comprehensive approach that accounts for functional status, impact on quality of life, cost, and potential adverse outcomes when managing high- and low-morbidity skin cancers in the elderly.

TI  - Remotely sensed vegetation index and LAI for parameter determination of the CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean model when <i>in situ</i> data are not available
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An agricultural system is a complex combination of many different components that require different types of data for analysis and modeling. Remote sensing information is an alternative source of data for areas that only have a small amount of ground truth data. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether remotely sensed data can be used for calibration of genetic specific parameters (GSPs) with the ultimate goal of yield estimation. This study used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with measured Leaf Area Index (LAI) for soybean fields in Parana, Brazil and Iowa, USA, to calibrate the cultivar parameters of the CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean model. Three calibration methods were performed including field-measured LAI, remotely sensed derived LAI, and remotely sensed derived Light Interception. The cultivar parameters sensitive to LAI and LI were calibrated for yield with a mean error of -4.5 kg/ha (0.1%) and with a R-2 of 0.89 for Parana. The availability of crop growth measurements for Iowa resulted in an average RMSE of 895 kg/ha (average nRMSE of 6%), and Willmott agreement index of 0.98 for time-series biomass, and an average RMSE of 941 kg/ha (average nRMSE of 15%) for pod weight. This study showed that remotely sensed LAI and LI from NDVI data can be used for calibration of GSPs with the ultimate goal of improving yield predictions based on local dynamic temporal and spatial variability.

TI  - Optimal Cyanobacterial Pigment Retrieval from Ocean Colour Sensors in a Highly Turbid, Optically Complex Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, several algorithms for the retrieval of cyanobacterial phycocyanin (PC) from ocean colour sensors have been presented for inland waters, all of which claim to be robust models. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive comparison to identify the optimal algorithm for retrieval of PC concentrations in the highly optically complex waters of Lake Balaton (Hungary). MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) top-of-atmosphere radiances were first atmospherically corrected using the Self-Contained Atmospheric Parameters Estimation for MERIS data v.B2 (SCAPE-M_B2). Overall, the Simis05 semi-analytical algorithm outperformed more complex inversion algorithms, providing accurate estimates of PC up to +/- 7 days from the time of satellite overpass during summer cyanobacteria blooms (RMSElog < 0.33). Same-day retrieval of PC also showed good agreement with cyanobacteria biomass (R-2 > 0.66, p < 0.001). In-depth analysis of the Simis05 algorithm using in situ measurements of inherent optical properties (IOPs) revealed that the Simis05 model overestimated the phytoplankton absorption coefficient [a(ph)(lambda)] by a factor of similar to 2. However, these errors were compensated for by underestimation of the mass-specific chlorophyll absorption coefficient [a*(chla)(lambda)]. This study reinforces the need for further validation of algorithms over a range of optical water types in the context of the recently launched Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3.

TI  - Evaluation of the diagnostic utility of the new clinical case definition of pertussis - experience from sentinel and hospital-based pertussis surveillance
T2  - SRPSKI ARHIV ZA CELOKUPNO LEKARSTVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction/Objective Global surveillance systems use different clinical case definitions of pertussis. The aim of this study was to identify sign and symptom combinations with best relation with laboratory-confirmed pertussis.Methods A one-year prospective observational study, proposed by the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) for three age groups (0-3 months, four months to nine years, and >= 10 years) was performed in Novi Sad to evaluate the performance of the clinical case definition of pertussis. Laboratory confirmation of B. pertussis infection was obtained using the DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or ELISA serology tests.Results From October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014, 103 (32.3%) out of 319 participants with suspected pertussis had laboratory-confirmed pertussis. Combined whooping, post-tussive emesis, and worsening of symptoms at night was the best predictor of pertussis in outpatients aged four months to nine years (positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 11.6), while among inpatients of the same age group it was apnoea (LR+ 13.5). The LR+ in outpatients aged >= 10 years for combinations of apnoea and post-tussive emesis, or a combination of whooping and sweating episodes between paroxysms and post-tussive emesis was 16.8, while among in-patients LR+ was < 2.3 for all combinations in the same age group.Conclusions The GPI case definitions for pertussis are good predictors for laboratory-confirmed pertussis and are useful for the purpose of pertussis surveillance.

TI  - Water and territory defense from the masewalmeh perspective: Cuetzalan del Progreso, Puebla
T2  - REVISTA DE PAZ Y CONFLICTOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the process of water defense by the masewalmeh (Nahuas) that inhabit the northern highlands of the state of Puebla, given the threat of the imposition of new ideologies for the appropriation of the territory, based on technical or economic knowledge and, under the capitalist perspective, where nature is "reified" and considered as a natural resource, and that when entering the market, it is conceived as merchandise, therefore subject to privatization processes, overexploitation and dispossession. The conflict arises when at least two perspectives are contrasted, on the one hand, the worldview that the masewalmeh have regarding nature and especially water, built from their cultural referents which provide collective identity, promotes social cohesion as well as the ability to organize for the conservation and custody of biodiversity inherent in the territories where they inhabit; On the other hand, the techno-bureaucratic vision, based on principles of efficiency and effectiveness from a perspective of economic profitability based on dispossession and dispossession.The methodological approach used for the analysis was that of "complex systems" proposed by Rolando Garcia (2006) in conjunction with the theoretical approaches on the complex processes of resignification of what is considered the environment by social subjects and conflict of interests generated by the application of legal frameworks that regulate the use of so-called natural resources to what Arun Agrawal has called environmentality (2005). As a result, it was observed that, the territorial affiliation of the masewalmeh, as well as their shared norms, have guaranteed that despite the persistence of multiple interests on water, today the forms of management on the part of the communities, who have pressured the authorities to tacitly accept an instrument of public policy such as participatory municipal land use planning; This instrument has also consolidated and technically and administratively strengthened the local community water management committees.

TI  - Normalized difference vegetation change index: A technique for detecting vegetation changes using Landsat imagery
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices have been developed to characterize and extract the Earth's vegetation cover from space using satellite images. For detection of vegetation changes, temporal images are usually independently analyzed or vegetation index differencing is implemented. In this study, a vegetation change index, named normalized difference vegetation change index (NDVCI), was developed to directly detect vegetation changes between two different time images with improved accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method to detect vegetation changes was evaluated in comparison with that of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) differencing and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) differencing methods at seven test sites under different environmental conditions in Iran, Malaysia, and Italy. Landsat imagery as one of the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing was used for this purpose. Overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and omission and commission errors were calculated to assess the accuracy of the resulting change maps. The results demonstrated superiority and higher performance of NDVCI compared to EVI and NDVI differencing for detection of vegetation changes. In five out of the seven test sites, the classification accuracy of NDVCI was higher compared to that of the other methods. In contrast, the results revealed lower accuracy of EVI differencing for vegetation change detection at all the test sites, while NDVI differencing was superior at two of the test sites. In conclusion, the study demonstrated great performance of NDVCI for monitoring vegetation changes at different environmental conditions. Accordingly, this technique may improve the vegetation change detection in future studies.

TI  - From the Demise of Social Democracy to the 'End of Capitalism' <i>The Intellectual Trajectory of Wolfgang Streeck</i>
T2  - HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, Wolfgang Streeck has emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the debate on the crisis of democratic capitalism. This article provides a critical appraisal of Streeck's recent writings in light of his wider intellectual trajectory, tracing the evolutions and continuities in his work over time; highlighting its important contributions to our understanding of the present crisis; and presenting a fourfold critique of his latest book on the end of capitalism. The main argument is that Streeck's work, while very valuable for its elucidation of the dynamics behind the demise of social democracy, ultimately remains plagued by a corporatist residue that keeps him from drawing his increasingly radical critique of capitalism to its logical conclusions. As a result, Streeck's embrace of an exceedingly catastrophist worldview, devoid of any emancipatory potential, has tempted him to veer dangerously close to the welfare chauvinism of the nationalist right.

TI  - The Assessment of Favourability and Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Pinus Mugo in the Romanian Carpathians Using GIS Technology and Landsat Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Favourability classification for forest species represents a fundamental activity for deriving technological solutions in forestry, as specialists need detailed information about the ecological requirements of forest species from environmental factors: climate, pedological characteristics and morphometric characteristics of the study area. The purpose of the present study was the use of the qualitative data extracted from the ecological records of the Pinus mugo species and the generation of a complex geospatial database for the entire territory of Romania. The results were represented by a collection of thematic maps generated on favourability classes for the Romanian Carpathians, as well as for the major landform subunits which had been the basis for the statistical analysis of the results. The validation of the results was performed by comparing the results obtained through the application of the model which used the frequency points reported in the European Atlas of the Forest Tree Species from Europe, 2016. In order to identify the spatio-temporal dynamics, LANDSAT satellite images from 30 years were used, which enabled the identification of the expansion and the reduction in size of the Pinus mugo area at a zonal level, a process which is dependent on natural factors, like climatic variations, or anthropic factors (overgrazing or works of cleaning the montain pastures).

TI  - An Improved Prediction-Area Plot for Prospectivity Analysis of Mineral Deposits
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper an improved prediction-area plot has been developed. This type of plot includes performance measures similar to other existing methods (receiver operating characteristics, success-rate curves and ordinary prediction-area plots) and, therefore, offers a reliable method for evaluating the performance of spatial evidence maps and prospectivity models. To demonstrate the reliability of the improved prediction-area plot proposed, we investigated the benefits of augmented targeting criteria through remotely sensed exploration features, compared to only geological map-derived criteria, for mineral prospectivity analysis using as an example the podiform chromite deposits of the Sabzevar Ophiolite Belt, Iran. The application of the newly developed improved prediction-area plot to the prospectivity models generated in this study indicated that the augmented targeting criteria by using remote sensing data perform better than non-updated geological map-derived criteria, and that model effectiveness can be improved by using an integrated approach that entails geologic remote sensing.

TI  - NN-Based Prediction of Sentinel-1 SAR Image Filtering Efficiency
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Images acquired by synthetic aperture radars are degraded by speckle that prevents efficient extraction of useful information from radar remote sensing data. Filtering or despeckling is a tool often used to improve image quality. However, depending upon image and noise properties, the quality of improvement can vary. Besides, a quality can be characterized by different criteria or metrics, where visual quality metrics can be of value. For the case study of discrete cosine transform (DCT)based filtering, we show that improvement of radar image quality due to denoising can be predicted in a simple and fast way, especially if one deals with particular type of radar data such as images acquired by Sentinel-1. Our approach is based on application of a trained neural network that, in general, might have a different number of inputs (features). We propose a set of features describing image and noise statistics from different viewpoints. From this set, that contains 28 features, we analyze different subsets and show that a subset of the 13 most important and informative features leads to a very accurate prediction. Test image generation and network training peculiarities are discussed. The trained neural network is then tested using different verification strategies. The results of the network application to test and real-life radar images are presented, demonstrating good performance for a wide set of quality metrics.

TI  - Nomogram to predict non-sentinel lymph node status using total tumor load determined by one-step nucleic acid amplification: first report from Thailand
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAxillary staging is a significant prognostic factor often used to determine the treatment course for breast cancer. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is now the most accepted method for intra-operative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) as it can semi-quantitatively determine the tumor burden in these SLN. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be omitted in patients with limited disease in the axilla. The objective was to create nomogram for prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) status using OSNA to avoid unnecessary ALND.Patients and methodsPatients with invasive breast cancer T1-T3 and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes underwent SLN biopsy assessed by OSNA. The patients with positive SLN underwent ALND. Correlations between total tumor load (TTL), clinicopathological parameters, and NSLN status were analyzed by Chi square statistic and logistic regression. Model discrimination was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.ResultsThe total number of patients who underwent SLN biopsies was 278. There were 89 patients with positive SLN. NSLNs were positive in 40 patients. Larger tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and higher log TTL were independent factors that predicted positive NSLN. TTL can discriminate NSLN status with area under the ROC curve of 0.789 (95% CI 0.686-0.892). Two nomograms using different parameters obtained pre- and post-operatively can predict NSLN involvement with better area under the ROC curve (0.801, 95% CI 0.702-0.900 and 0.849, 95% CI 0.766-0.932, respectively).ConclusionsNomograms using results obtained via OSNA can predict NSLN status, as well as aid in deciding to omit the use of ALND.

TI  - A composite analysis of the morning cyclone in two Asian deserts
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In some areas of the world, there are certain patterns of airflow which are created as a result of the interaction between different environmental factors. This study is trying to introduce one of these specific patterns that emerges particularly in closed and semi-closed deserts, especially in the arid and semi-arid areas. This phenomenon is highly influenced by the mountain-plain wind systems and that is defined as morning cyclone. In addition to NOAA/AVHRR satellite images, the ERA-interim reanalysis data are used as the main data in this study. The morning cyclone has been studied in the Taklamakan Desert in the northwest of China, and the Margo Desert in Afghanistan. The common feature of these two deserts is being surrounded by high mountains. This feature, alongside with some climatic characteristics such as air aridity, influences the formation of morning cyclones. The results of this study demonstrate the formation mechanisms of these cyclones. According to these mechanisms, morning cyclones form when the sun rises in the morning, the land surface temperature increases, and the mixed layer grows in mountain-surrounded deserts, while the mountain-plain winds (Katabatic winds) are blowing. As long as katabatic winds are blowing and warming trend continues across the deserts, the morning cyclones continue to exist. However, approaching noon, anabatic winds dominate over the lands and the morning cyclone disappears quickly. In other words, the morning cyclone has a lifetime spanning the hours between sunrise and pre-noon.

TI  - Assessing the impact of physical exercise on cognitive function in older medical patients during acute hospitalization: Secondary analysis of a randomized trial
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAcute illness requiring hospitalization frequently is a sentinel event leading to long-term disability in older people. Prolonged bed rest increases the risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia in acutely hospitalized older adults. Exercise protocols applied during acute hospitalization can prevent functional decline in older patients, but exercise benefits on specific cognitive domains have not been previously investigated. We aimed to assess the effects of a multicomponent exercise intervention for cognitive function in older adults during acute hospitalization.Methods and findingsWe performed a secondary analysis of a single-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted from February 1, 2015, to August 30, 2017 in an Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) unit in a tertiary public hospital in Navarre (Spain). 370 hospitalized patients (aged >= 75 years) were randomly allocated to an exercise intervention (n = 185) or a control (n = 185) group (usual care). The intervention consisted of a multicomponent exercise training program performed during 5-7 consecutive days (2 sessions/day). The usual care group received habitual hospital care, which included physical rehabilitation when needed. The main outcomes were change in executive function from baseline to discharge, assessed with the dual-task (i.e., verbal and arithmetic) Gait Velocity Test (GVT) and the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A). Changes in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test and verbal fluency ability were also measured after the intervention period. The physical exercise program provided significant benefits over usual care. At discharge, the exercise group showed a mean increase of 0.1 m/s (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07, 0.13; p < 0.001) in the verbal GVT and 0.1 m/s (95% CI, 0.08, 0.13; p < 0.001) in the arithmetic GVT over usual care group. There was an apparent improvement in the intervention group also in the TMT-A score (-31.1 seconds; 95% CI, -49.5, -12.7 versus -3.13 seconds; 95% CI, -16.3, 10.2 in the control group; p < 0.001) and the MMSE score (2.10 points; 95% CI, 1.75, 2.46 versus 0.27 points; 95% CI, -0.08, 0.63; p < 0.001). Significant benefits were also observed in the exercise group for the verbal fluency test (mean 2.16 words; 95% CI, 1.56, 2.74; p < 0.001) over the usual care group. The main limitations of the study were patients' difficulty in completing all the tasks at both hospital admission and discharge (e.g., 25% of older patients were unable to complete the arithmetic GVT, and 47% could not complete the TMT-A), and only old patients with relatively good functional capacity at preadmission (i.e., Barthel Index score >= 60 points) were included in the study.ConclusionsAn individualized, multicomponent exercise training program may be an effective therapy for improving cognitive function (i.e., executive function and verbal fluency domains) in very old patients during acute hospitalization. These findings support the need for a shift from the traditional (bedrest-based) hospitalization to one that recognizes the important role of maintaining functional capacity and cognitive function in older adults, key components of intrinsic capacity.

TI  - Assessment of the Temporal and Spatial Variations of Urban Development Using RS and GIS: A Case Study-Yasuj, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal-spatial change of cities is one of the main challenges of managers and decision makers in urban development. In the present study, a parameter related to the evaluation of the capability of Yasuj City was selected, classed, and weighed to determine a desired location for urban development. Accordingly, in order to determine fuzzy maps, all factors and sub-factors were weighed using the AHP and hierarchical technique. Then, the maps of each sub-factor were standardized in IDRIS environment and the considered layers were combined in GIS environment to determine the land suitability for urban development. Next, in order to evaluate the trend of temporal-spatial variation of land use around Yasuj City, the prepared images of the Landsat satellite as well as TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors in Envin 5.1 software related to 1986, 2001, and 2016, respectively, were employed. Finally, based on the changes in land use of Yasuj City, the residential or urban sections widely changed. The changes included different uses such as forests, grasslands, agriculture, and water corpuses. In 1986-2016, the results of changes in land use around the Yasuj City indicated 5% increase in the residential section and 3, 2 and 1% decrease in rangelands, agricultural lands, and water bodies, respectively. Forests, which are located in the outer and inner sections of Yasuj City, have a lot of ecological functions. With the high speed of city development, the ecological functions of forests are decreasing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and therefore, should be taken into consideration. The results of this study, and the similar studies, indicated that spatial data, especially data related to human settlements (since they are highly changeable), are a good foundation for detailed planning. Such kind of data is also used since they are suitable tools for research purposes.

TI  - On the reliability modeling of weighted k-out-of-n systems with randomly chosen components
T2  - METRIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - The weighted k-out-of-n (briefly denoted as weighted k/n) systems are among the most important kind of redundancy structures. We consider a weighted k/n system with dependent components where the system is built up from two classes CX and CY of components that are categorized according to their weights and reliability functions. It is assumed that a random number M, M=0,1,,m, of the components are chosen from set CX whose components are distributed as FX and the remaining n-M components selected from the set CY whose components have distribution function FY. We further assume that the structure of dependency of the components can be modeled by a copula function. The reliability of the system, at any time t, is expressed as a mixture of reliability of weighted k/n systems with fixed number of the components of types CX and CY in terms of the probability mass function M. Some stochastic orderings are made between two different weighted k/n systems. It is shown that when the random mechanism of the chosen components for two systems are ordered in usual stochastic (st) order then, under some conditions, the lifetimes of the two systems are also ordered in st order. We also compare the lifetimes of two different systems in the sense of stochastic precedence concept. The results are examined by several illustrative examples under different conditions.

TI  - An Update on the Development and Feasibility Assessment of Canadian Quality Indicators for Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter.
T2  - CJC open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2010, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter (AF/AFL) quality indicator (QI) working group was established to develop QIs and assess feasibility of measurement. After extensive review, 3 priority QIs were selected. However, none were measurable at a national level.METHODS: The working group reconvened in 2017 to review the relevance of previously proposed QIs, identify opportunities to develop new QIs, and propose an initial strategy for measuring and reporting.RESULTS: Two additional priority QIs were added to the previous 3: proportion of patients with nonvalvular (NV) AF/AFL sorted by stroke risk stratum and annual rate of hospitalization for a new heart failure diagnosis. An environmental scan was undertaken to determine the potential of existing databases to provide national and provincial estimates. On the basis of validated administrative codes, the Canadian Institute for Health Information discharge abstract database can be used for inpatients. In collaboration with the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, 2 of the 5 QIs can be assessed in outpatients (patients with NVAF/AFL sorted by stroke risk stratum and high risk for stroke NVAF/AFL receiving oral anticoagulation). Stroke prevention therapy can be further measured in selected provinces with linked databases including prescriptions.CONCLUSIONS: This first step could provide a better initial understanding of the quality of AF/AFL care in Canada, but important gaps in the meaningful measurement of QIs remain. The AF/AFL QI working group has limited capacity to make progress without national level leadership and the resources to support data aggregation, data analysis, and pan-Canadian reporting.
AB  - CONTEXTE: En 2010, le groupe de travail des indicateurs de qualite (IQ) de la Societe canadienne de cardiologie sur la fibrillation auriculaire (FA) et le flutter auriculaire (FLA) a ete mis sur pied pour elaborer des IQ et evaluer la faisabilite dutiliser ces IQ comme outils de mesure. Apres un examen approfondi, trois IQ prioritaires ont ete selectionnes, mais aucun na pu etre mesure a lechelle nationale.METHODOLOGIE: Le groupe de travail sest reuni a nouveau en 2017 afin dexaminer la pertinence des IQ proposes au depart, de recenser des occasions delaborer de nouveau IQ et de proposer une strategie initiale de mesure et de production de rapports a cet egard.RESULTATS: Deux IQ prioritaires supplementaires ont ete ajoutes aux trois premiers : la proportion de patients atteints de FA non valvulaire (FANV) ou de FLA ayant fait lobjet dun tri selon la strate de risque dAVC et le taux annuel dhospitalisations attribuables a un nouveau diagnostic dinsuffisance cardiaque. Une analyse de lenvironnement a ete realisee afin de determiner si les bases de donnees existantes pouvaient fournir des estimations nationales et provinciales. Dans le cas de patients hospitalises, on peut utiliser la Base de donnees sur les conges des patients de lInstitut canadien dinformation sur la sante en se servant de codes administratifs valides. Dans le cas de patients non hospitalises (patients atteints de FANV/FLA, tries par strate de risque, exposes a un risque eleve dAVC en raison dune FANV ou dun FLA et recevant une anticoagulation orale), on peut mesurer deux des cinq IQ, en collaboration avec le Reseau canadien de surveillance sentinelle en soins primaires. Le traitement preventif de lAVC peut continuer a faire lobjet de mesures dans certaines provinces grace aux bases de donnees interreliees, comme les bases de donnees sur les ordonnances.CONCLUSIONS: Cette premiere etape a permis dobtenir une meilleure comprehension initiale de la qualite de la prise en charge de la FA et du FLA au Canada, mais dimportantes lacunes restent a combler pour rendre pertinente la mesure des IQ. Le groupe de travail des IQ sur de la FA et le FLA na pas toutes les capacites requises pour realiser des progres en labsence de leadership national et de ressources permettant de soutenir le regroupement et lanalyse des donnees, ainsi que la production de rapports a lechelle pancanadienne.

TI  - Complementarity of X-, C-, and L-band SAR Backscatter Observations to Retrieve Forest Stem Volume in Boreal Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The simultaneous availability of observations from space by remote sensing platforms operating at multiple frequencies in the microwave domain suggests investigating their complementarity in thematic mapping and retrieval of biophysical parameters. In particular, there is an interest to understand whether the wealth of short wavelength Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations at X-, C-, and L-band from currently operating spaceborne missions can improve the retrieval of forest stem volume, i.e., above-ground biomass, in the boreal zone with respect to a single frequency band. To this scope, repeated observations from TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 from the test sites of Remningstorp and Krycklan, Sweden, have been analyzed and used to estimate stem volume with a retrieval framework based on the Water Cloud Model. Individual estimates of stem volume were then combined linearly to form single-frequency and multi-frequency estimates. The retrieval was assessed at large 0.5 ha forest inventory plots (Remningstorp) and small 0.03 ha forest inventory plots (Krycklan). The relationship between SAR backscatter and stem volume differed depending on forest structure and environmental conditions, in particular at X- and C-band. The highest retrieval accuracy was obtained at both test sites at L-band. The combination of stem volume estimates from data acquired at two or three frequencies achieved an accuracy that was superior to values obtained at a single frequency. When combining estimates from X-, C-, and L-band data, the relative RMSE for the 0.5 ha inventory plots at Remningstorp was 31.3%. For the 0.03 ha inventory plots at Krycklan, the relative RMSE was above 50%. In a retrieval scenario involving short wavelength SAR backscatter data, these results suggest combining multiple frequencies to ensure the highest possible retrieval accuracy achievable. Retrievals should be undertaken to target spatial scales well above the size of a pixel.

TI  - SPACE-TIME VARIABILITY OF THE RONCADOR RIVER BASIN IN THE CHANGE OF LAND USE AND COVER AND ITS CORRELATION WITH CLIMATIC VARIABLES
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the space-time dynamics of the soil use and occupation of the Rio Roncador river basin between 1985 and 2010. The scenes were classified by two methods (partially unsupervised - K-Means and supervised - Maximum likelihood), the Thematic Mapper sensor products on the LANDSAT 5 orbital platform were used for both images of a 25-year time series (1985 to 2000). In order to measure the accuracy of the field the computer application Google Earth was used, in which nine classes (urban area, agricultural area, pasture, exposed soil, native forest, secondary vegetation, mangrove, altitude field and water) were collected. A multiple linear regression was performed, correlating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - mean NDVI (dependent variable) with the independent climatic variables (global solar radiation - MJm(-2) day(-1), average air temperature - degrees C, relative humidity -%, evapotranspiration - mm and rain - mm). According to the general classification by Kappa parameter of the images for 2005 and 2010, they were identified as very good (68% and 74%). These results confirm that the Roncador River Basin is undergoing transformation in its landscape, with an average reduction of -49% in native vegetation areas due to the increase in urban areas (25%) and agriculture (31%). The statistical analysis showed that rainfall and air temperature were the only variables that presented significant sigma (0.04) and (0.02). The obtained coefficient of determination indicated that 47% of the variations of the "vegetation index" are explained by the environmental variables.

TI  - A Descriptive Analysis of Causalities Undergoing CASEVAC from the Point-of-Injury in the Department of Defense Trauma Registry
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan entail an asymmetric battlefield without clearly defined forward lines of troops as seen in previous wars. Accordingly, the United States military medical services have increasingly adopted casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) platforms. We describe CASEVAC events reported within the Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DODTR). Materials and Methods: This is a secondary analysis of previously published data from two datasets spanning from 2007 through 2017. We isolated casualties within our dataset that had a documented evacuation method from the point-of-injury other than dedicated medical evacuation platforms (e.g., MEDEVAC, etc.). Results: During OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, three casualties underwent CASEVAC. The median age was 30 and all were male. Most sustained injuries from explosives (67%) and the median composite injury scores were low (10). The most frequent seriously injured body region was the thorax (67%). All survived to hospital discharge. During operations in Afghanistan (OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, OPERATION FREEDOMS SENTINEL, OPERATION NEW DAWN), 248 casualties underwent CASEVAC. The median age was 28 and most (96%) were male. Most sustained injuries from explosives (58%) and the median injury score was low (9). The most frequent seriously injured body region was the extremities (24%). Most (97%) survived to hospital discharge. During OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE, 247 casualties underwent CASEVAC. The median age was 21 and most (96%) were male. The majority sustained injuries from explosives (61%) and the median injury score was low (9). The most frequent seriously injury body region was the extremities (27%). Most survived to hospital discharge (94%). Conclusions: In our dataset, CASEVAC events most frequently involved US military personnel service members with most surviving to hospital discharge. Developing new terminology that distinguishes different types of CASEVAC would allow for more accurate future analyses of casualty evacuation and outcomes - such as those transports that are truly in a non-medical versus the various medical platforms that do not fall with into the confines of the MEDEVAC platforms.

TI  - Recent Advances in Forest Observation with Visual Interpretation of Very High-Resolution Imagery
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Workshop on Space Based Measurement of Forest Properties for Carbon Cycle Research
CL  - Int Space Sci Inst, Bern, SWITZERLAND
AB  - The land area covered by freely available very high-resolution (VHR) imagery has grown dramatically over recent years, which has considerable relevance for forest observation and monitoring. For example, it is possible to recognize and extract a number of features related to forest type, forest management, degradation and disturbance using VHR imagery. Moreover, time series of medium-to-high-resolution imagery such as MODIS, Landsat or Sentinel has allowed for monitoring of parameters related to forest cover change. Although automatic classification is used regularly to monitor forests using medium-resolution imagery, VHR imagery and changes in web-based technology have opened up new possibilities for the role of visual interpretation in forest observation. Visual interpretation of VHR is typically employed to provide training and/or validation data for other remote sensing-based techniques or to derive statistics directly on forest cover/forest cover change over large regions. Hence, this paper reviews the state of the art in tools designed for visual interpretation of VHR, including Geo-Wiki, LACO-Wiki and Collect Earth as well as issues related to interpretation of VHR imagery and approaches to quality assurance. We have also listed a number of success stories where visual interpretation plays a crucial role, including a global forest mask harmonized with FAO FRA country statistics; estimation of dryland forest area; quantification of deforestation; national reporting to the UNFCCC; and drivers of forest change.

TI  - DSM Quality of Korean Satellite KOMPSAT-3 in Comparison to AW3D30 and Sentinel-1A in Respect of Airborne Laser Scanning
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - With significant technological improvements on earth observation instruments, three dimensional space-borne remote sensing data became indispensable for modelling large areas and continents. To acquire high resolution 3D earth data, actual optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite missions are launched frequently. Korean Multi-Purpose Satellite 3 (KOMPSAT-3), which was launched in May, 2012 by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), is a high-resolution optical observation mission. The 0.7 m ground sampling distance (GSD) and stereo imaging capability of the satellite enables to derive qualified digital surface models (DSM). We generated a 5 m spacing KOMPSAT-3 DSM in Istanbul historic peninsula and estimated its quality by comprehensively analysing the absolute and relative accuracies and the morphological detail description capability. In the analysis, 1 m spacing airborne laser scanning (ALS) DSM was used as reference. Additionally, the ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite) World 3D 30 m (AW3D30) and Sentinel-1A (S-1A) DSMs have been used in comparison with the KOMPSAT-3 DSM. As accuracy metrics, standard deviation (SZ) and normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of height differences between KOMPSAT-3, AW3D30, S-1A and ALS reference DSM were used. The results demonstrated that KOMPSAT-3 DEM quality is better than AW3D30 and S-1A both in accuracy and morphologic detail analysis.

TI  - A Clown's Laughter Specificity: From "Anesthesia of Heart" to "Synesthesia of Love"
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides insight into the insufficiently studied area of synesthesia in the art of clowning. The research methodology is based on the collection of essays by A. Berson "Laughter: an essay on the meaning of the comic". Herein laughter is regarded as a social creative proofreader, which signals that the creative driving force has been lost in the phenomenon/process. Besides, the author refers to the theory of A.G. Kozintsev. It states that at the stage of the "language Rubicon", anthropogenesis makes an evolutionary leap. After it, with the creation of language, a human being retains a direct two-element connection between signals and messages (inherited from animals), in particular, laughter. The latter is seen as something common between human being and animal. The difference is that a human responds to external signals not automatically, but selectively. The hypothesis of the study is that in the comic arts the connection between laughter stimulus and the response is formalized. The exception is the art of clowning, which goes beyond the comic, back to the tragic. It appears as a manifestation of human creative evolution, associated with the "language Rubicon". The article makes a point that a clown's laughter results from the multilevel structure of the psyche and is in a perfect step with "synesthesia of heart", love and empathy for the clown's character/masque. On the one hand, this unites it with the laughter of animals. On the other hand, this sharply distinguishes it by a strong feeling of laughter drama and tragedy. The laughter in a masque transforms tragedy into comedy. This gives reason to consider a clown's laughter in terms of synesthesia and addiction. The article is based on the author's report "Specificity of synesthesia as a form of world perception and worldview among satirists, comedians, clowns", presented at the conference "The phenomenon of synesthesia in the interdisciplinary space of scientific knowledge" (October 22-23, 2018 in Moscow, Russia).

TI  - Long-Term (1986-2015) Crop Water Use Characterization over the Upper Rio Grande Basin of United States and Mexico Using Landsat-Based Evapotranspiration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of historical water use in the Upper Rio Grande Basin (URGB), United States and Mexico, using Landsat-derived actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from 1986 to 2015 is presented here as the first study of its kind to apply satellite observations to quantify long-term, basin-wide crop consumptive use in a large basin. The rich archive of Landsat imagery combined with the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model was used to estimate and map ETa across the basin and over irrigated fields for historical characterization of water-use dynamics. Monthly ETa estimates were evaluated using six eddy-covariance (EC) flux towers showing strong correspondence (r(2) > 0.80) with reasonable error rates (root mean square error between 6 and 19 mm/month). Detailed spatiotemporal analysis using peak growing season (June-August) ETa over irrigated areas revealed declining regional crop water-use patterns throughout the basin, a trend reinforced through comparisons with gridded ETa from the Max Planck Institute (MPI). The interrelationships among seven agro-hydroclimatic variables (ETa, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), maximum air temperature (Ta), potential ET (ETo), precipitation, and runoff) are all summarized to support the assessment and context of historical water-use dynamics over 30 years in the URGB.

TI  - Regional CO emission estimated from ground-based remote sensing at Hefei site, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) is regarded as a useful tracer of biomass burning and anthropogenic pollution, so CO measurements can provide valuable information about the intensity of various anthropogenic activities. However, the emission estimates of CO based on inventories are associated with high uncertainties, especially in China. As CO is co-emitted with CO2 in the combustion of carbonaceous fuels, the relationship between CO and CO2 is often used to estimate regional CO emissions. Hefei is located in the area of eastern central China, which is one of the most industrialized regions in China, with severe regional air pollution. The enhancement slopes of Delta CO to Delta CO2 were calculated and compared from ground-based remote sensing observations, surface in-situ measurements, satellite and emission inventory data at the Hefei site during the period from September 2015 to August 2017. Both inventory based ratios of Delta CO to Delta CO2 are significantly larger than the ratios based on the observation data, including Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) data, in-situ data, and satellite data. Further the CO emissions in the central China were estimated from the enhancement slopes of Delta CO/Delta CO2 combined with the CO2 emission inventory. The CO emission estimated from the ground-based FTS observations and the Peking University (PKU) inventory based CO2 emission is about 10.96 +/- 0.88 and 11.95 +/- 0.71 Tg CO yr(-1) during the 2015-2016 and the 2016-2017 period, respectively. The CO emission estimated from the ground-based FTS observations and the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory based CO2 emission is about 11.27 +/- 0.91 and 12.35 +/- 0.74 Tg CO yr(-1), respectively. So the CO emissions estimated from the ground-based FTS data and the different inventory based CO2 emission show a good agreement. However, CO emissions derived from FTS data are substantially lower than those calculated directly from the inventories, i.e. there is a large difference between CO emissions derived from FTS and CO emissions directly derived from the two inventories. The phenomenon suggests that the emission inventories greatly overestimate the actual CO emission in the study area. This study estimates the regional CO emissions from ground-based remote sensing observations and investigates how much the difference is between the emissions from inventories and ground-based measurements.

TI  - Construction of a drought monitoring model using deep learning based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a popular scientific issue in global climate change research. Accurate monitoring of drought has important implications for the sustainable development of regional agriculture in the context of increasingly complex global climate change. Deep learning is a widely used technique in the field of artificial intelligence. However, ongoing on drought monitoring using deep learning is relatively scarce. In this paper, the various hazard factors in drought development were comprehensively considered based on satellite data including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) as multi-source remote sensing data. By using the deep learning technique, a comprehensive drought monitoring model was constructed and tested in Henan Province of China as an example. The results showed that the comprehensive drought model has good applicability in the monitoring of meteorological drought and agricultural drought. There was a significant positive correlation between the drought indicators of the model output and the comprehensive meteorological drought index (CI) measured at the site scale. The consistency rate of the drought grade of the two models was 85.6% and 79.8% for the training set and the test set, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the drought index of the model and the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPED was between 0.772 and 0.910 (P < 0.01), which indicated a strong level of significance. The correlation coefficient between the drought index of the model and the soil relative moisture at a 10 cm depth was greater than 0.550 (P < 0.01), and there was a good correlation between them. This study provides a new method for the comprehensive assessment of regional drought.

AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), as an advanced active sensor, can penetrate vegetation to detect ground information. The multimode observation data can provide more information to interpret different scattering mechanisms and have great application potential in soil moisture estimation (SME). In this paper, a modified method of soil moisture inversion from PoISAR data based on a two-component polarimetric decomposition model is introduced. The proposed method neglects the dihedral scattering component in the case of sparse vegetation cover and no-building areas, compensates the orientation angle by considering the influence of surface roughness and terrain slope, and calculates the dielectric constant with the hybrid X-Bragg/Fresnel model. Gaofen-3 (C-band) data from Ordos, Inner Mongolia, and Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) (C- and L-band) data from Southern Oklahoma were applied in the experimental research. Furthermore, the performance and validity limits were assessed by comparing the retrieval results with in situ measurements and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture products. The results reveal a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 8.66% with an inversion rate of up to 61% when using the Gaofen-3 data from Ordos. For the Southern Oklahoma study area, the inversion RMSE of the AIRSAR C- and L-band data is 8.57% and 8.95%, respectively. The tendency of the inversion results is also consistent with the change trend of the site observations. In the bare soil and sparse vegetation covered areas, the retrieval error is relatively small, while in dense vegetation covered areas, soil moisture is underestimated in both the C- and L-band data, and the former is more underestimated than the latter.

TI  - Prospective feasibility study for single-tracer sentinel node mapping by ICG (indocyanine green) fluorescence and OSNA (one-step nucleic acid amplification) assay in laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe double-tracer method has been established for sentinel node (SN) mapping in gastric cancer surgery. However, there remain several unresolved issues that prevent its widespread use in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of single-tracer SN mapping in laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer, using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging with a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay intraoperatively.MethodsPatients with clinical T1N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma preoperatively were considered for inclusion if they had a single primary lesion 4cm or less in maximal diameter. Immunohistochemical staining with the anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody was performed on preoperative biopsy specimens, and patients with faint positive reactions were excluded. Intraoperatively, single-tracer SN biopsy with ICG fluorescence imaging was performed, followed by laparoscopic gastrectomy with modified D1+ or D2 lymph node dissection.ResultsTwenty eligible patients underwent SN biopsy and laparoscopic gastrectomy. SNs were identified in 17 cases (85%), with a median number of three SNs per patient. The median times for SN mapping and OSNA assay were 19 and 35min, respectively. OSNA assay detected one metastatic lymph node, but all other nodes were negative. No adverse effects were observed in relation to SN mapping.ConclusionsSingle-tracer SN mapping by ICG fluorescence imaging with intraoperative diagnosis by OSNA assay is feasible and safe. SNs can be identified in most patients, without producing false-negative results. Further clinical trial to demonstrate the sensitivity is ongoing.

TI  - Numerical Simulation for FSW Process at Welding Aluminium Alloy AA6082-T6
T2  - METALS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the numerical simulation of the Friction stir welding (FSW) process obtained by using the DEFORM 3D software package. Numerical simulations are based on experimental research, welding of aluminum alloy AA6082-T6 by FSW method, which has the thickness of 7.8 mm. The aim of this paper is to determine the reliability of numerical simulations in the FSW process, which is followed by large deformations, where influential geometric and kinematic parameters are varied. Numerical research was done on the basis of the adopted five-phase orthogonal experimental plan with a variety of factors on two levels and repetition at the central point of the plan for four times. The parameters varied in the experiment are: Welding speed v mm / min, a rotation speed of tool omega rpm, angle of pin slopes alpha degrees, a diameter of the pin d mm, diameter of the shoulder D mm. During the performing of the FSW process, forces were measured in three normal directions: Axial force F-z, longitudinal force F-x and side force F-y, as well as the temperature in the adopted measuring positions of the workpiece. The experimental results obtained in this way were compared with the numerical experiment in the same adopted measuring positions, i. e., in the paper an analysis and comparison of the obtained experimental and numerical data of the measured forces and the generated temperature field were made.

TI  - Discrimination of Tomato Plants (Solanum lycopersicum) Grown under Anaerobic Baffled Reactor Effluent, Nitrified Urine Concentrates and Commercial Hydroponic Fertilizer Regimes Using Simulated Sensor Spectral Settings
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We assess the discriminative strength of three different satellite spectral settings (HyspIRI, the forthcoming Landsat 9 and Sentinel 2-MSI), in mapping tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Linnaeus) plants grown under hydroponic system, using human-excreta derived materials (HEDM), namely, anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) effluent and nitrified urine concentrate (NUC) and commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix (CHFM) as main sources of nutrients. Simulated spectral settings of HyspIRI, Landsat 9 and Sentinel 2-MSI were resampled from spectrometric proximally sensed data. Discriminant analysis (DA) was applied in discriminating tomatoes grown under these different nutrient sources. Results showed that the simulated spectral settings of HyspIRI sensor better discriminate tomatoes grown under different fertilizer regimes when compared to Landsat 9 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI spectral configurations. Using the DA algorithm, HyspIRI exhibited high overall accuracy (OA) of 0.99 and a kappa statistic of 0.99 whereas Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI exhibited OA of 0.94 and 0.95 and 0.79 and 0.85 kappa statistics, respectively. Simulated HyspIRI wavebands 710, 720, 690, 840, 1370 and 2110 nm, Sentinel 2-MSI bands 7 (783 nm), 6 (740 nm), 5 (705 nm) and 8a (865 nm) as well as Landsat bands 5 (865 nm), 6 (1610 nm), 7 (2200 nm) and 8 (590 nm), in order of importance, were selected as the most suitable bands for discriminating tomatoes grown under different fertilizer regimes. Overall, the performance of simulated HyspIRI, Landsat 9 OLI-2 and Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands seem to bring new opportunities for crop monitoring.

TI  - Risk Factors for Adverse Outcomes in Adult and Pediatric Patients With Hyperglycemia Presenting to the Emergency Department: A Systematic Review
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DIABETES
M3  - Review
AB  - Hyperglycemia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, often resulting in adverse outcomes. This review aimed to identify predictors of adverse outcomes, such as repeated hospital visits, hospitalization or death, in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with hyperglycemia.Electronic searches of Medline and EMBASE were conducted for studies in English of patients presenting to the ED with hyperglycemia. Both adult and pediatric populations were included, with and without diabetes. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts for relevance. If consensus was not reached, full-length manuscripts were reviewed. For discrepancies, a third reviewer was consulted. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Study-and patient-specific data were extracted and presented descriptively.Eight observational studies were reviewed; they included a total of 96,970 patients. Predictors of adverse outcomes included age, lowest income quintile, urban dwellers, presence of comorbidities, coexisting hyperlactatemia, having a family physician, elevated serum creatinine level, diabetes managed with insulin, sentinel visit for hyperglycemia in the past month, and high blood glucose level measured in the ED. Conflicting evidence was found for whether known history of diabetes was associated with risk. Factors associated with favourable outcomes included systolic blood pressure of 90 to 150 mmHg and tachycardia.This systematic review found 12 factors associated with adverse outcomes, and 2 factors associated with more favourable outcomes in patients presenting to the ED with hyperglycemia. These factors should be considered for easier identification of patients at higher risk for adverse outcomes to guide management and follow up. (C) 2018 Canadian Diabetes Association.

TI  - Climate impact of surface albedo change in Life Cycle Assessment: Implications of site and time dependence
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use affects the global climate through greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, as well as through changes in biophysical properties of the surface. Anthropogenic land use change over time has caused substantial climate forcing related to albedo, i.e. the share of solar radiation reflected back off the ground. There is growing concern that albedo change may offset climate benefits provided by afforestation, bioenergy or other emission reduction measures that affect land cover. Conversely, land could be managed actively to increase albedo as a strategy to combat global warming.Albedo change can be directly linked to radiative forcing, which allows its climate impact to be compared with that of greenhouse gases in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, the most common LCA methods are static and linear and thus fail to account for the spatial and temporal dependence of albedo change and its strength as a climate forcer. This study sought to develop analytical methods that better estimate radiative forcing from albedo change by accounting for spatial and temporal variations in albedo, solar irradiance and transmission through the atmosphere. Simplifications concerning the temporal resolution and aggregation procedures of input data were evaluated.The results highlight the importance of spatial and temporal variations in determining the climate impact of albedo change in LCA. Irradiance and atmospheric transmittance depend on season, latitude and climate zone, and they co-vary with instantaneous albedo. Ignoring these dependencies led to case-specific errors in radiative forcing. Extreme errors doubled the climate cooling of albedo change or resulted in warming rather than cooling in two Swedish cases considered. Further research is needed to understand how different land use strategies affect the climate due to albedo, and how this compares to the effect of greenhouse gases. Given that albedo change and greenhouse gases act on different time scales, LCAs can provide better information in relation to climate targets if the timing of flows is considered in life cycle inventory analysis and impact assessment.

TI  - Finding water: Reliability of remote-sensing methods in searching for water bodies within diverse landscapes
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Searching for and identification of water bodies (WBs) constitute an integral part of many ecological studies. Because field observations or sophisticated and costly remote sensing techniques (RSTs) cannot always be used, simple methods using freely available data are proposed. The reliability of these techniques in identifying WBs has not yet been experimentally verified, however. This study compares the reliability within various landscape types of five methods/tools in searching for WBs: Google Earth, Landsat 7, Sentinel 2, Open Street Map (OSM), digital water management database (DIBAVOD), and merged layer DOSM (OSM + DIBAVOD). The determined numbers and areas of WBs were compared with values determined by field observation (control). The reliability of all methods improved with increasing WB area. None of the methods was sufficiently accurate to identify WBs smaller than 500 m(2). Images from the Landsat 7 and Sentinel 2 satellites were demonstrated to be entirely unusable due to low resolution. Within various landscape types, reliability of the methods was comparable. When working with various techniques it is necessary to be aware of the limitations of each. To increase reliability, we recommend combining methods.

TI  - Dynamics of deforestation in Amazonia and its impacts in hydrology: Machadinho River basin - Rondonia / Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Machadinho river basin is an example of disorderly occupation present in the Amazon region, where large areas were deforested and consequently the forest was converted into pastures and urban centers. The present work has the objective of analyzing the impacts in hydrology (streamflows, precipitation and evapotranspiration) of the Machadinho river basin due to its dynamics of anthropic occupation. First, the land cover change was analyzed using Landsat 5-TM images for the years 1984, 1997 and 2011. The stream flow variable was evaluated for its sensitivity by using the SWAT model to determine net discharge by setting the weather patterns and by varying the historical land cover scenarios. The precipitation, obtained by data from the CHIRPS for the period from 1981 to 2017, and evapotranspiration, estimated by the SSEBop data between 2002 and 2017, were treated as distributed geospatial variables in the basin, with behavioral trends of their corresponding historical series measured by means of the Mann-Kendal test. The results showed that the occupation of the basin occurred in a disorderly way, where the pasture area increased from 2.6% in 1984 to 45.9% in 2011, with the highest conversion observed at the spring of the main water body, which accounted for a higher flow production by the SWAT model that adequately described the variable. In addition, trends of rainfall reduction were observed in wetter months, while trends of evapotranspiration elevation were detected in warmer months. Therefore, it is noteworthy to register that deforestation in the region tends to reduce water availability to the basin.

TI  - Automated surface energy balance algorithm for land (ASEBAL) based on automating endmember pixel selection for evapotranspiration calculation in MODIS orbital images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a fundamental phenomenon within terrestrial system processes that involves water on land and in the atmosphere. ET is one of the main components of energy production on Earth, and it controls the water balance. The determination of ET is very complex and requires an experienced modeler and a substantial number of working hours. Thus, we present a novel algorithm called the automated surface energy balance algorithm for land (ASEBAL) to automate the application of all stages of the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) to estimate ET from a long time series of MODIS orbital images. In this study, ASEBAL was applied to automate the endmember pixel selection and estimation of ET for 282 images of the Ipanema River Basin, which is located in a semiarid area of Brazil. The mean execution time was 3 min for each image, with the mean daily ET ranging from 1.63 mm day(-1) to 6.22 nm day(-1), presenting a mean ET of 3.86 mm day(-1) and a standard deviation of 0.97 mm day(-1). The comparison between the manual and automated selections of the endmember pixels performed in 37 images showed an average difference of 7% in the values of the selected pixels. A mean difference of 0.28 mm between the manual and automatic ET estimates was observed. In addition, a pixel-by-pixel comparison yielded an average R-2 of 0.82. The proposed automated pixel selection procedure remarkably reduced the execution time and eliminated the possibility of human error. Thus, ASEBAL was shown to be an efficient tool for applications with many images and was also shown to be a less complex task, with lower error incidences and much shorter execution time than the traditional method used to apply the algorithm.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Through record linkage, we describe the causes of death among persons with diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in England. Persons >= 1 year with anti-HCV/HCV-PCR tests reported to PHE sentinel surveillance during 2002-2016 were linked to death registrations from the Office for National Statistics during 2008-2016. We found that 8.6% of the 204 265 with evidence of HCV during the study period died. Among them, external causes (accidental poisoning from drugs) and liver disease (end-stage liver disease, liver cancer, hepatitis, alcohol- and non-alcohol-related) were the leading underlying causes of death (18% and 34.5%, respectively); the latter increased to 49.2% if reported anywhere on the death certificate. Median age of death was lower in persons with evidence of HCV than the general population (53 years vs 81 years). A higher proportion of persons with HCV died of external causes, liver disease and HIV compared to the general population (P < 0.001). Potential impact of new HCV treatments was observed as a relative reduction in liver-related deaths in 2016 compared with 2015. Recording of HCV as a contributory cause of death was 28.4% for all underlying causes, but 58.8% among the subgroup who died of liver disease. Data linkage between laboratory diagnosis and deaths data is an important tool for monitoring all-cause mortality among those with HCV and quantifying under-reporting of HCV in death registrations. Changes in mortality trends (causes and prematurity) in people with HCV can help evaluate the impact in the UK of HCV treatment scale-up and other interventions to achieve HCV elimination.

TI  - Introduction to the Special Issue: Ice on Ceres
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Ceres is the largest body in the asteroid belt, and the most water-rich inner solar system body after Earth. Its exploration by the Dawn spacecraft has been long anticipated, in large part because it was expected to be an ice-rich world. A variety of ice- and volatile-related physical processes were expected to occur on Ceres, including possible cryovolcanism. A major goal of the Dawn mission at Ceres was to understand the abundance, distribution, and phase partitioning of water in the subsurface. Coordinated investigations of subsurface ice during the Dawn mission benefited from the decades-long effort to inventory and characterize subsurface ice on Mars. Specifically, morphological analysis was leveraged to bridge a length-scale gap between geophysical remote sensing data sets that provide quantitative constraints on the abundance of subsurface ice at very shallow depths (<1 m; neutron spectroscopy) and data sets that provide quantitative constraints on composition at much longer length scales (tens of kilometers; gravity science). This morphological analysis underscores that Ceres shares geophysical characteristics with terrestrial planets, icy moons, comets, and asteroids, and blurs some of the conventional boundaries between these terms. Grappling with this ambiguity stands to benefit investigations of interior evolution and volatile-related processes on all solid planetary bodies.

AB  - This study aims at validating the cloud mask produced by the land surface reflectance code (LaSRC) for Landsat 8 data. To detect clouds in optical satellite imagery, LaSRC uses quality assurance (QA) layers, which are produced during the atmospheric correction process. The QA layers include a "cloud mask," which is based on the estimation of a residual metric showing the quality of aerosol inversion, and "high aerosol," which shows the impact of aerosols on the derived surface reflectance. Validation is performed using the "L8 Biome" cloud validation dataset, which is produced by the US Geological Survey, and consists of 96 Landsat 8 scenes distributed globally over 12 different biomes. We show that the LaSRC cloud detection algorithm reliably identifies thick clouds with commission and omission errors less than 4%. Large cloud overdetection errors occur for thin clouds, which is due to the subjectivity of defining and extracting thin clouds in the reference dataset. We conclude this paper with recommendations on using the LaSRC QA layers, and give suggestions on reducing subjectivity, when generating cloud validation datasets.

To increase the efficiency of the proposed approach, 16 cloud types were identified during the periods of snow cover absence, and 12 cloud types, in its presence; parallel computation methods on the general-purpose graphic processor units were used. The results of studying the frequency of various cloud types and variations in their parameters over the latitude zones of 50 degrees-60 degrees and 60 degrees-70 degrees N in the Tomsk oblast in 2017 are analyzed. The episodes with the deviation from the annual course are considered for a number of characteristics of several cloud types.

AB  - The first law of thermodynamics tells that the total amount of energy and matter in our Universe remains constant. This is also called the law of constants and implies that our Universe is a closed system with regard to matter and energy. The second law of thermodynamics was traditionally explained in terms of increasing entropy over time. This law, from an infodynamics perspective, can be regarded as increasing complexity of informational content over time. This opens an evolutionary view how, from an infodynamics perspective, our Universe evolved from initial simplicity through increasing complexity over time. Increasing complexity over time in a closed-loop system generates unique transformational dynamics. This paper explores how to apply this understanding for systemic transformational change within conventional systems that have evolved from a mechanistic worldview. Examples of praxis are provided to highlight this midwifing process to ease our collective birthing pains into new ways of being.

TI  - Multi-Beam Circular Polarized Reflectarray on Parabolic Reflector by Variable Rotation Technique
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-beams antennas are currently being used for direct broadcast satellite, personal communication satellite, military communication satellite, and high-speed internet applications. In this work, a circularly polarized (CP) multi-spot beam satellite parabolic reflectarray antenna is designed to provide six spot beams at 19.7 GHz. For this purpose, an easy technique to compute the required phase shifts to produce two focused beams in specular directions for a CP parabolic reflectarray is proposed. These required phase shifts are added to the reflected fields by the variable rotation of the reflectarray elements printed on the surface of a parabolic antenna which are fed by a dual-CP feed-horn. For this purpose, a reflectarray cell made of a conductive cross embedded in a grounded multilayered substrate is optimized to produce very linear phase-shift and low cross-polarization level. To demonstrate the multibeam capacity, a 1.8-meter offset parabolic reflectarray made of the optimized reflectarray element was designed to generate six focused beams in dual-CP with three dual-CP feed-horns. The six main spots fulfill the typical multi spot satellite requirement with angular separation less than 0.56 degrees, 0.4 dB loss in the gain, and cross-polarization level below 35 dB with respect to the maximum of radiation.

TI  - Hybrid Methodology for the Estimation of Crop Coefficients Based on Satellite Imagery and Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the current study was the investigation of specific relationships between crop coefficients and vegetation indices (VI) computed at the water-limited environment of Lake Karla Watershed, Thessaly, in central Greece. A Mapping ET (evapotranspiration) at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model was used to derive crop coefficient values during the growing season of 2012. The proposed methodology was developed using medium resolution Landsat 7 ETM+ images and meteorological data from a local weather station. Cotton, sugar beets, and corn fields were utilized. During the same period, spectral signatures were obtained for each crop using the field spectroradiometer GER1500 (Spectra Vista Corporation, NY, U.S.A.). Relative spectral responses (RSR) were used for the filtering of the specific reflectance values giving the opportunity to match the spectral measurements with Landsat ETM+ bands. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) were then computed, and empirical relationships were derived using linear regression analysis. NDVI, SAVI, and EVI2 were tested separately for each crop. The resulting equations explained those relationships with a very high R-2 value (>0.86). These relationships have been validated against independent data. Validation using a new image file after the experimental period gives promising results, since the modeled image file is similar in appearance to the initial one, especially when a crop mask is applied. The CROPWAT model supports those results when using the new crop coefficients to estimate the related crop water requirements. The main benefit of the new approach is that the derived relationships are better adjusted to the crops. The described approach is also less time-consuming because there is no need for atmospheric correction when working with ground spectral measurements.

TI  - Estimating leaf area index and light extinction coefficient using Random Forest regression algorithm in a tropical moist deciduous forest, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index ( LAI) and light extinction coefficient (k) are the key structural parameters controlling many canopy functions like radiation and water interception, radiation extinction, water and gas exchange. The present study aims at developing predictive models for generating spatial distribution of LAI and k by integrating remote sensing imagery and field data. The study was carried out in a tropical moist deciduous forest of Uttarakhand, India. Various spectral variables were derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data of 8 May 2017 to predict LAI and k. In-situ measurements of LAI, incident Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) above canopy (I-o) and below canopy (I) were taken using CI-110 Plant Canopy Imager. Canopy gap fraction and k (using Beer-Lambert's equation) were calculated. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to predict the spatial distribution of LAI and k using the best predictor variables. The best predictor variables for LAI included band 6 (Short wave infra-red (SWIR) -1) and band 7 (SWIR-2), tasseled cap wetness, Moisture Stress Index (MSI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). For prediction of k, the best predictor variables were band 6 (SWIR-1) and band 7 (SWIR-2), NDMI, tasseled cap wetness, MSI and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These variables were selected to generate RF-based models to predict LAI and k. On validation, the models were able to predict LAI with R-2 = 0.79 and % RMSE = 14.25% and k with R-2 = 0.77 and % RMSE = 11.98%. The predicted LAI and k followed an inverse relation in accordance with the Beer Lambert's Law. The results showed that RF can be effectively applied to predict the spatial distribution of LAI and k.

TI  - Trap Location and Premises Condition Influences on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Catches Using Biogents Sentinel Traps During a 'Rear and Release' Program: Implications for Designing Surveillance Programs
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the incidence of arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever increases globally, controlling their primary vector, Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae), is of greater importance than ever before. Mosquito control programs rely heavily on effective adult surveillance to ensure methodological efficacy. The Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap is the gold standard for surveilling adult Aedes mosquitoes and is commonly deployed worldwide, including during modern 'rear and release' programs. Despite its extensive use, few studies have directly assessed environmental characteristics that affect BGS trap catches, let alone how these influences change during 'rear and release' programs. We assessed male and female Ae. aegypti spatial stability, as well as premises condition and trap location influences on BGS trap catches, as part of Debug Innisfail 'rear and release' program in northern Australia. We found similar trends in spatial stability of male and female mosquitoes at both weekly and monthly resolutions. From surveillance in locations where no males were released, reduced catches were found at premises that contained somewhat damaged houses and unscreened properties. In addition, when traps were located in areas that were unsheltered, more than 10 m from commonly used sitting areas or more visually complex catches were also negatively affected. In locations where males were released, we found that traps in treatment sites, relative to control sites, displayed increased catches in heavily shaded premises and were inconsistently influenced by differences in house sets and building materials. Such findings have valuable implications for a range of Ae. aegypti surveillance programs.

TI  - Cloud Masking for Landsat 8 and MODIS Terra Over Snow-Covered Terrain: Error Analysis and Spectral Similarity Between Snow and Cloud
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated, reliable cloud masks over snow-covered terrain would improve the retrieval of snow properties from multispectral satellite sensors. The U.S. Geological Survey and NASA chose the currently operational cloud masks based on global performance across diverse land cover types. This study assesses errors in these cloud masks over snow-covered, midlatitude mountains. We use 26 Landsat 8 scenes with manually delineated cloud, snow, and land cover to assess the performance of two cloud masks: CFMask for the Landsat 8 OLI and the cloud mask that ships with Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance products MOD09GA and MYD09GA. The overall precision and recall of CFMask over snow-covered terrain are 0.70 and 0.86; the MOD09GA cloud mask precision and recall are 0.17 and 0.72. A plausible reason for poorer performance of cloud masks over snow lies in the potential similarity between multispectral signatures of snow and cloud pixels in three situations: (1) Snow at high elevation is bright enough in the "cirrus" bands (Landsat band 9 or MODIS band 26) to be classified as cirrus. (2) Reflectances of "dark" clouds in shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands are bracketed by snow spectra in those wavelengths. (3) Snow as part of a fractional mixture in a pixel with soils sometimes produces "bright SWIR" pixels that look like clouds. Improvement in snow-cloud discrimination in these cases will require more information than just the spectrum of the sensor's bands or will require deployment of a spaceborne imaging spectrometer, which could discriminate between snow and cloud under conditions where a multispectral sensor might not.Plain Language Summary Both snow and clouds are brighter in the visible spectrum and colder in the thermal infrared than other parts of the landscape, so discriminating between them in passive optical satellite images poses a long-standing problem in remote sensing of Earth. The operational cloud masks now provided for satellite imagery were chosen because they identify clouds correctly over most land covers. Over snow-covered terrain in the mountains, however, errors in identification persist. This study evaluates those errors and identifies reasons why some snow and clouds appear very similar in our workhorse satellite sensors, specifically Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer: (1) At high elevations, snow can look like cirrus clouds in the specific spectral regions employed to detect cirrus. (2) Snow is usually dark in spectral bands where most clouds are bright, but thin clouds can appear similarly dark in those same bands. (3) Image pixels containing both snow and soil can appear bright in the same spectral regions where clouds are bright. Fixing these cases of misidentification will require analyses that use more information than just the spectrum of the sensor's bands or will require deployment of an imaging spectrometer in space.

TI  - Estimating Subsurface Thermohaline Structure of the Global Ocean Using Surface Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving multi-temporal and large-scale thermohaline structure information of the interior of the global ocean based on surface satellite observations is important for understanding the complex and multidimensional dynamic processes within the ocean. This study proposes a new ensemble learning algorithm, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), for retrieving subsurface thermohaline anomalies, including the subsurface temperature anomaly (STA) and the subsurface salinity anomaly (SSA), in the upper 2000 m of the global ocean. The model combines surface satellite observations and in situ Argo data for estimation, and uses root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), and R-2 as accuracy evaluations. The results show that the proposed XGBoost model can easily retrieve subsurface thermohaline anomalies and outperforms the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model. The XGBoost model had good performance with average R-2 values of 0.69 and 0.54, and average NRMSE values of 0.035 and 0.042, for STA and SSA estimations, respectively. The thermohaline anomaly patterns presented obvious seasonal variation signals in the upper layers (the upper 500 m); however, these signals became weaker as the depth increased. The model performance fluctuated, with the best performance in October (autumn) for both STA and SSA, and the lowest accuracy occurred in January (winter) for STA and April (spring) for SSA. The STA estimation error mainly occurred in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) region in the upper ocean and the boundary of the ocean basins in the deeper ocean; meanwhile, the SSA estimation error presented a relatively even distribution. The wind speed anomalies, including the u and v components, contributed more to the XGBoost model for both STA and SSA estimations than the other surface parameters; however, its importance at deeper layers decreased and the contributions of the other parameters increased. This study provides an effective remote sensing technique for subsurface thermohaline estimations and further promotes long-term remote sensing reconstructions of internal ocean parameters.

TI  - In-situ characterization of handle characteristics of suiting woven fabrics by a simultaneous measurement method
T2  - TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns (CHES-FY) was developed to measure multiple mechanical properties, which are related to fabric handle. In this paper, the potential of using the CHES-FY to evaluate the handle characteristics of woven fabrics was studied. Three prediction models corresponding to the stiffness, smoothness and tightness attributes of fabrics were determined to relate the subjective handle to suitable curve parameters extracted from the pulling-out force-displacement curve of the CHES-FY based on the stepwise regression method. Moreover, the independent validation of the prediction models and sensitivity analysis of the CHES-FY were also conducted. Results show that the CHES-FY together with the developed models provides good prediction for the handle characteristics of wool-rich woven suiting fabrics. It was also shown that the CHES-FY was capable of detecting changes of fabric handle of the woven fabrics with plasma treatments.

TI  - An Efficient and Scalable Framework for Processing Remotely Sensed Big Data in Cloud Computing Environments
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large amount of data produced by satellites and airborne remote sensing instruments has posed important challenges to efficient and scalable processing of remotely sensed data in the context of various applications. In this paper, we propose a new big data framework for processing massive amounts of remote sensing images on cloud computing platforms. In addition to taking advantage of the parallel processing abilities of cloud computing to cope with large-scale remote sensing data, this framework incorporates task scheduling strategy to further exploit the parallelism during the distributed processing stage. Using a computation- and data-intensive pan-sharpening method as a study case, the proposed approach starts by profiling a remote sensing application and characterizing it into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). With the obtained DAG representing the application, we further develop an optimization framework that incorporates the distributed computing mechanism and task scheduling strategy to minimize the total execution time. By determining an optimized solution of task partitioning and task assignments, high utilization of cloud computing resources and accordingly a significant speedup can be achieved for remote sensing data processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves promising results in terms of execution time as compared with the traditional (serial) processing approach. Our results also show that the proposed approach is scalable with regard to the increasing scale of remote sensing data.

TI  - A study of the spatial-temporal distribution and propagation characteristics of internal waves in the Andaman Sea using MODIS
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes investigations of the internal waves in the Andaman Sea using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery over the period of June 2010 to May 2016. Results of the spatial and temporal distribution, generation sources and propagation characteristics of internal waves are presented. The statistical analysis shows that internal waves can be observed in almost the entire area of the Andaman Sea. Most internal waves are observed in the northern, central and southern regions of the Andaman Sea. A significant number of internal waves between 7 degrees N and 9 degrees N in the East Indian Ocean are also observed. Internal waves can be observed year-round in the Andaman Sea, while most of internal waves are observed between February and April, with a maximum frequency of 15.03% in March. The seasonal distribution of the internal waves shows that the internal waves have mostly been observed in the dry season (February to April), and fewer internal waves are observed in the rainy season (May to October). The double peak distribution for the occurrence frequency of internal waves is found. With respect to the lunar influence, more internal waves are observed after the spring tide, which implies the spring tide may play an important role in internal wave generation in the Andaman Sea. Generation sources of internal waves are explored based on the propagation characteristics of internal waves. The results indicate that six sources are located between the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands, and one is located in the northern Andaman Sea. Four regions with active internal wave phenomenon in the Andaman Sea were presented during the MODIS survey, and the propagation speed of internal waves calculated based on the semidiurnal generation period is smaller than the results acquired from pairs of the images with short time intervals.

TI  - Cellular Automata Markov Method, an Approach for Rice Self-Sufficiency Projection
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the ability of the Cellular Automata (CA) Markov method to project rice sufficiency by considering the conversion of massive rice fields, such as the ones in Indonesia. The conversion of rice fields into land use for non-farming due to the rapidly growing population, industry and economic needs is increasingly affecting the rice self-sufficiency. With the development of remote sensing techniques, such as CA Markov, which has been used for years in spatial change projection, there is a need to assess the rice field conversion and its impact on the rice field self-sufficiency. The process is not solely based on CA Markov but also includes an object-based classification method utilising multi-temporal spot image data to derive land use maps, CA Markov for rice field conversion projection and rice self-sufficiency assessment, which was developed by assessing the availability of rice, consumption and production. Using the Indramayu district as the study area, the results indicate that within the next 20 years, the rice field area will decrease, and the impact on rice self-sufficiency will be 5.34 for Business as usual (BAU) and 0.47 when considering population growth. The previous research validated the results and indicated the efficiency of this method for rice self-sufficiency projection. Moreover, a management assessment was also conducted and indicated that in order to maintain rice self-sufficiency, innovation in the planting and seed systems as well as in farmers' welfare management, such as incentives and subsidies, local food diversification systems and innovative food technique development to support food diversification, should be considered.

TI  - Assessing the role of SWIR band in detecting agricultural crop stress: a case study of Raichur district, Karnataka, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential consequence of global climatic change caused the rise in temperature and precipitation decline, the aftermath of which has led to phenomenon like drought. As the agriculture is mainly dependent on the timely availability of water, delayed arrival of rainfall or decrease in the intensity of precipitation highly affects the growth of crops. If such situation persists for a longer period, the soil moisture content will be exploited completely and maturity of the crop will be stunted, finally adversely affecting the annual crop yield. In the present study, the capability of shortwave-infrared (SWIR) channels in detecting the agricultural crop stress in Raichur district of Karnataka state, India, using spectral vegetation indices namely Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) and Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) has been analyzed using multi-temporal MODIS data. The vegetation health analysis by utilizing both indices were carried out from year 2002 to 2012 for the Kharif season, and it was seen that the year 2002 suffered major agricultural drought where the lower GVMI and NMDI values were covering the majority of the crop areas and in the year 2010 agricultural crop production was observed to be good. The average values of GVMI and NMDI for the years 2002 and 2010 were plotted with the average NDVI values of all months of both years and the results revealed that NDVI values were in concurrence with both NMDI and GVMI.

TI  - Seriate cytology vs molecular analysis of peritoneal washing to improve gastric cancer cells detection
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Intraperitoneal malignant cells detection in patients with gastric cancer is associated with a significant decrease in overall survival. The overall accuracy of cytological examination of peritoneal lavages, however, is quite low, and intraperitoneal recurrence has been observed even in patients with negative cytology. Immunocytochemistry and molecular techniques have been investigated to improve high-risk patients' identification with variable results. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of different laboratory methods applied to peritoneal washing, to improve the cytological identification of malignant cells. Methods We prospectively evaluated 21 patients who underwent surgery and peritoneal lavage for gastric cancer. Among them, 18 had negative cytology and three were positive for malignant cells. For each patient, immunohistochemistry with BerEP4 antibody was performed on seriate sections of cellblock preparation at different levels, using the method reported for sentinel nodes in other types of cancer. Paired frozen quotes of washing fluids were evaluated by qRT-PCR with primer for mRNA of Ceacam5. Results In 4 of 18 patients with previous negative routine cytology, isolated neoplastic cells in seriate sections of the cellblock inclusion have been found. Results showed to be coherent with molecular analysis for CEA mRNA. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of peritoneal washing analyses should be notably improved by immunohistochemistry applied to multilevel cellblock sectioning. The method is less expensive and more widely applicable than molecular analysis, in each laboratory setting. This approach allows detection of minimum peritoneal seeding in patients with gastric cancer.

TI  - Two Efficient Hybrid Methods for Enhancing Pan-Sharpening of Multi-spectral Images Transmitted from Satellite to Ground Stations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is one of the most important tasks performed on satellite images as it enhances spectral and spatial information of the images. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is one of the powerful methods for pan-sharpening. It first decomposes the image into a set of intrinsic mode functions and a residual component. These panchromatic and multi-spectral components are then fused to create an enhanced pan-sharpened image. This paper presents two efficient hybrid methods to enhance pan-sharpening of multi-spectral images. The new proposals combine the EMD with the two pan-sharpening methods: high-pass filtering and discrete wavelet transform to maximize the pan-sharpened image quality. The two methods are evaluated using satellite images of Cairo and Suez Canal region, Egypt, captured by Spot-4 and Landsat-8 satellites, respectively. The results imply that the proposed hybrid methods provide better qualitative and quantitative results compared to the individual and the common pan-sharpening methods.

TI  - Axillary irradiation in breast cancer; does meticulous contouring make a difference?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Due to the current trends towards replacing axillary dissection with radiotherapy, the need for more precise definition for different nodal stations becomes a must to ensure safe and adequate dose coverage. So, our study aimed to evaluate the coverage of axillary nodal volumes based on Project on Cancer of the Breast (PROCAB) guidelines, for cases previously treated with our standard tangential approach. Materials and Methods: Ten cases of previously treated patients diagnosed with breast cancer were included in this study. All patients were treated with three dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy. For each patient, a new contouring based on PROCAB guidelines were done for each lymph node (LN) station. An adequate dose coverage was assessed for all volumes using our Eclipse version 11 planning system. Results: From Jan. 2016 and March. 2016, ten patients who were pathologically confirmed to have breast cancer and treated at Kasr Alaini Centre of Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt were included. The mean volumes of axillary levels I, II, and III were 33.29 cm(3) (range 18.6 - 54.8cm(3)), 13.27 cm(3) (range 9.4-16.8 cm(3)), and 12.84 cm(3) (range 7.9-18.2 cm(3)), respectively. Level I, II and III lymph nodes received a median D98% of 7.82 Gy, 9.54 Gy, and 22.54 Gy, respectively. The mean dose was 34.94 Gy, 33.64 Gy, and 39.79 Gy, respectively. Conclusion: PROCAB guidelines present a method for standardization of axillary LN delineation. More advanced radiotherapy planning is needed to improve coverage of axilla in post-operative treatment of breast cancer.

TI  - CARL HENRY EVALUATES THE REFORMATION
T2  - PERICHORESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - When Carl Henry presented an evaluation of the Reformation and its impact on the worldview of that period, he often put forth the Reformation as an example, which needed emulation by the modern evangelical church. His focus in his evaluation were on actions related to an orthodox view of God's self-revelation in the areas of epistemology, authority, and life application. Henry's conviction was that these actions, undertaken particularly by the Reformers Luther and Calvin, were necessary for a redemptive impact on the world through the modern evangelical church.

TI  - Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network for the Retrieval of Land Surface Temperature from AMSR2 Data in China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was developed to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data in China. Reference data were selected using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product to overcome the problem related to the need for synchronous ground observation data. The AMSR2 brightness temperature (TB) data and MODIS surface temperature data were randomly divided into training and test datasets, and a CNN was constructed to simulate passive microwave radiation transmission to invert the surface temperature. The twelve V/H channel combinations (7.3, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, 89 GHz) resulted in the most stable and accurate CNN retrieval model. Vertical polarizations performed better than horizontal polarizations; however, because CNNs rely heavily on large amounts of data, the combination of vertical and horizontal polarizations performed better than a single polarization. The retrievals in different regions indicated that the CNN accuracy was highest over large bare land areas. A comparison of the retrieval results with ground measurement data from meteorological stations yielded R-2 = 0.987, RMSE = 2.69 K, and an average relative error of 2.57 K, which indicated that the accuracy of the CNN LST retrieval algorithm was high and the retrieval results can be applied to long-term LST sequence analysis in China.

TI  - A distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming approach for optimal irrigation water management in an arid area
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the uncertainties in agricultural system and spatiotemporal variability in evapotranspiration and precipitation, a distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming (DINMP) model was developed for optimal allocation of limited irrigation water resources in the middle reaches of Heihe River basin. The meteorological data from meteorological stations were used to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) through FAO56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation, and then the remote sensing MOD16/PET data were fitted by linear regression model according to the FAO56 PM results. The 95% confidence interval was used to further improve the accuracy of the fitting results. Thus, satellite-based potential evapotranspiration (PET) and ground-based ET0 estimation were integrated to not only reflect the spatial and temporal variability but also guarantee the accuracy of the ET0. In the terms of precipitation, spatial interpolation was used to spatial information of precipitation. Based on these spatiotemporal data, a DINMP with three objectives, including maximizing economic benefits and water saving as well as minimizing water shortage of critical growth periods, was formulated, and further solved by fuzzy coordination method. The optimal allocation scheme improves the irrigation water productivity by [0.50, 0.66] kg/m(3), and decreases net irrigation water allocation by [0.33, 1.01] x 10(8) m(3). These results show that DINMP can not only consider the uncertainties and multiple objectives in agricultural water management, but also improve the spatial resolution of optimal water allocation strategies. The framework of this study can provide a reference for agricultural water managers in similar areas to obtain more reasonable water allocation schemes.

TI  - Analytical Relationship between Two-Band Spectral Vegetation Indices Measured at Multiple Sensors on a Parametric Representation of Soil Isoline Equations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differences between the wavelength band specifications of distinct sensors introduce systematic differences into the values of a spectral vegetation index (VI). Such relative errors must be minimized algorithmically after data acquisition, based on a relationship between the measurements. This study introduces a technique for deriving the analytical relationship between the VIs from two sensors. The derivation proceeds using a parametric form of the soil isoline equations, which relate the reflectances of two different wavelengths. First, the derivation steps are explained conceptually. Next, the conceptual steps are cast in a practical derivation by assuming a general form of the two-band VI. Finally, the derived expressions are demonstrated numerically using a coupled leaf and canopy radiative transfer model. The results confirm that the derived expression reduced the original differences between the VI values obtained from the two sensors, indicating the validity of the derived expressions. The derived expressions and numerical results suggested that the relationship between the VIs measured at different wavelengths varied with the soil reflectance spectrum beneath the vegetation canopy. These results indicate that caution is required when retrieving intersensor VI relationships over regions consisting of soil surfaces having distinctive spectra.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: This report outlines our first experience of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in the natural orifices transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) technique, which is the combination of the least invasive surgical approach and the least invasive way of assessing lymph node status.Design: Descriptive study (Canadian Task Force classification III).Setting: Tertiary referral and educational center.Patients: Four patients with endometrial cancer clinical stage 1.Interventions: NOTES with SLN mapping using an indocyanine green-based near-infrared fluorescence imaging technique.Measurements and Main Results: The average operative time was 182.75 minutes (standard deviation, 34.5). Mean estimated blood loss was 67.5 mL (standard deviation, 39.4). All patients had surgical staging of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA (pT1aN0). The overall detection rate and bilateral detection rate were 100% (4/4). All procedures were successfully completed without complication or conversion to conventional laparoscopy.Conclusion: In our preliminary experience, SLN mapping in NOTES surgery appears to be feasible and safe. It can be considered as an alternative method to reduce morbidity from radical lymphadenectomy and provide the benefits from the NOTES technique. However, studies in a larger population are necessary. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of AAGL.

TI  - Antipsychotic Use and Stroke: A Retrospective Comparative Study in a Non-Elderly Population
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate stroke risk among users of typical antipsychotics compared to users of atypical antipsychotics in a non-elderly and non-demented US population.Methods: New users of antipsychotics aged 18-64 years without dementia were identified via electronic health care data from 13 health plans participating in the Sentinel System from January 2001 to September 2015. The risk of hospitalized stroke events, identified via ICD-9-CM diagnostic criteria, was compared between typical and atypical antipsychotic users using 1:1 matching on propensity score. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs during the entire follow-up period and during 1- to 15-day and 16- to 90-day risk windows were estimated. The risk associated with haloperidol use was estimated separately.Results: A total of 45,495 typical antipsychotic users were matched 1:1 to atypical antipsychotic users. While unmatched HRs suggest an increased stroke risk among typical antipsychotic users compared to atypical antipsychotic users, no increased risk was observed after matching during the entire follow-up period (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.54-1.41), the 1- to 15-day risk window (HR =1.16; 95% CI, 0.41-3.32), or the 16- to 90-day risk window (HR =0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.36).The adjusted HR for haloperidol was 1.31 (95% CI, 0.54-3.21).Conclusion: These findings were not suggestive of an increased stroke risk in typical antipsychotic users compared to atypical antipsychotic users in a non-elderly and non-demented population.

TI  - Hydroacoustic, Seismic, and Bathymetric Observations of the 2014 Submarine Eruption at Ahyi Seamount, Mariana Arc
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ahyi seamount, a shallow submarine volcano in the Northern Mariana Islands, began erupting on 23 April 2014. Hydroacoustic eruption signals were observed on the regional Mariana seismic network and on distant hydrophones, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA) scuba divers working in the area soon after the eruption began heard and felt underwater explosion sounds. The NOAA crew observed yellow-orange bubble mats along the shore of neighboring Farallon de Pajaros Island, but no other surface manifestations of the eruption were reported by the crew or observed in satellite data. Here, we detail the eruption chronology and its morphologic impacts through analysis of seismic and hydroacoustic recordings and repeat bathymetric mapping. Throughout the 2-week-long eruption, Ahyi produced several thousand short, impulsive hydroacoustic signals that we interpret as underwater explosions as well as tremor near the beginning and end of the sequence. The initial tremor, which occurred for 2 hr, is interpreted as small phreatomagmatic explosions. This tremor was followed by a 90-min pause before the characteristic impulsive signals began. Occasional tremor (lasting up to a few minutes) during the last 1.5 days of the eruption is interpreted as more sustained eruptive activity. Bathymetric changes show that a new crater, about 150 m deep, formed near the former summit and a large landslide chute formed on the southeastern flank. Comparing to other geophysically detected submarine eruptions, we find that the signals from the 2014 Ahyi eruption were more similar to those from other shallow or at-surface submarine eruptions than those at deep (>500 m) eruptions.Plain Language Summary Ahyi seamount, a shallow submarine volcano in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands(CNMI), began erupting on 23 April 2014. The U.S. Geological Survey first noticed signs of the eruption during a routine data check on 24 April, while National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scuba divers working in the area heard and felt underwater explosion sounds. We analyze recordings of the eruption on the CNMI seismic network and on hydrophones located near Wake Island to detail how the eruption unfolded. The eruption started with about 2 hr of tremor from magma explosively interacting with water. After a 90-min pause, short (up to a few seconds) explosions began and continued for 2 weeks. During the last 1.5 days of the eruption, longer tremor signals (up to a few minutes) from more sustained degassing eruptions occurred along with the short explosions. A comparison of bathymetric maps made before and after the eruption shows that the explosions formed a new crater 150 m deep near the summit and that a landslide chute formed on the southeastern flank. The seismic and hydroacoustic signals from the Ahyi eruption are more similar to those from eruptions at other shallow or at-surface seamounts than to those from deep (>500 m) eruptions.

TI  - Use of Hot Spot Analysis to Detect Underground Coal Fires from Landsat-8 TIRS Data: A Case Study in the Khanh Hoa Coal Field, North-East of Vietnam
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal fire (UCF) detection from remotely sensed data plays an important role in controlling and preventing the effects of coal fires and their environmental impact. The limitation of commonly used methods does not take into account spatial autocorrelation among observations. For solving this limitation, a method for UCF detection was proposed using hot spot analysis (HSA). Based on the radiative transfer equation (RTE), land surface temperatures (LSTs) were firstly retrieved from the Landsat-8 TIRS data. The degree of spatial clustering among these LSTs was measured using HSA. UCF areas were then delineated based on 99 percent confidence level of hot spot areas. These fires were finally validated using known UCF sites and cross-validated with the results extracted from the ASTER TIR image. It was found from a case study in the Khanh Hoa coal field (North-East of Vietnam); (i) UCFs were strongly correlated with known coal fires and were highly consistent with those obtained from the ASTER TIR data; (ii) a total fire area of 197 hectares was detected, of which the fire areas of low, medium, high and extremely high levels were 37.3, 47.3, 53.2 and 59.3 hectares respectively; (iii) these fires were mainly detected in the central area and at coal ash dump sites of the southern coal field. The results show HSA can be used to effectively detect UCFs.

TI  - Recurrence of Melanoma After a Negative Sentinel Node Biopsy: Predictors and Impact of Recurrence Site on Survival
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Factors that predict melanoma recurrence after a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are not well-defined. We evaluated melanoma recurrence patterns, factors prognostic for recurrence, and the impact of recurrence on outcomes after a negative SLNB.Methods. The Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database was evaluated from 1996 to 2016 for negative SLNB melanoma patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics were correlated with recurrence, overall survival (OS), and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).Results. Median follow-up was 32.1months. Recurrences developed in 558 of 5351 negative SLN patients (10.4%). First-site of recurrence included a local or in-transit recurrence (LITR) in 221 cases (4.1%), nodal recurrence (NR) in 109 cases (2%), and distant recurrence (DR) in 220 cases (4.1%). On multivariable analysis, age, thickness, head/neck or lower extremity primary, and microsatellitosis significantly predicted for an LITR as first-site. Having an LITR as first-site significantly predicted for a subsequent NR and DR, and significantly predicted for worse OS and MSS. Furthermore, thickness and head/neck or lower extremity primary significantly predicted for an NR as first-site, while a prior LITR significantly predicted for a subsequent NR. Factors significantly predictive for a DR included thickness, head/neck or trunk primary, ulceration, and lymphovascular invasion. Patients with any type of locoregional recurrence were at higher risk for a DR.Conclusions.Recurrences occur in 10.4% of negative SLN patients, with LITR and DR being the most common types. Importantly, having an LITR significantly predicts for a subsequent NR and DR, and is prognostic for worse survival after a negative SLNB.

TI  - US-Based National Surveillance for Fidaxomicin Susceptibility of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>-Associated Diarrheal Isolates from 2013 to 2016
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2011, we initiated a sentinel surveillance network to assess changes in Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile antimicrobial susceptibility to fidaxomicin from 6 geographically dispersed medical centers in the United States. This report summarizes data from 2013 to 2016. C. difficile isolates or toxin-positive stools from patients were referred to a central laboratory. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by agar dilution. CLSI, EUCAST, or FDA breakpoints were used, where applicable. Toxin gene profiles were characterized by multiplex PCR on each isolate. A random sample of approximately 40% of isolates, stratified by institution and year, was typed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA). Among 1,889 isolates from 2013 to 2016, the fidaxomicin MIC90 was 0.5 mu g/ml; all isolates were inhibited at <= 1 mu g/ml. There were decreases in metronidazole and vancomycin MICs over time. Clindamycin resistance remained unchanged (27.3%). An increase in imipenem resistance was observed. By 2015 to 2016, moxifloxacin resistance decreased in all centers. The proportion of BI isolates decreased from 25.5% in 2011 to 2012 to 12.8% in 2015 to 2016 (P < 0.001). The BI REA group correlated with moxifloxacin resistance (BI 84% resistant versus non-BI 12.5% resistant). Fidaxomicin MICs have not changed among C. difficile isolates of U.S. origin over 5 years post licensure. There has been an overall decrease in MICs for vancomycin, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, and rifampin and an increase in isolates resistant to imipenem. Moxifloxacin resistance remained high among the BI REA group, but the proportion of BI isolates has decreased. Continued geographic variations in REA groups and antimicrobial resistance persist.

TI  - Multi-year trends and determinants of the hydrochemistry of high mountain lakes in the Western Italian Alps
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High mountain lakes (HML) provide essential ecosystem services, have tremendous conservation and aesthetic value, and are good model ecosystems to study the ecological consequences of global change. Multi-year (2008-2017) chemical data from 25 HML from the Gran Paradiso National Park (Western Italian Alps) were used to address two specific objectives: (1) assess the major determinants of HML hydrochemistry; (2) identify any multi-years trend attributable to global change. Local trends in climatic variables and NO3-, NH4+, and SO42- deposition were evaluated over the same period as possible drivers of lake chemistry. We were able to explain most of the variance associated to the major ion concentration, but much less of that associated with nutrient content and with variables related to atmospheric deposition (e.g. Cl-, Na+, inorganic N). The explanation of which probably requires studies at a regional scale. As a whole, lake chemistry depends on the interplay of several environmental variables, including the impact of human activities (i.e. point source of organic pollutants). Catchment geology and vegetation cover influence several variables related to weathering processes, which show a general increase over the last 10years. This general trend can be attributable to climatic variability enhancing weathering processes in lake catchments. However, a concomitant decrease of precipitation amount and the deposition of acidifying compounds may have contributed to the observed trends. Meteorological data were almost unrelated to HML hydrochemistry, suggesting that lake chemical composition would depend more strongly on long-term climatic variations rather than on short-term meteorological events.

TI  - Comparing different classification algorithms for monitoring mangrove cover changes in southern Iran
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests in Iran are highly productive and complex ecosystems since they represent the interface between land and sea. They are a unique environment for supporting biodiversity, and they provide direct and indirect benefits to humans. Investigating changes in mangrove forests is essential for ecologists and forest managers to improve the assessment and conservation of natural ecosystems. The goals of the present study include: (I) to evaluate and compare four supervised classification algorithms based on Landsat time series imagery to detect mangrove cover in southern Iran, (II) to detect changes in mangrove cover between 1985, 1998, and 2017; and (III) to compare the four different predictions resulting from the applied classification algorithms. An accuracy assessment was conducted using k-fold cross-validation and independent validation, and differences between the classification techniques were analyzed. Although all four algorithms produced high overall accuracy (ranging from 81% to 93%) and Kappa values (from 0.81 to 0.92), visual comparisons of the predictions revealed that Random Forest (RF) performed best. The results of the change analysis showed that mangrove cover areas decreased by approximately 4% from 1985 to 1998 and then increased by approximately 8.9% from 1998 to 2017. A change detection map shows a decrease in mangrove cover in near coastal regions, such as the Tabl and Gavarzin areas, and an increase in mangrove cover at a distance from the Qeshm coastline that involves open spaces between the trees. Rising water levels and human development are important factors in the decline of mangroves. The findings of this research are useful for the management, restoration and conservation planning of mangrove forest in southern Iran. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Detection of floating plastics from satellite and unmanned aerial systems (Plastic Litter Project 2018)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A rapidly rising amount of plastic litter on land and at sea is becoming a global wicked environmental problem. Here, we present an innovative exploratory application of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and open-access satellite imagery in remote detection of floating plastics in natural seawater, through a dedicated aquatic environment experiment. We aimed to extract meaningful spectral measurements in near-real scenarios and to compare the geospatial information ranging from moderate to very high resolution. A set of three artificial floating plastic targets were setup for remote detection in the waters close to Tsamakia beach of Mytilene on Lesvos Island, Greece. These floating targets consisted of 100 m(2) PET-11.5 L water bottles, LDPE plastic bags and nylon fishing ghost nets. Spectral properties of the controlled targets as well as surrounding seawater were investigated for Sentinel-2A satellite data. We demonstrate how UAS very high geospatial resolution images can be useful in improving geo-referencing of satellite images and how UAS can be used to assess the plastic percentage coverage of satellite images. We observed very weak to strong relationships between percentage pixel coverage and the spectral reflectance at p-value < 0.1 significance level. Effects of atmospheric correction algorithms was evaluated using Sen2Cor and ACOLITE, derive unbiased percentage differences were less than 65%. Our feasibility study demonstrated the importance of very high geo-spatial resolution UAS datasets in validating and enhancing the geo-spatial accuracy of satellite data for monitoring plastics in the aquatic environment. Monitoring and identifying plastics needs an integrated suite of sensors, we therefore present how available tools can be utilized to improve current efforts and contribute to advancing relevant future remote sensing technologies.

TI  - Estimating tree species diversity from space in an alpine conifer forest: The Rao's Q diversity index meets the spectral variation hypothesis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests cover about 30% of the Earth surface, they are among the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems and represent the bulk of many ecological processes and services. The assessment of biodiversity is an important and essential goal to achieve but it can results difficult, time consuming and expensive when based on field data. Remote sensing covers large areas and provides consistent quality and standardized data, which can be used to estimate species diversity. One method to estimate species diversity from remote sensing data is based on the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), which assumes that the higher the spectral variation of an image, the higher the environmental heterogeneity and the species diversity of the considered area. SVH has been tested using different spectral heterogeneity (SH) indices and measures, recently the Rao's Q index has been proposed as a new spectral variation measure to be applied to remote sensing data. In this paper, we tested the SVH in an alpine coniferous forest to estimate tree species diversity. We evaluated the performance of the Rao's Q index and compared it with another widely used SH index, the Coefficient of Variation (CV), validating them against values of Shannon's H (used as species diversity index) derived from in-situ collected data. A NDVI time-series (for 2016 and 2017) derived from the Sentinel-2A and 2B and Landsat 8 OLI satellites has been used to test the effect of the spatial grain of both the sensors and to understand the seasonality of the SVH. The results showed that the SVH is season and sensor dependent. For both years and satellites, the relation between Rao's Q and field data reached the highest R-2 between June and July, decreasing towards winter and spring similarly to the NDVI time-series. This relationship could be given because, when NDVI reaches its highest values, it is able to capture small variation in reflectance of different leaf traits typical of specific trees. The relation between field and spectral diversity reached a value of R-2 = 0.70 (2017) and R-2 = 0.48 (2016) for Sentinel-2 and of R-2 = 0.42 (2017) and R-2 = 0.47 (2016) for Landsat 8. CV showed the same NDVI temporal tendency. However, the relation between field-derived Shannon's H and CV was on average lower than that we found for Rao's Q. This research underlined the goodness of the Rao's Q index, the relevance of the NDVI in the study of the SVH and the importance of the multi-temporal approach.

TI  - Monitoring and modelling spatio-temporal urban growth of Delhi using Cellular Automata and geoinformatics
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study encompasses spatio-temporal land use/ land cover (LULC) monitoring (1989-2014) and urban growth modelling (1994-2024) of Delhi, India to deduce the past and future urban growth paradigm and its influence on varied LULC classes integrating geospatial techniques and Cellular Automata (CA). The study focused on scrutinising the reliability of the CA algorithm to function independently for urban growth modelling, provided with strong model calibration. For this purpose, satellite data of six stages of time at equal intervals along with the population density, distance to CBD and roads, and terrain slope are used. The satellite-based LULC during 1989-2014 exhibited 457 km(2) of net urban growth (275% change), cloned by the simulated LULC with net increase 448 km(2) (270% change). The spatial variation analysis using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique exhibit high similarity in classification ranging from 72% to 88%. The statistical accuracy between the satellite-based and simulated built-up extent of 2014 resulted in the overall accuracy 95.62% of the confusion matrix, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as 0.928-indication high model accuracy. The projected LULC exhibit that the urban area will increase to 708 km(2) and 787 km(2), primarily in western and eastern parts during 2019 and 2014 respectively. The rapid urban growth will replace and transform others LULC (net loss 138 km(2)) followed by vegetation cover (net loss 26 km(2)) during 2014-24. This rapid urban growth is detrimental to the habitat and may trigger critical risks to urban geo-environment and ecosystem in Delhi. Therefore, the study necessitates towards decentralization of urban functions and restoration of varied LULC in order to regulate the future urban growth patterns for sustainable development. The GDAL and NumPy libraries in Python 3.4 were efficient in spatial modelling and statistical calculations.

TI  - Defective levels of both circulating dendritic cells and T-regulatory cells correlate with risk of recurrence in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundImmune markers in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients provide useful information for clinical management although there is poor consensus on circulating cells which could putatively reflect the disease activity and play a prognostic role. Here, we investigated both dendritic cells (DCs) and T-regulatory cells (Tregs).MethodsThe number of DC subsets as myeloid (m) and plasmacytoid was measured by flowcytometry in 113 melanoma patients in different clinical stages and correlated with the disease activity to evaluate the recurrence free survival (RFS) calculated as difference between baseline and post-surgical values in relation to the criteria for the melanoma staging, as primary tumor removal, sentinel lymph node biopsy and completion of lymph node dissection.ResultsCirculating mDC levels were significantly lower in metastatic melanoma than in other stages and inversely correlated to Treg values while both populations were similarly expressed in inactive disease at stage I-III. Furthermore, the levels of these cells after melanoma removal were apparently related to the disease activity since their persistent defect reflected high risk of recurrence and reduced the RFS.ConclusionsThis work highlighted the role of immune cell measurement for the management of melanoma activity and the identification of patients at potential risk of recurrence based on the mDC ratio.

TI  - Operational Flood Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Images: A Case Study from Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh is one of the most flood-affected countries in the world. In the last few decades, flood frequency, intensity, duration, and devastation have increased in Bangladesh. Identifying flood-damaged areas is highly essential for an effective flood response. This study aimed at developing an operational methodology for rapid flood inundation and potential flood damaged area mapping to support a quick and effective event response. Sentinel-1 images from March, April, June, and August 2017 were used to generate inundation extents of the corresponding months. The 2017 pre-flood land cover maps were prepared using Landsat-8 images to identify major land cover on the ground before flooding. The overall accuracy of flood inundation mapping was 96.44% and the accuracy of the land cover map was 87.51%. The total flood inundated area corresponded to 2.01%, 4.53%, and 7.01% for the months April, June, and August 2017, respectively. Based on the Landsat-8 derived land cover information, the study determined that cropland damaged by floods was 1.51% in April, 3.46% in June, 5.30% in August, located mostly in the Sylhet and Rangpur divisions. Finally, flood inundation maps were distributed to the broader user community to aid in hazard response. The data and methodology of the study can be replicated for every year to map flooding in Bangladesh.

TI  - Deep learning architectures for land cover classification using red and near-infrared satellite images
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of remotely sensed data requires the modelling of suitable image processing algorithms. The rise of machine learning systems upgraded the viability of satellite image applications. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), benchmark classification exactness can be accomplished for land cover grouping. Motivated by the concept of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), this paper utilizes only the red and near infrared (NIR) band information for classifying the publicly available SAT-4 and SAT-6 datasets. This is done, since NDVI computation requires only the two band (red and NIR) information and the classes involved in the dataset are types of vegetation. In this work, new deep learning architectures for three different networks (AlexNet, ConvNet, VGG) were proposed by hypertuning the network and the input as two band data. The modified architectures with the two band information along with reduced number of filters were trained and tested model manages to classify the images into different classes. The proposed architectures are compared against the existing architectures in terms of accuracy, precision and trainable parameters. The proposed architecture is found to perform equally efficient by retaining high accuracy with less number of trainable parameters, when compared against the the performance of benchmark deep learning architectures for satellite image classification.

TI  - Influence of the Underlying Surface on Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Atmosphere Over Central Siberia
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A crucial issue in atmospheric studies on greenhouse gas content involves assessing the representativeness (footprint) having influence on their concentrations measured by tall towers. In this study, the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model was used to estimate seasonal cumulative footprint climatology for greenhouse gases measurements obtained on the 301-meter-high Zotino Tall Tower Observation Facility (ZOTTO) for the growing seasons (May-September) from 2008 to 2012 (with the exception of 2011). Results showed that the ZOTTO seasonal concentration cumulative footprint climatology for four years reached 6.9x10(6) km(2) and the 75% cumulative footprints varied from 1.9 to 2.3x10(6) km(2). For the same period, the Russian Land Cover map based on MODIS data for 2014 was used to estimate the impact of land cover surrounding the ZOTTO tower on concentration measurements. The analysis showed that in the 75% seasonal cumulative footprint the largest area is occupied by bogs, followed (in decreasing order) by larch, mixed, light-coniferous evergreen forests, grassland, and by other classes. Furthermore, analysis of the contributions from individual cells making up a footprint showed that the largest influence on formation of greenhouse gas concentrations as recorded by ZOTTO comes from the types of vegetation growing in the immediate vicinity of the tall tower, namely bogs, mixed forests, and light and dark coniferous forest stands.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of land cover using the emerging technology of remote sensing has played indispensable role in evaluation and effective management of dams particularly for ecosystem maintenance. The present study was conducted around the unprotected area of Mangla to analyze the ecological changes over time and space. Spatio-temporal variation was analyzed by using multispectral Landsat satellite imageries of two decades. Supervised classification approach, viz. maximum likelihood algorithm, was employed to delineate changes by using ERDAS Imagine software followed up with a delineation of four, i.e., water body, built-up area, vegetation and barren area. Maps of change detection for different classes were generated by using ArcGIS 10.2. Results of spatial and temporal changes revealed remarkable increase in built-up area, while reduction in water body, vegetation and barren area was observed from 1992 to 2013. Significant transformation was recorded in built-up area with respect to others. Major shifts detected in class of vegetation and barren area into built-up class. This expansion in built-up area posed threat to biodiversity and water bodies. Presented work on spatial and temporal change analysis around unprotected wetland will be helpful in decision making for further land development and dam extension project.

TI  - Towards Global Volcano Monitoring Using Multisensor Sentinel Missions and Artificial Intelligence: The MOUNTS Monitoring System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the world's 1500 active volcanoes are not instrumentally monitored, resulting in deadly eruptions which can occur without observation of precursory activity. The new Sentinel missions are now providing freely available imagery with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions, with payloads allowing for a comprehensive monitoring of volcanic hazards. We here present the volcano monitoring platform MOUNTS (Monitoring Unrest from Space), which aims for global monitoring, using multisensor satellite- based imagery (Sentinel- 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR, Sentinel- 2 Short- Wave InfraRed SWIR, Sentinel- 5P TROPOMI), ground- based seismic data (GEOFON and USGS global earthquake catalogues), and artificial intelligence (AI) to assist monitoring tasks. It provides near- real- time access to surface deformation, heat anomalies, SO2 gas emissions, and local seismicity at a number of volcanoes around the globe, providing support to both scientific and operational communities for volcanic risk assessment. Results are visualized on an open- access website where both geocoded images and time series of relevant parameters are provided, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the temporal evolution of volcanic activity and eruptive products. We further demonstrate that AI can play a key role in such monitoring frameworks. Here we design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on synthetically generated interferograms, to operationally detect strong deformation (e. g., related to dyke intrusions), in the real interferograms produced by MOUNTS. The utility of this interdisciplinary approach is illustrated through a number of recent eruptions (Erta Ale 2017, Fuego 2018, Kilauea 2018, Anak Krakatau 2018, Ambrym 2018, and Piton de la Fournaise 2018- 2019). We show how exploiting multiple sensors allows for assessment of a variety of volcanic processes in various climatic settings, ranging from subsurface magma intrusion, to surface eruptive deposit emplacement, pre / syn- eruptive morphological changes, and gas propagation into the atmosphere. The data processed by MOUNTS is providing insights into eruptive precursors and eruptive dynamics of these volcanoes, and is sharpening our understanding of how the integration of multiparametric datasets can help better monitor volcanic hazards.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Dual- and Quad-Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data for Crop-Type Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover monitoring is one of the core applications of remote sensing. Monitoring and mapping changes in the distribution of agricultural land covers provide a reliable source of information that helps environmental sustainability and supports agricultural policies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can contribute considerably to this monitoring effort. The first objective of this research is to extend the use of time series of polarimetric data for land-cover classification using a decision tree classification algorithm. With this aim, RADARSAT-2 (quad-pol) and Sentinel-1 (dual-pol) data were acquired over an area of 600 km(2) in central Spain. Ten polarimetric observables were derived from both datasets and seven scenarios were created with different sets of observables to evaluate a multitemporal parcel-based approach for classifying eleven land-cover types, most of which were agricultural crops. The study demonstrates that good overall accuracies, greater than 83%, were achieved for all of the different proposed scenarios and the scenario with all RADARSAT-2 polarimetric observables was the best option (89.1%). Very high accuracies were also obtained when dual-pol data from RADARSAT-2 or Sentinel-1 were used to classify the data, with overall accuracies of 87.1% and 86%, respectively. In terms of individual crop accuracy, rapeseed achieved at least 95% of a producer's accuracy for all scenarios and that was followed by the spring cereals (wheat and barley), which achieved high producer's accuracies (79.9%-95.3%) and user's accuracies (85.5% and 93.7%).

TI  - Basic Spatial Resolution Metrics for Satellite Imagers
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Six basic criteria used to estimate the Ground Resolution Distance of satellite imagers are considered: Ground Sample Distance (GSD), Rayleigh diffraction limit, ground spot size, generalized Rayleigh resolution criterion, Sparrow limit, and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Point/Line Spread Function (PSF/LSF). Theoretical arguments and experimental results that support the use of the LSF FWHM as a spatial resolution metric are presented. The procedure to compute the LSF FWHM from the system modulation transfer function is reviewed and is used to compute the FWHM of the three ideal sensors as a function of their optical factor, contrasting these theoretical results with 22 in orbit measurements. Within this context, the limited range of validity of the GSD and the Rayleigh diffraction limit as spatial resolution estimators is assessed. The limitations of the LSF FWHM as a resolution estimator are also noted.

TI  - "She Thinks of Him as a Machine": On the Entanglements of Neoliberal Ideology and Misogynist Cybercrime
T2  - SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The "manosphere" is a constellation of masculinist social media communities loosely unified by an anti-feminist worldview. Although extant journalism and social media scholarship successfully delineate the manosphere as a significant social problem by associating it with misogynist cybercrime and cyberhate, the resulting narrative simplistically pathologizes manosphere discourse while leaving its misogyny undertheorized. In this article, I complicate this emerging narrative by demonstrating how a certain central manosphere discourse qualitatively overlaps with a broader neoliberal ideology. I do so by further developing a critical discourse analysis of quasi-representative manosphere documents drawn from "The Red Pill," a sub-forum of Reddit.com. Although this forum is explicitly devoted to discussing heterosexual seduction strategies, I find that it also produces a discursive means for fiscally conservative men to reconcile their pro-capitalist economic beliefs with apparent evidence of capitalism's destructive tendencies and contradictions. This forum's anti-feminist discourse implicitly parallels Marxian theory while explicitly supporting free market capitalism and denigrating women, thereby providing men with a linguistic and conceptual framework to scapegoat women for economic problems while leaving neoliberal ideas and assumptions unchallenged.

TI  - Determination of Vegetation Thresholds for Assessing Land Use and Land Use Changes in Cambodia using the Google Earth Engine Cloud-Computing Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As more data and technologies become available, it is important that a simple method is developed for the assessment of land use changes because of the global need to understand the potential climate mitigation that could result from a reduction in deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics. Here, we determined the threshold values of vegetation types to classify land use categories in Cambodia through the analysis of phenological behaviors and the development of a robust phenology-based threshold classification (PBTC) method for the mapping and long-term monitoring of land cover changes. We accessed 2199 Landsat collections using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and applied the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and harmonic regression methods to identify phenological behaviors of land cover categories during the leaf-shedding phenology (LSP) and leaf-flushing phenology (LFS) seasons. We then generated 722 mean phenology EVI profiles for 12 major land cover categories and determined the threshold values for selected land cover categories in the mid-LSP season. The PBTC pixel-based classified map was validated using very high-resolution (VHR) imagery. We obtained a cumulative overall accuracy of more than 88% and a cumulative overall accuracy of the referenced forest cover of almost 85%. These high accuracy values suggest that the very first PBTC map can be useful for estimating the activity data, which are critically needed to assess land use changes and related carbon emissions under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) scheme. We found that GEE cloud-computing is an appropriate tool to use to access remote sensing big data at scale and at no cost.

TI  - A GCIG international survey: clinical practice patterns of sentinel lymph node biopsies in cervical cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo evaluate the practice patterns among centers and physicians worldwide regarding sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) in cervical cancer (CC) patients.MethodA validated 35-item questionnaire regarding SLNB in CC supported by the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG), and sponsored by the North-Eastern German Society of Gynaecologic-Oncology (NOGGO) was sent to all major gynecological cancer societies across the globe for further distribution from October 2015 and continued for a period of 7months.ResultsOne hundred and sixty-one institutions from around the world participated. One hundred and six (66%) of the participants were from university centers and 111 (69%) were gynecologic oncologists. One hundred and fifty-two (97%) performed lymphadenectomy (LNE) and 147 (94%) did so systematically; 97 (60%) used SLNB, due to lower morbidity (73%), reliability (55%) and time-saving (27%). In cases of positive SLNB (pN+), 39% of respondents stopped the operation and sent the patient for chemoradiation (CRT), 45% completed pelvic and paraaortic LNE, whereas 26% went on to perform a radical hysterectomy (RH) and systematic pelvic and paraaortic LNE. In case of negative SLNB (pN0), 39% of institutions still performed a systematic pelvic and paraaortic LNE.ConclusionIn this survey worldwide, SLNB adoption is an encouraging 60%, yet ample differences exist regarding strategy, and to a lower extent the techniques used. Lack of experience is the most common reason SLNB is not performed. Efforts to increase surgical education on SLNB technique and multicenter prospective trials providing evidence-based guidelines are warranted.

TI  - Determining the Best Method of Calculating the Large Frequency Separation For Stellar Models
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators often relies on the comparisons between stellar models and stellar observations in order to determine the properties of stars. The values of the global seismic parameters, nu(max) (the frequency where the smoothed amplitude of the oscillations peak) and Delta nu (the large frequency separation), are frequently used in grid-based modeling searches. However, the methods by which Delta nu is calculated from observed data and how Delta nu is calculated from stellar models are not the same. Typically for observed stars, especially for those with low signal-to-noise data, Delta nu is calculated by taking the power spectrum of a power spectrum, or with autocorrelation techniques. However, for stellar models, the actual individual mode frequencies are calculated and the average spacing between them directly determined. In this work we try to determine the best way to combine model frequencies in order to obtain Delta nu that can be compared with observations. For this we use stars with high signal-to-noise observations from Kepler as well as simulated Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data of Ball et al. We find that when determining Delta nu from individual mode frequencies the best method is to use the l = 0 modes with either no weighting or with a Gaussian weighting around nu(max).

TI  - Diagnostic application of patent blue V in sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer u Is it time for a change
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was introduced in the 1990s, as a minimally invasive procedure for staging the axilla with less morbidity to the traditional axillary lymph node dissection and is now standard management of the axilla in the early breast cancer. SLNB using the combined technique of blue dye and radioisotope is currently the recommended method for lymphatic mapping, and studies have shown high identification rates (IR) (95%) and low false-negative rates (FNR) 5u10%. However, there are several reports raising awareness regarding patent blue V dye-induced peri-operative anaphylaxis. The main aim of this article is to highlight the emergence of patent blue dye as a new allergen and present evidence regarding the utility of alternative safer methods of evaluation of early breast cancer without compromising IR.

TI  - Social and Cultural Background of the Invisibility of Women in the Jewish and Rabbinical Narratives of the Ancient World
T2  - APOSTA-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to analyze the representation of women in both Jewish and Rabbinical narratives in the context of the Ancient world. To carry out this study, we will use the deconstructive method, which allows us to analyze the anthropological and cultural causes of the absence and representation of women in these narratives. The outlining of the representation of women in the context of the Jewish world is a broad and dense task due to its extension and complexity. That is why we are going to focus on the basic literary accounts of the Jewish world, works that constitute the religious foundation of the Jewish worldview: the Bible and the Misna. The role that women had to play was fixed in these texts and it is also in them where, from a feminist analysis, it is sought at present to redefine the patriarchal character of Judaism.

TI  - Breast Cancer Care in South India: Is Practice Concordant With National Guidelines?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE The National Cancer Grid (NCG) of India has recently published clinical practice guidelines that are relevant in the Indian context. We evaluated the extent to which breast cancer care at a teaching hospital in South India was concordant with NCG guidelines.METHODS All patients who had surgery for breast cancer at a single center from January 2014 to December 2015 were included. Demographic, pathologic, and treatment characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record. Patients were classified as being concordant with six elements selected from the NCG guideline. The indicators related to appropriate use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, lymph node harvest, adjuvant radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing, and delivery of adjuvant trastuzumab.RESULTS A total of 401 women underwent surgery for breast cancer; mean age (standard deviation) was 57 (12) years. Lymph node involvement was present in 47% (188 of 401) of the cohort; 23% (94 of 401) had T1 disease. Ninety-two percent (368 of 401) underwent radical modified mastectomy. SLN biopsy was performed in 75% (167 of 222) of eligible patients. Eighty percent (208 of 261) of patients with a positive SLN biopsy or no SLN biopsy had a lymph node harvest of more than 10. Adjuvant chemotherapy with an anthracycline and a taxane was delivered to 67% of patients (118 of 177) with node-positive disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered to 84% (180 of 213) of patients with breast-conserving surgery, T4 tumors, or 3+ positive lymph nodes. Fluorescent in situ hybridization testing was performed in 59% of patients (43 of 73) with 2+ HER2-positive lymph nodes on immunohistochemistry. Among patients with HER2 overexpression, 40% (36 of 91) received adjuvant trastuzumab.CONCLUSION Concordance with NCG guidelines for breast cancer care ranged from 40% to 84%. Guideline concordance was lowest for those elements of care associated with the highest direct costs to patients. (C) 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> at US Emerging Infections Program Sites, 2015
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial drugs, making carbapenems crucial in clinical management. During July-October 2015 in the United States, we piloted laboratory-based surveillance for car-bapenem- resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) at sentinel facilities in Georgia, New Mexico, Oregon, and Tennessee, and population-based surveillance in Monroe County, NY. An incident case was the first P. aeruginosa isolate resistant to antipseudomonal carbapenems from a patient in a 30-day period from any source except the nares, rectum or perirectal area, or feces. We found 294 incident cases among 274 patients. Cases were most commonly identified from respiratory sites (120/294; 40.8%) and urine (111/294; 37.8%); most (223/280; 79.6%) occurred in patients with healthcare facility inpatient stays in the prior year. Genes encoding carbapenemases were identified in 3 (2.3%) of 129 isolates tested. The burden of CRPA was high at facilities under surveillance, but carbapenemase-producing CRPA were rare.

TI  - A Post-Classification Comparison Method for SAR and Optical Images Change Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a method for the change detection in multisensor remote sensing images. The proposed method combines multitemporal segmentation and compound classification. In consideration of the particularity of multisensor images, multitemporal segmentation is applied to generate homogeneous objects. This process can reduce the salt and pepper effect that is inevitable in pixel-based methods and reduce the false alarms caused by area transitions and object misalignment in traditional object-based methods. Then, compound classification is carried out at the object level. This process exploits temporal correlations and overcomes the error propagation of traditional postclassification comparison methods. The change map is generated by comparing the classification maps at different times. Experimental validation is conducted with GaoFen3, Terrasar, GaoFen2, and Google Earth data.

TI  - An a-contrario method of mismatch detection for two-view pushbroom satellite images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mismatch detection is a key step in the geometric correction of satellite images. However, most RANSAC-based mismatch detection methods face two problems in practical application, i.e., how to preset the threshold when the apriori matching accuracy is not known and how to validate the correctness of the results when the proportions of true matches are very low. In this paper, we propose an a-contrario method named ORSA-SAT to remove the mismatches for two-view satellite images by finding the most meaningful set of matches. The formula first is defined to compute the geometric rigidity of a set of point matches according to the image match search area with the matching accuracy measured by the maximum point-to-epipolar-line distance. Then, the meaningfulness of a set is rated by a probabilistic criterion that estimates the number of false alarms (NFA), which indicates the expected times that a set can be found by chance from non-rigid and randomly distributed matched points. The criterion is a function of the quantity of point-matches and the geometric rigidity and is used in ORSA-SAT for comparing two sets. The true matches are collected by finding the most meaningful set; thus, no preset thresholds are needed to separate the true matches and the mismatches. Furthermore, the criterion also justifies the correctness of the sets obtained by ORSA-SAT since rigid sets rarely occur from mismatches. In this paper, we use both simulated data and real matched points on images captured by IKONOS-2, ZY-3, and Landsat-8 to demonstrate ORSA-SAT. The results of the simulated experiments show that both the precisions and the recalls were ensured above 80% in the correct results of ORSA-SAT even though there were over 90% mismatches originally.

TI  - A Small-Baseline InSAR Inversion Algorithm Combining a Smoothing Constraint and <i>L</i><sub>1</sub>-Norm Minimization
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric artifacts and phase unwrapping errors have unfavorable effects on differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) deformation monitoring. In this letter, we present an alternative small-baseline DInSAR inversion algorithm, velocity-constraint L-1-norm minimization. The proposed algorithm improves the robustness of time series deformation estimation by combining a smoothing constraint and L-1-norm minimization. The smoothing constraint can minimize temporal atmospheric artifacts, and the L-1-norm minimization outperforms L-2-norm minimization in the presence of phase unwrapping errors. The iteratively reweighted least square algorithm is employed to adjust the weights of DInSAR observations and smoothing constraints in L-1-norm minimization. The proposed algorithm is validated using simulated data and TerraSAR-X data. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the inversion of approximately linear deformation processes affected by both atmospheric artifacts and unwrapping errors.

TI  - Random Walks for Pansharpening in Complex Tight Framelet Domain
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a new random walk (RW) pansharpening method on the basis of the complex framelet domain is proposed. In the process of fusion, the hidden Markov tree model is first established based on the statistical properties of complex high-pass framelet coefficients. On this basis, a novel RW fusion algorithm is presented. Then, the probabilities of complex framelet coefficients being allotted original images are solved by the linear system of equations. Based on these probabilities, the spatial details of the panchromatic image are selectively injected into the multispectral (MS) image to get a space-enhanced MS image. In the end, the GeoGye-1, WorldView-3, and WorldView-2 remote sensing image data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the presented method quantitatively and qualitatively. The results of the experiment show that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches. It can improve the spatial resolution of the MS image while keeping the spectral information.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the plasma selenium level of student men who have sex with men(MSM) in Changzhou and its influencing factors.METHODS: A total of 251 male students with previous male sexual history, 15-25 years of age who had been consulted by VCT clinics in Changzhou were included in this study from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. Questionnaires referred to AIDS sentinel surveillance were conducted to provide information about demographic characteristics and behaviors. Blood samples were collected for syphilis and HIV antibody detection. Selenium in plasma was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The influencing factors of plasma selenium level among student MSM were screened by classification tree model.RESULTS: The average age of objects was(20. 74±1. 94)years and the average plasma selenium level was(82. 30+12. 05) ng/mL. Educational attainment was mainly college or above, 77. 69%, and HIV antibody positive rate was 29. 48%. Plasma selenium was(87. 39±11. 37) ng/mL among student MSM with college or above, not infected with HIV and older than 20. 5 years, but was(78. 19±13. 48) ng/mL among those who were high school and below. Three related factors were screened out by the classification tree model, including education level, HIV infection status and age. The most important factor was education level. The estimate of substitution and cross-validation of the classification tree model were 131. 87 and 135. 11, and the standard error were 10. 50 and 10. 89, respectively.CONCLUSION: The related factors of plasma selenium level among student MSM are education level, HIV infection status and age.

TI  - Recognition of Significant Surface Soil Geochemical Anomalies Via Weighted 3D Shortest-Distance Field of Subsurface Orebodies: A Case Study in the Hongtoushan Copper Mine, NE China
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative prediction of concealed mineralization is always confronted with difficulties in comprehensive analysis between 2D and 3D data and between qualitative and quantitative data. A weighted shortest-distance field method is proposed here to track, in 3D heterogeneous space, the shortest migration paths of ore-forming elements from an orebody to the ground surface, assuming that ore-forming elements migrate at less costs into fault rupture zones than in other surrounding rocks. This method was used to generate the weighted shortest-distance field of the 3D orebody model in the Hongtoushan copper mine, NE China. In addition, the field value and the geochemical soil survey data on the Earth's surface were subjected to statistical analysis. Results showed that some geochemical anomalies are characterized by the shortest-distance field of the known orebodies, while other formerly unrecognized anomalies may possibly be related to undiscovered orebodies. This method can also be applied to comprehensive statistical analysis between a 3D geological model and 2D data on the Earth's surface, e.g., geophysical exploration or remote sensing data.

TI  - Assessment of the Dual Polarimetric Sentinel-1A Data for Forest Fuel Moisture Content Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) is a crucial variable affecting fuel ignition and rate of fire spread. Much work so far has focused on the usage of remote sensing data from multiple sensors to derive FMC; however, little attention has been devoted to the usage of the C-band Sentinel-1A data. In this study, we aimed to test the performance of C-band Sentinel-1A data for multi-temporal retrieval of forest FMC by coupling the bare soil backscatter linear model with the vegetation backscatter water cloud model (WCM). This coupled model that linked the observed backscatter directly to FMC, was firstly calibrated using field FMC measurements and corresponding synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatters (VV and VH), and then a look-up table (LUT) comprising of the modelled VH backscatter and FMC was built by running the calibrated model forwardly. The absolute difference (MAE(r)) of modelled and observed VH backscatters was selected as the cost function to search the optimal FMC from the LUT. The performance of the presented methodology was verified using the three-fold cross-validation method by dividing the whole samples into equal three parts. Two parts were used for the model calibration and the other one for the validation, and this was repeated three times. The results showed that the estimated and measured forest FMC were consistent across the three validation samples, with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.53% (Sample 1), 12.64% (Sample 2) and 15.45% (Sample 3). To further test the performance of the C-band Sentinel-1A data for forest FMC estimation, our results were compared to those obtained using the optical Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data and the empirical partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. The latter resulted in higher RMSE between estimated and measured forest FMC with 20.11% (Sample 1), 26.21% (Sample 2) and 26.73% (Sample 3) than the presented Sentinel-1A data-based method. Hence, this study demonstrated that the good capability of C-band Sentinel-1A data for forest FMC retrieval, opening the possibility of developing a new operational SAR data-based methodology for forest FMC estimation.

TI  - DEM generation from Worldview-2 stereo imagery and vertical accuracy assessment for its application in active tectonics
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The DEM-generation technology from high-resolution satellite imagery enables us to generate a wide range of high resolution topographic data rapidly, improving the efficiency of data acquisition greatly. This method is more efficient than airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) in terrain reconstruction, since satellite imagery covers a larger area without difficulties in field deployment. Previous researches evaluated the accuracy of DEMs generated from stereo imagery of different satellite sensors, however there is not enough quantitative analysis concerning the capability of satellite-based DEM in active tectonic studies. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a study to investigate the accuracy to measure heights of fault scarps using the DEM obtained from Worldview-2 stereo imagery and chose the Kumysh fault in the southern margin of Kumysh Basin (Eastern Tian Shan, China) as our test site. Point cloud data were obtained from stereo satellite imagery, both with and without GCPs respectively. Prior to the generation of the DEM, we compared the overall elevation differences of the point clouds and the fault scarp swaths. The overall elevation difference ranges from -1.2 to 0.4 m, with the mean value of -0.57 m, while the elevation difference of fault scarp swaths range from -1.1 to 0 m, with the mean value of -0.4 m. Afterwards, we generated a 0.5 m resolution DEM of 5-km swath along the Kumysh fault, measured the heights of fault scarps on different levels of alluvial fans, and compared the topographic profiles obtained from DEM and post processed differential GPS (ppGPS) survey. Our results show that: (1) the elevation difference between the topographic profiles ranges from -2.82-4.47 m, the shape of the fault scarp can be accurately reconstructed by satellite-based DEM with the deviation of 029 m after elevation correction; (2) the accuracy of the height measurement of fault scarps can reach 0.25 m. These findings indicate that the DEM generated from Worldview-2 stereo imagery is capable of measuring relative deformed topographic features, which could be of great interest to professionals exploring the use and accuracy of satellite stereo imagery for active tectonic applications.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing to Identify and Monitor Seasonal and Interannual Changes of Water Turbidity in Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water turbidity is an important indicator for water security and environmental security in the Yellow River estuary. However, due to the complex terrain and harsh climatic environment, it is difficult to monitor the water turbidity over the complex surface of the estuary. In this study we applied a self-organizing map clustering method, an artificial neural network clustering method, to extract turbidity patterns from the long-term remote sensing data sets in the Yellow River estuary. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data from 2000 to 2015, six turbidity patterns were identified by using the self-organizing map clustering method: high turbidity pattern, moderate turbidity pattern, low turbidity pattern, very low turbidity pattern, extreme high turbidity pattern and sea ice pattern, and the first four patterns appear every year. All patterns have significant seasonal characteristics, and monthly turbidity is dominated by one of these turbidity patterns. The water turbidity in the estuary has decreased in the past 16 years, and the interannual variation of the turbidity pattern is the result of the combination of the sediment transported into the sea by the Yellow River and the wind and waves on the sea surface.

TI  - Near-surface snowmelt detection on the Greenland ice sheet from FengYun-3 MWRI data
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The melt extent on the Greenland ice sheet plays an important role in energy balance, and the Arctic and global climates. The micro-wave radiation imager (MWRI) is one of the major payloads of Chinese second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, FengYun-3 (FY-3), and it is similar to the special sensor microwave/image (SSM/I). The cross-polarized gradient ratio (XPGR) is mainly applied in the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) (18 GHz horizontal polarization (18 H) and 37 GHz vertical polarization (37 V)), the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth observing system (AMSR-E) (18.7 GHz horizontal polarization (18 H) and 36.5 GHz vertical polarization (36 V)) and SSM/I (19.3 GHz horizontal polarization (19 H) and 37 GHz vertical polarization (37 V)), which increases the differences between dry and wet snow. The hyperplane of support vector machine (SVM) is used to detect the melt information based on the XPGR data on the Greenland ice sheet, which has higher detection accuracy comparing with the existing threshold methods in theory. The results were compared with the SSM/I data (threshold = - 0.0154), and the results show that the proposed method (That is XPGR combining with SVM) for MWRI data is feasible for the detection of the near-surface snowmelt information on the Greenland ice sheet.

TI  - Estimation of Canal Water Deficit Using Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS: A Case Study in Lower Chenab Canal System
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely precise information of land use land cover (LULC) in the canal command area can help in managing irrigation water according to the crop water requirement. A study was conducted to map the LULC of irrigated command area of three distributaries in the lower Chenab canal system, Pakistan, namely Mungi, Killianwala and Khurrianwala for the estimation of canal water deficit (CWD). Multispectral images of LANDSAT-7 were used for Rabi season of 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Normalized difference vegetation index-based unsupervised classification was performed for the formation of LULC of the commands area. During the initial classification, totally nine clusters were created with maximum likelihood. These clusters were then merged into final four classes on the basis of field knowledge. Accuracy assessment was performed using error matrix; producer and user accuracies were estimated for each class with overall accuracy of 84% and 86% for the Rabi season 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, respectively. For the assessment of the irrigation water demand, potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation. Crop water requirement was estimated based on the 10-day Kc value of the mapped crop from the LULC. Irrigation water demand for cropped area was estimated from the LULC and crop evapotranspiration. Canal water deficit was estimated from the available canal water supply and irrigation water requirement in the Rabi season. During the Rabi seasons, average CWD was 64%, 72% and 32% (2009-2010) and 33%, 46% and 36% (2010-2011) for Khurrianwala, Killianwala and Mungi distributary, respectively.

TI  - A Regionally Robust High-Spatial-Resolution Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm for MODIS Images Over Eastern China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been widely used in related aerosol studies because of its long data records. However, operational aerosol optical depth (AOD) products at coarse spatial resolutions limit their applications on small and medium scales. Thus, high-spatialresolution AOD products are needed. In this paper, a regionally robust high-resolution aerosol retrieval algorithm is developed for MODIS images over Eastern China which has complex surfaces and severe air pollution. Several major challenges in aerosol retrieval are resolved including: 1) surface reflectance by correcting for the effects of surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function using the RossThick-LiSparse model; 2) aerosol models assumed by time-series data analysis with historical aerosol optical properties measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites; and 3) cloud screening using the proposed universal dynamic threshold cloud detection algorithm. Moreover, gas (i.e., ozone and water vapor) absorption is also corrected. Finally, our AOD retrievals are compared with the newest AERONET Version 3 Level 2.0 AOD ground-based measurements, latest MODIS Collection 6.1 AOD products at 3- and 10-km resolutions, and multiangle implementation of the atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD product at a 1-km resolution. The results suggest that our algorithm performs well over dark vegetated and bright urban surfaces and that 78.56% of the retrievals meet the acceptable expected error of +/-(0.05% + 20%) with a mean absolute error and a root-mean-square error of 0.074 and 0.125, respectively. Comparison results indicate that the newly generated 1-km AOD data set is much better than the routine MOD04 3- and 10-km dark target data sets, and slightly better than the 10-km deep blue (with lower resolution) and 1-km MAIAC (with narrower space coverage) AOD products. This attests to the robustness of our algorithm that generates an AOD product with a more continuous coverage and finer resolution over complex surfaces.

TI  - Satellite Observations of the Diurnal Dynamics of Particulate Organic Carbon in Optically Complex Coastal Oceans: The Continental Shelf Seas of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The continental shelf seas of China (CSSC) broadly encompass the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea and exhibit highly variable optical properties. Accurate satellite estimates of particulate organic carbon (POC) remain challenging because optimal proxies for remotely sensed POC are largely obscure in these optically complex coastal waters. In this study, optical and biogeochemical data, including the particulate beam attenuation coefficient (c(p)), particulate backscattering coefficient (b(bp)), remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), POC, total suspended matter (TSM), and chlorophyll-a (Chla), were collected over multiple seasons and years in the CSSC. We first classified the study area into three different water types with three different POC retrieval proxies: the TSM for high-TSM waters, Chla for low-TSM waters, and R-rs ratio (R-rs(490)/R-rs(555)) for moderate-TSM waters. A composite POC algorithm using these three optimal proxies was then developed for Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data (hereafter called the POC_CSSC algorithm). The validation results indicated that the accuracy of GOCI-derived POC was greatly improved with a mean relative error of 32.08%. Application of the POC_CSSC algorithm to GOCI data over a tidally impacted estuary demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm and that tides play different roles in the broad CSSC. More specifically, tides have the strongest influence on nearshore estuarine waters, regulating the progression of high-POC water masses from estuary to offshore environments, while offshore waters were the least influenced by tides with less variable, low POC concentrations.

TI  - Remote Detection of Large-Area Crop Types: The Role of Plant Phenology and Topography
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable agricultural practices necessitate accurate baseline data of crop types and their detailed spatial distribution. Compared with field surveys, remote sensing has demonstrated superior performance, offering spatially explicit crop distribution in a timely manner. Recent studies have taken advantage of remote sensing time series to capture the variation in plant phenology, inferring major crop types. However, such an approach was rarely used to extract detailed, multiple crop types spanning a large area, and the impact of topography has yet to be well analyzed in mountainous regions. This study aims to answer two questions in crop type extraction: (i) Is it feasible to accurately map multiple crop types over a large mountainous area with phenology-based modeling? (ii) What are the effects of topography in such modeling? To answer the questions, phenological metrics were extracted from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite time series, and the random forests classifier was used to map 12 crop types in South China (236,700 km(2)), featuring a subtropical monsoon climate and high topographic variation. Our study revealed promising results using MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series, although EVI outperformed NDVI (overall accuracy: 85% versus 81%). The spectral and temporal metrics of plant phenology significantly contributed to crop identification, where the spectral information exhibited greater importance. The increase of slope led to a decrease in model accuracy in general. However, uniformly distributed tree plantations (e.g., tea-oil camellia, gum, and tea trees) being cultivated on large slopes (>15 degrees) achieved accuracies greater than 80%.

TI  - Microfluidic enrichment, isolation and characterization of disseminated melanoma cells from lymph node samples
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time in melanoma, novel therapies have recently shown efficacy in the adjuvant therapy setting, which makes companion diagnostics to guide treatment decisions a desideratum. Early spread of disseminated cancer cells (DCC) to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is indicative of poor prognosis in melanoma and early DCCs could therefore provide important information about the malignant seed. Here, we present a strategy for enrichment of DCCs from SLN suspensions using a microfluidic device (Parsortix (TM), Angle plc). This approach enables the detection and isolation of viable DCCs, followed by molecular analysis and identification of genetic changes. By optimizing the workflow, the established protocol allows a high recovery of DCC from melanoma patient-derived lymph node (LN) suspensions with harvest rates above 60%. We then assessed the integrity of the transcriptome and genome of individual, isolated DCCs. In LNs of melanoma patients, we detected the expression of melanoma-associated transcripts including MLANA (encoding for MelanA protein), analyzed the BRAF and NRAS mutational status and confirmed the malignant origin of isolated melanoma DCCs by comparative genomic hybridization. We demonstrate the feasibility of epitope-independent isolation of LN DCCs using Parsortix (TM) for subsequent molecular characterization of isolated single DCCs with ample application fields including the use for companion diagnostics or subsequent cellular studies in personalized medicine.

TI  - Evolution in practice patterns of axillary management following mastectomy in patients with 1-2 positive sentinel nodes
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe optimal management of breast cancer patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) who undergo mastectomy remains controversial. This study aimed to describe treatment patterns of patients with positive SLNs who undergo mastectomy using a large population-based database.MethodsThe NCDB was queried for cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy between 2006 and 2014 who had 1-2 positive SLNs. Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Axillary management included SLN dissection (SLND) alone, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), post-mastectomy radiation (PMRT) alone, and ALND+PMRT. Trends of axillary management and patient characteristics were examined.ResultsAmong 12,190 patients who met study criteria, the use of ALND dropped with a corresponding increase in other approaches. In 2006, 34% of patients had SLND alone, 47% ALND, 8% PMRT and 11% ALND+PMRT. By 2014, 37% had SLND, 23% ALND, 27% PMRT and 13% ALND+PMRT. Patients who underwent SLND alone were older (mean 60.6years) with more comorbidities (Charlson-Deyo score>2), smaller primary tumors (mean 2.1cm), well-differentiated histology, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative tumors, without lymphovascular invasion (all P values<0.01). Treatment with SLND alone was more likely if patients had only one positive SLN (P<0.001) or micrometastatic disease (P<0.001), and were treated at community centers compared with academic centers (P<0.001).ConclusionsThe management of breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with positive SLNs has evolved over time with decreased use of ALND and increased use of radiation. Some patient subsets are underrepresented in recent clinical trials, and therefore, future trials should focus on these patients.

AB  - remote sensing image land type data mining was studied based on QUEST decision tree with Dongting Lake area as the research object. First of all, the texture feature of gray level co-occurrence matrix was expounded, and the texture size was selected to construct the QUEST decision tree model; secondly, through spectrum and texture feature of remote sensing data with different resolutions and combining with other auxiliary data, Dongting land information was explored, and land type was classified. Finally, the following conclusions were reached: multi-scale texture can better describe the texture feature of land, more effectively solve with the phenomenon of "same image for different object" in the classification results, and help to improve classification accuracy of high resolution image.

TI  - Selective abortion as path to infanticide
T2  - ESTUDOS TEOLOGICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - In many countries it is possible to choose abortion in case of diagnosis of fetal anomalies. Some intellectuals, such as Peter Singer, Francesca Minerva and Alberto Giubilini, understand and defend, from a utilitarian point of view, that under the same justification, infanticide becomes morally correct. These philosophers are clear in their conclusions, and it is in this context that this article proposes to discuss some of the consequences of this worldview. Using the bibliographic method, we try to give form to this discussion, presenting the case of Down syndrome. Referring to the impossibility, under the utilitarian justification, of defending abortion and rejecting infanticide, as proposed by Henrik Friberg-Fernros, we present the humanist perspective, in dialogue with Jurgen Habermas and Hannah Arendt, as a counterpoint to ethical relativism. The authors of this article conclude that, if morally accepted as a way of eliminating suffering and guaranteeing the quality of life, selective abortion opens the way to the moral viability of infanticide.

TI  - Clinical characteristics in a sentinel case as well as in a cluster of tularemia patients associated with grape harvest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis and can occasionally establish foodborne transmission.Methods: Patients were identified by active case detection through contact with the treating physicians and consent for publication was obtained. Clinical data were accumulated through a review of the patient charts. Serology, culture, and PCR methods were performed for confirmation of the diagnosis.Case cluster: A 46-year-old patient was hospitalised in the University Hospital Frankfurt (a tertiary care hospital) for pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenitis with abscess. A diagnosis of tularemia was made serologically, but treatment with ciprofloxacin initially failed. F. tularensis was detected in pus from the lymph node using a specific real-time PCR. The use of RD1 PCR led to the identification of the subspecies holarctica. Antibiotic therapy with high-dose ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was administered and was subsequently changed to ciprofloxacin and rifampicin. During a must-tasting, five other individuals became infected with tularemia by ingestion of contaminated must. All patients required treatment durations of more than 14 days.Conclusions: Mechanically harvested agricultural products, such as wine must, can be a source of infection, probably due to contamination with animal carcasses. The clinical course of tularemia can be complicated and prolonged and requires differentiated antibiotic treatment. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Measurement of Vegetation Change in Critical Dune Sites along the Eastern Shores of Lake Michigan from 1938 to 2014 with Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal sand dunes are common on coastlines around the world and are often heavily managed to control erosion or to enable their dynamic nature. The largest body of freshwater coastal dunes in the world occurs on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan in North America. This dune system is one of the most heavily utilized landscapes in the Great Lakes region and has tremendous economic and cultural significance. As a result, they are managed in association with Michigan's Sand Dune Protection and Management Act, which seeks, in part, to preserve their diversity, quality, and function. To achieve these goals, it is essential to understand the dunes' geomorphic evolution and behaviors. Prior research has thoroughly investigated their geomorphic development in the past 5000 years; however, this record is based on "C and optical dates with inherent chronological uncertainty. In contrast, little is known about the patterns or rates of vegetation expansion and contraction in this period. Iligh-resolution remote sensing data may provide new insights into the spatial conditions of the landscape not available through field data collection. Land cover change mapping provides an estimate of the extent of vegetation change in these environments. The use of black and white historical photographs are difficult for these studies because of their lack of spectral information. Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) incorporates spatial context into the classification process and can improve classification resolution and accuracy from such images. A GEOBIA technique was applied to estimate the extent of vegetation change from 1938 to 2014 in coastal dune systems along much of the eastern coast of Lake Michigan. Results show that 14 of 16 study sites experienced significant vegetation increase; however, classification accuracies depend on the successful co-registration of the images and land cover heterogeneity. These results provide essential baseline information for maintaining the diversity, quality, and function of this dynamic landscape.

TI  - The Impact of the Two-Way Coupling between Wind Wave and Atmospheric Models on the Lower Atmosphere over the North Sea
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of coupling between the atmospheric model of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling-Climate Limited-area Modelling (CCLM) and the wind wave model (WAM) on the lower atmosphere within the North Sea area are studied. Due to the two-way coupling between the models, the influences of wind waves and the atmosphere on each other can be determined. This two-way coupling between these models is enabled through the introduction of wave-induced drag into CCLM and updated winds into WAM. As a result of wave-induced drag, different atmospheric parameters are either directly or indirectly influenced by the wave conditions. The largest differences between the coupled and reference model simulation are found during storm events as well as in areas of steep gradients in the mean sea level pressure, wind speed or temperature. In the two-way coupled simulation, the position and strength of these gradients vary, compared to the reference simulation, leading to differences that spread throughout the entire planetary boundary layer and outside the coupled model area, thereby influencing the atmosphere over land and ocean, although not coupled to the wave model. Ultimately, the results of both model simulations are assessed against in situ and satellite measurements, with a better general performance of the two-way coupled simulation with respect to the observations.

TI  - Integrating LiDAR data and multi-temporal aerial imagery to map wetland inundation dynamics using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region of North America is characterized by millions of depressional wetlands, which provide critical habitats for globally significant populations of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife species. Due to their relatively small size and shallow depth, these wetlands are highly sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic changes, exhibiting inter- and intra-annual inundation dynamics. Moderate-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) alone cannot be used to effectively delineate these small depressional wetlands. By integrating fine spatial resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-temporal (2009-2017) aerial images, we developed a fully automated approach to delineate wetland inundation extent at watershed scales using Google Earth Engine. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify aerial imagery with additional spectral indices to extract potential wetland inundation areas, which were further refined using LiDAR-derived landform depressions. The wetland delineation results were then compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and existing global-scale surface water products to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We tested the workflow on 26 watersheds with a total area of 16,576 km(2) in the Prairie Pothole Region. The results showed that the proposed method can not only delineate current wetland inundation status but also demonstrate wetland hydrological dynamics, such as wetland coalescence through fill-spill hydrological processes. Our automated algorithm provides a practical, reproducible, and scalable framework, which can be easily adapted to delineate wetland inundation dynamics at broad geographic scales.

TI  - A novel algorithm for differentiating cloud from snow sheets using Landsat 8 OLI imagery
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The separation of clouds from snow is fundamentally very challenging because of their similar spectral signature. A new algorithm was proposed to detect clouds from snow in Landsat 8 imagery. Taking the Hetian District region, where there is frequent cloud and snow cover, in northwestern China as one of the typical case areas. The typical case is presented in detail to illustrate the approach produces and results. A band math method for cloud and snow discrimination index (CSDI) was firstly conducted in this paper, fractal digital number-frequency (DN-N) algorithm and hotspot analyses were applied to determine the threshold of the CSDI and eliminate false anomalies. The results showed that an overall accuracy exceeding 95% in areas with very bright land surfaces, which indicate that this algorithm is effective for detecting clouds in specific situations where the ground objects have some reflectance characteristics similar to cloud.

TI  - A Spatialization Method for Grain Yield Statistical Data: A Study on Winter Wheat of Shandong Province, China
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Grain yield data based on administrative divisions (counties, cities, etc.) for statistics lack spatial information, which can be effectively solved by grain yield spatialization. This paper proposes a spatialization method for grain yield based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data. The method was tested by taking winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Shandong Province in China as an example. First, the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm was trained to extract the winter wheat planting pixels in 2016. The average NDVIs of the different growing stages (returning green, jointing, heading, and milk ripening) were calculated from the MODIS NDVI time series data. The relationship between winter wheat yield and NDVI variables (including single-phase NDVI and the average NDVI of different growing stages) was analyzed by univariate and multiple linear regressions. The NDVI variable with the highest correlation to winter wheat yield and the minimum root mean square error of the fitting equation were chosen as input to build the spatialization model. The results show that the classification accuracy of winter wheat estimated with the confusion matrix was 82.51% and that the average precision of planting acreage compared with county-level statistical data was 87.64%. The average relative error of yield spatialization at the county level was 22.71%. The method developed in this paper is easy to operate and popularize, and it can provide a technical reference for producing high-resolution crop yield distribution maps of long time series through spatialization.

TI  - Effects of Shipping-originated Aerosols on Physical Cloud Properties over Marine Areas near East China
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shipping emissions have received increasing attention due to their influence on regional climate, and air quality at ports and in coastal areas around the world. In the context of climatology, the effects of shipping-originated aerosols (using the aerosol optical depth, AOD(ship), as a proxy) on clouds in marine areas near East China were examined based on multi-satellite datasets. On average, AOD(ship) is approximately 0.17, 0.20, 0.15 and 0.13 in the different seasons, contributing 23%, 30%, 36% and 25% of the total AOD, respectively. In remote sea areas, AOD(ship) is generally higher in spring and summer and lower in autumn. Statistical analysis shows that it is strongly related to the cloud parameters, such as the cloud fraction (CF), cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER) in the liquid phase. In particular, CER and AOD(ship) exhibit a positive correlation in winter but a weakly negative correlation in summer over the northern East China Sea and a positive correlation in spring and summer over the Yellow Sea. In all four seasons, COT and CF decrease as AOD(ship) increases. The correlations between AOD(ship) and the cloud properties are stronger (R > 0.3) when the aerosol-cloud layers are well mixed than when they are separated, indicating that shipping-originated aerosols drawn into the cloud body can directly affect the microphysical properties of cloud droplets during cloud formation. The water vapor content and upward air motion are key thermodynamic conditions within the low atmospheric layers under the cloud bottom that play an important role in cloud formation and development. Our results provide new insight into the influence of shipping emissions on clouds in Asian marine areas.

TI  - Evaluation of Aib and PEG-polymer insect kinin analogs on mosquito and tick GPCRs identifies potent new pest management tools with potentially enhanced biostability and bioavailability
T2  - GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Insect kinins modulate aspects of diuresis, digestion, development, and sugar taste perception in tarsi and labellar sensilla in mosquitoes. They are, however, subject to rapid biological degradation by endogenous invertebrate peptidases. A series of alpha-aminoisobutyric (Aib) acid-containing insect kinin analogs incorporating sequences native to the Aedes aegypti mosquito aedeskinins were evaluated on two recombinant kinin invertebrate receptors stably expressed in cell lines, discovering a number of highly potent and biostable insect kinin mimics. On the Ae. aegypti mosquito kinin receptor, three highly potent, biostable Aib analogs matched the activity of the Aib-containing biostable insect kinin analog 1728, which previously showed disruptive and/or aversive activity in aphid, mosquito and kissing bug. These three analogs are IK-Aib-19 ([Aib]FY[Aib]WGa, EC50 = 18 nM), IK-Aib-12 (pQKFY[Aib]WGa, EC50 = 23 nM) and IK-Aib-20 ([Aib]FH[Aib]WGa, EC50 = 28 nM). On the Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus tick receptor, IK-Aib-20 ([Aib]FH[Aib]WGa, EC50 = 2 nM) is more potent than 1728 by a factor of 3. Seven other potentially biostable analogs exhibited an EC50 range of 5-10 nM, all of which match the potency of 1728. Among the multi-Aib hexapeptide kinin analogs tested the tick receptor has a preference for the positively-charged, aromatic H over the aromatic residues Y and F in the X-1 variable position ([Aib]FX1[Aib]WGa), whereas the mosquito receptor does not distinguish between them. In contrast, in a mono-Aib pentapeptide analog framework (FX1[Aib] WGa), both receptors exhibit a preference for Y over H in the variable position. Among analogs incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer attachments at the Nterminus that can confer enhanced bioavailability and biostability, three matched or surpassed the potency of a positive control peptide. On the tick receptor IK-PEG-9 (P-8-R[Aib]FF[Aib]WGa) was the most potent. Two others, IK-PEG-8 (P-8-RFFPWGa) and IK-PEG-6 (P-4-RFFPWGa), were most potent on the mosquito receptor, with the first surpassing the activity of the positive control peptide. These analogs and others in the IK-Aib series expand the toolbox of potent analogs accessible to invertebrate endocrinologists studying the structural requirements for bioactivity and the as yet unknown role of the insect kinins in ticks. They may contribute to the development of selective, environmentally friendly pest arthropod control agents.

TI  - IDeRs: Iterative dehazing method for single remote sensing image
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images (RSIs) taken in hazy conditions, such as haze, fog, thin could, snow, silt, dust, offgas, etc., suffer from sever color and contrast degradations. Dehazing algorithm is therefore highly demanded to restore hazed RSIs from their degradations. In the literatures, most dehazing algorithms were originally designed for natural images dehazing (NID). For our analysis, the physical model of NID is different from that of RSI dehazing (RSID), which was not clearly addressed yet. In this paper, a new concept of "virtual depth" concerning physical model of RSI is firstly raised. Virtual depth is different from real depth of nature image in that the former gives the distance of an object departing from the foreground, while the later measures the coverings of the earth's surface, such as snow, dust, cloud and haze/fog. These coverings act as the hazes in a natural image, providing the hint of foreground and background. Secondly, an Iterative Dehazing for Remote Sensing image (IDeRS) is proposed, in which dehazing operator is implemented iteratively to remove haze progressively until arriving at a satisfied result. In IDeRS, we also raise a fusion model for combining patch-wise and pixel-wise dehazing operators to overcome both halos and over-saturation caused by them respectively. Extensive experimental results tested on publicly available databases demonstrate that the proposed IDeRS outperforms most state-of-the-arts in RSID. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Regionally and Locally Adaptive Models for Retrieving Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Inland Waters From Remotely Sensed Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various empirical algorithms have been developed to retrieve chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from multispectral and hyperspectral images as a proxy variable for algal blooms in inland waters. In most previous studies, a single empirical model (global model) was calibrated for the entire water body under study. Our analysis shows that the performance of a global model is limited for optically complex inland waters. We discovered that the global model tends to overestimate in some regions and underestimate in other regions, and that the model residuals (errors) display an apparent spatial autocorrelation pattern. To address the inadequacy of the global empirical model, this paper presents regionally or locally adaptive models to better estimate Chl-a concentrations for the first time. We collected two dense sets of Chl-a measurements over Harsha Lake in Ohio during a Sentinel-2A satellite overpass and a dedicated airborne hyperspectral flight. Based on the atmospherically corrected multispectral and hyperspectral images and concurrent in situ measurements, we implemented and evaluated the performance of regionally and locally adaptive models in comparison with the single global model. Among a number of candidate empirical algorithms, the two-band algorithm produces the best global model for Chl-a retrievals for both the multispectral and hyperspectral image sources. By subdividing the water body under investigation into several regions or a set of local areas, we demonstrate that regionally and locally adaptive models can improve Chl-a estimate accuracy by 13%-28% for the multispectral image and by 33%-47% for the hyperspectral image, in comparison with the best global Chl-a model.

TI  - The impact of topographical parameters to the glaciation and glacial retreat on Mount Ar (Ararat)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The controls of topography on glacial changes are crucial, because the heterogeneity in glacial distribution is mainly due to the topography. It is possible to see clearly the topographical effects on glacier distributions on the Ar Glacier. As it is the highest region relative to its immediate surroundings, so the glacier region is not under the influence of topography of other regions. This paper investigates and aims to determine the effects of topographic characteristics on glaciation and melting regions on Ar glacier. The study was carried out using Landsat satellite data in August 1987, 1989, 1998, 2013, and 2015. Glacier boundaries delineated with both band ratio technique and Normalize Difference Snow Index for each year. Topographical characteristics of glaciation and melting zones were analyzed regarding aspect, slope, elevation, and direction. All analyses were performed by spatial statistics based on the Geographic Information System. As a result of the study, the significant spatial correlation was observed between topographic parameters and glacier distributions. Therefore, the topographic structure has a direct impact on the glaciation and melting. In comparison with aspect and slope parameters, elevation and direction are more important parameters for prediction of potential melting zones. It was predicted that the glacier area loss will be higher at lower elevations of both the eastern and southern parts of the glacier and there will be no glacier in these directions soon.

TI  - Evaluating land surface phenology from the Advanced Himawari Imager using observations from MODIS and the Phenological Eyes Network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Himawari Imager (Al-II) onboard the recently launched next generation geostationary satellite, Himawari-8, provides an opportunity to improve Land Surface Phenology (LSP) detections over the Asia-Pacific region. In this paper, we detected four phenological transition dates (PTDs) using the three-day Two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series from AHI based on the Hybrid Piecewise Logistic Model-Land Surface Phenology Detection (HPLM-LSPD) algorithm. The four PTDs are Start of Spring (SOS), End of Spring (EOS), Start of Fall (SOF) and End of Fall (SOF). We evaluated the four AHI-derived PTDs against those detected using eight-day EVI2 time series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the polar-orbiting satellite Terra, and three-day Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) time series from the Phenological Eyes Network (PEN) at six sites in central and northern Japan. The evaluation was performed by conducting regression analyses, and calculating root mean square difference (RMSD) and bias between satellite and PEN-derived PTDs. First, the difference in the spatial variations of SOS and EOF timing between naturally vegetated areas, and urban areas and croplands indicates the anthropogenic footprints on LSP. Second, the RMSD of either AHI PTDs or MODIS PTDs against PEN PTDs were higher in the fall (i.e., SOF and EOF) than those in spring (i.e., SOS and EOS). Third, the later EOS and earlier SOF derived from satellite EVI2 relative to those derived from PEN GCC might be caused by the difference in the sensitivity of GCC and EVI2 to the increases in leaf area index (LAI) over high-LAI canopies. Fourth, the higher temporal resolution of AHI EVI2 only helped reduce the RMSD during spring compared to the RMSD for MODIS. In contrast, the RMSD for AHI PTDs and MODIS PTDs were comparable in fall. Finally, the between-sensor correlation in the spatiotemporal variability of the four PTDs was higher for SOS and EOF than those for EOS and SOF.

TI  - Sharpening land use maps and predicting the trends of land use change using high resolution airborne image: A geostatistical approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High quality land use/land cover (LULC) data with fine spatial resolution and frequent temporal coverage are indispensable for revealing detail information of the Earth's surface, characterizing LULC of the area, predicting the plausible land use changes, and assessing the viability and impacts of any development plans. While airborne imagery has high spatial resolution, it only provides limited temporal coverage over time. The LULC data from historical remote sensing images, such as those from Landsat, have frequent coverages over a long temporal period, but their spatial resolutions are low.This paper presents a spatio-temporal Cokriging method to sharpen LULC data and predict the trends of land use change. A set of time-series coarse resolution LULC maps and one frame of high spatial resolution airborne imagery of the Upper Mill Creek Watershed were used to illustrate the utility of our method. By explicitly describing the spatio-temporal dependence within and between different datasets, modelling the Anderson classification codes using spatial, temporal, and cross-covariance structures, and transforming the Anderson integer classification code to class probability, our method was able to resolve the differences between multi source spatio-temporal LULC data, generate maps with sharpened and detailed land features, characterize the spatial and temporal LULC changes, reveal the trend of LULC change, and create a quality dataset invaluable for monitoring, assessing, and modelling LULC changes.

TI  - Sentinel-3A SRAL Global Statistical Assessment and Cross-Calibration with Jason-3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3A satellite, equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Altimeter (SRAL) instrument to derive sea surface height, significant wave height and surface wind speed over the global ocean, was launched on 16 February 2016. The assessment of data quality and the system performance of the altimeter are very important to data application. In this article, Sentinel-3A SRAL data quality is assessed and altimetry system performance is estimated by verifying data availability and monitoring the parameters of altimeter and radiometer through the global statistical analyses of Sentinel-3A Non-Time-Critical (NTC) Marine Level 2 products during the period from 13 March 2016 to 25 February 2019, in comparison with self-crossovers and cross-calibration with the Jason-3 mission. The global statistical analyses and the comparisons at self-crossovers show that Sentinel-3A SRAL data and performance are stable and have no trend over time, and the total cycle average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of sea surface height (SSH) differences at self-crossovers is about 5.4 cm. The comparisons at the dual-crossovers show the consistency of the observation between Sentinel-3A SRAL and Jason-3, and indicate that the systemic bias of SSH is about 2.96 cm. In general, it can be concluded that Sentinel-3A SRAL has good and stable data quality and system performance for operational ocean forecasting and scientific research.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The validation of significant wave height (SWH) data measured by the Sentinel-3A/3B SAR Altimeter (SRAL) is essential for the application of the data in ocean wave monitoring, forecasting and wave climate studies. Sentinel-3A/3B SWH data are validated by comparisons with U. S. National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys, using a spatial scale of 25 km and a temporal scale of 30 min, and with Jason-3 data at their crossovers, using a time difference of less than 30 min. The comparisons with NDBC buoy data show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of Sentinel-3A SWH is 0.30 m, and that of Sentinel-3B is no more than 0.31 m. The pseudo-Low-Resolution Mode (PLRM) SWH is slightly better than that of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode. The statistical analysis of Sentinel-3A/3B SWH in the bin of 0.5 m wave height shows that the accuracy of Sentinel-3A/3B SWH data decreases with increasing wave height. The analysis of the monthly biases and RMSEs of Sentinel-3A SWH shows that Sentinel-3A SWH are stable and have a slight upward trend with time. The comparisons with Jason-3 data show that SWH of Sentinel-3A and Jason-3 are consistent in the global ocean. Finally, the piecewise calibration functions are given for the calibration of Sentinel-3A/3B SWH. The results of the study show that Sentinel-3A/3B SWH data have high accuracy and remain stable.

In this context, spatially explicit soil information is essential for improving the knowledge of the role of soil in changing environments, supporting coastal sustainable management. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data provides an attractive opportunity to monitor soil because the acquisition of images is independent of weather and daylight. However, SAR has not been commonly used for soil prediction. In this study, we firstly investigated the temporal variation of vegetation canopy and the soil-vegetation relationship using Sentinel-1 data in an invaded coastal wetland. And then we built 3D models to predict soil properties at multiple depths. A total of 16 Sentinel-1 images were acquired in a growing season. A series of soil physicochemical properties were examined including soil bulk density, texture, organic/inorganic carbon, pH, salinity, total nitrogen, and C/N ratio, relating to three depth layers in the top 1-m depth. Our results showed that time-series Sentinel-1 data can capture temporal characteristics of vegetation, and VH/VV was more sensitive to the vegetation growth than VH and VV. The soil-vegetation relationship captured by time-series SAR data was beneficial to predict soil properties, especially for soil chemical properties. The models provided permissible prediction accuracy, with an average RPD of 0.99. We concluded that the prior understanding of the temporal variation of SAR data is essential for developing practical soil prediction strategy. Our results highlight that SAR has the potential to predict a diverse set of soil properties in coastal wetlands with dense vegetation cover.

TI  - A semi-analytical snow-free vegetation index for improving estimation of plant phenology in tundra and grassland ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite monitoring of plant phonology in tundra and grassland ecosystems using conventional vegetation indices (VIs), such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), can be biased by effects of snow. Snow free VIs that take advantage of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band have been proposed to overcome this problem, viz., the phonology index (PI) and the normalized difference phonology index (NDPI). However, the PI cannot properly capture the presence of sparse vegetation, and the NDPI does not account for the influence of dry vegetation. Here, we propose a novel snow-free VI, designated the normalized difference greenness index (NDGI), that uses reflectance in the green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The NDGI is a semi-analytical index based on a linear spectral mixture model and the spectral characteristics of vegetation, snow, soil, and dry grass. Its performance at estimating the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS) was evaluated using simulation datasets, time-lapse camera data at tundra sites, and flux tower gross primary production (GPP) data at grassland sites. Simulation results demonstrated that the NDGI can exclude the influence of snow on estimates of SOS and EOS. At the tundra sites, the NDGI markedly outperformed the NDVI, PI, NDPI, NIRv (near-infrared reflectance of vegetation), EVI2 (two-band enhanced vegetation index), PPI (plant phenology index), and DVI (difference vegetation index plus) for SOS estimation, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.5 days and a Bias of 1.3 days, and for EOS estimation, with an RMSE of 8.3 days and a Bias of 0.11 days. At the grassland sites, the NDGI also outperformed the other VIs at SOS estimation, with an RMSE of 10.3 days and a Bias of 4.9 days. Although its performance was poorer at monitoring EOS than SOS at grassland (GPP) sites, its performance was comparable to that of the PI and superior to that of the other VIs at estimating EOS. These results indicate the potential of the NDGI for operational monitoring of plant phenology in tundra and grassland ecosystems based on satellite observations.

T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting slope movement before landslides occur in mountain regions is crucial for disaster reduction. In October 2018, a gigantic landslide occurred on the Jinsha River, causing dammed-lake breach flood 500km downstream. In this work, we used 25 Sentinel-2 images from November 2015 to August 2018 to explore the capability of this high temporal resolution optical images in detecting slope movement before the Jinsha River landslide. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated to composite temporal profiles using all Sentinel-2 images. With this NDVI time series, unsupervised K-means classifier was applied to initially classify the study area and find the best thresholds for automatically extracting landslide scars in the image series. These extracted landslide scars were validated using interpreted results from two high spatial resolution images of similar dates in 2015 (user's accuracy 89.7%, producer's accuracy 83.6%) and 2018 (user's accuracy 90.8%, producer's accuracy 74.9%). After validation, extracted landslide scars of different years were counted and displayed in an RGB composite image to highlight slope movement. In addition, monotonous decrease/increase of NDVI was also observed, indicating continuous expansion of landslide scarps and movement of landslide head along the slope on the landslide surface. This work demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-2 time series images to capture slope movement with short revisit time at low cost. By incorporating other environmental information (such as elevation), this proposed method has the potential to consistently map pre-landslide slope movements over a large region.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of the relationship between vegetation and groundwater buried depth: A case study of a coal mine district in Western China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the interdependence between vegetation and the buried depth of groundwater is key to revealing the ecological and hydrological processes affecting vegetation in arid and semi-arid areas. The study area, the Yushen coal mine district, is located in the Mu Us Desert, which is the typical arid and semi-arid transition zone in Western China. There are a large number of areas with shallow with shallow groundwater depths in the region, which provides favorable growing conditions for vegetation growth. Due to sparse precipitation and rapid evaporation of water in the region, vegetative growth is tied closely to the depth of groundwater table. Given the widespread and intensive exploitation of the region's abundant coal resources, the decline of groundwater table poses a threat to surface vegetation ecology health inevitably. Therefore, study of the ecological effects of large-scale changes to the depth of groundwater is of great significance for guiding exploitation of coal resources, eco-environmental conservation and future rehabilitation efforts. Using Yushen coal mine district as a study area, the quantitative relationship between groundwater buried depth and vegetation development is determined in different ecological and geological (eco-geological) environments by combining MODIS remote sensing with measured groundwater buried depth data as well as supplementing with other on-site investigations and collection of data. Using ArcGIS 10.5 and MATLAB R2018a, we divided the study area into 3 eco-geological environments: (1) phreatic water desert shallows oasis; (2) surface runoff (loess) gully; and (3) surface water river-valley oasis. The vegetation types, growth status, and diversity differed within the eco-geological environments. Based on the sensitivity of vegetation to the buried depth of groundwater in each of the three eco-geological environments, we further classified areas within the eco-geological environments as either type-1 sensitive, either type-2 sensitive or non-sensitive. We found that sensitivity class was related to the groundwater buried depth. Vegetative ecology improved with groundwater buried depth drawdown, while it deteriorated in type-2 sensitive areas. Vegetative ecology generally exhibited little dependence on groundwater buried depth in non-sensitive areas, where climate and soil moisture content were the predominant influences.

TI  - Assessing Hydrological and Sedimentation Effects from Bottom Topography Change in a Complex River-Lake System of Poyang Lake, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, a dramatic decline in Poyang Lake water levels and a shrinking water surface have raised concerns about water security and the wetland ecosystem. Changes in bottom topography due to sand mining activities in the lake was supposed to be one of the influencing factors of these changes. In response to this issue, the current study analyzed the change of lake bottom topography from observed digital elevation model (DEM) data, and quantitatively assessed the spatial and temporal responses of lake hydrology based on the framework of the neural network and the sediment effect was examined afterward. Results showed a total volume of 11.54 x 10(8) m(3)/year (about 0.96 x 10(8) m(3)/year or 1.58 x 10(8) t/year sediment) in net change of lake bottom topography in recent years, among which 97% was directly exported by commercial sand mining. During the study period, 2000-2011, intensive sand mining extended the central part of Poyang Lake and widened and deepened the outflow channel of the northern lake. This great change of lake bottom topography caused an average annual increase of 182.74 m(3)/s of lake outflow and a decline of 0.23 m-0.61 m in water levels across the lake. However, lake water levels are not consistent and show remarkable spatial and seasonal differences. The effects of changes in lake bottom topography on lake hydrological processes continue to grow as sand mining activities in the lake continue. More research on the environmental impacts is required for sustainable management of the lake ecosystem.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR) at the Earth's surface drives evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and other physical and biological processes. The primary objective of this study is to estimate NSSR in all sky conditions by using narrowband data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the AQUA satellite. The random forest (RF) machine learning method for retrieving NSSR was developed with MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission model (MODTRAN 5) simulated data. The bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and R-2 for the training dataset of the model are 0.04 W m(-2), 2.03 W m(-2), and 1.00, respectively; for testing data, these values are 0.53 W m(-2), 5.50 W m(-2), and 1.00, respectively. Note that the proposed method is better than the traditional method (RMSE 7.29 W m(-2)) with MODTRAN data, and the sky conditions (clear and cloudy) do not need to be distinguished in the RF method. Seven in situ measurements of the Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) observation network were used to validate the estimated NSSR with MODIS/AQUA data using the proposed RF method, and the bias, RMSE, and R2 of the comparison are -8.4 W m(-2), 76.8 W m(-2), and 0.91, respectively. Approximately 70% of the absolute difference of all the samples is below 50 W m(-2). Considering its concise process and relatively improved accuracy, both in regard to model development and validation, it can be concluded that the retrieval of NSSR with RF will be an efficient and feasible method in the future.

TI  - Spatial variation of correlations between vertical soil water and evapotranspiration and their controlling factors in a semi-arid region
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A decrease in soil water content (SWC) has been observed at the global scale and has led to a reduction in evapotranspiration (ET). However, the trend in SWC in eastern Asia differed from the global trend, and this may be due to the overlapping of warm/wet seasons. Because of the limitation of deep soil water content data, especially in drylands, changes in SWC and the correlation between SWC (particularly deep SWC) and ET remain poorly understood. In this study, spatial distribution of correlation coefficient (r) between SWC and ET were calculated based on reanalysis data and remote sensing data, which were validated by in situ data (2004-2005) and sampling data (2016-2017). Firstly, the correlation between SWC and ET decreased with soil depth. The depth of the sharp decrease was 10 cm based on in situ monitoring data (2005-2008) and spatial sampling data (2016-2017). Secondly, the spatial correlation between SWC and ET varied with different vegetation cover types. The correlation increased from the western typical steppe to the eastern forest. The highest values of r were in a forest-covered area, because it had the highest water uptake capacity. However, the difference between r_10 and r_100 (D_r) showed a different spatial pattern, and the lowest negative D_r value was obtained from a forest-grass transition zone in which the enhanced vegetation index showed a significant increasing trend. The significant negative regression determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.9, p < 0.01) between B_(EVI) (0-0.1) and D_r indicated that the narrowed D_r in the transition zone was due to the vegetation increase. This meant that more deep soil water was taken up into the atmosphere. Thus, the deep SWC could become unstable and deep soil could become drier, which would be unsustainable for the ecosystem.

TI  - Remote-sensing Based Assessment of Long-term Riparian Vegetation Health in Proximity to Agricultural Lands with Herbicide Use History
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian ecosystems provide various ecosystem services including habitat for a variety of plant and animal communities, biofiltering, and stabilizing stream and river systems. Due to their location, riparian zones often share long borders with agricultural fields where herbicides are commonly applied to eliminate unwanted plants. There is a general concern that exposure of riparian vegetation to off-target drifted herbicides may adversely impact their health and diversity. We utilized the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the long-term (between 1992 and 2011) trend of riparian vegetation health at 17 locations in the Midwest and Great Plains areas of the United States, where herbicide usage was likely most intense. Assessment of NDVI data demonstrated that long-term vegetation health did not decline for the studied riparian zones located in proximity to croplands during spring months (April and May). During summer (June and July), while the long-term vegetation health did not decline for the majority of the sites, there were a few cases in Kansas and Nebraska with a decline in vegetation health (negative-trending NDVI). Cluster analysis of the negative-trending NDVI pixels showed that the majority of these pixels were randomly distributed throughout these riparian sites, indicating a lack of shared common causing factors. Similarly, proximity analysis suggested that distance from croplands was not associated with the decline of vegetation health found in these sites, suggesting that exposure to herbicide drift may not be a plausible factor because this would have shown higher impact on pixels closer to the cropland. Changes in canopy coverage and vegetation diversity also did not show any dependence on distance from croplands. Finally, the remote-sensing-based NDVI data sets used provide only an indirect way of assessing the impact of herbicide drift, and therefore, further work based on field survey data is recommended to completely isolate the impacts of herbicides.

TI  - Locality preserving fusion of multi-source images for sea-ice classification
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel sea-ice classification framework based on locality preserving fusion of multi-source images information. The locality preserving fusion arises from two-fold, i.e., the local characterization in both spatial and feature domains. We commence by simultaneously learning a projection matrix, which preserves spatial localities, and a similarity matrix, which encodes feature similarities. We map the pixels of multi-source images by the projection matrix to a set fusion vectors that preserve spatial localities of the image. On the other hand, by applying the Laplacian eigen-decomposition to the similarity matrix, we obtain another set of fusion vectors that preserve the feature local similarities. We concatenate the fusion vectors for both spatial and feature locality preservation and obtain the fusion image. Finally, we classify the fusion image pixels by a novel sliding ensemble strategy, which enhances the locality preservation in classification. Our locality preserving fusion framework is effective in classifying multi-source sea-ice images (e.g., multi-spectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images) because it not only comprehensively captures the spatial neighboring relationships but also intrinsically characterizes the feature associations between different types of sea-ices. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our framework.

TI  - Assessment of CALIOP and MODIS aerosol products over Iran to explore air quality
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring air quality is crucial for Middle East countries such as Iran, where dust and polluted aerosol sources heavily influence local air quality. The use of active satellite remote sensing techniques is therefore considered in monitoring air quality. This study presents an initial assessment of NASA's Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol data over Tabriz and Mashhad cities in the north-western and north-eastern regions of Iran. We examined the Cloud and Aerosol Discrimination (CAD) score values, extinction coefficient, and the CALIOP Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) data product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue Aerosol Optical Depth (DBOD) at wavelength of 0.55 mu m. The ground-based PM10 measurements were analyzed for different time periods, seasons, and years from 2005 to 2016. We investigated the profiles of the particle backscatter and extinction coefficient, as well as information about the determined feature types (e.g., clouds or aerosols) and aerosol subtypes (e.g., dust, and smoke) from the VFM data product in 2months of August 2009 and July 2013, which were statistically selected from 2009 to 2016. Evaluation of the comparison of the relative humidity, temperature, and their inversion shows that the performance of the CALIOP in the detection of aerosols in mid-troposphere (around 5.0km) is better than cloud detection. Additionally, the correlations of the PM10 concentration, MODIS AOD, and MODIS DBOD were investigated for January 2005 to December 2014. The overall analyses show that monthly ground-based PM10 concentration measurements reveal better correlation (r=0.65 and 0.67 for Tabriz and Mashhad, respectively) with monthly MODIS-DBOD than MODIS-AOD for different seasons. The observed differences in the investigation of the CALIPSO dataset with the actual measured values and the overall correlation results show that the cloud and aerosol discrimination algorithm should be modified and calibrated based on local measurements of relative humidity, temperature, and their inversions, MODIS-DBOD, and ground-based PM10 for the Iran region.

TI  - Fusion of Change Vector Analysis in Posterior Probability Space and Postclassification Comparison for Change Detection from Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Postclassification Comparison (PCC) has been widely used as a change-detection method. The PCC algorithm is straightforward and easily applicable to all satellite images, regardless of whether they are acquired from the same sensor or in the same environmental conditions. However, PCC is prone to cumulative error, which results from classification errors. Alternatively, Change Vector Analysis in Posterior Probability Space (CVAPS), which interprets change based on comparing the posterior probability vectors of a pixel, can alleviate the classification error accumulation present in PCC. CVAPS identifies the type of change based on the direction of a change vector. However, a change vector can be translated to a new position within the feature space; consequently, it is not inconceivable that identical measures of direction may be used by CVAPS to describe multiple types of change. Our proposed method identifies land-cover transitions by using a fusion of CVAPS and PCC. In the proposed algorithm, contrary to CVAPS, a threshold does not need to be specified in order to extract change. Moreover, the proposed method uses a Random Forest as a trainable fusion method in order to obtain a change map directly in a feature space which is obtained from CVAPS and PCC. In other words, there is no need to specify a threshold to obtain a change map through the CVAPS method and then combine it with the change map obtained from the PCC method. This is an advantage over other change-detection methods focused on fusing multiple change-detection approaches. In addition, the proposed method identifies different types of land-cover transitions, based on the fusion of CVAPS and PCC, to improve the results of change-type determination. The proposed method is applied to images acquired by Landsat and Quickbird. The resultant maps confirm the utility of the proposed method as a change-detection/labeling tool. For example, the new method has an overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient relative improvement of 7% and 9%, respectively, on average, over CVAPS and PCC in determining different types of change.

TI  - Icebergs in Sea Ice With TanDEM-X Interferometry
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the advantages of using an interferometric method for detecting and characterizing icebergs in sea ice were demonstrated. Iceberg topography was analyzed using single-pass TanDEM-X interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. Multiple InSAR data sets in bistatic mode were acquired over icebergs in sea ice in the Arctic region. InSAR processing was used to extract 3-D elevation information of the sea ice surface. The results firmly demonstrate the capability of TanDEM-X data to characterize the shape of icebergs. Very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite data were collected by Pleiades 1A over the same area to derive digital elevation models (DEMs) of ice features for validation. The accuracy of the extracted topography over icebergs was evaluated by comparing InSAR and optical DEMs. The quantitative comparison demonstrated good correspondence between InSAR and optical DEMs with root-mean-square value values of 2.2 m for icebergs and 0.6 m for sea ice, respectively. Using DEMs derived from VHR optical imagery, it was possible to calculate receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for detecting icebergs in sea using InSAR. The resulting ROC analysis illustrates a good detection performance.

TI  - Identifying local actors of deforestation and forest degradation in the Kalasha valleys of Pakistan
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prevention of forest loss is a high priority in Pakistan, where catastrophic flooding in 1992 and 2010 has been linked to deforestation. Under the United Nation's REDD+ program, new incentive schemes are developed to encourage forest protection and reforestation, while implementing social safeguards for forest-dependent indigenous groups. The objective of this study is to support Pakistan's REDD+ readiness activities that affect the Kalasha, a unique indigenous people that are nominated for enhanced protection of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list. We aim to identify actors and power structures that have caused deforestation in the past, and recommend policy improvements that protect forests as well as the Kalasha's culture and traditional livelihoods. A remote-sensing based historical analysis showed that government actors have significant power to influence land use practices in the region, although their policy instruments may not have had the intended effects. A logging ban in 1993 could not stop forest loss and instead caused a shift to illegal selective cutting of the same magnitude. Near human habitation, forest loss actually increased after the ban. In household surveys, self-reported clearing of forests conformed to remote sensing data, and fuel wood use was identified as the primary pressure on forest resources. Results from expert interviews, however, revealed contradictory perceptions regarding the actors responsible for forest loss. Both local residents and government officials hold the other side as primarily responsible, while rationalizing their own contribution. We recommend policy changes towards more balanced power structure in joint forest management committees. In addition, alternative heating methods would remove the currently largest pressure on forest extraction for fuelwood. Since fuelwood production for regional consumption constitutes one of the largest sources of income for the poorest households, REDD-based compensation schemes would have to support the most affected households of the indigenous Kalasha.

TI  - A Model-Oriented System for Operational Forecasting of River Floods
T2  - HERALD OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article gives the results of developing and testing a system for operational river flood forecasting, which is based on a system of hydrological and hydrodynamic models, as well as ground-observation and satellite data. This system is implemented on the basis of service-oriented architecture. A specific feature of the system is fully automated implementation of the entire modeling cycle-from loading input data to interpreting and visualizing the results and alerting the interested parties. The theoretical basis for coherent functioning of all system components is the qualimetry of models and polymodel complexes developed by the authors. The practical implementation is based on open codes and freeware. The results of testing demonstrate the potential for a wide introduction of such systems in the activities of territorial authorities and emergency services.

TI  - Prediction of machining performance using RSM and ANN models in hard turning of martensitic stainless steel AISI 420
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this experimental work is to study the impact of the machining parameters (Vc, ap, and f) on the surface roughness criteria (Ra, Rz, and Rt) as well as on the cutting force components (Fx, Fy, and Fz), during dry turning of martensitic stainless steel (AISI 420) treated at 59 hardness Rockwell cone. The machining tests were carried out using the coated mixed ceramic cutting-insert (CC6050) according to the Taguchi design (L-25). Analysis of the variance (ANOVA) as well as Pareto graphs made it possible to quantify the contributions of (Vc, ap, and f) on the output parameters. The response surface methodology and the artificial neural networks approach were used for output modeling. Finally, the optimization of the machining parameters was performed using desirability function (DF) minimizing the surface roughness and the cutting forces simultaneously. The results indicated that the roughness is strongly affected by the feed rate (f) with contributions of (80.71%, 80.26%, and 81.80%) for (Ra, Rz, and Rt) respectively, and that the depth of cut (ap) is the factor having the major influence on the cutting forces (Fx = 53.76%, Fy = 50.79%, and Fz = 65.31%). Furthermore, artificial neural network and response surface methodology models correlate very well with experimental data. However, artificial neural network models show better accuracy. The optimum machining setting for multi-objective optimization is Vc = 80 m/min, f = 0.08 mm/rev and ap = 0.141 mm.

TI  - Changes in quantity, quality, and pattern of farmland in a rapidly developing region of China: a case study of the Ningbo region
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of the quantity, quality, and pattern of farmlands are important to adequately understand the changing trajectories of farmlands, and the effectiveness of farmland protection policies in rapidly developing China. In this study, an integrated approach incorporating remote sensing images, random forest (RF) classification, geographic information system (GIS), digital elevation model (DEM), land quality score (SQ), and landscape pattern indices was applied to analyze the features of farmland use change in China, taking the Ningbo region as an example. RF classification was chosen to extract farmland use information from Landsat images; GIS and DEM were applied to quantify changes in farmland areas and their spatial variations; SQ and landscape pattern indices were used to detect changes in farmland quality and pattern. The results showed a trend of decrease followed by increase in farmland quantity, a continuously decreasing trend in farmland quality, and continuously increasing trends in both farmland fragmentation and dispersion in the Ningbo region. Besides, there was also a distinct trend of farmland advancing upwards into hills with slopes larger than 6 degrees and elevations higher than 20m. Farmland protection policies, represented by the overall land use plans of Ningbo, proved to be effective in protection of only farmland quantity, rather than quality and pattern. Suggestions were given for the optimization of farmland protection policies by considering not only quantity and quality but also the farmland pattern in China.

TI  - Correlation of Conventional Ultrasound Characteristics of Breast Tumors With Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis and Ki-67 Expression in Patients With Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To explore the association between the ultrasound (US) characteristics of breast tumors with axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) and Ki-67 expression in patients with breast cancer. Methods In total, 527 consecutive patients with breast cancer who had undergone US examinations and curative surgery with axillary lymph node evaluations were included. The size, shape, aspect ratio, margin, internal echo, internal calcification, posterior echo attenuation, lymphatic hilar structure, cortical thickness, and blood flow of the axillary lymph nodes or primary breast lesions were observed with conventional US. Pathologic prognostic factors, including the histologic type of the tumor, histologic grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, lymph node status, and Ki-67 expression were determined. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate whether the US characteristics of primary breast lesions were associated with ALNM and Ki-67 expression. Results The maximum tumor diameter (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.27; P = .028), tumor margin (OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.69-4.94; P < .001), internal echo (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.47-3.20; P < .001), and Ki-67 status (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 2.29-5.58; P < .001) had significant value as independent predictors of ALNM. Only the internal echo (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.28-2.95; P = .002) of breast cancer was an independent predictor of the Ki-67 status. The heterogeneity in the internal echo indicated faster cancer cell proliferation and was associated with a worse prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma. Conclusions Certain conventional US characteristics may be useful predictors of ALNM and the Ki-67 status in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Double-Rice System Simulation in a Topographically Diverse Region-A Remote-Sensing-Driven Case Study in Hunan Province of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have focused on the potential impacts of topography on regional crop simulation, which might constrain the development of crop models and lead to inaccurate estimations for food security. In this study, we used remote sensing data to calibrate a regional crop model (MCWLA-Rice) for yield simulation in a double-rice crop rotation system in counties of Hunan province dominated by three landforms (plain, hill, and mountain). The calibration scheme with coarse remote sensing data (Global LAnd Surface Satellite, GLASS) greatly improved model accuracy for the double-rice system and is a promising method for yield estimation in large areas. The average improvement in relative root mean square error (RRMSE) was at most 48.00% for early rice and 41.25% for late rice. The average improvement in coefficient of determination (R-2) value was at most 0.54 for early rice and 0.19 for late rice. Estimation of yield in counties dominated by different landform types indicated that: (1) MCWLA-Rice tended to be unstable in areas of complex topography and resulted in unbalanced proportions of overestimations and underestimations. (2) Differences in yield simulation between early rice and late rice varied among counties; yield estimates were highest in predominantly hilly counties, followed by counties dominated by plains, and lowest in predominantly mountainous counties. The results indicated that the topography might harm the accuracy of crop model simulations. Integration of topographic factors into crop models may enable yield estimation with enhanced accuracy to promote social development.

TI  - A Method Based on Temporal Component Decomposition for Estimating 1-km All-Weather Land Surface Temperature by Merging Satellite Thermal Infrared and Passive Microwave Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable at the land-atmosphere boundary. For many research projects and applications an all-weather LST product at moderate spatial resolution (e.g., 1 km) would be highly useful, especially in frequently cloudy areas. Merging thermal infrared (TIR) and microwave (MW) observations is able to overcome shortcomings of single-source remote sensing to derive such an LST. However, in current merging methods, models adopted for downscaling MW LST fail to quantify the effect of temporal variation of LST. Thus, accuracy of the merged LST can be deteriorated and therefore remain a major impediment for these methods to he generalized over large areas. In this context, we propose a new practical method to merge TIR and MW observations from a perspective of decomposition of LST in temporal dimension. The physical basis of the method is decomposing LST into three temporal components: annual temperature cycle component, diurnal temperature cycle component prescribed by solar geometry, and weather temperature component driven by weather change. The method was applied to MODIS and AMSR-E/AMSR2 data to generate an 11-year record of 1-km all-weather LST over Northeast China: the resulting merged LST has an accuracy of 1.29-1.71 K when validated against in situ LST; besides, no obvious differences in accuracy of the merged LST were found between clear-sky and unclear-sky conditions. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms the previous method in both accuracy and image quality, indicating its good capability to generate daily 1-km all-weather LST, which will benefit continuous monitoring of earth's surface temperature.

TI  - An Operational Approach for Generating the Global Land Surface Downward Shortwave Radiation Product From MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface shortwave net radiation (SSNR) and surface downward shortwave radiation (DSR) are the two surface shortwave radiation components in earth's radiation budget and the fundamental quantities of energy available at the earth's surface. Although several global radiation products from global circulation models, global reanalyses, and satellite observations have been released, their coarse spatial resolutions and low accuracies limit their application. In this paper, the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) DSR product was generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral reflectance based on a direct-estimation method. First, the TOA reflectances were derived based on the atmospheric radiative transfer simulations under different solar/view geometries; second, a linear regression relationship between the TOA reflectance and SSNR was developed under various atmospheric conditions and surface properties for different solar/view geometries; third, the coefficients derived from the linear regression were used to compute the SSNR; and finally, the DSR was estimated using the SSNR estimates and broadband albedo at the surface. A 13-year (2003-2015) GLASS DSR product was generated at a 5-km spatial resolution and 1-day temporal resolution. Compared with the ground measurements collected from 525 stations from 2003 to 2005 around the world, the model-computed SSNR (DSR) had an overall bias of 8.82 (3.72) W/m(2) and a root mean square error of 28.83 (32.84) W/m(2) at the daily time scale. Moreover, the global land annual mean of the DSR was determined to be 184.8 W/m(2) with a standard deviation of 0.8 W/m(2) over a 13-year (2003-2015) period.

TI  - An Entropy and MRF Model-Based CNN for Large-Scale Landsat Image Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale Landsat image classification is essential for the production of land cover maps. The rise of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provides a new idea for the implementation of Landsat image classification. However, pixels in Landsat images have higher uncertainty compared with high-resolution images due to its 30-m spatial resolution. In addition, the current deep learning methods tend to lase detailed information such as boundaries along with the stacking of convolutional and pooling layers. To solve these problems, we propose a new method called entropy and MRF model (EMM)-CNN based on Pyramid Scene Parsing Network. The EMM-CNN uses entropy to decrease the uncertainty of pixels. Then, the Markov random filed (MRF) model is employed to construct the connections between neighboring pixels and defined a prior distribution to prevent the cross entropy from sacrificing detailed information for the overall accuracy. Finally, transfer learning based on the pretrained ImageNet is introduced to overcome the shortage of training samples and boost the speed of the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EMM-CNN is able to obtain classification results with fine structure by decreasing the uncertainty and retaining detailed information of the detected image.

TI  - A numerical study of island wakes in the Xisha Archipelago associated with mesoscale eddies in the spring
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddies caused by island wakes often appear downstream of an island where upwelling currents are coupled with nutrient transport. Several island wake eddies downstream of the Yongle atoll (YA), Huaguang Reef (HR) and Yuzhuo Reef (YR) in the Xisha Archipelago (XA) are found based on SAR and GF-1 satellite images taken on April 14, 2009 and May 30, 2014, respectively. The present study aims to explore the features and mechanisms of spring island wakes based on a high-resolution numerical model as well as satellite data. Our results are: 1) The cyclonic wake eddies (CWEs) are surface-intensified, and introduce a 20 - 40 m uplift of the isopycnal for the most intense eddies; While the anticyclonic wake eddies (AWEs) reach a subsurface maximum at a depth of 25 - 50 m, which leads to the weak isopycnal downwelling. The CWEs are generally more abundant than the AWEs in different radius classes under different incoming flows, which is due to the inertial-centrifugal instability (ICI) of the AWEs. 2) In the XA, lower SST features observed in the downstream side of the reefs demonstrate the presence of current-induced island wakes. In the near wakes of YA, HR and YR, the periodic vorticity generation is mainly caused by shear flow instabilities arising from the side boundaries of the reefs. Anticyclonic vorticity generation is slightly larger than that of the cyclonic for these three reefs. 3) For the submesoscale wake dynamics, the barotropic instability is more significant than the baroclinic in the XA. Strong toroidal vortices of alternating sign, which strongly perturb the density, were observed as the existence of the ICI in the transects of an unstable intense AWE. But these could hardly be found in a weak AWE. The unstable AWEs may have a larger decay of the velocity at their eddy edges and large persistent vorticities at their cores, which lead to an increase of the ratio between the core vorticity and the Rossby number Gamma. While stable AWEs have longer lifetimes with nearly constant Gamma values that are similar to those of the stable CWEs.

TI  - Revegetation has increased ecosystem water-use efficiency during 2000-2014 in the Chinese Loess Plateau: Evidence from satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation coverage has been effectively increased across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) mainly because of the implementation of large-scale revegetation programs. Understanding the entire CLP's ecosystem carbon-water relationship and its response to the vegetation coverage increase and climate change is essential for the water resources management in this semi-humid to arid region. Water-use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) over evapotranspiration (ET), is an important indicator linking carbon and water cycles at the ecosystem scale. In this study, the spatial and temporal variations in the ecosystem WUE were analyzed to investigate the responses of WUE variation to regional climate and vegetation coverage changes in the CLP using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets of GPP and ET from 2000 to 2014. Results indicate that the spatial pattern of annual WUE was different from that of WUE over active growing season (AGS), generally with higher annual WUE but lower AGS-WUE for the semi-humid southeastern CLP areas. Significant increases were observed in annual and autumn WUE during the study period at both the per-pixel and spatial-average levels, while AGS-WUE, spring WUE, and summer WUE remained quite stable. Correlations between WUE trends and interannual variability of vegetation coverage (expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI), precipitation (P), and air temperature (T-a) showed that WUE trends were positively correlated with NDVI variation due to faster increases in GPP as compared to ET caused by enhanced NDVI. Precipitation variation was generally negatively correlated to WUE variation by contributing to faster increases in ET than GPP especially at different seasons. The positive correlations between interannual variability of WUE and T-a were subject to negative feedbacks between ET and T-a. Similar results were also found using net primary productivity (NPP) to calculate ecosystem annual WUE (i.e., NPP/ET). Our findings suggest that revegetation-induced vegetation coverage change rather than P and T-a changes is the primary cause for the increasing ecosystem annual WUE in the CLP. This study contributes to our enhanced understanding of the coupled carbon-water dynamics over regional terrestrial ecosystem under climate and vegetation coverage changes.

TI  - Effects of lymphadenectomy among women with stage IA endometrial cancer: a SEER database analysis
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To determine whether lymphadenectomy is associated with increased survival of women with stage IA endometrial cancer. Methods: Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 2004 to 2013 and whose clinicopathologic data were recorded in the SEER database were examined. Propensity matching paired subjects with similar background variables. Before and after matching, Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn for comparison. Results: In 11,603 patients, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most common causes of death. Before matching, lymphadenectomy significantly improved the overall survival of stage IA/grade 3-4 patients (p=0.013), but after matching, lymphadenectomy did not prolong survival for any grade. Sentinel lymph nodes biopsy can reduce the number of resected lymph nodes (p=8.387e-10 in Wilcox test) but can't prolong survival. Conclusion: After matching, no significant difference in survival between lymphadenectomy and nonlymphadenectomy was observed for stage IA patients, sentinel lymph nodes group had fewer lymph node removed, but didn't affect survival.

This research was carried out on a four-lane highway (the Guilin-Guiyang highway, G76) and a two-lane high-speed railway (the Guilin-Guiyang high-speed railway, GGHSR) in karst areas in Guizhou and Guangxi provinces. The highway and high-speed railway were constructed in the 2010s and covered by Landsat images whose multispectral information could be used for research purposes. In this study, the severity of the impact and the CO2 emissions from the G76 and GGHSR construction were evaluated. Landsat images and field meteorological measurements were applied to calculate the surface functional parameters (surface temperature and surface wetness) and heat fluxes (latent, sensible and ground heat flux) before and during the highway and high-speed railway construction; the amount of CO2 emissions during the G76 and GGHSR construction were determined by using budget sheets, which record the detail consumptions of materials and energy. The results showed that the decrease of water evaporation from the highway and high-speed railway construction can reach up to 26.4 m(3) and 20.1 m(3) per kilometer, which corresponds to an average decrease in the vegetation cooling effect of 18.0 MWh per day per highway kilometer and 13.7 MWh per day per high-speed railway kilometer, respectively. At the meantime, the average CO2 emission densities from the G76 and GGHSR construction can reach up to 24813.7 and 36921.1 t/km, respectively. This study implied that extensive line constructions have a significant impact on the local climate and the energy balance, and it is evident that selecting and planting appropriate plant species can compensate for the adverse effects of line constructions in karst mountain regions.

TI  - Effects of Progressive Upper Limb Exercises and Muscle Relaxation Training on Upper Limb Function and Health-Related Quality of Life Following Surgery in Women with Breast Cancer: A Clinical Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of progressive upper limb exercises and muscle relaxation training (PULE-MRT) on upper limb function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) following surgery in Chinese mainland women with breast cancer (BC).Methods. Overall, 102 patients following surgery (i.e. mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, with sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n=51) or control (n=51) groups. The former received PULE-MRT plus routine nursing care, whereas the latter received only routine nursing care for 6months. Upper limb function and HRQoL were measured at baseline and 1, 3, and 6months using Constant-Murley scores (CMS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast version 4.0 (FACT-Bv4.0), respectively.Results. All patients in the intervention group completed the exercises and training, with 100% compliance and no adverse events. The intervention group had significantly higher total CMS and FACT-Bv4.0 scores at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up than the control group. The significant effects in total CMS comparisons were group (F=25.30, p<0.001), time (F=18.02, p<0.001), and group-by-time interaction (F=9.95, p<0.001), and, in FACT-Bv4.0, total score comparisons were group (F=15.87, p<0.001), time (F=17.92, p<0.001), and group-by-time interaction (F=7.88, p<0.001). Similar results were observed for the scale scores of CMS and FACT-Bv4.0.Conclusions. PULE-MRT had positive effects on improving upper limb function and HRQoL following surgery in women with BC and could be used as an optional rehabilitation management strategy in post-surgery BC patient populations.

TI  - DCN-Based Spatial Features for Improving Parcel-Based Crop Classification Using High-Resolution Optical Images and Multi-Temporal SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial features retrieved from satellite data play an important role for improving crop classification. In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method to extract and organize spatial features to improve parcel-based crop classification using high-resolution optical images and multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Central to this method is the use of multiple deep convolutional networks (DCNs) to extract spatial features and to use the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to organize spatial features. First, a precise farmland parcel map was delineated from optical images. Second, hundreds of spatial features were retrieved using multiple DCNs from preprocessed SAR images and overlaid onto the parcel map to construct multivariate time-series of crop growth for parcels. Third, LSTM-based network structures for organizing these time-series features were constructed to produce a final parcel-based classification map. The method was applied to a dataset of high-resolution ZY-3 optical images and multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data to classify crop types in the Hunan Province of China. The classification results, showing an improvement of greater than 5.0% in overall accuracy relative to methods without spatial features, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting and organizing spatial features for improving parcel-based crop classification.

TI  - Understanding an urbanizing planet: Strategic directions for remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific contributions from remote sensing over the last fifty years have significantly advanced our understanding of urban areas. Key contributions of urban remote sensing include but are not limited to characterization of urban areas, urban land cover changes and thermal remote sensing of urban climates. Today, the proliferation of new sensors, long time series of the satellite record, joint analysis of Earth observation data with ancillary data sets, widespread availability of high-performance computing facilities, and slow but increasing use of remote sensing data and methods in non-remote sensing fields together offer new opportunities to generate scientific knowledge for an urbanizing planet. Simultaneously, the scale and pace of contemporary urbanization require new information about urban areas from both the science and policy communities. This paper examines remote sensing contributions to the scientific understanding of urban areas over the last 50 years until today. Based on this assessment and current needs by user communities, we identify four strategic directions for future urban remote sensing research: high temporal frequency analysis, characterization of urban heterogeneity, characterization of urban form and structure in two and three dimensions, and linking remote sensing with emerging urban data. Advances in these four areas are likely to generate significant new insights that will be useful to both science and policy.

TI  - Assimilating Soil Moisture Retrieved from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data into WOFOST Model to Improve Winter Wheat Yield Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation at a regional scale over a long period of time is of great significance to food security. In past decades, the integration of remote sensing observations and crop growth models has been recognized as a promising approach for crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. Optical remote sensing data are susceptible to cloud and rain, while synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can penetrate through clouds and has all-weather capabilities. This allows for more reliable and consistent crop monitoring and yield estimation in terms of radar sensor data. The aim of this study is to improve the accuracy for winter wheat yield estimation by assimilating time series soil moisture images, which are retrieved by a water cloud model using SAR and optical data as input, into the crop model. In this study, SAR images were acquired by C-band SAR sensors boarded on Sentinel-1 satellites and optical images were obtained from a Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) for Hengshui city of Hebei province in China. Remote sensing data and ground data were all collected during the main growing season of winter wheat. Both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), derived from Sentinel-2, and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators, computed from Sentinel-1, were used in the water cloud model to derive time series soil moisture (SM) images. To improve the prediction of crop yields at the field scale, we incorporated remotely sensed soil moisture into the World Food Studies (WOFOST) model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm. In general, the trend of soil moisture inversion was consistent with the ground measurements, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) equal to 0.45, 0.53, and 0.49, respectively, and RMSE was 9.16%, 7.43%, and 8.53%, respectively, for three observation dates. The winter wheat yield estimation results showed that the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R-2 = 0.35; RMSE =934 kg/ha) compared to the situation without data assimilation (R-2 = 0.21; RMSE = 1330 kg/ha). Consequently, the results of this study demonstrated the potential and usefulness of assimilating SM retrieved from both Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI optical remote sensing data into WOFOST model for winter wheat yield estimation and could also provide a reference for crop yield estimation with data assimilation for other crop types.

TI  - Connectivity in coastal systems: Barrier island vegetation influences upland migration in a changing climate
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to their position at the land-sea interface, barrier islands are vulnerable to both oceanic and atmospheric climate change-related drivers. In response to relative sealevel rise, barrier islands tend to migrate landward via overwash processes which deposit sediment onto the backbarrier marsh, thus maintaining elevation above sea level. In this paper, we assess the importance of interior upland vegetation and sediment transport (from upland to marsh) on the movement of the marsh-upland boundary in a transgressive barrier system along the mid-Atlantic Coast. We hypothesize that recent woody expansion is altering the rate of marsh to upland conversion. Using Landsat imagery over a 32 year time period (1984-2016), we quantify transitions between land cover (bare, grassland, woody vegetation, and marsh) and the marsh-upland boundary. We find that the Virginia Barrier Islands have both gains and losses in backbarrier marsh and upland, with 19% net loss from the system during the timeframe of the study and increased variance in marsh to upland conversion. This is consistent with recent work indicating a shift toward increasing rates of landward barrier island migration. Despite a net loss of upland area, macroclimatic winter warming resulted in 41% increase in woody vegetation in protected, low-elevation areas, introducing new ecological scenarios that increase resistance to sediment movement from upland to marsh. Our analysis demonstrates how the interplay between elevation and interior island vegetative cover influences landward migration of the boundary between upland and marsh (a previously underappreciated indicator that an island is migrating), and thus, the importance of including ecological processes in the island interior into coastal modeling of barrier island migration and sediment movement across the barrier landscape.

TI  - Use of satellite data for land surface radiative parameters retrieval of Bucharest metropolitan zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to investigate the influences of urban growth and green land cover decrease on land surface radiative properties and metropolitan climate of Bucharest in Romania. Landsat TM/ETM+/8 OLI and time series MODIS Terra/Aqua and NOAA AVHRR satellite data have been used to assess urban land cover-thermal environment over 2000-2018 years. As the city climate system is very sensitive to air and land surface temperature, land surface albedo, NDVI/EVI vegetation index, latent heat flux, these variables could have a significantly feedback to the projected climate change. The results show that the satellite-inferred radiative parameters agree well with the field-observations.

TI  - The adaptations to tube-dwelling life of <i>Propsilocerus akamusi</i> (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae and its eutrophication-tolerant mechanisms
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Propsilocerus akamusi (Diptera: Chironomidae) is a dominant macroinvertebrate species in many eutrophic lakes in subtropical and temperate zones. P. akamusi larvae can migrate deep into the sediment (> 30 cm) during summer where is no oxygen. However, to our knowledge, the specific adaptive tactics of its tube-dwelling life (> 30 cm) and underlying mechanisms why this species is favored by nutrient-rich lakes remain limited. With the understanding above-mentioned issues, we can provide important information for the development of sensitive biomonitoring. We examined monthly morphological dynamics and physiological adaptations of P. akamusi to anoxic conditions, and environmental relationships of the species abundance in a subtropical eutrophic lake. Results of our experiments indicated that this species presented extremely low fuel consumption at a state of estivation when the larvae dwelt in deep sediment, and conducted anaerobic respiration, with ethanol as a major metabolite, to withstand long term anoxic conditions. Additionally, in our field study, the abundance of P. akamusi correlated positively with most nutrient-related variables, indicating that this species can serve as sentinel organisms of nutrient enrichment. We suggest that the high tolerance to anoxia and detritivorous diet of P. akamusi larvae may allow the species to benefit from nutrient enrichment. The vertical niche differentiation and the avoidance of benthivorous predator by vertical sediment migration behavior may also contribute to its high dominance in eutrophic freshwaters.

TI  - Fine-Scale SAR Soil Moisture Estimation in the Subarctic Tundra
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the subarctic tundra, soil moisture information can benefit permafrost monitoring and ecological studies, but fine-scale remote-sensing approaches are lacking. We explore the suitability of C-band SAR, paying attention to two challenges soil moisture retrieval faces. First, the microtopography and the heterogeneous organic soils impart unique microwave scattering properties, even in absence of noteworthy shrub cover. Empirically, we find the polarimetric response is highly random (entropies >0.7). The randomness limits the applicability of purely polarimetric approaches to soil moisture estimation, as it causes a tailor-made decomposition to break down. For comparison, the L-band scattering response is more surfacelike, also in terms of its angular characteristics. The second challenge concerns the large spatial but small temporal variability of soil moisture observed at our site. Accordingly, the Radarsat-2 C-band backscatter has a limited dynamic range (similar to 2 dB). However, contrary to polarimetric indicators, it shows a clear surface soil moisture signal. To account for the small dynamic range while retaining a 100-m spatial resolution, we embed an empirical time-series model in a Bayesian framework. This framework adaptively pools information from neighboring grid cells, thus increasing the precision. The retrieved soil moisture index achieves correlations of 0.3-0.5 with in situ data at 5 cm depth and, upon calibration, root-mean-square errors of <0.04 m(3) m(-3). As this approach is applicable to Sentinel-1 data, it can potentially provide frequent soil moisture estimates across large regions. In the long term, L-band data hold greater promise for operational retrievals.

TI  - The immune system of the freshwater zebra mussel, <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>, decrypted by proteogenomics of hemocytes and plasma compartments
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The immune system of bivalves is of great interest since it reflects the health status of these organisms during stressful conditions. While immune molecular responses are well documented for marine bivalves, few information is available for continental bivalves such as the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha. A proteogenomic approach was conducted on both hemocytes and plasma to identified immune proteins of this non-model species. Combining transcriptomic sequences with mass spectrometry data acquired on proteins is a relevant strategy since 3020 proteins were identified, representing the largest protein inventory for this sentinel organism. Functional annotation and gene ontology (GO) analysis performed on the identified proteins described the main molecular players of hemocytes and plasma in immunity. GO analysis highlights the complementary immune functions of these two compartments in the management of micro-organisms. Functional annotation revealed new mechanisms in the immune defence of the zebra mussel. Proteins rarely observed in the hemolymph of bivalves were pinpointed such as natterin-like and thaumatin-like proteins. Furthermore, the high abundance of complement-related proteins observed in plasma suggested a strong implication of the complement system in the immune defence of D. polymorpha. This work brings a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in zebra mussel immunity.Significance: Although the molecular mechanisms of marine bivalves are widely investigated, lithe information is known for continental bivalves. Moreover, few proteomic studies described the complementarity of both hemolymphatic compartments (cellular and plasmatic) in the immune defence of invertebrates. The recent proteogenomics concept made it possible to discover proteins in non-model organisms. Here, we propose a proteogenomic strategy with the zebra mussel, a key sentinel species for biomonitoring of freshwater, to identify and describe the molecular actors involved in the immune system in both hemocytes and plasma compartments. More widely, this study provided new insight into bivalve immunity.

TI  - Grounding Twenty-first-Century Public Relations Praxis in Aristotelian E<i>thos</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC RELATIONS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - By grounding public relations praxis in Aristotelian ethos, practitioners can function as liaison officers with balanced perspectives, capable of co-creating meaning with both client organizations and their publics between whom experts are hired to facilitate mutually beneficial relationships. This approach locates persuasion at the nexus of speaker ethos in the public relations process. It allows practitioners to balance their commitment to the ethics of their profession with loyalty to clients, while empowering audiences (organizations and their publics) to function as the final arbiters of any courses of action proposed to them. Moreover, because the approach enables practitioners, based on their credible ethos, to participate in organizational decision-making, it has the potential to transfer their ethical worldview to client organizations. Ultimately, the central theoretical contribution of this essay is an alternative approach to public relations praxis founded on an analysis of Aristotle's notion of phronesis, arete, and eunoia.

TI  - Drivers of forest change in Hoa Binh, Vietnam in the context of integration and globalization
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study identified spatial patterns of forest change in Hoa Binh, Vietnam, from 2005 to 2017 by integrating Landsat data and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. A Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) model was adapted to analyse drivers of three types of forest change, including (i) deforestation and forest degradation, (ii) forest regrowth and (iii) plantation expansion. The results reveal that accessibility and local economic development were determinants of forest cover dynamics during the integration and globalization period and that increased population pressure and poverty were no longer the main factors in forest cover transition. Several key policies in this time period positively affected forest cover change, triggering private sector participation in developing the forest economy by including households and small and medium enterprises in particular. The findings of this study can provide learning points for the implementation of sustainable forest management policies in other Vietnamese provinces or in neighbouring countries. This research has provided an effective tool for visualizing human-forest ecosystem interaction, and this tool can be applied to subsequent studies to determine causes of forest cover change at the provincial level in Vietnam.

TI  - Aerosol radiative effects from observations and modelling over the Yangtze River Basin, China from 2001 to 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a quantitative assessment of clear-sky aerosol direct radiative effects (ADREs) at the surface over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), China was conducted based on Mesoscale Atmospheric Global Irradiance Code (MAGIC) radiation code (direct method) and ground-based measurements (indirect method). For the direct method, The ADRE at the surface was calculated using MAGIC radiation code with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-INTERIM) integrated water vapour as input. Results showed that the multi-year average ADRE ranged from -39.29 to -1.95 W/m(2) with mean values of -18.19 +/- 1.44 W/m(2). High ADRE (larger than -34 W/m(2)) occurred in Sichuan Basin, Central Hubei Province and Yangtze River Delta. The seasonal ADRE was high in spring (-23.05 +/- 13.48 W/m(2)) and low in winter (-14.24 +/- 8.51 W/m(2)). Generally, an increasing trend (0.27 W/m(2) per year) of ADRE was found from 2001 to 2010 and a decreasing trend (-0.72 W/m(2) per year) from 2011 to 2015. The water vapour radiative effect (WVRE) was calculated using MAGIC radiation code and the multi-year average value was -52.59 +/- 1.45 W/m(2), which indicated the attenuation of clear-sky radiation in YRB due to water vapour was stronger than the aerosols. However, the trends of water vapour effects were 0.03 W/m(2) per year during 2001-2010 and -0.37 W/m(2) per year during 2011-2015, which were much smaller than the trends of ADRE. For the indirect method, the clear-sky ADRE at sites was calculated using the solar radiation observations. The variations of annual average ADRE obtained by above methods gave good match. An obvious increasing trend (-0.71 W/m(2) per year) of aerosol radiative cooling effect was found in Central Hubei Province from 2001 to 2010 and an obvious decreasing trend (3.23 W/m(2) per year) in Sichuan Basin from 2011 to 2015. The determination coefficient (R-2) between ADRE trends and clear-sky solar radiation trends is 0.874, indicating that the trends of clear-sky solar radiation were mainly determined by the trends of ADRE.

TI  - Trading off between control and autonomy: a narrative review around de-design
T2  - BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In this work, we provide an overview of contemporary perspectives of design that may challenge the traditional design of IT and socio-technical systems. Our starting metaphor is that of 'wicked problems', where the singularity, incompleteness and intrinsic uncertainty of real world settings foregrounds how the worldview that designers offer to practitioners may be optimal in theory but useless in practice. To go beyond traditional notions of design and designer, we intercepted insights coming from minoritarian voices in both theoretic and practice-based design fields. 'De-design' is a term we coined to encompass this wide spectrum of approaches that make more resilient and sustainable information artifact, de-emphasize design as a theoretical construct, and reconsider practice as the leading principle of digital innovation. This paper is a narrative review of voices in an extensive array of fields: from Information Systems to Human-Computer Interaction, from End-User Development to Critical Design, from Software Design to Design Studies. Our contribution retraces the motivational roots of de-design and tries to characterise de-design by filling relational gaps between disparate approaches and by bringing them back to IT and socio-technical design, to make digital artifacts sustainable in all of the new environmental, organisational and cultural spaces near to come.

TI  - Monitoring endogenous growth of open-vent volcanoes by balancing thermal and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions data derived from space
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring the amount of magma intruding in a volcano represents one of the main challenges of modern volcanology. While in closed-vent volcanoes this parameter is generally assessed by the inversion of deformation data, in open-vent volcanoes its measurement is more complicated and results from the balance between the magma entering and leaving the storage system. In this work we used thermal and SO2 flux data, derived from satellite measurements, to calculate the magma input and output rates of Mt. Etna between 2004 and 2010. We found that during the analysed period more magma was supplied than erupted, resulting into an endogenous growth rate equal to 22.9 +/- 13.7 x 10(6) m(3) y(-1). Notably, this unbalance was not constant in time, but showed phases of major magma accumulation and drainage acting within a compressible magma chamber. The excellent correlation with the inflation/deflation cycles measured by ground-based GPS network suggests the thermal, SO2 flux and deformation data, can be combined to provide a quantitative analysis of magma transport inside the shallow plumbing system of Mt Etna. Given the global coverage of satellite data and the continuous improvement of sensors in orbit, we anticipate that this approach will have sufficient detail to monitor, in real time, the endogenous growth associated to other world-wide open-vent volcanoes.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided immunofunctional photoacoustic imaging for diagnosis of lymph node metastases
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastases, rather than primary tumors, determine mortality in the majority of cancer patients. A non-invasive immunofunctional imaging method was developed to detect sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases using ultrasound-guided photoacoustic (USPA) imaging combined with glycol-chitosan-coated gold nanoparticles (GC-AuNPs) as an imaging contrast agent. GC-AuNPs, injected peritumorally into breast tumor-bearing mice, were taken up by immune cells, and subsequently transported to the SLN. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional USPA imaging was used to isolate the signal from GC-AuNP-tagged cells. Volumetric analysis was used to quantify GC-AuNP accumulation in the SLN after cellular uptake and transport by immune cells. The results show that the spatio-temporal distribution of GC-AuNPs in the SLN was affected by the presence of metastases. The parameter describing the spatial distribution of GC-AuNP-tagged cells within the SLN was more than 2-fold lower in metastatic lymph nodes compared with non-metastatic controls. Histological analysis confirmed that the distribution of GC-AuNP-tagged immune cells is changed by the presence of metastatic cells. The USPA immunofunctional imaging successfully distinguished metastatic from non-metastatic lymph nodes using biocompatible nanoparticles. This method could aid physicians in the detection of micrometastases, thus guiding SLN biopsy and avoiding unnecessary biopsy procedures.

TI  - Circulation and characterization of seasonal influenza viruses in Cambodia, 2012-2015
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Influenza virus circulation is monitored through the Cambodian influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance system and isolates are characterized by the National Influenza Centre (NIC). Seasonal influenza circulation has previously been characterized by year-round activity and a peak during the rainy season (June-November). Objectives We documented the circulation of seasonal influenza in Cambodia for 2012-2015 and investigated genetic, antigenic, and antiviral resistance characteristics of influenza isolates. Patients/Methods Respiratory samples were collected from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) at 11 hospitals throughout Cambodia. First-line screening was conducted by the National Institute of Public Health and the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences. Confirmation of testing and genetic, antigenic and antiviral resistance characterization was conducted by Institute Pasteur in Cambodia, the NIC. Additional virus characterization was conducted by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza (Melbourne, Australia). Results Between 2012 and 2015, 1,238 influenza-positive samples were submitted to the NIC. Influenza A(H3N2) (55.3%) was the dominant subtype, followed by influenza B (30.9%; predominantly B/Yamagata-lineage) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (13.9%). Circulation of influenza viruses began earlier in 2014 and 2015 than previously described, coincident with the emergence of A(H3N2) clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a, respectively. There was high diversity in the antigenicity of A(H3N2) viruses, and to a smaller extent influenza B viruses, during this period, with some mismatches with the northern and southern hemisphere vaccine formulations. All isolates tested were susceptible to the influenza antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Conclusions Seasonal and year-round co-circulation of multiple influenza types/subtypes were detected in Cambodia during 2012-2015.

TI  - Reconstruction of Cloud Vertical Structure With a Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate the feasibility of solving atmospheric remote sensing problems with machine learning using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), implemented using convolutional neural networks. We apply the CGAN to generating two-dimensional cloud vertical structures that would be observed by the CloudSat satellite-based radar, using only the collocated Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer measurements as input. The CGAN is usually able to generate reasonable guesses of the cloud structure and can infer complex structures such as multilayer clouds from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data. This network, which is formulated probabilistically, also estimates the uncertainty of its own predictions. We examine the statistics of the generated data and analyze the response of the network to each input parameter. The success of the CGAN in solving this problem suggests that generative adversarial networks are applicable to a wide range of problems in atmospheric science, a field characterized by complex spatial structures and observational uncertainties.

TI  - Extensive 21st-Century Woody Encroachment in South America's Savanna
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody encroachment is occurring in all tropical savannas of the world. However, in the Brazilian savanna (the Cerrado), the extent of this phenomenon is still poorly documented. Here woody encroachment was quantified throughout the Cerrado biome and transitional ecotones using a trend analysis of the annual maximum of enhanced vegetation index obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The associations with potential local drivers, such as fire and land use regime, were assessed using satellite data of land cover and fire regime. We found that 19% of the remaining native vegetation showed significant evidence of woody encroachment in the last 15 years and 7% exhibited degradation processes. The local factors that favored woody expansion in 19% of the biome were a decrease of fire (34%) and land use abandonment (26%). Our study highlights that local human-associated drivers are playing a major role in woody encroachment and savanna degradation.

TI  - Assessment of Satellite-Based Chlorophyll-a Algorithms in Eutrophic Korean Coastal Waters: Jinhae Bay Case Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Jinhae Bay, one of the most important aquaculture areas in Korean coastal waters, has suffered from serious environmental problems due to intensive anthropogenic activities since the 1970s. Determining the response of coastal ecosystems in Korea to anthropogenic activities requires understanding the characteristics of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), and the high spatiotemporal resolution of the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) can aid these efforts. However, producing reliable satellite-based Chl-a estimates is challenging in optically complex coastal waters and the Chl-a estimation algorithms must be assessed regionally. Based on in situ Chl-a measurements collected in Jinhae Bay between 2011 and 2016, we evaluated GOCI-derived Chl-a estimates obtained using six ocean color Chl-a algorithms: two standard open ocean algorithms, one GOCI-standard algorithm, and three Tassan's algorithms regionally modified for Korean waters. All of the algorithms tended to underestimate high Chl-a values >0.9 mg m(-3). The Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem Ocean Color Project (YOC) algorithm, one of the modified Tassan's algorithms, provided the best fit to the in situ Chl-a measurements in Jinhae Bay (r = 0.51, p < 0.05), including appropriate representations of the spatial and temporal variation. Therefore, this algorithm can be considered a baseline approach for satellite-based long-term coastal monitoring systems in Jinhae Bay.

TI  - Automatically delineating the calving front of Jakobshavn Isbrae from multitemporal TerraSAR-X images: a deep learning approach
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The calving fronts of many tidewater glaciers in Greenland have been undergoing strong seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Conventionally, calving front positions have been manually delineated from remote sensing images. But manual practices can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly when processing a large number of images taken over decades and covering large areas with many glaciers, such as Greenland. Applying U-Net, a deep learning architecture, to multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images taken by the TerraSAR-X satellite, we here automatically delineate the calving front positions of Jakobshavn Isbrae from 2009 to 2015. Our results are consistent with the manually delineated products generated by the Greenland Ice Sheet Climate Change Initiative project. We show that the calving fronts of Jakobshavn's two main branches retreated at mean rates of -117 +/- 1 and -157 +/- 1 m yr(-1), respectively, during the years 2009 to 2015. The interannual calving front variations can be roughly divided into three phases for both branches. The retreat rates of the two branches tripled and doubled, respectively, from phase 1 (April 2009-January 2011) to phase 2 (January 2011-January 2013) and then stabilized to nearly zero in phase 3 (January 2013-December 2015). We suggest that the retreat of the calving front into an overdeepened basin whose bed is retrograde may have accelerated the retreat after 2011, while the inland-uphill bed slope behind the bottom of the overdeepened basin has prevented the glacier from retreating further after 2012. Demonstrating through this successful case study on Jakobshavn Isbrae and due to the transferable nature of deep learning, our methodology can be applied to many other tidewater glaciers both in Greenland and else-where in the world, using multitemporal and multisensor remote sensing imagery.

AB  - This paper presents the analysis of land subsidence as a result of excessive groundwater abstraction for irrigation and domestic supply in Quetta valley, Pakistan. The European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data is used to identify and categorize the spatial distribution of land subsidence. The aquifer geology and observed groundwater table are used to establish the relationship between land subsidence and groundwater abstraction. For this, we performed Persistent Scattering Interferometry (PSIn) analysis using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to develop 28 maps of land subsidence covering a period of 16 October 2014 to 22 November 2016. The interferometry results matched well with the land subsidence values measured at the Global Positioning System (GPS) ground station with a mean absolute error of 5.7 mm and coefficient of determination of 0.94. The land subsidence values at each pixel of the map were classified according to the land cover types of the study area. Here, the map of land cover types was developed using the multispectral image of Sentinel-2A satellite. The results revealed that, during the 2-year period, the entire study area has suffered from varying degree of accumulated land subsidence ranging between 10 and 280 mm in magnitude, which was linearly proportional to the depth and drawdown of groundwater table observed at four piezometers located in the study area. The magnitude of land subsidence across the study area showed a strong correlation with land covers. The urban area and orchard vegetation with a large amount of groundwater abstraction showed an excessive amount of cumulative land subsidence, while the seasonally cultivated and barren land are slightly affected by land subsidence.

TI  - Characterizing persistent unburned islands within the Inland Northwest USA
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States, fire is a dominant driver of ecological change. Within wildfire perimeters, fire effects often vary considerably and typically include remnant patches of unburned islands. As fires reburn the landscape, some unburned islands remain persistently unburned. These persistent unburned islands can serve an important ecological function as fire refugia; however, their characteristics have not been quantified. The objective of this study was to assess the characteristics of persistent unburned islands and compare them to the burned areas that surround them. Using an existing database of unburned islands from 1984 to 2014, overlapping unburned islands were delineated. We sampled points in both persistent unburned islands and in areas burned by wildfire. At these sample points, we derived several topographical and other geospatial metrics, and we compared the characteristics of these groups. Because the study area covers many ecosystems, we stratified the analysis by different fire regime groups.Results: Our analysis revealed that persistent unburned islands are not randomly distributed across the landscape. While the topography and vegetation fuel type that underlie persistent unburned islands differ from burned areas, these differences are dependent upon fire regime group and are less pronounced than what other studies have found. The topographic features that differed the most between persistent unburned islands and burned areas were terrain ruggedness, slope, and transformed aspect. We also found that, as unburned islands increased in persistence (i.e., remained unburned for an increasing number of overlapping fires), they decreased in size and shape complexity.Conclusions: Our research shows that the biophysical setting underlying persistent unburned islands differs between forests and rangelands, and also differs from burned areas, which has potential applications for fire refugia prediction and management. Characterizing fire refugia and understanding the processes that contribute to their creation and maintenance will be important for land management as climate changes and increasingly large areas are affected by wildfire.

TI  - Observed Evidence of Enhanced Probability of Mesoscale Convective System Initiations due to Land Surface Heterogeneity in Semiarid East Asia
T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the impact of land surface heterogeneity on Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) initiations in East Asia, using geostationary satellite data during June-August from 1996 through 2018. The detected MCSs over land exhibited clear diurnal variation with the lowest existence frequency at 10:00 and highest initiation frequency during 12:00-17:00 local time. To quantify land surface heterogeneity, the spatial standard deviation of equivalent Black-Body Temperature (TBB) within a cloud-free 0.35 degrees x 0.35 degrees box (sigma LSTBB:Land Surface TBB) was computed for 10:00 each day. A comparison of the sigma LSTBB and MCS databases revealed that the probability of MCS initiations increased with increasing sigma LSTBB in East Mongolia while the probability was not sensitive to sigma LSTBB in East China. This indicated that MCSs tend to form over heterogeneous land surface conditions in the semiarid region. We found that the impact of land surface heterogeneity on MCS initiations was highest over flat terrain in East Mongolia, where the convection trigger due to topographically-induced circulation was absent. These results suggest that the impact of land surface heterogeneity on MCS initiations during the warm season varies with climate zones and terrain complexities in East Asia, with strongest impact in semiarid and flat regions.

TI  - All-Sky Assimilation of the MWHS-2 Observations and Evaluation the Impacts on the Analyses and Forecasts of Binary Typhoons
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data assimilation is transitioning from clear-sky to all-sky approach at some operational forecasting centers; the all-sky approach directly assimilates observations under clear, cloudy, and precipitating conditions and shows a positive impact on medium-range forecasts. Although there has been progress in the all-sky technique for the forecasting of high-impact weather processes, such as typhoon, these studies mainly focused on a single typhoon case, and the influence of all-sky assimilation on the forecasts of binary typhoons, which have tracks and intensities that are more complex, is less investigated. In this study, a binary typhoons case (i.e., Typhoons Haitang and Nesat), which occurred in the western Pacific in July 2017, is selected, and the Weather Research and Forecasting data assimilation system is applied to examine the impact of all-sky assimilation of the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 data from FengYun-3C on the analysis and forecasting of the binary typhoons for the first time. The results show that with more cloud- and precipitation-affected data being assimilated, the vertical structures of temperature and humidity around the core areas of the two typhoons and the forecasts of wind, temperature, and humidity are improved significantly in the all-sky assimilation. These improvements result in the simulated tracks being more similar to the observations, and an error reduction in intensity is achieved in the all-sky assimilation. The heavy rainfall (>250 mm) caused by Nesat over Taiwan is also improved. These encouraging results suggest that all-sky assimilation is able to improve the forecasts of binary typhoons.

TI  - Urban expansion in the megacity since 1970s: a case study in Mumbai
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the process of urban expansion in megacities is considerably important. In this study, megacity Mumbai was selected as the study area. Based on the urban maps retrieved from Landsat images in 1973-2018, we mapped and quantified the detailed urban expansion process of Mumbai by adopting the expansion area and speed indices, centroid shift model, urban expansion type method, hot-zone identification method and landscape metrics. The results indicated that: (1) urban land remarkably expanded, and its centroid moved from the southwest to the northeast direction, mainly adopting the edge-expansion form. (2) Distinctly spatiotemporal heterogeneities existed in eight directions, faster in the north, northeast and east directions, whereas slower in the five other directions. (3) The number of hot-zones increased from two to three and moved outward in space from urban centroid. (4) The urban landscape of Mumbai showed the 'diffusion, aggregation, re-diffusion' pattern and presented differences in eight directions.

TI  - A combined drought monitoring index based on multi-sensor remote sensing data and machine learning
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of drought is related to complicated interactions between many factors, such as precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration and vegetation. In this study, the relationships between drought and precipitation, temperature, vegetation and evapotranspiration were investigated with a random forest (RF), and a new combined drought monitoring index (CDMI) was constructed. The effectiveness of the CDMI in monitoring drought in Shaanxi Province was verified by the in situ 1 similar to 12-month standardized precipitation index (SPI); relative soil moisture (RSM) and four other commonly used remote sensing drought monitoring indices. The results show that CDMI is more correlated with the SPI and RSM than the four indices. Moreover, the spatial distributions of drought for the CDMI and RSM are similar. Therefore, the CDMI can be used to monitor droughts in Shaanxi Province, and machine learning can explore the relationships between various factors and establish a drought index without knowledge of the causal mechanisms of these factors.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of multiangle implementation of the atmospheric correction algorithm, Dark Target, and Deep Blue aerosol products over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new multiangle implementation of the atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm has been applied in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and has recently provided globally high-spatial-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) products at 1 km. Moreover, several improvements have been modified in the classical Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) aerosol retrieval algorithms in MODIS Collection 6.1 products. Thus, validation and comparison of the MAIAC, DT, and DB algorithms are urgent in China. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment and comparison of AOD products at a 550 nm wavelength based on three aerosol retrieval algorithms in the MODIS sensor using ground-truth measurements from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites over China from 2000 to 2017. In general, MAIAC products achieved better accuracy than DT and DB products in the overall validation and accuracy improvement of DB products after the QA filter, demonstrating the highest values among the three products. In addition, the DT algorithms had higher aerosol retrievals in cropland, forest, and ocean land types than the other two products, and the MAIAC algorithms were more accurate in grassland, built-up, unoccupied, and mixed land types among the three products. In the geometry dependency analysis, the solar zenith angle, scattering angle, and relative azimuth angle, excluding the view zenith angle, significantly affected the performance of the three aerosol retrieval algorithms. The three products showed different accuracies with varying regions and seasons. Similar spatial patterns were found for the three products, but the MAIAC retrievals were smaller in the North China Plain and higher in Yunnan Province compared with the DT and DB retrievals before the QA filter. After the QA filter, the DB retrievals were significantly lower than the MAIAC retrievals in south China. Moreover, the spatiotemporal completeness of the MAIAC product was also better than the DT and DB products.

TI  - The etiology of acute meningitis and encephalitis syndromes in a sentinel pediatric hospital, Shenzhen, China
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAcute meningitis and encephalitis syndromes (AMES) is a severe neurological infection which causes high case fatality and severe sequelae in children. To determine the etiology of childhood AMES in Shenzhen, a hospital-based study was undertaken.MethodsA total of 240 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 171 children meeting the case definition were included and screened for 12 common causative organisms. The clinical data and conventional testing results were collected and analyzed. Whole genome sequencing was performed on a Neisseria meningitidis isolate.ResultsA pathogen was found in 85 (49.7%) cases; Group B Streptococcus (GBS) was detected in 17 cases, Escherichia coli in 15, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 14, enterovirus (EV) in 13, herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 3, N. meningitidis in 1, Haemophilus influenzae in 1, and others in 23. Notably, HSV was found after 43days of treatment. Twelve GBS and 6 E. coli meningitis were found in neonates aged less than 1month; 13 pneumococcal meningitis in children aged >3months; and 12 EV infections in children aged >1year old. The multilocus sequence typing of serogroup B N. meningitidis isolate was ST-3200/CC4821. High resistance rate to tetracycline (75%), penicillin (75%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75%) was found in 4 of S. pneumoniae isolates; clindamycin (100%) and tetracycline (100%) in 9 of GBS; and ampicillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (67%) in 12 of E. coli.ConclusionsThe prevalence of N. meningitidis and JEV was very low and the cases of childhood AMES were mainly caused by other pathogens. GBS and E. coli were the main causative organisms in neonates, while S. pneumoniae and EV were mainly found in older children. HSV could be persistently found in the CSF samples despite of the treatment. A better prevention strategy for GBS, the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine, and incorporation of PCR methods were recommended.

TI  - System design of the physical layer for Loon's high-altitude platform
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes several aspects of the physical layer and over the air interface of Loon. Loon utilizes stratospheric balloon-based high-altitude platforms (HAPs) that use Long-Term Evolution (LTE) to connect people with standard User Equipment (UEs) to the Internet. In particular, topics covered include the Loon prototype eNodeB (eNB) antenna pattern, the observed channel, UE battery life, and coexistence with terrestrial networks using the same spectrum. While channel models from a HAP to the ground have been well studied in the past, the use of polarization diversity to establish Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) communication to real UEs below 1 GHz has not. In addition, a theoretical analysis of terrestrial coexistence and an analysis of the estimated impact on UE battery life when communicating with HAPs are presented. Finally, results from several measurement campaigns and from experiments with polarization diversity are presented as a spot check of theory.

TI  - Sediment connectivity linked to vegetation using UAVs: High-resolution imagery for ecosystem management
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle was used to obtain multi-spectral high-resolution imagery (1.4 cmpx(-1)) from2 microcatchments (3.3 ha) with burned Mediterranean shrubland and pine forests. This imagery was used to calculate the blue normalized differential vegetation index and to generate digital elevation models for estimating the sediment connectivity index. Both indices enabled an integrated approach for deciphering how hydrological and sediment connectivity interact with vegetation as well as soil conservation structures. The application of spatial analysis improves our understanding of the feedback between biological and geomorphological processes. Local spatial data analysis established a significant link between local geomorphological and biological factors, enabling a precise identification of homogeneous areas at micro-catchment scale and the minimal size of vegetation units reacting to geomorphology as natural groups at plot-scale where management strategies and efforts should be applied. Establishing this local relationship between sediment connectivity and vegetation patterns through new and interdisciplinary methodologies represents a new strategy for the assessment of ecosystem dynamics and management.

TI  - Monitoring Habitat Quality Changes in Yuanjiangyuan Nature Reserve Based on Landsat Images
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - In nature reserve, monitoring habitat quality changes by remote sensing technology is of great significance to regional ecological protection policies making. Taking the Yuanjiangyuan Nature Reserve in Guizhou Province as an example, combining Fragstats 4.2 with InVEST 3.4.4 software, land use changes and landscape patterns were analyzed based on Landsat-5 TM images, Landsat-7 ETM+ images and Landsat-8 OLI images from 1990 to 2018. Then, the habitat quality changes were explored and validity of the functional zoning was assessed. Finally, habitat quality improvement affected by ecological protection scenarios was simulated. Results showed that: from 1990 to 2018, forest, constructed land and wetland in nature reserve increased, while grassland, other types and cultivated land decreased. The land transformation of reserve mainly occurred from grassland to forest, cultivated land to forest and cultivated land to grassland. As integrated degree of land use increased, the impact of human activities was gradually increasing. The integrated degree of land use was in the order of the core area < buffer area < pilot area during the past 29 years. The clumpy of cultivated land and the patch density of artificial land increased in reserve. Increase of landscape advantage of patch connectivity led to decrease of the fragmentation. Forest patch controlled landscape pattern. The average habitat quality showed a fluctuating increase trend from 1990 to 2018, which increased by 8.64% than those in 1990. The average habitat quality was in the order of the core area > buffer area > pilot area in the past 29 years. The trend of habitat quality improvement was greater than that of degradation in nature reserves. Under the ecological protection scenario, the average habitat quality of the reserve increased from 0.88 to 0.90. The implementation of Green for Grain plan and the increase of human activities were the main reasons for the changes of the habitat quality.

TI  - On the relationship between normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature: MODIS-based analysis in a semi-arid to arid environment
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focused on studying the relationships between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and daytime and nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) in winter, spring, summer and fall and investigating the effects of land cover on these variables in Jordan, which represents a typical semi-arid to arid environment. Using MODIS-based data for the year 2017, multiple procedures were applied: one-way analysis of variance followed by comparison between means, Pearson correlation coefficient, global Moran's index, simple linear regression, second-order polynomial regression, recursive-partitioning regression and geographically weighted regression. The results showed that land cover explained fair amount of the variability in NDVI but small amount of the variability in daytime and nighttime LST. In addition, an inverted surface urban heat island pattern was observed in daytime. Finally, applying different regression procedures produced different perspectives about the complex and variable relationships between daytime and nighttime LST and NDVI in different seasons.

TI  - Determinants for non-sentinel node metastases in primary invasive breast cancer: a population-based cohort study of 602 consecutive patients with sentinel node metastases
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel node biopsy (SNB) is the standard procedure for axillary staging in patients with clinically lymph node negative invasive breast cancer. Completion axillary lymph node dissection (c-ALND) may not be necessary for all patients as a significant number of patients have no further metastases in non-sentinel nodes (non-SN) and c-ALND may not improve survival. The first aim of our study is to identify clinicopathological determinants associated with non-SN metastases. The second aim is to determine the impact of the number of sentinel node (SN) with macro-metastases and the type of SN metastases on metastatic involvement in non-SN.MethodsThis is a retrospective study of 602 patients with primary invasive breast cancer operated on with SNB and c-ALND in Lund and Malmo during 2008-2013. All these patients had micro- and/or macro-metastases in SNs. Information was retrieved from the national Information Network for Cancer Care (INCA). The risk of metastases to non-SNs were analyzed in relation to clinicopathological determinants such as age, screening mammography, tumour size, tumour type, histological grade, estrogen status, progesterone status, HER2 status, multifocality and lymphovascular invasion. Additionally, we compared the association between the number of the SN and the type of metastases in SN with the risk of metastases to non-SNs. Binary logistic regression was used, yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsWe found that 211 patients (35%) had metastases in non-SNs and 391 patients (65%) had no metastases in non-SNs. Lobular type (18%) of breast cancer (1.73; 1.0 1-2.97) and multifocal (31.3%) tumours (2.20; 1.41-3.44) had a high risk of non-SNs metastases. As compared to only micro-metastases, the presence of macro-metastases in SNs was associated with a high risk of metastases to non-SNs (4.91; 3.01-8.05). The number of SN with macro-metastases, regardless of the number of SNs removed by surgery, increases the risk of finding non-SNs with metastases. The total number of SN removed by surgery had no impact on diagnosis of metastases in non-SNs. No statistically significant associations were observed regarding other studied determinants.ConclusionWe conclude in the present study that lobular cancer and multifocal tumours were associated with a high risk of non-SN involvement. The presence of the macro-metastases in SNs and the number of SN with macro-metastases has a positive association with presence of metastases in non-SNs. The total number of SNs removed by surgery had no impact on finding metastases in non-SNs. These factors may be valuable considering whether or not to omit c-ALND.

TI  - Empirical modelling for retrieval of foliar traits in cotton crop using spatial data
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study conducted in cotton fields of Vadodara district, Gujarat, India during kharif season of 2009-10, aimed at assessing foliar traits, in particular crop leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (CC) from space-borne optical LANDSAT 5 TM and IRS LISS-IV satellite data. Field measurements of these foliar traits coinciding with the dates of the satellite data for cotton were used for validation of RS-based VI-LAI and VI-CC empirical models developed in the present study. These models developed for LAI estimation in cotton crop showed good correlation with R-2 varying from 0.592 to 0.805, and CC between 0.585 and 0.746 with P at 0.01 level in both cases. It has been observed that the potential of NDVI-LAI and NDVI-CC empirical models was better compared to RVI-LAI and RVI-CC models. The VI-LAI and VI-CC models derived from LISS-IV data were better estimators of LAI compared to LANDSAT. A high R-2 value between ground-measured foliar traits and those predicted using empirical models complemented the validation.

TI  - Flood assessment using multi-temporal remotely sensed data in Cambodia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop an approach for flood assessment using MODIS data in Cambodia. The data were processed for the period from 2000 to 2017 using vegetation and water surface indices. The results of flood mapping were verified with the ground reference data, indicating the overall accuracy of 88.7% and Kappa coefficient of 0.77, respectively. These findings were confirmed by close agreement between the flood-mapping area and ground reference data, with the correlation coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.94. The flood-prone areas were generally concentrated along the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake. The seasonal flooded areas observed for 2010, 2015 and 2016 were remarkably smaller than other years, mainly attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon exacerbated by impacts of climate change. Eventually, the probability of flood occurrence during this 18-year period with reference to percentage of population at the district level was calculated for flood management purposes.

AB  - Aim: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act a role in regulation numerous processes crucial for oncogenesis. The aim of the study was to compare the blood serum concentrations of selected microRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-10b and miRNA-200c) between breast cancer patients without sentinel lymph node metastasis (Group 1) and those with metastasis (Group 2).Material/Methods: The serum levels of miRNA-21, miRNA-10b and miRNA-200c were measured with using TaqMan PCR assays performed on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System in two groups of breast cancer patients: Group 1 - without sentinel lymph node metastasis (32 patients) and Group 2 - with sentinel lymph node metastasis (14 patients).Results: The mean level of miRNA-200c was noticeably lower in Group 2 than in Group 1. The mean fold change of miRNA-200c level in the metastatic group (Group 2) was approximately 1.3 times lower than that in non-metastatic group (Group 1). However, this result just approached the arbitrary threshold for significance (p = 0.05).Conclusions: Breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis demonstrate diminished levels of circulating miR-200c compared to non-metastatic patients.

TI  - Eco-geomorphic assessment of the Varanasi Turtle Sanctuary and its implication for Ganga River conservation
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The eco-geomorphology of the Varanasi Turtle Sanctuary (VTS) located on the Ganga River in Uttar Pradesh, India was examined for its stability using hydraulic geometry of the channels, such as width, depth and discharge acquired from an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and the mapping of planform morphology from remote-sensing images. Planform maps were generated using Corona and Landsat satellite images for the period 1965-2018. The assessment suggests a well-defined, stable cross-section profile along this stretch of the river. It provides conclusive evidence that the geomorphology of the Ganga River within the VTS has remained stable for the past 50 years, except for some minor changes in the form of bar growth and erosion both upstream and downstream of the sanctuary. Construction activities along the bank, movement of large vessels, sand mining in the sanctuary or dredging of the main channel may destabilize the river geomorphology that will negatively affect the integrity of the VTS as well as the ghats at Varanasi.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of urban agglomerations in four major bay areas of US, China and Japan from 1987 to 2017: Evidence from remote sensing images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As major urban agglomerations with strong urbanization, global bay areas are seldom detected and compared in detail regarding the spatiotemporal evolution of their urban expansion. In this work, a framework was applied for detecting and comparing the spatiotemporal evolution of urban agglomerations in four major bay areas: the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area in the US, the Tokyo Bay Area in Japan, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau (GHM) Bay Area in China. Landsat images from 1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017 were employed to derive the four urban bay areas using the object-oriented support vector machine (O-SVM) classification method, and a multi-scale spatial analysis method was applied to detect the landscape characteristics and types of growth in the urban expansions. The results showed that: (1) the O-SVM classification method exhibited a high accuracy in urban area extraction, especially for classifying large-scale images; (2) the urban areas of the San Francisco Bay Area, the New York Bay Area, the Tokyo Bay Area and the GHM Bay Area from 1987 to 2017 expanded from 1686.82, 5315.93, 3765.09 and 605.71 km(2) to 2714.7, 8359.18, 5351.06 and 7568.19 km(2), respectively, with a corresponding annual average increase of 1.60%, 1.52%, 1.18% and 8.82%; (3) the GHM Bay Area had the largest expansion area and rate among the four bay areas; (4) both the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area successively formed a multi-nuclei ribbon model, and the Tokyo Bay Area and the GHM Bay Area formed a multinuclear fan-shaped model and a triangle zonal expansion pattern, respectively; and (5) the spatial patterns of urban expansions in these bay areas shifted from outlying to edge-expansion and infilling, in which the Tokyo Bay Area and the New York Bay Area experienced the largest infilling growth, and the San Francisco Bay Area followed closely thereafter; all were ahead of the GHM Bay Area. These results will be helpful for the understanding and sustainable development of these bay areas. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impacts of urban configuration on urban heat island: An empirical study in China mega-cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban configuration can influence the local thermal environment by altering energy balances. However, previous studies have found that either sprawling urban or compact urban development could intensify urban heat island (UHI) intensity. How urban configurations can mitigate the UHI intensity has drawn full attention. In this study, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal UHI intensities in 36 cities in China and investigated their response to urban configurations. In each city, urban land cover maps were classified from Landsat 8 and UHIs were quantified using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST). Results show that the average UHI intensities of 36 cities vary temporally with a sequence of summer day > summer night > winter night > winter day. Moreover, whether the daytime UHI is higher or lower than the nighttime UHI significantly depends on climatic zones and seasons. Besides, we found that UHIs significantly correlate with urban configurations in two ways. First, for the spatial structure among built-up patches, a lower UHI located in the smaller built-up area with dispersed distribution when compared to the larger built-up patches, if the total built-up area holds constant. Second, for the spatial structure of a single patch, the single patch with more complex shape would mitigate the UHI intensities. Overall, urban configuration and other control variables (e.g., urban characteristics and climatic condition) can explain 41% and 51% of the variance in UHI in summer day and night, respectively. Therefore, the design of urban configuration can serve as an essential practice to mitigate UHI intensity. Considering the difficulties of altering the urban configuration in the urbanized area, planting vegetation might be a great choice to change the urban contiguity and shape complexity with providing an extra cooling effect.

TI  - Research on County Ecological Compensation Mechanism in the Process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integration: A Case Study of Dingxing County in Baoding City
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - in recent years, the integration of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei ecological environment has been difficult, which has affected the integration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. The ecological compensation mechanism is one of the economic means to effectively protect the regional ecological environment. By interpreting the Landsat TM remote sensing images of 2000, 2008, 2013 and 2018 in Dingxing County of Baoding City, the changes of land types in Dingxing County was analyzed from 2000 to 2018, and the value of county's ecological service functions and the loss of development rights were calculated. The scope of ecological compensation standards was discussed. On this basis, how the region compensates the county, and how the county compensates the ecological protector were further discussed. The county's ecological compensation mechanism was established. The results show that due to the development and utilization of land, the value of ecosystem services in Dingxing County had been reduced from 861.17 million yuan to 813.19 million yuan, and the loss of development rights being 672.74 million yuan, that is, the ecological compensation range of Dingxing County was 672.74 million-813.19 million yuan. The county's ecological compensation mechanism was to grasp the principle of "who protects, who benefits and compensated" and "equal rights and responsibilities", and the region should provide financial compensation, policy compensation, and technical compensation to the county. The county should combine the policies of the times with the townships and enterprises, environmental NGOs, farmers and herdsmen compensated to form "hematopoietic" compensation for "reasonable distribution, key attention, and social participation", thereby improving the operationality of the county's ecological compensation mechanism in the process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine combinations for uncomplicated malaria in 10 sentinel sites across Ghana: 2015-2017
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRoutine surveillance on the therapeutic efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been ongoing in Ghana since 2005. The sixth round of surveillance was conducted between 2015 and 2017 to determine the therapeutic efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 10 sentinel sites across the country.MethodsThe study was a one-arm, prospective, evaluation of the clinical, parasitological, and haematological responses to directly observed treatment with AS-AQ and AL among children 6months to 9years old with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The WHO 2009 protocol on surveillance of anti-malaria drug efficacy was used for the study with primary outcomes as prevalence of day 3 parasitaemia and clinical and parasitological cure rates on day 28. Secondary outcomes assessed included patterns of fever and parasite clearance as well as changes in haemoglobin concentration.ResultsDay 3 parasitaemia was absent in all sites following treatment with AS-AQ whilst only one person (0.2%) was parasitaemic on day 3 following treatment with AL. Day 28 PCR-corrected cure rates following treatment with AS-AQ ranged between 96.7% (95% CI 88.5-99.6) and 100%, yielding a national rate of 99.2% (95% CI 97.7-99.7). Day 28 PCR-corrected cure rates following treatment with AL ranged between 91.3% (95% CI 79.2-97.6) and 100%, yielding a national rate of 96% (95% CI 93.5-97.6). Prevalence of fever declined by 88.4 and 80.4% after first day of treatment with AS-AQ and AL, respectively, whilst prevalence of parasitaemia on day 2 was 2.1% for AS-AQ and 1.5% for AL. Gametocytaemia was maintained at low levels (<5%) during the 3days of treatment. Post-treatment mean haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher than pre-treatment concentration following treatment with either AS-AQ or AL.ConclusionsThe therapeutic efficacy of AS-AQ and AL is over 90% in sentinel sites across Ghana. The two anti-malarial drugs therefore remain efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the country and continue to achieve rapid fever and parasite clearance as well as low gametocyte carriage rates and improved post-treatment mean haemoglobin concentration.

TI  - The Generalized Data Model for clinical research
T2  - BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMost healthcare data sources store information within their own unique schemas, making reliable and reproducible research challenging. Consequently, researchers have adopted various data models to improve the efficiency of research. Transforming and loading data into these models is a labor-intensive process that can alter the semantics of the original data. Therefore, we created a data model with a hierarchical structure that simplifies the transformation process and minimizes data alteration.MethodsThere were two design goals in constructing the tables and table relationships for the Generalized Data Model (GDM). The first was to focus on clinical codes in their original vocabularies to retain the original semantic representation of the data. The second was to retain hierarchical information present in the original data while retaining provenance. The model was tested by transforming synthetic Medicare data; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims; and electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We also tested a subsequent transformation from the GDM into the Sentinel data model.ResultsThe resulting data model contains 19 tables, with the Clinical Codes, Contexts, and Collections tables serving as the core of the model, and containing most of the clinical, provenance, and hierarchical information. In addition, a Mapping table allows users to apply an arbitrarily complex set of relationships among vocabulary elements to facilitate automated analyses.ConclusionsThe GDM offers researchers a simpler process for transforming data, clear data provenance, and a path for users to transform their data into other data models. The GDM is designed to retain hierarchical relationships among data elements as well as the original semantic representation of the data, ensuring consistency in protocol implementation as part of a complete data pipeline for researchers.

TI  - The CMEMS GlobColour chlorophyll <i>a</i> product based on satellite observation: multi-sensor merging and flagging strategies
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper concerns the GlobColour-merged chlorophyll a products based on satellite observation (SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS, VIIRS and OLCI) and disseminated in the framework of the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS).This work highlights the main advantages provided by the Copernicus GlobColour processor which is used to serve CMEMS with a long time series from 1997 to present at the global level (4 km spatial resolution) and for the Atlantic level 4 product (1 km spatial resolution).To compute the merged chlorophyll a product, two major topics are discussed:The first of these topics is the strategy for merging remote-sensing data, for which two options are considered. On the one hand, a merged chlorophyll a product computed from a prior merging of the remote-sensing reflectance of a set of sensors. On the other hand, a merged chlorophyll a product resulting from a combination of chlorophyll a products computed for each sensor.The second topic is the flagging strategy used to discard non-significant observations (e.g. clouds, high glint and so on).These topics are illustrated by comparing the CMEMS GlobColour products provided by ACRI-ST (Garnesson et al., 2019) with the OC-CCI/C3S project (Sathyendranath et al., 2018). While GlobColour merges chlorophyll a products with a specific flagging, the OC-CCI approach is based on a prior reflectance merging before chlorophyll a derivation and uses a more constrained flagging approach. Although this work addresses these two topics, it does not pretend to provide a full comparison of the two data sets, which will require a better characterisation and additional intercomparison with in situ data.

AB  - Coastal and open ocean regions throughout the world are now subject to an array of toxic, harmful, or more intense algal blooms with an increasing trend of incidence over large geographical areas due to anthropogenic factors such as pollution and climate shifts. To date, detection capabilities of causative species based on remote sensing data are greatly limited because of the difficulties in interpreting the composite reflectance signal from different water features and types. In the present study, an accurate and reliable method is developed to automatically detect the onset of blooms and correctly classify the bloom species in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal waters using remote sensing data. A data-driven approach using machine learning algorithm is devised based on reflectance spectral signatures and tested on several MODIS-Aqua (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data for classifying the dominant water categories, including clear ocean waters devoid of sediments and algal blooms, sediment-laden coastal waters, and three major algal blooms, Trichodesmium erythraeum, Noctiluca scintillans and Cochlodinium polykrikoides. An extreme gradient boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model is chosen to improve the prediction accuracy by prevention of overfitting, which increases the scalability of the model on several unseen test data. This model was trained using 1.5 million samples and resulted in a classification accuracy of over 98%. When the results were validated using forty thousand random samples from the known blooms, an overall accuracy more than 96.8% was achieved. The applicability of the trained XGBoost model was further verified using MODIS-Aqua images, and it showed promise for successful detection and identification of well-documented blooms. The use of spectral information to classify algal blooms makes this method more robust and easily adaptable to different ocean colour sensors with a scope to accommodate other major algal blooms.

TI  - Estimation of some stand parameters from textural features from WorldView-2 satellite image using the artificial neural network and multiple regression methods: a case study from Turkey
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is to assess some stand parameters such as stand volume (SV), basal area (BA), number of trees (NT) and aboveground biomass (AGB) of pure Crimean pine forest stands in Turkey by using ground measurements and remote sensing techniques. For this purpose, 86 sample plots were collected from pure Crimean pine stands of Yenice Forest Management Planning Unit in Ilgaz Forest Management Enterprise, Turkey. The stand parameters of each sample area were estimated using the data obtained from the sample plots. Subsequently, we calculated the values of contrast (CON), correlation (COR), dissimilarity (DIS), entropy (ENT), homogeneity (HOM), mean (M), second moment (SM) and variance (VAR) from WorldView-2 imagery using a grey-level co-occurrence matrix method. Eight textural features and twelve different window sizes ranging from 3 x 3 to 25 x 25 were generated from blue, green, red and near-infrared bands of the WorldView-2 satellite image. For predicting the relationships between WorldView-2 textural features and stand parameters of each sample plot, regression models were developed by using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. Additionally, artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function (RBF) architectures were trained by comparing various numbers of neurons and activation functions in their network types. The results showed that the MLR models had low the coefficient of determination (R-2) values (0.32 for SV, 0.35 for BA, 0.33 for NT and 0.34 for AGB), and the most of the ANNs models (MLP and RBF) were better than the regression models for estimating stand parameters. The ANNs model containing MLP and RBF for SV (R-2 = 0.40; R-2 = 0.56), for BA (R-2 = 0.34; R-2 = 0.51), for NT (R-2 = 0.34; R-2 = 0.37) and for AGB (R-2 = 0.34, R-2 = 0.57) were found the best results, respectively. Our results revealed that the ANNs models developed with WorldView-2 satellite image were beneficial to estimate stand parameters better than the MLR model in pure Crimean pine stands.

TI  - Uncertainty in the optical remote estimation of the biomass of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> macroalgae using MODIS imagery in the Yellow Sea
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A laboratory experiment was conducted to obtain a floating algae index (FAI) of the floating macroalgae (Ulva prolifera), corresponding to various values of biomass per unit area (BPA). A piecewise empirical model was used to fit the statistical relationships between BPA and FAI, corresponding to FAI <= 0.2 (BPA <= 1.81kg/m(2)) and FAI. 0.2 (BPA. 1.81 kg/m(2)). Spectral mixing derived results show that a linear relationship between FAI and BPA is maintained when the BPA of endmembers is less than 1.81 kg/m2. However, when the BPA of the endmembers exceeds 1.81 kg/m(2), there is substantial uncertainty in the optical remote estimation of biomass. Although the MODIS-derived FAI of Ulva prolifera is often less than 0.2, it is very difficult to determine whether the FAI results from low BPA (<= 1.81kg/m(2)) of the endmembers, or from a low area ratio including high BPA (> 1.81 kg/m(2)), due to pixel mixing. If it is assumed that the unit biomass distribution of pure endmembers is a standard Gaussian distribution, then the uncertainty in the biomass estimation of Ulva prolifera from MODIS data can be expressed. This results in the uncertainty of similar to 36% in total biomass estimation, similar to 43% of which was contributed by a few pixels (10% of total pixels) with high FAI (> 0.05). The uncertainty in BPA caused by high FAI (> 0.05) pixels is about 7.2 times that for low FAI (<= 0.05) pixels. In future research, the spatial distribution characteristics of the FAI of pure endmembers need to be considered in order to improve the accuracy of optical remote estimation of floating Ulva prolifera.

TI  - Land use/land cover in view of earth observation: data sources, input dimensions, and classifiers-a review of the state of the art
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) is a fundamental concept of the Earth's system intimately connected to many phases of the human and physical environment. Earth observation (EO) technology provides an informative source of data covering the entire globe in a spatial and spectral resolution appropriate to better and easier classify land cover than traditional or conventional methods. The use of high spatial and spectral resolution imagery from EO sensors has increased remarkably over the past decades, as more and more platforms are placed in orbit and new applications emerge in different disciplines. The aim of the present review work is to provide all-inclusive critical reflection on the state of the art in the use of EO technology in LULC mapping and change detection. The emphasis is placed on providing an overview of the different EO datasets, spatial-spectral-temporal characteristics of satellite data and classification approaches employed in land cover classification. The review concludes providing recommendations and remarks on what should be done in order to overcome hurdle faced using above-mentioned problems in LULC mapping. This also provides information on using classifier algorithms depending upon the data types and dependent on the regional ecosystems. One of the main messages of our review is that in future, there will be a need to assemble techniques specifically used in LULC with their merit and demerits that will enable more comprehensive understanding at regional or global scale and improve understanding between different land cover relationship and variability among them and these remains to be seen.

T2  - BMC RESEARCH NOTES
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveForecasting the time of future outbreaks would minimize the impact of diseases by taking preventive steps including public health messaging and raising awareness of clinicians for timely treatment and diagnosis. The present study investigated the accuracy of support vector machine, artificial neural-network, and random-forest time series models in influenza like illness (ILI) modeling and outbreaks detection. The models were applied to a data set of weekly ILI frequencies in Iran. The root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE), and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics were employed as evaluation criteria.ResultsIt was indicated that the random-forest time series model outperformed other three methods in modeling weekly ILI frequencies (RMSE=22.78, MAE=14.99 and ICC=0.88 for the test set). In addition neural-network was better in outbreaks detection with total accuracy of 0.889 for the test set. The results showed that the used time series models had promising performances suggesting they could be effectively applied for predicting weekly ILI frequencies and outbreaks.

AB  - Assessing and monitoring of the landfill temperature is of great importance, so as to assess environmental impacts of the landfill and to prevent fires that may lead to failure of the landfill operations. In this study, satellite images were used in mapping the landfill surface temperature (LFST) of Al Akeeder landfill site in Northern Jordan. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was developed to simulate and predict the LFST. Fifty-four Landsat satellite images on different dates covering the period 2000-2016 were collected and utilized after being subjected to correction of the thermal band. Multi-temporal thematic maps were developed for the landfill site and the LFST trends, patterns and magnitude were evaluated. Correlating LFST with the amount of the landfilled solid waste has resulted in a good correlation coefficient (r = 0.884), which implies that LFST can serve as an indicator of the amount of solid waste buried in the landfill. Solid waste amount, methane emitted as well as meteorological parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and evaporation, were used to simulate and predict the value of landfill LFST using ANN. Validation of the ANN has resulted in a good correlation between the predicted and calculated values of the LFST.

AB  - Bamboo is an important plant not only because of its vital role in supporting biodiversity and land restoration, but also due to its contribution to poverty eradication. Although remote sensing has an advantage for monitoring vegetation, bamboo mapping is challenging due to the spectral similarity between bamboo and forest types. To overcome difficulties in bamboo mapping, we experimented with a phenology-based approach using dense Landsat time series data in Hainan Island, China. We constructed temporal profiles of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) for estimating the phenological variation among bamboo and adjacent forest types. We then compared the classification results under an all-season feature set and single-season feature sets. Our results indicated that the phenological variations of bamboo differed greatly from adjacent forest types, implying a good potential for bamboo identification. Compared to the conventional spectra-based approach, these results also emphasized the importance of phenological features. Validation using the k-fold (k = 10) approach showed this experiment achieved reasonable levels of accuracy for bamboo mapping (PA = 88.8%; UA = 74.6%). A bamboo distribution map in Hainan Island is useful to resource inventory in the second largest island in China. The success of the method in this tropical region suggests that it might be applicable to other parts of the tropical world.

TI  - Artificial neural network models to predict nodal status in clinically node-negative breast cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard staging procedure for nodal status in breast cancer, but lacks therapeutic benefit for patients with benign sentinel nodes. For patients with positive sentinel nodes, individualized surgical strategies are applied depending on the extent of nodal involvement. Preoperative prediction of nodal status is thus important for individualizing axillary surgery avoiding unnecessary surgery. We aimed to predict nodal status in clinically node-negative breast cancer and identify candidates for SLNB omission by including patient-related and pathological characteristics into artificial neural network (ANN) models.MethodsPatients with primary breast cancer were consecutively included between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 in a prospectively maintained pathology database. Clinical- and radiological data were extracted from patient's files and only clinically node-negative patients constituted the final study cohort. ANN-based models for nodal prediction were constructed including 15 risk variables for nodal status. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (HL) were used to assess performance and calibration of three predictive ANN-based models for no lymph node metastasis (N0), metastases in 1-3 lymph nodes (N1) and metastases in 4 lymph nodes (N2). Linear regression models for nodal prediction were calculated for comparison.ResultsEight hundred patients (N0, n=514; N1, n=232; N2, n=54) were included. Internally validated AUCs for N0 versus N+ was 0.740 (95% CI=0.723-0.758); median HL was 9.869 (P=0.274), for N1 versus N0, 0.705 (95% CI=0.686-0.724; median HL: 7.421; P=0.492) and for N2 versus N0 and N1, 0.747 (95% CI=0.728-0.765; median HL: 9.220; P=0.324). Tumor size and vascular invasion were top-ranked predictors of all three end-points, followed by estrogen receptor status and lobular cancer for prediction of N2. For each end-point, ANN models showed better discriminatory performance than multivariable logistic regression models. Accepting a false negative rate (FNR) of 10% for predicting N0 by the ANN model, SLNB could have been abstained in 27.25% of patients with clinically node-negative axilla.ConclusionsIn this retrospective study, ANN showed promising result as decision-supporting tools for estimating nodal disease. If prospectively validated, patients least likely to have nodal metastasis could be spared SLNB using predictive models.Trial registrationRegistered in the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN14341750.Date of registration 23/11/2018.

TI  - A dataset of 30 m annual vegetation phenology indicators (1985-2015) in urban areas of the conterminous United States
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Medium-resolution satellite observations show great potential for characterizing seasonal and annual dynamics of vegetation phenology in urban domains from local to regional and global scales. However, most previous studies were conducted using coarse-resolution data, which are inadequate for characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation phenology in urban domains. In this study, we produced an annual vegetation phenology dataset in urban ecosystems for the conterminous United States (US), using all available Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. First, we characterized the long-term mean seasonal pattern of phenology indicators of the start of season (SOS) and the end of season (EOS), using a double logistic model. Then, we identified the annual variability of these two phenology indicators by measuring the difference of dates when the vegetation index in a specific year reaches the same magnitude as its long-term mean. The derived phenology indicators agree well with in situ observations from the PhenoCam network and Harvard Forest. Comparing with results derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, our Landsat-derived phenology indicators can provide more spatial details. Also, we found the temporal trends of phenology indicators (e.g., SOS) derived from Landsat and MODIS are consistent overall, but the Landsat-derived results from 1985 offer a longer temporal span compared to MODIS from 2001 to present. In general, there is a spatially explicit pattern of phenology indicators from the north to the south in cities in the conterminous US, with an overall advanced SOS in the past 3 decades. The derived phenology product in the US urban domains at the national level is of great use for urban ecology studies for its medium spatial resolution (30 m) and long temporal span (30 years).

TI  - Forewarned is forearmed: harmonized approaches for early detection of potentially invasive pests and pathogens in sentinel plantings
T2  - NEOBIOTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of invasive alien pest and pathogen species affecting ecosystem functioning, human health and economies has increased dramatically over the last decades. Discoveries of invasive pests and pathogens previously unknown to science or with unknown host associations yet damaging on novel hosts highlights the necessity of developing novel tools to predict their appearance in hitherto naive environments. The use of sentinel plant systems is a promising tool to improve the detection of pests and pathogens before introduction and to provide valuable information for the development of preventative measures to minimize economic or environmental impacts. Though sentinel plantings have been established and studied during the last decade, there still remains a great need for guidance on which tools and protocols to put into practice in order to make assessments accurate and reliable. The sampling and diagnostic protocols chosen should enable as much information as possible about potential damaging agents and species identification. Consistency and comparison of results are based on the adoption of common procedures for sampling design and sample processing. In this paper, we suggest harmonized procedures that should be used in sentinel planting surveys for effective sampling and identification of potential pests and pathogens. We also review the benefits and limitations of various diagnostic methods for early detection in sentinel systems, and the feasibility of the results obtained supporting National Plant Protection Organizations in pest and commodity risk analysis.

AB  - A real-time algorithm is proposed to estimate hourly relative humidity at the surface level. The algorithm was developed with Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-13 and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The methodology is also designed to operate with the newer GOES-16 satellite data. The algorithm uses the brightness temperatures from the water vapour (6.7 mu m) channel and albedo from the near-infrared (3.9 mu m) channel to model short-term variations. The algorithm also includes three physical parameters extracted from satellites to complement the short-term variations of relative humidity at surface level. The parameters are: precipitable water (PW), land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Two years (2010-2011) of hourly data from 458 ground stations were used to build the model. Validation was conducted with 2012 (GOES-13) and 2018 (GOES-16) data. Stations are located in the Caribbean islands, including the Peninsula of Florida, and in Mesoamerica countries, including part of Mexico, Central America, Colombia, and Venezuela. A regression model was used to estimate relative humidity, and validation was performed over different rainfall seasons. Results show that the average mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and the coefficient of multiple determination were 7.4, 9.9, and 0.58, respectively.

TI  - A remote-sensing-based intensity-duration threshold, Faifa Mountains, Saudi Arabia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Construction of intensity-duration (ID) thresholds and early-warning and nowcasting systems for landslides (EWNSLs) are hampered by the paucity of temporal and spatial archival data. This work represents significant steps towards the development of a prototype EWNSL to forecast and nowcast landslides over the Faifa Mountains in the Red Sea Hills. The developed methodologies rely on readily available, temporal, archival Google Earth and Sentinel-1A imagery, precipitation measurements, and limited field data to construct an ID threshold for Faifa. The adopted procedures entail the generation of an ID threshold to identify the intensity and duration of precipitation events that cause landslides in the Faifa Mountains, and the generation of pixel-based ID curves to identify locations where movement is likely to occur. Spectral and morphologic variations in temporal Google Earth imagery following precipitation events were used to identify landslide-producing storms and generate the Faifa ID threshold (I = 4.89D(-0.65)). Backscatter coefficient variations in radar imagery were used to generate pixel-based ID curves and identify locations where mass movement is likely to occur following landslide-producing storms. These methodologies accurately distinguished landslide-producing storms from non-landslide-producing ones and identified the locations of these landslides with an accuracy of 60 %.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural networks for land-cover classification with Sentinel-2 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, analyzing satellite images requires an unsustainable amount of manual labor. Semiautomatic solutions for land-cover classification of satellite images entail the incorporation of expert knowledge. To increase the scalability of the built solutions, methods that automate image processing and analysis pipelines are required. Recently, deep learning (DL) models have been applied to challenging vision problems with great success. We expect that the use of DL models will soon outperform shallow networks and other classification algorithms, as recently achieved in multiple domains. Here, we consider the task of land-cover classification of satellite images. This seems particularly appropriate for deep classifiers due to the combined high dimensionality of the data with the presence of compositional dependencies between pixels, which can be used to characterize a particular class. We develop a pipeline for analyzing satellite images using a deep convolutional neural network for practical applications. We present its successful application for land-cover classification, where it achieves 86% classification accuracy on unseen raw images.

TI  - Slope-compensated interferogram filter with ESPRIT for adaptive frequency estimation
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric phase filtering represents an indispensable step in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data processing. However, conventional filtering methods fail to make a balance between the noise elimination and phase preserving in strong noise environments or dense fringe regions. This in turn leads to an inaccurate interferometric phase. To overcome this problem, the authors introduce the concept of slope-compensated filter based on the local adaptive frequency estimation. This method uses the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRITs), based on the singular value decomposition of the correlation matrix and generalised eigenvalue solution for providing an accurate local fringe frequency. Meanwhile, the size of the estimation window is adaptively determined by the coherence coefficient, and the judgement and modification of the invalid frequency estimation are utilised to further improve the accuracy of the local fringe frequency. Moreover, the authors consider a two-stage with the back projection technique to further eliminate the noise residual and improve the filtering performance. The simulated and TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM) data sets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that this method is capable of efficiently reducing the noise level as well as minimising the loss of the signal, outperforming other conventional methods.

TI  - Exploring the trend, prediction and driving forces of aerosols using satellite and ground data, and implications for climate change mitigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities-related aerosol emissions and CO2 emissions originate from many of the common sources. Identifying the aerosol variations and the underling determinates can provide insights into united mitigation policy controls targeting on both aerosol pollution and climate change. Long-term trend analysis and modeling offers an effective way to fully appreciate how aerosols interlink with carbon cycle and climate change. This study analyzes the current trends, models the future predictions, and investigates potential driving forces of aerosol loading at six sites across North America and East Asia during 2003-2015. Satellite-retrieved MODIS Collection 6 retrievals and ground measurements derived from AERONET are used. Results show that there is a persistent decreasing trend in AOD for both MODIS data and AERONET data at three sites. Monthly and seasonal AOD variations reveal consistent aerosol patterns at sites along mid-latitudes. Regional differences caused by impacts of climatology and land cover types are observed for the selected sites. Statistical validation of time series ARIMA models indicates that the non-seasonal ARIMA model performs better for AERONET AOD data than for MODIS AOD data at most sites, suggesting the method works better for data with higher quality. The seasonal ARIMA model reproduces time series with distinct seasonal variations much more precisely. The reasonably predicted AOD values could provide reliable estimates to better inform the decision-making for sustainable environmental management. Drawn from aerosol pollution control strategies, it is suggested that the enforcement of regulations on emission sources and the initiative of reforestation on emission sinks could have potential implications for climate change mitigation.

T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration is a significant conditioning factor for analysing variation of water quality. It is also an important indicator for examining phytoplankton and biomass both in inland and oceanic waters. The study aims at developing an approach to quantify chlorophyll-a concentration using Landsat-8 Optical land imager sensor data in Densu River, West Africa. Twelve water samples across Densu River were collected to measure chlorophyll-a concentration. Satellite data base chlorophyll-a concentration was determined using NIR-red algorithm. The chlorophyll-a concentration obtained through this algorithm was validated with laboratory-measured chlorophyll-a concentration. Regression analysis between laboratory-measured and modelled chlorophyll-a concentration revealed strong relationship. Thus, NIR-red algorithm has proved an effective tool in measuring and mapping chlorophyll-a concentration. The algorithm can also be utilised for assessing quality of different water bodies at spatial scales.

TI  - Detecting layer height of smoke aerosols over vegetated land and water surfaces via oxygen absorption bands: hourly results from EPIC/DSCOVR in deep space
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an algorithm for retrieving aerosol layer height (ALH) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) for smoke over vegetated land and water surfaces from measurements of the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). The algorithm uses Earth-reflected radiances in six EPIC bands in the visible and near-infrared and incorporates flexible spectral fitting that accounts for the specifics of land and water surface reflectivity. The fitting procedure first determines AOD using EPIC atmospheric window bands (443, 551, 680, and 780 nm), then uses oxygen (O-2) A and B bands (688 and 764 nm) to derive ALH, which represents an optical centroid altitude. ALH retrieval over vegetated surface primarily takes advantage of measurements in the O-2 B band. We applied the algorithm to EPIC observations of several biomass burning events over the United States and Canada in August 2017. We found that the algorithm can be used to obtain AOD and ALH multiple times daily over water and vegetated land surface. Validation is performed against aerosol extinction profiles detected by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and against AOD observed at nine Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites, showing, on average, an error of 0.58 km and a bias of -0:13 km in retrieved ALH and an error of 0.05 and a bias of 0.03 in retrieved AOD. Additionally, we show that the aerosol height information retrieved by the present algorithm can potentially benefit the retrieval of aerosol properties from EPIC's ultraviolet (UV) bands.

TI  - Explaining National Trends in Terrestrial Water Storage
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Access to fresh water is critical for human well-being, economic activity and, in some cases, political stability. Data fromthe Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has been used to monitor variability and trends in total water storage. This makes it possible to associate changes in water storage with both climate variability and large scale water management. Recent research has shown that these trends can be associated, globally, with rainfall, irrigation, and climate model predictions. This research indicates a need for further investigation into specific human predictors of trends in terrestrial water storage. This paper presents the first global scale analysis of GRACE trends focused on national scale socio-economic predictors of terrestrial water storage. We show that rainfall, irrigation, agricultural characteristics, and energy practices all contribute to GRACE trends, and the importance of each differs by country and region. Additionally, this work suggests that other factors such as GDP, population density, urbanization, and forest cover do not explain GRACE trends at a national level. Identifying these key predictors aids in understanding trends in water availability and for informing water management policy in a changing climate.

TI  - Wavelet-based analysis of ground deformation coupling satellite acquisitions (Sentinel-1, SMOS) and data from shallow and deep wells in Southwestern France
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquisitions of the Sentinel-1 satellite are processed and comprehensively analyzed to investigate the ground displacement during a three-year period above a double gas storage site (Lussagnet and Izaute) in Southwestern France. Despite quite low vertical displacements (between 4 and 8 mm) compared to the noise level, the cyclic motion reflects the seasonal variations due to charge and discharge during summer and winter periods, respectively. We can simulate the ground deformation at both storage sites by a simple mechanical model. However, ground movements of low-magnitude may be also induced by natural factors, such as the temperature or the soil moisture. Using a wavelet-based analysis, we show there is a soil expansion in the Lussagnet zone that contrasts both in phase and period with the seasonal deformation and that is linked to the surface soil moisture measured by the SMOS satellite. This other displacement is consistent with the water infiltration in the unsaturated zone followed by the swelling of a clay layer. This work reveals the combination of two different processes driving the ground displacement with the same order of magnitude (about 6 mm), namely the pressure variation of a deep gas reservoir and the swelling/shrinking of the shallow subsurface.

TI  - Modelling aboveground biomass in forest remnants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest using remote sensing, environmental and terrain-related data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the most threatened tropical regions in the world, exhibits high levels of terrestrial aboveground biomass (AGB). We propose a random forest approach to model, map and assess whether public lands provide protection for AGB in the Rio Doce watershed, one of the most important watercourses of the Atlantic Forest biome. We used 188 field plots and individual and hybrid features from remote sensing, environmental and terrain-related data. The hybrid model improved the AGB prediction by reducing the root mean square error to 33.43 Mg/ha and increasing the coefficient of determination (R-2) to 0.57. The total estimated AGB was 178,967,656.73 Mg, ranging from 20.40 to 167.72 Mg/ha following the seasonal precipitation pattern and anthropogenic disturbance effects. Only 5.76% of the total AGB was located on public protected lands, totalling 10,305,501 Mg, while most of the remaining AGB were located on private properties.

AB  - In this paper, an approach for estimating the soil moisture content (SMC) in arid environment in Tunisia is presented. In countries characterized by arid and semi-arid climate, it is very important to obtain reliable estimates of soil moisture evolution for water management purposes, in order to reduce water wastes and properly schedule agricultural practices. On the other hand, the retrieval of SMC is often hampered by the small humidity range (below 10%). A retrieval algorithm aiming at estimating the soil moisture and based on artificial neural networks (ANN) has therefore been implemented, using the data collected by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor of Sentinel-1. By taking advantage of the fast computation and high retrieval accuracy, ANN are able to generate reliable output maps of SMC starting from the complex SAR images and using little auxiliary information, as Digital Elevation Models, Local Incidence angle, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and so on. The peculiar strategy adopted for the training, which has been obtained by combining satellite measurements with data simulated by electromagnetic model (based on the Integral Equation Model, IEM), made this algorithm robust and almost site independent. The obtained results demonstrated that ANN represent a powerful tool for estimating SMC, provided that they have been trained with consistent datasets, made up by both experimental and theoretical data. The relationship of the algorithm validation between the estimated and measured SMC showed Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.77, and RMSE = 1.84%, in spite of the very low SMC values found on the area.

TI  - Integrating satellite soil-moisture estimates and hydrological model products over Australia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate soil-moisture monitoring is essential for water-resource management and agricultural applications, and is now widely undertaken using satellite remote sensing or terrestrial hydrological models' products. While both methods have limitations, e.g. the limited soil depth resolution of space-borne data and data deficiencies in models, data-assimilation techniques can provide an alternative approach. Here, we use the recently developed data-driven Kalman-Takens approach to integrate satellite soil-moisture products with those of the Australian Water Resources Assessment system Landscape (AWRA-L) model. This is done to constrain the model's soil-moisture simulations over Australia with those observed from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System and Soil-Moisture and Ocean Salinity between 2002 and 2017. The main objective is to investigate the ability of the integration framework to improve AWRA-L simulations of soil moisture. The improved estimates are then used to investigate spatiotemporal soil-moisture variations. The results show that the proposed model-satellite data integration approach improves the continental soil-moisture estimates by increasing their correlation to independent in situ measurements (similar to 10% relative to the non-assimilation estimates).

AB  - Mangroves in different part of the globe including world's largest halophytic population in Sundarban are under tremendous pressure due to global warming, sea level rise, natural disasters and ever-increasing influence of human population. In such an alarming situation conservation of mangrove population has been recommended by the experts. Species-level mapping of mangroves is one of the important steps for sustainable conservation of mangrove ecosystem. This study demonstrates the efficiency of a combination of Hyperion hyperspectral and IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV multispectral data for discriminating and mapping some mangrove species at Lothian Island and Saptamukhi Reserve Forest located in the western part of Sundarban Biosphere Reserve of India. The spectral signature drawn on Hyperion data helped to extrapolate field samples of various pure pixels of the mangrove plant species using a region growing approach. Those training samples were used to apply Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) classification on 5 m spatial resolution LISS-IV data. Mostly dominant mangrove species like Aegialitis rotundifolia, Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia community, Ceriops community, Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa and Phoenix paludosa have been successfully classified along with other associated landuse/landcover in these islands. The methodology used in the study has a huge potential in identification, mapping and management through restoration of mangroves in difficult terrain like the Sundarban.

TI  - The Ubiquity of Cross-Domain Thinking in the Early Phase of the Creative Process
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To what extent are creative processes in one domain (e.g., technology) affected by information from other domains (e.g., music)? While some studies of professional creators suggest that creative abilities are domain-specific, other studies suggest that creative avocations stimulate creativity. The latter is consistent with the predictions of the honing theory of creativity, according to which the iterative process culminating in a creative work is made possible by the self-organizing nature of a conceptual network, or worldview, and its innate holistic tendency to minimize inconsistency. As such, the creative process is not restricted to the creative domain; influences from domains other than that of the final product are predicted to impact the creative process and its outcome. To assess the prevalence of cross-domain influences on creativity we conducted two studies: one with creative experts, and one with undergraduate students from diverse academic backgrounds. Participants listed both their creative outputs, and the influences (sources of inspiration) associated with each of these outputs. In both studies, cross-domain influences on creativity were found to be widespread, and indeed more frequent than within-domain sources of inspiration. Thus, examination of the inputs to, rather than the outputs of, creative tasks supported the prediction of honing theory that cross-domain influences are a ubiquitous component of the creative process.

TI  - A Markov regime-switching regression approach to modelling NDVI from surface temperature and soil moisture

AB  - Building accurate relationships between vegetation amount and climatic variables is helpful in understanding and informing sustainable environmental management. The common approach in this regard is to develop a generic, linear relationship or season-dependent relationships. Such approaches, however, fail to hold if data characteristics deviate from expected patterns. This study applied a regime-switching regression model, namely the Markov-switching (MS) approach, to predict time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This was done using surface temperature, soil moisture and the interaction of surface temperature and soil moisture as regressors at monthly temporal resolution. Modelling was executed at the biome spatial (broad vegetation categories) scale. The results showed that the MS approach captured the non-linear dynamics in the data for each of the eight biomes considered in the study. The accuracy of the MS approach compared to non-switching modelling approach was evident in model comparison criteria including significance of parameter estimates, coefficient of determination (R-2), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and log-likelihood as well as post-modelling diagnostics such as residual plots, autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of residuals, and squared residuals. Overall, the study clearly demonstrates the superiority of MS modelling that captures non-linear relationships that may not be modelled using conventional non-switching modelling. Further studies are encouraged to test the approach at larger spatial scales.

TI  - "African Factors" in the Metamorphosis of Indigenous Pentecostalism in Ekitiland, Nigeria
T2  - BLACK THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pentecostalism is a renewal movement within Christianity that places primary emphasis on gifts of the Holy Spirit, joyful worship, exorcism and discourse on prosperity and the "born again" experience. African Pentecostalism is a segment of African Christianity that is proliferating at an exponential rate. It is the most widespread form of non-Roman Catholic Christianity in Africa today. In Ekitiland, which is predominantly a Christian milieu, indigenous Pentecostalism has become an increasingly prominent feature in the religious and political landscape of Ekiti-kete. The growth of indigenous Pentecostalism in Ekiti Communities has been particularly dramatic since the 1980s. Suffice it to say that, much of the worldviews underlying the important expressions of indigenous Pentecostalism in Ekiti communities like healing, "deliverance" exorcism and belief in spirits resonate with traditional African philosophical thoughts. This is an important factor that contributes to the growth of Indigenous Pentecostal Churches (IPCs) in Ekitiland.

TI  - Application of ET-NDVI-relationship approach and soil-water-balance modelling for the monitoring of irrigation performance of treed horticulture crops in a key fruit-growing district of Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were used to demonstrate the estimation of irrigation water requirement (rho) for treed horticulture crops in an important irrigation district of Australia. Crop- and region-specific relationship between satellite-derived evapotranspiration (ET) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was combined with daily step soil water balance to investigate the performance of horticulture crops for their water use during the peak irrigation demand period (summer) over three years from 2014-15 to 2016-17. Relative irrigation water use (RIWU) as the key irrigation performance indicator was calculated by comparing the irrigation water supply (psi) records and the rho estimates. psi and rho of the treed horticulture crops showed a strong positive correlation (Coefficient of determination, R-2 > 0.70; p < 0.001) for each of the three summer seasons investigated, indicating an overall consistency in irrigation pattern. However, the values of both rho and psi varied considerably at farm level over the seasons, highlighting the changing demand and supply of crop water over the years. Most farms remained within the optimal irrigation range (0.5-1.5 RIWU) over the seasons - 75% in 2014-15, 68% in 2015-16, and 80% in 2016-17. However, some farms were over-irrigated (>1.5 RIWU) - 12% in 2014-15, 5% in 2015-16, and 8% in 2016-17.

TI  - Ecological challenges for the buffer zone management of a West African National Park
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In sub-Saharan Africa, the management of buffer zones around protected areas does not often take into serious account the needs of resource exploitation by the local populations or the conservation needs of these areas. We described the ecological characteristics and management issues affecting the buffer zone around the Fazao-Malfakassa National Park; a 192,000-ha protected area in central-western Togo of utmost conservation importance within the Dahomey Gap region. Within the buffer zone (10 km radius, 334,800 ha), we focussed on four high conservation value areas totalling 65,594 ha (20% of the total buffer zone area). Using 2015 sentinel-2 images we analyzed land cover patterns and described existing ecological zones. We complemented these with field surveys and interviews with 300 people living in 22 villages within the buffer zone to describe the conditions affecting the resident human population. Although over 60% of the total buffer zone area is degraded, we identified four areas of high conservation value (total area = 65,594 ha). Interviewees recognized that slash-and-burn was the most common form of land use, followed by agroforestry practices. Agriculture, charcoal, and firewood production were the main drivers affecting habitats, and land conflicts were recurrent due to the rise in human population. The decline in agriculture, reported by interviewees in some sectors, was attributable to ravages of crops by elephants. Three independent diversity indices showed that, in preserved zones, a greater diversity of animals (with similar utilization frequencies) were hunted than in degraded sites (where grasscutters were the dominant hunted species). There were also significant differences between degraded and preserved zones in terms of plants used for charcoal production and for non-timber forest products. We advocate the development of community-controlled hunting areas to enhance the conservation value of the four well-preserved zones. Instead, promoting sustainable agricultural production systems in the degraded areas can help to further stabilize the agricultural front and reduce land pressure on the park.

TI  - Land-cover classification from multiple classifiers using decision fusion based on the probabilistic graphical model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method of using different classification algorithms in an integrated manner by adaptively weighted decision level fusion was proposed. The proposed fusion scheme involves two steps. First, we processed the data using each classifier separately and provided probability estimations for each pixel of the considered classes. Then, the results are aggregated on the basis of the decision rule of probabilistic graphical model according to the capabilities of classifiers and ancillary information. The method was tested and validated through the Landsat 8 operational land imager data using two different classifiers, namely, maximum likelihood classifier and support vector machine. The proposed method provided higher accuracy improvement than the separate use of different classifiers and that complex landscapes, such as mountainous regions, have higher accuracy improvement than the relatively homogenous ones. Moreover, the method can handle more than two types of classifiers and effectively introduce additional ancillary information for adaptive weight selection. These findings can help promote our proposed method as an emerging approach for land-cover classification through remote sensing technology.

TI  - Assessing the capability of broadband indices derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager to monitor above ground biomass and salinity in semiarid saline environments of the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, salinisation and desertification are the most common processes of land degradation, and satellite data may provide a valuable tool to assess land surface condition and vegetation status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) remote sensing information and broadband indices derived from it, to monitor above ground biomass (AGB) and salinity in two different semiarid saline environments (unit a and unit b) in the Bahia Blanca Estuary. Unit a (Ua) is composed of bushes of Cyclolepis genistoides in association with Atriplex undulata and 41% of bare soil. Unit b (Ub) is composed of dense thickets of Allenrolfea patagonica in association with C. genistoides and 34% of bare soil. Pearson's correlation analyses were performed between field estimates of AGB and salinity (soil salinity and interstitial water salinity) and remote sensing estimates. Satellite data include surface reflectance of individual bands, vegetation indices (NDVI [normalised difference vegetation index], SAVI [soil-adjusted vegetation index], MSAVI2 [modified soil-adjusted vegetation index], NDII [normalised difference infrared index], GNDVI [green normalised difference vegetation index], GRNDI [green-red normalised difference index], OSAVI [optimised soil-adjusted vegetation index], SR [simple ratio]), and salinity indices (SI1, SI2, SI3 [salinity index 1, 2 and 3, respectively] and BI [brightness index]). Correlation analyses involving AGB were performed twice; first considering all months and then again excluding the months with higher soil salinities. In Ua, soil adjusted vegetation indices SAVI and MSAVI2 showed to be suitable to detect changes in the total green AGB and C. genistoides green AGB (the major contributor to total green AGB). After excluding data from December and January (the months with the highest soil salinity), green AGB of A. undulata also showed a significant positive correlation with soil adjusted indices SAVI, MSAVI2 and OSAVI. Although proportionally this species was not a large contributor to the total biomass, it is characterised by a high leaf reflectance, which makes it suitable for biomass retrieval. In Ub, significant positive correlations were obtained between NDVI, SAVI, NDII, OSAVI and SR indices and the AGB green ratio, but significant negative correlations were obtained between A. patagonica red AGB and these vegetation indices. When December and January were excluded from the analysis the negative correlations between vegetation indices NDVI, OSAVI and SR and red AGB remained significant (r = -0.68, -0.76 and -0.7, respectively). The positive correlations between these indices and AGB green ratio (r = 0.73, 0.78 and 0.75, respectively) remained significant as well. Significant negative correlations were also found between NDVI, NDII, GNDVI, OSAVI and SR indices and field salinity estimates. As soil salinisation induces A. patagonica reddening, red AGB and soil salinity covariate in the field, and the negative correlation with vegetation indices may be useful to retrieve information on both variables combined, which are indicative of water stress. Correlation analysis between field estimates of salinity and spectral salinity indices showed significant positive correlation for all the tested indices. The obtained results highlight the importance of a thoughtful selection of remote sensing indices to account for changes in vegetation biomass, especially in arid and semiarid environments particularly sensitive to desertification and salinisation.Also, ground truth cannot be overlooked, and field work is necessary to test index performance in every case.

TI  - Study of upper ocean parameters during passage of tropical cyclones over Indian seas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary energy supply for tropical cyclones is the upward latent heat fluxes that are directly related to Sea Surface Temperatures (SST). The strong winds induce a negative SST anomaly in the tropical cyclone wake. This is usually referred to as the 'cold wake'. Many studies have suggested that the cold wake results in a significant reduction of upward latent heat fluxes that supply energy to the tropical cyclone, and hence provides a negative feedback on its intensity. The cold-wake feedback on the intensity of tropical cyclones is a strong motivation to understand the oceanic response to tropical cyclones. A recent study of re-examining the mechanisms controlling the cold wake has shown the importance of vertical Ekman pumping. Under the core of tropical cyclones (typically over a disk of 100 km radius), vertical pumping is responsible for a cooling of the entire water column, while surface heat fluxes and vertical mixing both contribute to the surface cooling during the cyclone passage. Farther away from the cyclone core, vertical mixing generally overwhelms the effect of vertical pumping, and also the effect of heat fluxes in the case of strong tropical cyclones. The study examines the Ekman pumping during the passage of few cyclonic storms in the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BOB) during last decade using different datasets such as Satellite (QuikScat) and reanalysis (ERA-Interim) data and calls up the value for satellite deliverables. Surface currents and subsurface temperature structure is examined further and for different Ekman pumping velocity (EPV), variable subsurface response is illustrated. The changes in ocean surface temperature, sea level and heat content obtained from the remote sensing data products, in the wake of cyclone are also reported and thus the usefulness of satellite products to study the coupled tropical system is demonstrated.

TI  - Modeling Atmosphere-Ocean Radiative Transfer: A PACE Mission Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The research frontiers of radiative transfer (RT) in coupled atmosphere-ocean systems are explored to enable new science and specifically to support the upcoming Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite mission. Given (i) the multitude of atmospheric and oceanic constituents at any given moment that each exhibits a large variety of physical and chemical properties and (ii) the diversity of light-matter interactions (scattering, absorption, and emission), tackling all outstanding RT aspects related to interpreting and/or simulating light reflected by atmosphere-ocean systems becomes impossible. Instead, we focus on both theoretical and experimental studies of RT topics important to the science threshold and goal questions of the PACE mission and the measurement capabilities of its instruments. We differentiate between (a) forward (FWD) RT studies that focus mainly on sensitivity to influencing variables and/or simulating data sets, and (b) inverse (INV) RT studies that also involve the retrieval of atmosphere and ocean parameters. Our topics cover (1) the ocean (i.e., water body): absorption and elastic/inelastic scattering by pure water (FWD RT) and models for scattering and absorption by particulates (FWD RT and INV RT); (2) the air-water interface: variations in ocean surface refractive index (INV RT) and in whitecap reflectance (INV RT); (3) the atmosphere: polarimetric and/or hyperspectral remote sensing of aerosols (INV RT) and of gases (FWD RT); and (4) atmosphere-ocean systems: benchmark comparisons, impact of the Earth's sphericity and adjacency effects on space-borne observations, and scattering in the ultraviolet regime (FWD RT). We provide for each topic a summary of past relevant (heritage) work, followed by a discussion (for unresolved questions) and RT updates.

TI  - Two Distinct E2F Transcriptional Modules Drive Cell Cycles and Differentiation
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Orchestrating cell-cycle-dependent mRNA oscillations is critical to cell proliferation in multicellular organisms. Even though our understanding of cell-cycle-regulated transcription has improved significantly over the last three decades, the mechanisms remain untested in vivo. Unbiased transcriptomic profiling of G(0), G(1)-S, and S-G(2)-M sorted cells from FUCCI mouse embryos suggested a central role for E2Fs in the control of cell-cycle-dependent gene expression. The analysis of gene expression and E2F-tagged knockin mice with tissue imaging and deep-learning tools suggested that post-transcriptional mechanisms universally coordinate the nuclear accumulation of E2F activators (E2F3A) and canonical (E2F4) and atypical (E2F8) repressors during the cell cycle in vivo. In summary, we mapped the spatiotemporal expression of sentinel E2F activators and canonical and atypical repressors at the single-cell level in vivo and propose that two distinct E2F modules relay the control of gene expression in cells actively cycling (E2F3A-8-4) and exiting the cycle (E2F3A-4) during mammalian development.

TI  - Layered compressive sensing reconstruction for non-scanning three-dimensional laser imaging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an active remote-sensing technique, three-dimensional (3D) laser radar enables accurate target detection and identification. However, the resolution of obtained image is limited by the integrated level of the sensor array. In this article, we propose a layered compressive sensing reconstruction method for high-resolution 3D laser imaging. The range profile is first reconstructed by applying a designed range observation matrix to the original sampling data. According to the distribution of range values in the reconstructed range profile, the original sampling data are divided into several layers and the corresponding intensity images are reconstructed by different algorithms. The global intensity image is generated by the reconstructed intensity images with different range compensation coefficients. In our simulations based on real data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2 (ASTER GDEM V2) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), the proposed method realised 3D laser imaging for complex landforms with a pixel resolution of , and reached a satisfactory performance for reconstructions of the range profile (peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) = 33.08 dB, feature similarity (FSIM) = 0.9450) and the intensity image (PSNR = 20.63 dB, FSIM = 0.8893) with a subrate of 0.25.

TI  - A new image classification approach for mapping coral density in State of Kuwait using high spatial resolution satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology can be a valuable tool for mapping coral reef ecosystems. However, the resolution capabilities of remote sensors, the diversity and complexity of coral reef ecosystems, and the low reflectivity of marine environments increase the difficulties in identifying and classifying their features. This research study explores the capability of high spatial resolution (WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Pleiades-1B) and low spatial resolution (Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat 8)) multispectral (MS) satellite sensors in quantitatively mapping coral density. The Kubbar coral reef ecosystem, located in Kuwait's southern waters, was selected as the research site. The MS imagery of WV-2, Pleiades-1B and Landsat 8 were, after geometric and radiometric assessment and corrections, subjected to new image classification approach using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis. The new approach of MLR coral density analysis used the dependent variable of coral density percentage from ground truth and independent variables of spectral reflectance from selected imagery, depth (as estimated from a surface derived from bathymetric charts) and distance to land or reef unit centre. Accuracy assessment using independent ground truth was performed for the selected approach and satellite sensors to determine the quality of the information derived from image classification processes. The results showed that coral density maps developed using the MLR coral density model proved to have some level of reliability (radiometrically corrected WV-2 image (the coefficient determination denoted as R-squared (R-2) = 0.5, Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) = 10) and radiometrically corrected Pleiades-1B image (R-2 = 0.8, RMSE = 10)). This study suggested using high spectral resolution data and including additional factors (variables) (e.g. water turbidity, temperature and salinity) could contribute to improving the accuracy of coral density maps produced by application of the MLR model; however, all of these would add cost and effort to the mapping process. The outcomes of this research study provide coral reef ecosystem researchers, managers, and decision makers a tool to determine and map coral reef density in more detail than in the past. It will help quantify coral density at particular points in time leading to estimates of change, and allow coral reef ecologists to identify the current coral reef habitat health status, distribution and extent.

TI  - Detection of rainstorm pattern in arid regions using MODIS NDVI time series analysis
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to delineate potential water suppliers west of the Arabian Peninsula. Time series NDVI data extracted from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer NDVI product were used to develop a robust estimate of rainstorm frequency and intensity. A total of 216 NDVI images were acquired between February 2000 and January 2018 to carry out this investigation. As NDVI values of negative records correspond to water, it was possible to address and delineate the occurrence and duration of temporal ponded water. Results showed that at least 7 locations are potential to harvest water from flashfloods. Some locations witnessed 10, 11 and 13 rainstorms and ponding of water ranged from 1 to 20 months. These locations, if properly managed, could sustain a fresh water resource for local uses. The study demonstrates that NDVI time series curves could help identify the time/duration of previous rainstorms.

TI  - An agent-based extension for object-based image analysis for the delineation of irrigated agriculture from remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly developed image interpretation approach of agent-based image classification combines the advantages of object-based image classification and expert knowledge. Agent-based classification identifies meaningful objects by autonomous software units that alter their spatial extent and composition to adapt to a changing environment and data availability. Agents deliver highly variable classification results of a remotely sensed scene. Although the approach has proven its general ability, the use of agent-based image classification studies is sparse. With this study, we want to introduce this concept to water resource management in form of the detection of irrigated agriculture. In this study, we present the fundament of an agent-based image classification framework in terms of agriculture and irrigation management that shows promising results. In contrast to pixel-based classification approaches, the agent-based classification uses the shape and the relation of an image object to other image objects to improve classification results. To incorporate the possibility of erroneous classification due to threshold behaviour, a strict and a soft formulation for class membership are applied. The results show that the object- and agent-based approaches both deliver similar results as a traditional pixel-wise classification approach, but improve the completeness of the classes. In this case study, the different formulations have only little influence on the general results, but remain a promising addition to the classification approach. The here presented classification strategy is sensitive to changes in the underlying classification scheme. Nevertheless, this framework is an ideal addition to the toolset of image interpretation especially in natural systems that are affected by human behaviour like irrigated agriculture.

TI  - Multi-sensor mapping of honey bee habitats and fragmentation in agro-ecological landscapes in Eastern Kenya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive land transformation leads to habitat loss, which directly affects and fragments species habitats. Such land transformations can adversely affect fodder availability for bees and thus colony strength with consequences for rural communities that use bee keeping as a livelihood option. Quantification of the landscape structure is thus critical if the linkages between the landscape and honey bee colony health are to be well understood. In this study, a random forest algorithm was used on dual-polarized multi-season Sentinel-1A (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and single season Sentinel-2A (S2) optical imagery to map honey bee habitats and their degree of fragmentation in a heterogeneous agro-ecological landscape in eastern Kenya. The dry season S2 optical imagery was fused with the S1 data and class-wise mapping accuracies (with and without radar) were compared. Relevant fragmentation indices representing patch sizes, isolation and configuration were thereafter generated using the fused imagery. The fused imagery recorded an overall accuracy of 86% with a kappa of 0.83 versus the SAR imagery only, which had an overall accuracy of 76% with a kappa of 0.68. However, the S1 imagery had slightly higher user's and producer's accuracies for under-represented but important honey bee habitat classes, that is, natural grasslands and hedges. The variable importance analysis using the fused imagery showed that the short-wave infrared and the red-edge waveband regions were highly relevant for the classification model. Our mapping approach showed that fusing data generated from S1 and S2 with improved spectral resolution, could be effectively used for the spatially explicit mapping of honey bee habitats and their degree of fragmentation in semi-arid African agro-ecological landscapes.

TI  - Population Dynamics of Thermotolerant <i>Campylobacter</i> in Broilers Reared on Reused Litter
T2  - FOODBORNE PATHOGENS AND DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - A study using sentinel broiler chickens was performed to address Campylobacter persistence in litter that was reused for successive flocks. Cloacal swabs, litter, drag swabs, darkling beetles, feed, and drinking water were weekly sampled and analyzed by standard microbiological procedures. Thermotolerant Campylobacter isolated strains were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. Campylobacter was not detected in samples collected immediately after downtime between broiler flocks. However, Campylobacter-positive samples were first detected at 21 d. After Campylobacter was initially isolated from the cloacal swabs, reused litter, drag swabs, or darkling beetles, these samples remained Campylobacter positive in the following weeks until the end of the rearing period. Campylobacter-positive cloacal swabs obtained from sentinel broilers ranged from 97.3% to 100% at 42 d. All isolated strains were identified as Campylobacter jejuni. Among the subtypes identified, an indistinguishable C. jejuni strain was predominant in sentinel broilers and was also detected in the other environmental samples analyzed, suggesting a common and persistent contamination source within the flocks. Sentinel broilers may have contributed to amplify the Campylobacter level, maintaining flock and broiler house contamination until the end of the production cycle.

TI  - Characterisation of aerosol constituents from wildfires using satellites and model data: a case study in Knysna, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong winds and dry conditions make it difficult to contain wild fires worldwide. Such fires could cause devastating effects on landscape structures around many urban/peri-urban areas. The greater impact of such fires is commonly felt when landscape elements such as forest vegetation biomass fuel increase the wild fire risk to people and their properties. In order to mitigate the impact of a wild fire at local level, it is imperative to understand its spatial distribution and fuel load dynamics surrounding it. This study aimed at exploring the possibility of integrating various satellites and model data to characterise the aerosols emissions from wild fires which occurred at Knysna (South Africa). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Intergrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) model were employed to characterise the Knysna fires, and the resultant atmospheric conditions that prevailed at altitudes lower than 10 km. Large flames and high amounts of smoke were observed at the Knysna forests by the Sentinel-2 optical data. Our findings showed that there was an apparent reduction in the green vegetation biomass coverage of up to 20.2% following the wildfires as observed by Sentinel-2 data analysis. Biomass burning (BB) aerosols and smoke were observed to reach high altitudes of 2-4 km by CALIPSO. Pyrocumulus clouds were also observed at altitudes of 7.2 km. These clouds were a result of the mixing of the smoke and clouds in the mid-troposphere. The HYSPLIT model and MERRA-2 model showed that the emitted BB aerosols and smoke did not travel inland but rather dispersed in an eastward and south-eastward direction into the Indian Ocean from the source. A multi-satellite data approach proved to be a valuable resource to study the extent of wild fires and to determine their atmospheric impact and thus contributing to climate change. The transport models data was resourceful in determining the destination of the wild fires emissions.

TI  - The influence of river discharge and wind on Patos Lagoon, Brazil, Suspended Particulate Matter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eight years (2008-2015) of reflectance data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) - Aqua sensor are used to quantify Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) distribution and variability in Brazil's Patos Lagoon. After application of an atmospheric correction suitable for extremely turbid coastal water and calculation of SPM concentrations from the reflectance values using an established algorithm, the daily remote sensing data were averaged into eight-day and monthly composites. The climatological patterns show a gradient from higher concentrations in the north to lower concentration in the south, with highest concentrations in austral spring and summer and lowest in autumn and winter. Strong interannual variability shows 2009 and 2012 to have the highest SPM concentrations and 2010 and 2014 to have the lowest. Time series of SPM were then compared with the main forces to the lagoon circulation (wind and river discharge). Peaks in SPM are associated with peaks in river discharge. Maximum SPM occurred following peaks in river discharge combined with strong northeast (NE) winds, suggesting that freshwater input and direction-specific winds are the major mechanisms of sediment transport in Patos Lagoon.

TI  - Bigger and Better? Representativeness of the Influenza A Surveillance Using One Consolidated Clinical Microbiology Laboratory Data Set as Compared to the Belgian Sentinel Network of Laboratories
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Infectious diseases remain a serious public health concern globally, while the need for reliable and representative surveillance systems remains as acute as ever. The public health surveillance of infectious diseases uses reported positive results from sentinel clinical laboratories or laboratory networks, to survey the presence of specific microbial agents known to constitute a threat to public health in a given population. This monitoring activity is commonly based on a representative fraction of the microbiology laboratories nationally reporting to a single central reference point. However, in recent years a number of clinical microbiology laboratories (CML) have undergone a process of consolidation involving a shift toward laboratory amalgamation and closer real-time informational linkage. This report aims to investigate whether such merging activities might have a potential impact on infectious diseases surveillance. Influenza data was used from Belgian public health surveillance 2014-2017, to evaluate whether national infection trends could be estimated equally as effectively from only just one centralized CML serving the wider Brussels area (LHUB-ULB). The overall comparison reveals that there is a close correlation and representativeness of the LHUB-ULB data to the national and international data for the same time periods, both on epidemiological and molecular grounds. Notably, the effectiveness of the LHUB-ULB surveillance remains partially subject to local regional variations. A subset of the Influenza samples had their whole genome sequenced so that the observed epidemiological trends could be correlated to molecular observations from the same period, as an added-value proposition. These results illustrate that the real-time integration of high-throughput whole genome sequencing platforms available in consolidated CMLs into the public health surveillance system is not only credible but also advantageous to use for future surveillance and prediction purposes. This can be most effective when implemented for automatic detection systems that might include multiple layers of information and timely implementation of control strategies.

TI  - Augmenting camera images with gamma detector data: A novel approach to support sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - EJNMMI PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSquamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region is one of the most widespread cancers with high morbidity. Classic treatment comprises the complete removal of the lymphatics together with the cancerous tissue. Recent studies have shown that such interventions are only required in 30% of the patients. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an alternative method to stage the malignancy in a less invasive manner and to avoid overtreatment. In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables a future augmented reality device which improves the biopsy procedure by visual means.MethodsWe propose a co-calibration scheme for axis-aligned miniature cameras with pinholes of a gamma ray collimating and sensing device and show results gained by experiments, based on a calibration target visible for both modalities.ResultsVisual inspection and quantitative evaluation of the augmentation of optical camera images with gamma information are congruent with known gamma source landmarks.ConclusionsCombining a multi-pinhole collimator with axis-aligned miniature cameras to augment optical images using gamma detector data is promising. As such, our approach might be applicable for breast cancer and melanoma staging as well, which are also based on sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Towards automated mapping and monitoring of potentially dangerous glacial lakes in Bhutan Himalaya using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of glacial lakes around the world are located in remote and hardly accessible regions. The use of remote sensing data is therefore of high importance to identify and assess their potential hazards. However, the persistence of cloud cover, particularly in high mountain areas such as the Himalayas, limits the temporal resolution of optical satellite data with which we can monitor potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs). The ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites to collect data, irrespective of weather and at day or night, facilitates monitoring of PDGLs by without compromising temporal resolution. In this study, we present a semi-automated approach, based on a radar signal intensity threshold between water and non-water feature classes followed by post-processing including elevations, slopes, vegetation and size thresholds, to delineate glacial lakes in Sentinel-1 SAR images in Bhutan Himalaya. We show the capability of our method to be used for delineating and monitoring glacial lakes in Bhutan Himalaya by comparing our results to 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 multispectral data, field survey data, meteorological data, and a time series of monthly images from January to December 2016 of two lakes. Sentinel-1 SAR data can, moreover, be used for detecting lake surface area changes and open water area variations, at temporal resolution of six days, providing substantial advantages over optical satellite data to continuously monitor PDGLs.

TI  - Exploring the addition of Landsat 8 thermal band in land-cover mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One focus of remote-sensing studies is obtaining highly accurate land-cover maps, which is essential for quantifying and monitoring changes in the environment. However, thermal data, which can provide auxiliary information, is often ignored in land-cover classification. In this study we compare the performance of different remote-sensing feature combinations with and without the Landsat 8 thermal band (band 10). The results show that overall the thermal feature had a positive effect on mapping land cover. A combination of spectral features, indices and the thermal feature maximized the improvement in accuracy. The proposed classifier was applied to map land cover in an area in Egypt. The thermal feature significantly reduced the confusion between cropland and wetland. The improvement in accuracy obtained by adding the thermal feature was analysed in a time series spanning 1 year. We found that the thermal feature improved the classification accuracy when temperature variations occurred among the different land-cover types. The effect of the thermal feature was also influenced by the land cover; in cloudless conditions, warmer weather can enhance the accuracy improvement of the thermal feature.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Freely-available satellite data streams and the ability to process these data on cloud-computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine have made frequent, large-scale landcover mapping at high resolution a real possibility. In this paper we apply these technologies, along with machine learning, to the mapping of peatlands-a landcover class that is critical for preserving biodiversity, helping to address climate change impacts, and providing ecosystem services, e.g., carbon storage-in the Boreal Forest Natural Region of Alberta, Canada. We outline a data-driven, scientific framework that: compiles large amounts of Earth observation data sets (radar, optical, and LiDAR); examines the extracted variables for suitability in peatland modelling; optimizes model parameterization; and finally, predicts peatland occurrence across a large boreal area (397, 958 km(2)) of Alberta at 10 m spatial resolution (equalling 3.9 billion pixels across Alberta). The resulting peatland occurrence model shows an accuracy of 87% and a kappa statistic of 0.57 when compared to our validation data set. Differentiating peatlands from mineral wetlands achieved an accuracy of 69% and kappa statistic of 0.37. This data-driven approach is applicable at large geopolitical scales (e.g., provincial, national) for wetland and landcover inventories that support long-term, responsible resource management.

TI  - A high-resolution spatial assessment of the impacts of drought variability on vegetation activity in Spain from 1981 to 2015
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a major driver of vegetation activity in Spain, with significant impacts on crop yield, forest growth, and the occurrence of forest fires. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of vegetation to drought conditions differs largely amongst vegetation types and climates. We used a high-resolution (1.1 km) spatial dataset of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the whole of Spain spanning the period from 1981 to 2015, combined with a dataset of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) to assess the sensitivity of vegetation types to drought across Spain. Specifically, this study explores the drought timescales at which vegetation activity shows its highest response to drought severity at different moments of the year. Results demonstrate that - over large areas of Spain - vegetation activity is controlled largely by the interannual variability of drought. More than 90% of the land areas exhibited statistically significant positive correlations between the NDVI and the SPEI during dry summers (JJA). Nevertheless, there are some considerable spatio-temporal variations, which can be linked to differences in land cover and aridity conditions. In comparison to other climatic regions across Spain, results indicate that vegetation types located in arid-regions showed the strongest response to drought. Importantly, this study stresses that the timescale at which drought is assessed is a dominant factor in understanding the different responses of vegetation activity to drought.

TI  - Discrimination of Senescent Vegetation Cover from Landsat-8 OLI Imagery by Spectral Unmixing in the Northern Mixed Grasslands
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mixed grasslands of North America are ecosystems with a high volume of dead biomass. This characteristic underlies key ecosystem features such as the rate of carbon and nutrient uptake, heat flux exchange between the surface and the atmosphere, and wildlife habitat. Senescent vegetation is an important forage resource for grazing animals and is related to natural fire frequency and intensity. Therefore, quantitative estimation of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), senescent vegetation (NPV), and bare soil (BS) fraction is important for natural resource management. The authors propose an approach for extracting PV, NPV, and BS endmembers from the normalized difference vegetation index-dead fuel index (NDVI-DFI) plane by using the Landsat-8 imagery. The constrained linear spectral unmixing model was applied to discriminate NPV, PV, and BS using original spectral bands, NDVI-DFI indices, and original spectral plus NDVI and DFI indices. As a comparison, the traditional NDVI-SWIR32 was also investigated. Results showed that the DFI performed better than the SWIR32 to predict NPV from spectral unmixing. Index selection has a significant effect on NPV and BS cover fraction estimation. Choice of equation setup has a significant effect on the PV estimation. The methods proposed here can be applied to grassland ecosystems across the northern mixed grasslands region.

TI  - Characterization and application of artificial light sources for nighttime aerosol optical depth retrievals using the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using nighttime observations from Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night band (DNB), the characteristics of artificial light sources are evaluated as functions of observation conditions, and incremental improvements are documented on nighttime aerosol retrievals using VIIRS DNB data on a regional scale. We find that the standard deviation of instantaneous radiance for a given artificial light source is strongly dependent upon the satellite viewing angle but is weakly dependent on lunar fraction and lunar angle. Retrieval of nighttime aerosol optical thickness (AOT) based on the novel use of these artificial light sources is demonstrated for three selected regions (United States, Middle East and India) during 2015. Reasonable agreement is found between nighttime AOTs from the VIIRS DNB and temporally adjacent daytime AOTs from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) as well as from coincident nighttime AOT retrievals from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), indicating the potential of this method to begin filling critical gaps in diurnal AOT information at both regional and global scales. Issues related to cloud, snow and ice contamination during the winter season, as well as data loss due to the misclassification of thick aerosol plumes as clouds, must be addressed to make the algorithm operationally robust.

TI  - DInSAR Analysis and Analytical Modeling of Mount Etna Displacements: The December 2018 Volcano-Tectonic Crisis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the 24-27 December 2018 eruption of Mount Etna occurred from fissures located on the volcano eastern flank and accompanied by a seismic swarm, which was triggered by the magma intrusion and continued for weeks after the end of the eruption. Moreover, this swarm involved some of the shallow volcano-tectonic structures located on the Mount Etna flanks and culminated on 26 December with the strongest event (M-L 4.8), occurred along the Fiandaca Fault. In this work, we analyze seismological data and Sentinel-1 Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) measurements, the latter inverted through analytical modeling. Our results suggest that a dike source intruded, promoting the opening of the eruptive fissures fed by a shallower dike. Moreover, our findings indicate that the activation of faults in different sectors of the volcano may be considered as a response to accommodate the deformations induced by the magma volumes injection.

TI  - An Examination of Temperature Trends at High Elevations Across the Tibetan Plateau: The Use of MODIS LST to Understand Patterns of Elevation-Dependent Warming
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Research has revealed systematic changes in warming rates with elevation (EDW) in mountain regions. However, weather stations on the Tibetan plateau are mostly located at lower elevations (3,000-4,000 m) and are nonexistent above 5,000 m, leaving critical temperature changes unknown. Satellite LST (Land Surface Temperature) can fill this gap but needs calibrating against in situ air temperatures (T-air). We develop a novel statistical model to convert LST to T-air, developed at 87 high-elevation Chinese Meteorological Administration stations. T-air (daily maximum/minimum temperatures) is compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua LST (1330 and 0130 local time) for 8-day composites during 2002-2017. Typically, 80-95% of the difference between LST and T-air (Delta T) is explained using predictors including LST diurnal range, morning heating/nighttime cooling rates, the number of cloud free days/nights, and season (solar angle). LST is corrected to more closely represent T-air by subtracting modeled Delta T. We validate the model using an AWS on Zhadang Glacier (5800 m). Trend analysis at the 87 stations (2002-2017) shows corrected LST trends to be similar to original T-air trends. To examine regional contrasts in EDW patterns, elevation profiles of corrected LST trends are derived for three ranges (Qilian Mountains, NyenchenTanglha, and Himalaya). There is limited EDW in the Qilian mountains. Maximum warming is observed around 4,500-5,500 m in NyenchenTanglha, consistent with snowline retreat. In common with other studies, there is stabilization of warming at very high elevations in the Himalaya, including absolute cooling above 6,000 m, but data there are compromised by frequent cloud.

TI  - In Search of Red <i>Noctiluca scintillans</i> Blooms in the East China Sea
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Red Noctiluca scintillans (RNS) is one of the major species causing red tides and bioluminescence, yet extremely difficult to track due to its ephemeral nature. Here, we show that RNS can be fingerprinted from satellite data due to its unique absorption and scattering properties. Retrospective analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data of 2000-2017 over the East China Sea reveals seasonal patterns and interannual changes as well as an increasing RNS bloom trend, all driven by hydrographical and biological factors and possibly by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Unlike earlier reports from field measurements, RNS blooms are found in both coastal and offshore waters of the ECS, to at least 126 degrees E (> 330 km from the Yangtze River mouth). RNS blooms are also found in August and September where water temperature of 28-30 degrees C is well beyond the earlier reported range of 10-25 degrees C.

TI  - Remote sensing application to estimate fish kills by Saprolegniasis in a reservoir
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Saprolegniasis is one of the most economical and ecologically harmful diseases in different species of fish. Low water temperature is one of the most important factors which increases stress and creates favourable conditions for the proliferation of Saprolegniasis. Therefore, the monitoring of water surface temperature (WST) is fundamental for a better understanding of Saprolegniasis. The objective of this study was to develop a predictive algorithm to estimate the probability of fish kills caused by Saprolegniasis in Rio Tercero reservoir (Argentina). WST was estimated by Landsat 7 and 8 imagery using the Single-Channel method. Logistic regression was used to relate WST estimated from 2007 to 2017 with different episodes of fish kills by Saprolegniasis registered in the reservoir during this period of time. Results showed that the algorithm created with the first quartile (25th percentile) of the WST values estimated by Landsat sensors was the most suitable model to estimate Saprolegniasis in the studied reservoir.

TI  - Combination of GNSS, satellite InSAR, and GBInSAR remote sensing monitoring to improve the understanding of a large landslide in high alpine environment
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of large landslides in high alpine environments is often hindered by the difficult accessibility of the mountainous terrain. Efforts are typically concentrated on the remote measurement of the surface displacements, in order to define the general slope dynamics and identify phases of increasing activity. The characterization of such phenomena is challenging, due to their complex nature as well as the limitations of monitoring techniques. Appropriately integrating monitoring data from different sources can help reduce uncertainties, yet it is seldom done. In this paper, the outcomes of GNSS, satellite InSAR and GBInSAR campaigns performed at the Bosmatto landslide (Northwestern Alps, Italy) are presented. The joint analysis provided a comprehensive view of the deformation field of the landslide, which revealed a gradually decreasing dip angle of the calculated movement vectors from head to toe. The instability was interpreted as a 2.5 - 3.5 * 10(6) m(3) rockslide, moving at peak velocities >50 mm/y according to a broadly roto-translational mechanism. The impact of the seasonal snow cover on the reliability of the interferometric acquisitions was also evaluated. Advantages and implications offered by the combination of multiple monitoring techniques are highlighted. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping dynamics of soil organic matter in croplands with MODIS data and machine learning algorithms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important indicator of soil quality, soil organicmatter (SOM) significantly contributes to land productivity and ecosystemhealth. Accuratelymapping SOMat regional scales is of critical importance for sustainable agriculture and soil utilization management and remains a grand challenge. Many studies used soil sampling data and machine learning algorithms to predict SOM at regional scales for a given year, while few studies mapped SOM formultiple years and examined its temporal dynamics. We compared the performance of fourmachine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), bagging decision tree (BDT), randomforest (RF), and gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) in mapping SOM in Hubei province, China over the 18-year period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that RF and DT had the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) (0.61) and the lowest potential bias (9.48 g/kg), respectively, while GBRT had the lowest mean error (ME) (1.26 g/kg), root mean squared error (RMSE) (5.41 g/kg) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) (0.72). The SOM map based on GBRT better captured the distribution of the soil sample data than that based on RF. The trained GBRT model and the spatially explicitly data on explanatory variables (e.g., climate, terrain, remote sensing) were used to predict SOM for each 500 m x 500 m grid cell in Hubei for the period from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed that the SOM content of cropland was relatively high in the southeast and relatively low in the north. The SOM content in the topsoil varied from 0.89 to 58.86 g/kg and was averaged at 20.52 g/kg. The mean cropland SOM content of the province exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2017 with an increase of 0.26 g/kg and a growth rate of 1.28%. Spatially, the SOMcontent increased in southernHubei and decreased in central and northern parts of the province. A large portion of the areas with decreasing SOM content in northern Hubei was reclaimed cropland, while a large part of the high-quality cropland with rising SOM content in the east (similar to 0.45 x 10(4) ha) was lost due to land use change (e.g., urbanization).

TI  - High-frequency observation of floating algae from AHI on Himawari-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8 (H8) is a geostationary meteorological satellite launched by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and is now operated by JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency). It takes measurements at a temporal resolution of 10 min for full disk view. Although designed as a meteorological satellite, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard H8 has three visible (460, 510 and 640 nm), one near infrared (860 nm) and two shortwave infrared bands (1610 and 2257 nm) to observe the Earth system. In this study, the Floating Algae Index (FAI) developed for ocean color satellites (Hu, 2009) is adapted to process AHI data for the first time and applied for waters of Lake Taihu, China. For a total of 18 near-cloud-free images, a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.92 was obtained between the algae area derived from AHI FAI and that from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FAI, and the mean percentage difference is similar to 5% in algae coverage. More concurrent images (n = 80) were collected for a comparison between AHI and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), as GOCI is also a geostationary satellite, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and percentage deviation of similar to 8% in observed algae coverage. These results indicate that H8/AHI can obtain reliable observations of floating algae at ultrahigh temporal resolutions (10 min). Especially, such ultrahigh-frequency measurements show that part of Lake Taihu (e.g., Meiliang Bay) experienced more frequent events of floating algae (mostly > 60%) than that observed by GOCI (generally < 40%). These results indicate that ultrahigh-frequency measurements are important not only for efficient environmental monitoring but also for the scientific understanding of algae dynamics.

TI  - 40-Year (1978-2017) human settlement changes in China reflected by impervious surfaces from satellite remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces are the most significant feature of human settlements. Timely, accurate, and frequent information on impervious surfaces is critical in both social-economic and natural environment applications. Over the past 40 years, impervious surface areas in China have grown rapidly. However, annual maps of impervious areas in China with high spatial details do not exist during this period. In this paper, we made use of reliable impervious surface mapping algorithms that we published before and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to address this data gap. With available data in GEE, we were able to map impervious surfaces over the entire country circa 1978, and during 1985-2017 at an annual frequency. The 1978 data were at 60-m resolution, while the 1985-2017 data were in 30-m resolution. For the 30-m resolution data, we evaluated the accuracies for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Overall accuracies reached more than 90%. Our results indicate that the growth of impervious surface in China was not only fast but also considerably exceeding the per capita impervious surface area in developed countries like Japan. The 40-year continuous and consistent impervious surface distribution data in China would generate widespread interests in the research and policy-making community.

TI  - A long-term and comprehensive assessment of the urbanization-induced impacts on vegetation net primary productivity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization not only directly alters the regional ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) through land-cover replacement, but it is also accompanied by huge indirect impacts due to the associated climate change and anthropogenic activities. However, to date, limited efforts have been made to quantitatively separate the two types of urbanization impacts, and the continuous variations over a long-time span are not well understood. In this study, both the long-term direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on NPP were established and analyzed based onmulti-source remote sensing data, taking the city of Kunming in China as a case study area. The results indicated that the intense urbanization process has led to a continuous decrease in NPP from 1990 to 2014, due to the direct impact of land-cover replacement. Nevertheless, the urbanization has also resulted in an apparently positive indirect impact on NPP, which has offset about 30% of the direct impact in recent years. The increasing trend of the indirect impact was found to be higher than the NPP trend in the surrounding forest areas, which proves that vegetation growth has been promoted by the urban environment. The indirect impact has also shown great spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with generally higher values in the old city area and winter season. This can mostly be attributed to the distribution of temperature, i.e., the urban heat island effect, which has shown a significantly positive correlation with the indirect impact. However, the correlations between NPP and climatic factors were found to be completely different, which confirmed the need to separate the direct and indirect impacts. Overall, this study has demonstrated that urbanization has reduced the total NPP over the region, but has promoted some vegetation growth, and the knowledge of the indirect impact will help to support urban greening planning.

This study developed a scale-independent and semi-automatic image processing technique to map the upwelling areas along the 4500 km south-eastern coast of Australia from 14-year monthly MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. The results show that there is significant spatial variability in the mapped upwelling areas, month to month, season to season and year to year. There is also strong temporal (month to month, seasonal and inter-annual) variability of the upwelling characteristics in area of influence, SST anomaly, chlorophyll-a concentrations and upwelling speed. This study identifies two prominent upwelling systems, the NSW system along the coast of New South Wales and the WVIC/SA system along the coast of western Victoria and adjacent South Australia. The NSW coastal upwelling system occurs more or less continuously from austral spring to autumn. The WVIC/SA coastal upwelling system is a seasonal upwelling system occurring in the austral summer. The NSW coastal upwelling system has a stronger upwelling intensity than the WVIC/SA system, in terms of area of influence, SST anomaly, chlorophyll-a concentrations and upwelling speed. We believe that the NSW coastal upwelling system, especially the northern and central parts, is mainly driven by the East Australian Current (EAC) and its eddies; while, the WVIC/SA coastal upwelling is a typical wind-driven system. In addition, the results indicate that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are likely to have a low-to-moderate impact on both the NSW and the WVIC/SA coastal upwelling systems. The El Nino (La Nina) events tend to strengthen (weaken) upwelling intensity.

TI  - UAV data as alternative to field sampling to map woody invasive species based on combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant species can pose major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services. Satellite based remote sensing has evolved as an important technology to spatially map the occurrence of invasive species in space and time. With the new era of the Sentinel missions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral data are now freely available and repeatedly acquired on a high spatial and temporal resolution for the entire globe. However, the high potential of such sensors for automatic mapping procedures cannot be fully harnessed without sufficient and appropriate reference data for model calibration. Reference data are commonly acquired in field surveys, which however, are often relatively expensive and affected by sampling and observer bias. Moreover, a direct transferability to the remote sensing perspective and scale is difficult. Accordingly, we firstly assess the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for semi-automatic reference data acquisition on species cover of three woody invasive species Pinus radiata, Ulex europaeus and Acacia dealbata occurring in Chile. Secondly, we test the upscaling of the estimated species cover to the spatial scale of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The proposed workflow includes the visual sampling of respective canopies in UAV orthomosaics and the subsequent spatial extrapolations using MaxEnt with spectral (RGB, Hyperspectral), textural (2D) and canopy structural (3D) predictors derived from UAV-based photogrammetry. These UAV-based maps are then used to train random forest models with multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map the invasive species cover on large spatial scales. Our results show that the semi-automatic UAV-based mapping of the three invasive species results in accurate predictions. Depending on the predictor combination, the correlation was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.90 for Pinus radiatia, Ulex europaeus, Acacia dealbata, respectively. Among the three species, we observed clear differences in the model performance between the tested photogrammetric predictors and their combinations (spectral, 2D texture or 3D structure). For scaling up the UAV-based estimates to the satellite-scale, the Sentinel-2 data (multispectral) were more important than Sentinel-1 data (SAR). An independent validation revealed that the R-2 of the upscaling accounted for 0.78 or higher for all species and RMSE lower than 12%. Our results hence demonstrate that UAV-based reference data acquisitions are a promising alternative to traditional field surveys if the target species are directly identifiable in the UAV data.

TI  - Completion lymphadenectomy for a positive sentinel node biopsy in melanoma patients is not associated with a survival benefit
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) disease in melanoma patients is debated. We evaluated the impact of CLND on survival and assessed for predictors of nonsentinel node metastasis (positive CLND). Methods Positive SLN melanoma patients were retrospectively identified in the Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database. Clinicopathological factors were correlated with CLND status, overall survival (OS), and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Results There were 953 positive SLN patients of whom 831 (87%) had CLND. Positive CLND was seen in 141 (17%) cases and was associated with worse OS and MSS (both P < 0.001). CLND was not performed (No-CLND) in 122 of 953 positive SLN cases (13%), of whom 100 had follow-up and 18 (18%) developed a nodal recurrence (NR). No significant differences in OS and MSS were seen comparing CLND with No-CLND (P = 0.084, P = 0.161, respectively) and comparing positive CLND with No-CLND NR patients (P = 0.565, P = 0.998, respectively). Gender, primary site, ulceration, and number of positive SLNs were correlated with nonsentinel node metastasis. Conclusions Performance of CLND provides prognostic information but is not associated with a survival benefit. Clinical variables can predict a positive CLND in patients who may be at high risk of recurrence.

TI  - An Improved Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (IFSDAF) method for producing high spatiotemporal resolution normalized difference vegetation index time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most commonly used vegetation indices for monitoring ecosystem dynamics and modeling biosphere processes. However, global NDVI products are usually provided with relatively coarse spatial resolutions that lack important spatial details. Producing NDVI time-series data with high spatiotemporal resolution is indispensable for monitoring land surfaces and ecosystem changes, especially in spatiotemporally heterogeneous areas. The Improved Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (IFSDAF) method was developed in this study to fill this need. In accord with the distinctive characteristics of NDVIs with large data variance and high spatial autocorrelation compared with raw reflectance bands, the IFSDAF method first produces a time-dependent increment with linear unmixing and a space-dependent increment via thin plate spline interpolation. It then makes a final prediction by optimal integration of these two increments with the constrained least squares method. Moreover, the IFSDAF was developed with the capacity to use all available finer-scaled images, including those partly contaminated by clouds. NDVI images with coarse spatial resolution (MODIS) and fine spatial resolution (Landsat and Sentinel) in areas with great spatial heterogeneity and significant land cover changes were used to test the performance of the IFSDAF method. The root mean square error and relative root mean square error of predicted relative to observed results were 0.0884 and 22.12%, respectively, in heterogeneous areas, and 0.0546 and 25.77%, respectively, in areas of land-cover change. These promising results demonstrated the strength and robustness of the IFSDAF method in providing reliable NDVI datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution to support research on land surface processes. The efficiency of the proposed IFSDAF method can be greatly improved by using only the space-dependent increment. This simplification will make IFSDAF a feasible method for monitoring global vegetation.

TI  - Changing aerosol loadings over Central Himalayan region (2007-2016) - A satellite perspective
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the variation of aerosol columnar variation and vertical profiles over the study area encompassing a portion of Central Himalayan region and the surrounding planar areas. The analysis is carried out using decadal (2007-2016) Level-2 CALIOP (onboard CALIPSO), Level-3 MODIS (onboard Aqua/Terra) and MISR (onboard Terra) datasets. Four seasons have been considered, namely, DJF (December-January-February), MAM (March-April-may), JJA (June-July-August) and SON (September-October-November). The CALIOP data has been screened using quality flags, i.e., CAD score, aerosol layer fraction and extinction quality checks. There are also signatures of elevated aerosol layers, especially during winter (DJF) and post-monsoon (SON) seasons. Latitudinal and longitudinal variations of the vertical structure have also been presented. The HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis has been carried out in order to explore the changes in the sources of the aerosols during different seasons. It is seen that as we go higher up in the altitudes, the long range transport becomes more dominant. Compared to the other seasons, the air masses are more localized in JJA season. The changing aerosol amounts at different heights of the atmosphere have also been discussed in terms of decadal trends for the four seasons. These trends have been supplemented by the AOD trends from the passive satellite sensors. We find that aerosol amounts have increased in the last decade during DJF and SON seasons, when the atmospheric conditions are more stable. On the contrary, aerosol amounts have significantly decreased in JJA season throughout the vertical column. The effect of changing amounts of aerosols may have impacts on the snow cover variability as well. In this connection, the seasonal trends in snow cover have also been explored during the considered decadal period. Especially during the DJF and SON seasons, decreasing trends in snow cover are observed when the aerosol amounts have been found to be increased.

TI  - Molards as an indicator of permafrost degradation and landslide processes
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Molards have been defined in the past as conical mounds of debris that can form part of a landslide's deposits. We present the first conclusive evidence that molards in permafrost terrains are cones of loose debris that result from thawing of frozen blocks of ice-rich sediments mobilised by a landslide, and hence propose a rigorous definition of this landform in permafrost environments. We show that molards can be used as an indicator of permafrost degradation, and that their morphometry and spatial distribution give valuable insights into landslide dynamics in permafrost environments. We demonstrate that molards are readily recognisable not only in the field, but also in remote sensing data; surveys of historic aerial imagery allow the recognition of relict molards, which can be used as an indicator of current and past permafrost conditions. The triggering of landslides as a result of permafrost degradation will arguably occur more often as global atmospheric temperatures increase, so molards should be added to our armoury for tracking climate change, as well as helping us to understand landslide-related hazards. Finally, we have also identified candidate molards on Mars, so molards can inform about landscape evolution on Earth and other planetary bodies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Light availability for reef-building organisms in a plume-influenced shelf
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of a reef system composed by crustose coralline algae and scieractinian corals, under the influence of the worlds largest freshwater plume, led us to investigate how much light is available for reef-building organisms at the bottom of the Amazon shelf. We analyzed ocean color data from MODIS Aqua to assess the plume dynamics and estimate the benthic light availability over the Amazon shelf. These methods may be applied to other river-dominated shelves. Four zones were detected regarding the bottom light regime. The seasonal changes of the dynamic forcing over the shelf reflect little in the light parameters over the Amazon shelf. Three zones presented constant light regimes along the year: dark coastal zone under the permanent influence of the plume; dim-light zone in the deeper northern shelf; and high-light zone in the shallower southern shelf. Only one zone presented a seasonally changing benthic light regime, and it was located under the seasonally variable edge of the plume over the northern mid-to-outer shelf. The minimum light level estimated in the deeper dim-light zone was similar to 2 mu E m(-2) s(-1) which is sufficient for reef-building organisms to thrive. The cause of the incipient living coverage and low vitality of crustose coralline algae, previously reported in the northern shelf, cannot be attributed to a lack of light, but might be related to sedimentation processes associated to the plume. Thus, the potential, in terms of light, for reef builders to develop along this and other river-influenced margins is much greater than previously anticipated.

TI  - Improvement of satellite-based estimation of gross primary production through optimization of meteorological parameters and high resolution land cover information at regional scale over East Asia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is a crucial factor in the carbon cycle especially for the absorption of carbon dioxide into the biosphere from the atmosphere. A large discrepancy between a satellite-based GPP product named MOD17A2H GPP and in-situ data measured at eddy covariance flux towers has been identified over East Asia where the biome types and climatic characteristics are heterogeneous with rugged terrain. For that reason, this study focuses on two potential major error sources in MOD17A2H GPP, which are the coarse resolution land cover information and inappropriate meteorological parameters. The finer resolution observation and monitoring global land cover (FROM-GLC) and the MODIS land cover product collection 5.1 (MCD12Q1) were used to describe biome types in detail, by combining spatial distribution from FROM-GLC and the phenological characteristics of land cover from MCD12Q1. Meteorological parameters were optimized using the 55-years Japanese reanalysis meteorological data (JRA-55). The light use efficiency of the MOD17 GPP algorithm was modified using the combined land cover information (FROM-MCD). Although the use of FROM-MCD and JRA-55 did not improve MOD17A2H GPP, the optimization of two meteorological parameters-daily minimum air temperature (TMIN) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) significantly improved the GPP algorithm for East Asia. The results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the estimated and in situ GPPs decreased from 21.83 (gC/m(2)/8days) to 16.11 (gC/m(2)/8days) through optimizing the two parameters at 9 flux tower sites. The optimized TMIN and VPD thresholds in the MOD17 GPP algorithm were applied to the entire study area (i.e., East Asia) according to the Koppen-Geiger climate classes. The estimated GPP using the proposed approach was compared to GPPs from widely used process-based models (i.e., VISIT, BEAMS, and BESS), which confirmed that the proposed approach with locally optimized meteorological parameters improved on the underestimation of the MOD17 GPP algorithm for East Asia. The uncertainty of the VPDmin parameter was revealed to be larger than that of TMINmax.

TI  - Does sentinel lymph node status have prognostic significance in patients with acral lentiginous melanoma?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The prognostic benefit of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and factors predictive of survival specifically in patients with acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) are unknown. Methods The SEER database was queried for ALM cases that underwent SLNB from 1998 to 2013. Clinicopathological factors were correlated with SLN status, overall survival (OS), and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Results Median age for the 753 ALM study patients was 65 years, and 48.2% were male. Median thickness was 2 mm with 38.1% of cases having ulceration. SLN metastases were detected in 194 of 753 cases (25.7%). Multivariable analysis showed that thickness, Clark level IV-V, and ulceration significantly predicted for SLN metastasis (P < 0.05). For patients with positive SLN, 5-year OS and MSS were significantly worse at 48.1% and 58.9%, respectively, compared with 78.7% and 88.5%, respectively, for patients with negative SLN (P < 0.0001). On multivariable analyses, older age, male gender, increasing thickness, ulceration, and a positive SLN significantly predicted for worse OS and MSS (all P < 0.05). Conclusion This study confirms the important role of SLNB in ALM. SLN metastases are seen in 25.7% of ALM cases, providing significant prognostic information. In addition, thickness, ulceration status, and SLNB status significantly predict survival in patients with ALM.

TI  - Remote prediction of yield based on LAI estimation in oilseed rape under different planting methods and nitrogen fertilizer applications
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate prediction of crop yield at field scale is important for precision agriculture to understand crop production response to agronomic management practice and environmental stress. In this study, we developed a method to predict yield based entirely on remotely sensed data in oilseed rape under different planting methods and nitrogen fertilizer applications. Leaf are index (LAI) measured at four developmental stages were correlated with oilseed rape yield. It is found that LAI at the initiation of stem elongation stage closely related to yield, thus the remote estimation of LAI at this stage can be used to indicate the yield in oilseed rape. The red edge vegetation index (CIred (edge)), which was derived from canopy reflectance collected at close range as well as by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), was able to accurately estimate LAI thus can be used to predict yield in oilseed rape with the estimation error below 15%. Based on remote predictions of field-scale yield in oilseed rape, it is observed that with the same nitrogen fertilizer the oilseed rape plots planted by seed sowing method consistently produced higher yield than plots planted by seedling transplanting method. With the increase of nitrogen fertilizer, the yield of oilseed rape increased but became saturated for the high level of nitrogen applications above 225 kg/ha.

TI  - Spatial filtering and Bayesian data fusion for mapping soil properties: A case study combining legacy and remotely sensed data in Iran
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - In a spatial mapping context, we address in this paper the issue of combining at best soil data coming from legacy soil surveys with soil information that is indirectly obtained from remote sensing (RS). We show first how spatial scale issues need to beproperly addressed for soil mapping in order to increase the predictive performances of spatial prediction models, where the two prediction techniques that are compared here are kriging and random forests (RF). By relying afterwards on a Bayesian data fusion approach, we then emphasize the benefit of combining the output of these two prediction models in order to get a single prediction result that leads to an improved final map.The advocated methodology is illustrated with the mapping of soil saturation percentage (SP) over a 10,480 km(2) area located in Iran, were SP is a key soil parameter for sustainable development and land management. A set of 396 soil profiles were obtained from legacy soil surveys and were used to compute vertically averaged SP values. In parallel, a set of RS covariates were obtained from a 90 meters resolution Landsat image and a digital elevation model. Based on the modeling of the spatialdependence both for soil SP data and for RS covariates, it is shown how the relationship between them is improved by using a filtered kriging technique that allows us to focus on their long range component only. Using these filtered SP value and RS covariates, predictions were obtained separately from kriging and from a RF model at the nodes of a 90 meters resolution grid. Even if the performances of these two models are almost identical with R-2 values equal to 0.66-0.67, it is shown afterwards that a Bayesian data fusion procedure that combines both predictions yields improved performance with a R2 value equal to 0.86. These results clearly emphasize the importance of properly addressing scale issues and the benefit of data fusion inorder to improve the quality of the final map. Though the study was conducted here for SP values, we believe this methodology and these findings are relevant when it comes to handle other soil properties in a spatial mapping context that involves several data sources.

TI  - Aerosol optical depth climatology over Central Asian countries based on Aqua-MODIS Collection 6.1 data: Aerosol variations and sources
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the aerosol optical depth (AOD) - an indicator of air quality, based on satellite data over Central Asia. Due to limited studies and lack of knowledge regarding AOD variations over this region, five countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and fifteen sites including the capital cities were selected for the analysis. Long-term Aqua-MODIS Collection 6.1 Deep Blue (DB) AOD observations at 10 km spatial resolution were obtained for 2002-2017 and the angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) was calculated using spectral AOD observations. AOD and AE were explored based on seasonal and inter-annual scale. The relationship between aerosol loading and economic indicator (gross domestic product) was also analyzed. Highest frequencies of low AOD and high AE were observed in all countries. Average AOD (AE) values during the study period were 0.17 +/- 0.09 (1.29 +/- 0.17) for Kazakhstan, 0.11 +/- 0.13 (1.41 +/- 0.13) for Kyrgyzstan, 0.17 +/- 0.14 (1.36 +/- 0.18) for Tajikistan, 0.20 +/- 0.10 (1.10 +/- 0.28) for Turkmenistan, and 0.18 +/- 0.09 (1.18 +/- 0.24) for Uzbekistan. Summer season experienced highest aerosol loading over Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, whereas spring season experienced highest aerosol loading over Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan possibly due to the influence of less precipitation and dust from the arid regions. All fifteen cities selected in this study exhibited increasing aerosol load. Aerosol types based on the relationship between AOD and AE were investigated, results suggested the clean continental aerosol as a major aerosol type over the region, whereas the contribution of mixed aerosols was observed during spring and summer seasons. This study suggests for establishment of ground-based aerosol monitoring stations network and inclusions of modeling works to understand the complex nature of aerosol over this vast landmass.

TI  - Intra-annual <i>Ips typographus</i> outbreak monitoring using a multi-temporal GIS analysis based on hyperspectral and ALS data in the Bialowieza Forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances caused by biotic and abiotic agents are inherent processes of forest ecosystems and often play a key role in forming the ecosystems themselves. However, they also may negatively affect wood production and alter ecosystem services. Thus, precise and up-to-date spatial information on invasion presence and dynamic is essential when planning protective and sanitary actions. Gathering such data is still challenging if large areas, with limited access, are affected.This study addresses this issue by suggesting a GIS-workflow based on high-resolution multi-temporal remote sensing data to describe the spread of a bark beetle outbreak by mapping dead trees on a single tree level and estimating timber losses associated with the infestations in the Polish part of the Bialowieza Forest (BF) in 2015.Along with field inventories, airborne hyperspectral data were collected in 2015 at three acquisition dates: 2-4 July, between August 24th and 27th and between 1st and 2nd October with a HySpex VNIR-1800 camera. Airborne laser scanning data were collected during 2-5 July 2015 using a Riegl LMS-Q680i scanner. The analysis consisted of three steps: (i) hyperspectral images were used to stratify the area into living vegetation and all other classes (including dead trees); (ii) a single tree delineation was performed and individual tree volumes were calculated based on a volume similar to height allometry; (iii) the delineated trees were assigned as either living trees or dead trees (snags). Based on these data bark beetle dynamics between the three time steps were analysed.The results show that the Ips typographus outbreak in BF in 2015 was very dynamic. The volume of dead standing spruce detected in subsequent dates was as follows: July - 503 410 m(3); August - 640 692 m(3); October - 737 978 m(3) New groups of dead trees in the flat landscape of Bialowieza forest appeared preferably but not only in the immediate vicinity of trees classified as dead in the previous period. New infestations were also identified over 100 m away from earlier infested trees. On the other hand, we could not identify any tendencies in terms of the spread direction which makes the prediction of the spread-dynamics challenging in our study area.

TI  - Remote sensing of spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton assemblages in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and east China sea
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine phytoplankton accounts for roughly half the planetary primary production, and plays significant roles in marine ecosystem functioning, physical and biogeochemical processes, and climate changes. Documenting phytoplankton assemblages' dynamics, particularly their community structure properties, is thus a crucial and also challenging task. A large number of in situ and space-borne observation datasets are collected that cover the marginal seas in the west Pacific, including Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. Here, a customized region-specific semi-analytical model is developed in order to detect phytoplankton community structure properties (using phytoplankton size classes, PSCs, as its first-order delegate), and repeatedly tested to assure its reliable performance. Independent in situ validation datasets generate relatively low and acceptable predictive errors (e.g., mean absolute percentage errors, MAPE, are 38.4%, 22.7%, and 34.4% for micro-, nano-, and picophytoplankton estimations, respectively). Satellite synchronization verification also produces comparative predictive errors. By applying this model to long time-series of satellite data, we document the past two-decadal (namely from 1997 to 2017) variation on the PSCs. Satellite-derived records reveal a general spatial distribution rule, namely microphytoplankton accounts for most variation in nearshore regions, when nanophytoplankton dominates offshore water areas, together with a certain high contribution from picophytoplankton. Long time-series of data records indicate a roughly stable tendency during the period of the past twenty years, while there exist periodical changes in a short-term one-year scale. High covariation between marine environment factors and PSCs are further found, with results that underwater light field and sea surface temperature are the two dominant climate variables which exhibit a good ability to multivariate statistically model the PSCs changes in these marginal seas. Specifically, three types of influence induced by underwater light field and sea surface temperature can be generalized to cover different water conditions and regions, and meanwhile a swift response time (approximately < 1 month) of phytoplankton to the changing external environment conditions is found by the wavelet analysis. This study concludes that phytoplankton community structures in the marginal seas remain stable and are year-independent over the past two decades, together with a short-term in-year cycle; this change rule need to be considered in future oceanographic studies.

TI  - Non-point source pollution risks in a drinking water protection zone based on remote sensing data embedded within a nutrient budget model
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple, transparent and reliable method for evaluating non-point source pollution (NPSP) risks to drinking water source areas lacking observational data is proposed herein. The NPSP risks are assessed by using nutrient budget models for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, making the best use of remote sensing and field survey data. We demonstrate its potential using a case study of the Chaihe Reservoir in northeastern China. Fertilizer inputs and crop-uptake outputs were estimated based on normalized difference vegetation index, which is derived from remote sensing as indicators of crop growth and production. The nutrient balances for this area showed surpluses of both N and P within the soil system. Estimated imbalances per unit area were consistent with statistical relationships derived from all Chinese counties, demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable. The surplus P amounts were higher than the standard threshold for NPSP risks, indicating the existence of a potential contamination risk of P to this drinking water source. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A multilayer cloud detection algorithm for the Suomi-NPP Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new multilayer (ML) cloud detection algorithm based on three shortwave infrared (SWIR) and two longwave infrared (LWIR) channels is developed and applied to the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi-NPP satellite. The algorithm identifies ML clouds, i.e., ice clouds overlying water clouds, based on satellite multispectral observations in the 1.38, 1.6, 2.25, 8.5, and 11 pm channels. We perform synthetic radiative transfer simulations to understand the sensitivities of the aforementioned channels on ML and single-layer (SL) clouds. Active CALIOP observations are used to evaluate the algorithm. Compared with the collocated CALIOP results, the algorithm can determine SL and ML clouds correctly with success rates of approximately 80% and 60%, respectively, and has similar performance to that of the current MODIS operational ML cloud detection algorithm. The misclassification of ML clouds as SL clouds is primarily caused by thin ice clouds that are practically undetectable using LWIR tests. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to analyze data from radiometers onboard the geostationary Himawari-8 and FengYun-4A satellites, and results similar to those of VIIRS are obtained.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis and multi-criteria optimization of SMA cable restrainers for longitudinal seismic protection of isolated simply supported highway bridges
T2  - ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the flexibility of isolation bearings, isolated bridges are susceptible to unseating problems or even collapse due to excessive displacement under strong earthquakes. Shape memory alloy (SMA) wires can be utilized as seismic restrainers to confine this displacement. Recently, a design procedure for SMA restrainers has been proposed based on a linearized two degree-of-freedom analytical model. The key design parameters include three geometric factors (the ratio of the allowable displacement to the seat width, Delta(a)/L-sw, horizontal angle, theta(0), and normalized elongation parameter alpha), and three factors related to material properties of SMA (the maximum applied strain, epsilon(max), the elastic modulus, E-0, and the austenite to martensite start stress, f(y,SMA)). The objective of this study is to optimize the design procedure by evaluating the effect of each design factor on the seismic response of an isolated bridge which is retrofitted by SMA restrainers. After conducting a one-half fractional factorial analysis, it was found that the material factors have slight impact on the relative displacement between the pier and the girder, and the base shear of the pier, with percentage contributions smaller than 4% and 13%, respectively. Then, a full factorial analysis is followed through a multi-criteria decision making process in order to optimize the SMA restrainer. The results show that the optimal value of Delta(a)/L-sw, which effectively reduces the relative displacement and simultaneously control the base shear of the piers, is 0.4; the optimum value of theta(0) ranges from 0 to pi/4; and the most effective value of alpha is 1.0.

TI  - Research on the Pollution Characteristics and Causality of Haze-sand Air Pollution in Beijing in spring
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - From to 2017, a special eavy AutitTnoccurred in Beijing. The meteorological conditions associated with the Wea y Tillutiontire relatively special, so the pollute i ms and causes were studied. The general characteristics of this pollution event, obtained based on data from 35 environmental monitoring stations in Beijing. Matching characteristics of PM, and PM2.5 concentrations with ground wind field data from automatic weather stations closest to the environmental monitoring stations were analyzed. By using MODIS and CALIPSO data, the spatial distribution in the horizontal and vertical directions was obtained, and the transport paths and pollutant categories of the pollution were elucidated. The causes of the pollution were analyzed by using ECMWF ERA -Interim data and Wind Profiler radar data. It was hoped that the special morphological characteristics and influencing factors of the pollution could be obtained by means of ground -space monitoring technology combined with meteorological conditions. The results showed that pollution characteristics and constraints could be better reflected by stereo observations and comprehensive analyses based on the above multi -source data. The pollution stalled abruptly and dropped sharply, and the pollution process lasted for about 30 hours. The whole process was divided into the following three stages: the first half, intermittent period, and second half. The concentrations of PMio and PM2 s were high throughout the whole process, reaching to 600-1 000 pig"m-3 and 200-700 pig"m-3, respectively. The causes of pollution in the first half and second half and the resulting PM, and PM2.5 concentrations were different in terms of the spatial distribution. In the first half, the dominant wind direction was northwest wind, and the wind speed was small. The spatial difference of PM, concentrations was also small, with concentrations more than 800 pig"m-3; meanwhile, the spatial difference of PM2.5 concentrations was great. The concentration of PM2.5 was high in the south and urban areas, reaching to 600-700 pig"m-3, and it was low in other places, reaching to 350-500 pig"m-3. During the intermission, the wind direction in the lower layer shifted from northwest wind to south wind, and the upper layer maintained northwest wind. The concentration of PM, in the south and urban area decreased obviously to 650 pig"al 3, and the concentration of PMio in the north remained at 800 pig"al 3. At this time, the concentration of PM2, in the north even dropped to 200 pig"m-3. The dominant wind returned to northwest wind in the latter half, and the wind speed increased sharply. At this time, the spatial difference of PM2.5 concentrations was small and the concentration of PM2.5 at the same station was less than that in the former half, ranging from 250 to 500 pig"m-3. The PMio concentrations returned to the level of 800 pig"m-3. The pollution process involved mixed pollution consisting of haze and sand. Under the influence of westerly winds, the main contribution to Beijing pollution was dust -type PMi, -while under southerly flows, the contribution to Beijing pollution was not only dust, but also PM,. Heavy pollution was accompanied by high wind speeds. The vertical motion of the atmosphere converged at an altitude of about 2-3 km, which resulted in the accumulation of pollutants at this altitude.

TI  - A space-time observation system for soil moisture in agricultural landscapes
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - A confluence of scientific and technological developments in geospatial data have made it possible to para-meterise the components of the soil water balance equation in space and time at spatial and temporal resolutions useful for agriculture. In this work, we present results on the development of an approach that takes advantage of this opportunity to predict soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 90 m on a daily time step at multiple depths in the profile.Three types of water balance model were examined: (i) single layer model with saturated flow (ii) multi-layer model with saturated flow and (iii) multi-layer model with unsaturated flow. Five layers were considered: 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm, which coincide with the layers of the Soil Landscape Grid of Australia which is available at similar to 90 m spatial resolution. Pedotransfer functions were used to predict the bucket size for each soil layer. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are estimated by gridded SILO precipitation data (5 km, 1 day) and the MODIS 16 ET product (1 km, 8 day), respectively. Soil moisture predictions were tested against four publicly and privately owned soil moisture networks.The multi-layer model incorporating unsaturated flow performed the best in terms of predicting soil moisture for the whole profile (0-1 m) with a median correlation coefficient (r) of just over 0.7 across all sites. When classifying the sites according to the land use; cropping sites showed better median correlation (similar to 0.8) than grazing sites (similar to 0.7). However, grazing sites seem to have more consistent results for all the layers. To understand the relative importance of the water balance model predictions as compared to other environmental properties, a Random Forest model was fitted to a suite of variables e.g. soil order, month, temperature and etc., that vary in space, time or both space and time. For the analysis, only calibrated soil moisture network sites (OzNet) were considered. Soil moisture which was derived from unsaturated soil water balance model was the 9th most important variable. To assess the quality of the predictive model, leave-one-out-site cross validation (LOOSCV) was performed and across all sites the prediction quality was reasonable (Concordance = 0.66, Accuracy = 0.06 cm 3 cm(-3)). These results highlight the potential of this approach and since it is based on readily available data it is scalable to large spatial domains.

TI  - Global parameters sensitivity analysis of modeling water, energy and carbon exchange of an arid agricultural ecosystem
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural ecosystems are important for regulating terrestrial hydrological and carbon cycles. Hydrological and carbon processes in agricultural ecosystem models are complex due to interactions between parameters. It is therefore crucial to identify parameter sensitivity before a process-based model is applied for simulations and predictions of water, energy and carbon fluxes in agricultural ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity and equifinality of the CoupModel parameters in modeling an arid agricultural ecosystem in northwestern China. In total, 27 model parameters were analyzed using a global parameters sensitivity analysis approach and a combination of multiple in situ and remotely sensed data sets. Among the five major model processes, we found that the energy balance process account for much of the importance in the model, followed by soil hydrology, plant growth, soil heat, and soil carbon processes. Meanwhile, parameters from the plant growth process exhibited higher equifinalities than other processes. We found that net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is controlled by soil heat, soil hydrology and energy balance processes, which is mainly due to a high equifinality (0.91) between the parameters g(max) (maximal stomatal conductance) and V-cmax (maximal carboxylation rate). The equifinalities between different parameters result in a trade-off in model performance metrics (i.e. determination coefficient R-2 and mean error ME) in the water, energy and carbon balance simulations. We revealed that daytime and yearly accumulated eddy fluxes (sensible heat H-s, latent heat LE and NEE) can constrain the model parameters better. Remotely sensed data were also promising as additional constraints on soil water contents and energy fluxes. This study introduced a systematic global parameter sensitivity analysis approach together with the equifinality identification in an ecosystem model. The approach proposed here is applicable to other studies and the equifinalities detected in this study can be important implications for modelling arid agricultural ecosystems. Additional exploration on remotely sensed data in constraining the model from different aspects are highly recommended in modeling agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - Quantifying the contribution of multiple factors to land subsidence in the Beijing Plain, China with machine learning technology
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is the ground surface response to underground space development, utilization and evolution. Presently, land subsidence has developed into a global, comprehensive and interdisciplinary complex systems problem. More than half a century has passed since the discovery of subsidence in the Beijing Plain in the 1960s. In this study, we investigate the land subsidence in the Beijing Plain over the period of 2003-2015 using ENVISAT ASAR and RADARSAT-2 interferometric datasets and the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique. Furthermore, we introduced the data field model and index-based built-up index (IBI) to obtain the dynamic and static load information of the Beijing Plain. Then, based on a machine learning method, we selected the gradient lifting decision tree (GBDT) model to quantitatively analyze the contributions of groundwater level change, compressible deposit thickness and dynamic and static loads to land subsidence. The results showed that the maximum land subsidence rate was 122 and 141 mm/year in 2003-2010 and 2010-2015, respectively. Comparisons between the SBAS-InSAR results and leveling measurements showed that the minimum absolute error achieved was only 0.2 mm/year. We suggest that the groundwater exploitation in the third confined aquifer has greater impacts on land subsidence in the Beijing Plain than the other factors. The land subsidence likely occurred in compressible deposit thicknesses exceeding 90 m. Moreover, we found that the compressible thickness and groundwater level contributions to land subsidence exceeded 60%. Our results provide a scientific basis for the regulation and control of regional land subsidence. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Global Plankton Diversity Monitoring Program
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Plankton are the base of marine food webs, essential to sustaining fisheries and other marine life. Continuous Plankton Recorders (CPRs) have sampled plankton for decades in both hemispheres and several regional seas. CPR research has been integral to advancing understanding of plankton dynamics and informing policy and management decisions. We describe how the CPR can contribute to global plankton diversity monitoring, being cost-effective over large scales and providing taxonomically resolved data. At OceanObs09 an integrated network of regional CPR surveys was envisaged and in 2011 the existing surveys formed the Global Alliance of CPR Surveys (GACS). GAGS first focused on strengthening the dataset by identifying and documenting CPR best practices, delivering training workshops, and developing an integrated database. This resulted in the initiation of new surveys and manuals that enable regional surveys to be standardized and integrated. GACS is not yet global, but it could be expanded into the remaining oceans; tropical and Arctic regions are a priority for survey expansion. The capacity building groundwork is done, but funding is required to implement the GACS vision of a global plankton sampling program that supports decision-making for the scientific and policy communities. A key step is an analysis to optimize the global sampling design. Further developments include expanding the CPR for multidisciplinary measurements via additional sensors, thus maximizing the ship-of-opportunity platform. For example, defining pelagic ecoregions based on plankton and ancillary data could support high seas Marine Protected Area design. Fulfillment of Aichi Target 15, the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, and delivering the Essential Ocean Variables and Essential Biodiversity Variables that the Global Ocean Observing System and Group on Earth Observation's Biodiversity Observation Network have, respectively, defined requires the taxonomic resolution, spatial scale and time-series data that the CPR approach provides. Synergies with global networks exploiting satellite data and other plankton sensors could be explored, realizing the Survey's capacity to validate earth observation data and to ground-truth emerging plankton observing platforms. This is required for a fully integrated ocean observing system that can understand global ocean dynamics to inform sustainable marine decision-making.

TI  - Framework for agricultural performance assessment based on MODIS multitemporal data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a hierarchical classification framework for automated detection and mapping of spatial patterns of agricultural performance using satellite-based Earth observation data exemplified for the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) in Central Asia. The core element of the framework is the derivation of a composite agricultural performance index which is composed of different subindicators taking into account cropping intensity, crop diversity, crop rotations, fallow land frequency, land utilization, water use efficiency, and water availability. We derive these subindicators from net primary productivity and evapotranspiration data obtained from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra satellite during the observation period from 2000 to 2016, as well as from cropland maps created through multiannual classification of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We classified pixel-based NDVI time series covering more than 8 X 10(6) ha of irrigated cropland based on a hierarchical approach concatenating unsupervised and supervised classification techniques to automatically generate and refine training labels, which are then used to train a decision fusion classifier, achieving an average overall accuracy of 78%. The results give unprecedented insights into spatial patterns of agricultural performance in the ASB. The proposed method is transferable and applicable for global-scale mapping, and the results of this remote sensing-aided assessment can provide important information for regional agricultural planning purposes.

TI  - Retrieving snow cover information from AMSR-2 satellite data for North-West Himalaya, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of seasonal snowpack play an important role in hydrology, climatology and disaster related studies particularly snow avalanche. In the present study, snow cover information, i.e. Snow Cover Area (SCA) and Snow Depth (SD) has been retrieved over North West Himalaya using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-2) satellite data for period 2012-2016. The spatio-temporal variations of AMSR-2 retrieved Brightness Temperature (T-B) and Scattering Index (SI) values were used to obtain SCA. The SCA retrieved using AMSR-2 was compared with MODIS retrieved SCA and a good agreement has been observed. A SD algorithm was developed for a part of Great Himalaya based on the field measured SD and satellite retrieved T-B. The satellite retrieved SD values were found in agreement with field measured SD (R-2 = 0.8). The The RMSE and MAE were found as similar to 16 and similar to 13.9 cm, respectively. This study is important for retrieving snow cover information on regular basis from Himalaya.

TI  - Fluorophore-quencher interactions effect on hybridization characteristics of complementary oligonucleotides
T2  - ANALYTICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nucleic acids are often covalently modified with fluorescent reporter molecules to create a hybridization state-dependent optical signal. Designing such a nucleic acid reporter involves selecting a fluorophore, quencher, and fluorescence quenching design. This report outlines the effect that these choices have on the DNA hybridization characteristics by examining six fluorophores in four quenching schemes: a quencher molecule offset fromthe fluorophore by 0, 5, or 10 bases, and nucleotide quenching. The similar binding characteristics of left-handed L-DNA were evaluated in comparison with righthanded DNA to quantify the effect of each quenching scheme. These results were applied to the Adaptive PCR method, which monitors fluorescently-labeled L-DNA as a sentinel for analogous unlabeled D-DNA in the reaction. All of the tested fluorophores and quenching schemes increased the annealing temperature of the oligonucleotide pairs by values ranging from 0.5 to 8.5 degrees C relative to unlabeled oligonucleotides. The design with the smallest increase (0.5 degrees C) was a sense strand with a FAM fluorophore and an anti-sense strand with Black Hole Quencher 2 offset by 10 bases from the FAM. An identical design that did not offset the quencher molecules resulted in a shift in annealing temperature of 5 degrees C. PCR was performed using temperature switching based on each of these L-DNA designs, and efficiency was significantly increased for the 10-base offset design, which had the smallest shift in annealing temperature. These results highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate fluorescence quenching scheme for nucleic acid optical signals.

TI  - Epidemiology of respiratory infections among adults in Qatar (2012-2017)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLimited data is available about the etiology of influenza like illnesses (ILIs) in Qatar.ObjectivesThis study aimed at providing preliminary estimates of influenza and other respiratory infections circulating among adults in Qatar.MethodsWe retrospectively collected data of about 44,000 patients who visited Hamad General Hospital clinics, sentinel sites, and all primary healthcare centers in Qatar between 2012 and 2017. All samples were tested for influenza viruses, whereas about 38,000 samples were tested for influenza and a panel of respiratory viruses using Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) RT-PCR kit.ResultsAmong all ILIs cases, 20,278 (46.5%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Influenza virus was predominating (22.6%), followed by human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (9.5%), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) (5%). A detection rate of 2-3% was recorded for mycoplasma pneumonia, adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). ILIs cases were reported throughout the year, however, influenza, RSV, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal peaks in the winter, while HRVs circulated more during fall and spring. Elderly (> 50 years) had the lowest rates of influenza A (13.9%) and B (4.2%), while presenting the highest rates of RSV (3.4%) and HMPV (3.3%). While males had higher rates of HRVs (11.9%), enteroviruses (1.1%) and MERS CoV (0.2%), females had higher proportions of influenza (26.3%), HPIVs (3.2%) and RSV (3.6%) infections.ConclusionThis report provides a comprehensive insight about the epidemiology of ILIs among adults in the Qatar, as a representative of Gulf States. These results would help in improvement and optimization of diagnostic procedures, as well as control and prevention of the respiratory infections.

TI  - Landsat-MODIS image fusion and object-based image analysis for observing flood inundation in a heterogeneous vegetated scene
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon flooding normally occurs suddenly with short duration, and the thick cloud cover limits the ability of one single satellite to timely capture the inundation extent. Landsat satellite data with a spatial resolution of 30 m is spatially applicable for flooding research; however, its 16-day observation frequency is typically insufficient to observe short-term typhoon inundation. Alternatively, despite the coarse spatial resolutions, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor provide daily data, which is well suited for flood-related investigations. Accordingly, the idea of combining these two sources of data to generate a high spatial and temporal image would be useful. In this study, the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) was applied to generate cloud-free Landsat/MODIS synthesized data with a spatial resolution of 30 m for the delineation of the inundated areas during a flood event. This approach produces a Landsat-scale image for fine-scale flood mapping of areas where there are no observed cloud-free Landsat or similar resolution satellite images. The fusion model was implemented on atmospherically corrected surface reflectance, and the resultant reflectance values were validated by comparing with observed Landsat reflectance before further data interpretation. The blending results indicate that the synthetic Landsat-scaled image is highly correlated with Landsat surface reflectance, captured a day after the synthetic image acquisition date, over cloud-free areas. For image interpretation, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach with an optimal-scale segmentation and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was applied for flood classification. The flood mapping result was validated by comparing with a reference flood map derived from an observed Landsat image. This study demonstrates that the techniques of image fusion and object-based image analysis are useful for observing flood inundation in the heterogeneous vegetated area.

TI  - A water identification method basing on grayscale Landsat 8 OLI images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of water boundaries is of great significance to water resources surveys. Most water indexes have been designed for different districts and cannot be universally utilized in different regions and, in addition, they rely on atmospheric correction. A new water index, None-Radiation-Calibration Water Index (NRCWI), was constructed by Landsat OLI Band 3 (Green), Band 5 (NIR), and Band 6 (SWIR1), and was compared to the previous method, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI). We evaluated the accuracy of four water index methods for classifying water in 30-m resolution Landsat 8 OLI imagery from the Bohai Sea Rim in China, which takes in a broad assortment of features including sea and coastline, lakes, rivers, man-made water features, and mountains (shadow water). The following outcomes were obtained: 1. The overall accuracy of NRCWI was 95.23%, which is higher than NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI; 2. The leakage error of NRCWI was 5.48%, the misclassification error was 6.15%, and it implies that the error of NRCWI was effected decrease; 3. NRCWI had the highest kappa coefficient in lakes, rivers, man-made waters, mountains, and other ground features, which means that the method can reach a high accuracy in case 2 water which is principally situated in the near shore, estuary and so on; 4. In the applicability study, the kappa values of NRCWI were 89.99% (OLI), 87.36% (ETM+), 87.33% (TM), and 81.20% (Sentinel-2 MSI). Overall, the NRCWI method performed the best, with the highest accuracy and the lowest leakage error, which may be useful in OLI, ETM+, and TM imagery.

TI  - What is the impact of large-scale implementation of stroke Early Supported Discharge? A mixed methods realist evaluation study protocol
T2  - IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundStroke Early Supported Discharge (ESD) is a service innovation that facilitates discharge from hospital and delivery of specialist rehabilitation in patients' homes. There is currently widespread implementation of ESD services in many countries, driven by robust clinical trial evidence. In England, the type of ESD service patients receive on the ground is variable, and in some regions, ESD is still not offered at all. This protocol presents a study designed to investigate the mechanisms and outcomes of implementing ESD at scale in real-world conditions. This will help to establish which models of ESD are most effective and in what context.MethodsA realist evaluation approach composed of two interlinking work packages will be adopted to investigate how and why ESD works, for whom and in what circumstances. Work package 1 (WP1) will begin with a rapid evidence synthesis to formulate preliminary realist hypotheses. Quantitative analyses of historical prospective Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data will be performed to evaluate service outcomes based on the degree to which evidence-based ESD has been implemented. Work package 2 (WP2) will involve the qualitative investigation of purposively selected case study sites featuring in WP1 and covering different regions in England. The perspectives of clinicians, managers, commissioners, and service users will be explored qualitatively. Cost implications of ESD models will be examined using a cost-consequence analysis. Cross-case comparisons and triangulation of the data sources from both work packages will be performed to test, revise, and refine initial programme theories and address research aims.DiscussionThis study will investigate whether and how current large-scale implementation of ESD is achieving the outcomes suggested by the evidence base. The theory-driven evaluation approach will highlight key mechanisms and contextual conditions necessary to optimise outcomes and allow us to draw transferable lessons to inform the effective implementation and sustainability of ESD in clinical practice. In addition, the methodological framework will progress the theoretical understanding of implementation and evaluation of complex rehabilitation interventions in stroke care.Trial registrationISRCTN: 15568163, registration date: 26 October 2018.

TI  - 3-D crustal density model of the Sea of Marmara
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sea of Marmara, in northwestern Turkey, is a transition zone where the dextral North Anatolian Fault zone (NAFZ) propagates westward from the Anatolian Plate to the Aegean Sea Plate. The area is of interest in the context of seismic hazard of Istanbul, a metropolitan area with about 15 million inhabitants. Geophysical observations indicate that the crust is heterogeneous beneath the Marmara basin, but a detailed characterization of the crustal heterogeneities is still missing. To assess if and how crustal heterogeneities are related to the NAFZ segmentation below the Sea of Marmara, we develop new crustal-scale 3-D density models which integrate geological and seismological data and that are additionally constrained by 3-D gravity modeling. For the latter, we use two different gravity datasets including global satellite data and local marine gravity observation. Considering the two different datasets and the general non-uniqueness in potential field modeling, we suggest three possible "end-member" solutions that are all consistent with the observed gravity field and illustrate the spectrum of possible solutions. These models indicate that the observed gravitational anomalies originate from significant density heterogeneities within the crust. Two layers of sedi-ments, one syn-kinematic and one pre-kinematic with respect to the Sea of Marmara formation are underlain by a heterogeneous crystalline crust. A felsic upper crystalline crust (average density of 2720 kg m(-3) ) and an intermediate to mafic lower crystalline crust (average density of 2890 kg m(-3)) appear to be cross-cut by two large, dome-shaped mafic high-density bodies (density of 2890 to 3150 kg m(-3)) of considerable thickness above a rather uniform lithospheric mantle (3300 kg m(-3)). The spatial correlation between two major bends of the main Marmara fault and the location of the highdensity bodies suggests that the distribution of lithological heterogeneities within the crust controls the rheological behavior along the NAFZ and, consequently, maybe influences fault segmentation and thus the seismic hazard assessment in the region.

TI  - Differential impact of remotely sensed dry dekads on maize yield in Zimbabwe
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Moisture requirements for crops vary with the crop phenological stage. In this study, we test whether and in what way the sequence of the dry dekads derived from Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) recorded during the growing season affect maize yield. VCI was calculated from eModis NDVI long-term time series data ranging from 2001 to 2016. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test whether there were statistical differences in yield among administrative units with different sequences. Pairwise comparisons indicated that sequences with higher number of dry dekads have significantly lower maize yield than those with few dry dekads. Furthermore, sequences with dry dekads in the beginning of the vegetative stage reduce yield more than those that have the dry dekads at the end. Based on these results, we conclude that the phenological stage at which the dry dekads occur has a significant effect on maize yield.

TI  - Evaluation of the residual efficacy of indoor residual spraying with bendiocarb (FICAM WP 80) in six health districts in Senegal
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFrom 2011 to 2014, an indoor residual spray (IRS) programme for malaria vectors control was implemented in six health districts in Senegal. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of bendiocarb (FICAM WP 80) sprayed on different wall surfaces and its impact on malaria vectors. The entomological monitoring activities were carried out monthly in five treated sentinel villages and one control untreated village in each district.MethodsThe residual efficacy of bendiocarb applied at a dosage of 0.4g/sq m was monitored for a period up to 9months post-IRS using WHO cone bioassay method. This assay consisted to expose 2-5days old unfed susceptible Anopheles coluzzii females to sprayed walls for a period of 30min. The mortality rates after 24h post-exposure were estimated and compared between the different types of walls sprayed in each sentinel village.ResultsThe results showed that the residual efficacy varied between the different sprayed walls, from one sentinel village to another and between the different campaigns. The FICAM had a residual efficacy of 3-6months post-IRS on mud and cement wall surfaces. In some cases, the observed mortality rates were much higher than those reported elsewhere particularly during the first campaign in all the six districts.ConclusionsThe FICAM was found to be effective with a residual efficacy varying from 3 to 6months. If the quality of the IRS application is excluded as a possible explanation of the short efficacy duration, the results suggest at least two rounds of treatments in order to cover the rainy season that lasts 5 to 6months in the area. Such treatments could be carried out before the intensification of the rains in July and August in order to better cover the transmission period that occurs between late August and October in the area.

TI  - Recent changes in two outlet glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula using multi-temporal Landsat and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work investigates the dynamics of the ice front retreat of two tidewater glaciers in adjacent valleys, Drummond and Widdowson (66 degrees 43'S, 65 degrees 46'W), on the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula over the past six decades. The Widdowson Glacier had a more significant area loss (36.37 km(2) or 16.97%) and a higher snow line elevation (200 m above sea level (a.s.l.) in 2016) than the Drummond Glacier (19.11 km(2), or 4.33%; snow line at 100 m a.s.l. in 2016). This difference in the retreat of the two glaciers is attributed slopes and accumulation areas values. The glacier with a smaller area, Widdowson, has been shown to be more sensitive to environmental changes Their steeper glacier front may have influenced the calving rate and generated a more efficient basal slip, increasing the ice flow rate and consequently increasing the retreat rate.

TI  - Analysis of an extreme weather event in a hyper-arid region using WRF-Hydro coupling, station, and satellite data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates an extreme weather event that impacted the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in March 2016, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.7.1 coupled with its hydrological modeling extension package (WRF-Hydro). Six-hourly forecasted forcing records at 0.5 degrees spatial resolution, obtained from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS), are used to drive the three nested downscaling domains of both standalone WRF and coupled WRF-WRF-Hydro configurations for the recent flood-triggering storm. Ground and satellite observations over the UAE are employed to validate the model results. The model performance was assessed using precipitation from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (30 min, 0.1 degrees product), soil moisture from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2; daily, 0.1 degrees product) and the NOAA Soil Moisture Operational Products System (SMOPS; 6-hourly, 0.25 degrees product), and cloud fraction retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Atmosphere product (MODATM; daily, 5 km product). The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), relative bias (rBIAS), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) are used as performance measures. Results show reductions of 24 % and 13 % in RMSE and rBIAS measures, respectively, in precipitation forecasts from the coupled WRF-WRF-Hydro model configuration, when compared to standalone WRF. The coupled system also shows improvements in global radiation forecasts, with reductions of 45 % and 12 % for RMSE and rBIAS, respectively. Moreover, WRF-Hydro was able to simulate the spatial distribution of soil moisture reasonably well across the study domain when compared to AMSR2 derived soil moisture estimates, despite a noticeable dry and wet bias in areas where soil moisture is high and low. Temporal and spatial variabilities of simulated soil moisture compare well to estimates from the NOAA SMOPS product, which indicates the model's capability to simulate surface drainage. Finally, the coupled model showed a shallower planetary boundary layer (PBL) compared to the standalone WRF simulation, which is attributed to the effect of soil moisture feedback. The demonstrated improvement, at the local scale, implies that WRF-Hydro coupling may enhance hydrological and meteorological forecasts in hyper-arid environments.

TI  - Estimation and distribution of near-surface meteorological elements over complex terrains: a case study in the Tibetan areas of West Sichuan Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological elements are important for various fields related to human activities, including scientific research. Using the Tibetan Areas of West Sichuan Province (TAOWS) as an example, this study examined the estimation methods for near-surface air temperature (T-a), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and atmospheric pressure (P) and their distribution characteristics in areas with complex terrains and sparse stations. An improved satellite-based approach, combining an artificial neural network and inverse distance weighting (ANN-IDW), is proposed for estimating T-a and VPD with high-accuracy under all weather conditions from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The data of 41 meteorological stations in TAOWS and its adjacent areas were used for the training and validation of the ANN-IDW. For T-a and VPD, the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the ANN-IDW are 1.45 degrees C to 2.15 degrees C and 0.54 hPa to 0.87 hPa, respectively. Also, the detailed features of the distribution of the estimated T-a and VPD are prominent and closely related to the terrain. The accuracy of the method was also verified indirectly. In addition, the improved method based on the existing method was applied for estimating P. The results confirm that (1) the ANN-IDW is suitable for estimating T-a and VPD in areas with complex terrain and sparse stations under all weather conditions; (2) the improved method is more suitable for estimating P at high-elevation. Moreover, the distribution characteristics of meteorological elements in TAOWS were also analysed. These elements influence agricultural production and animal husbandry and have a high application value. The results further show that topography is the most important factor affecting the spatial distribution and complexity of meteorological elements over complex terrains, but the degree of influence of topography varies greatly across different seasons.

TI  - Development of a Zebrafish S1500+Sentinel Gene Set for High-Throughput Transcriptomics
T2  - ZEBRAFISH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel gene sets have been developed with the purpose of maximizing the information from targeted transcriptomic platforms. We recently described the development of an S1500+ sentinel gene set, which was built for the human transcriptome, utilizing a data- and knowledge-driven hybrid approach to select a small subset of genes that optimally capture transcriptional diversity, correlation with other genes based on large-scale expression profiling, and known pathway annotation within the human genome. While this detailed bioinformatics approach for gene selection can in principle be applied to other species, the reliability of the resulting gene set depends on availability of a large body of transcriptomics data. For the model organism zebrafish, we aimed to create a similar sentinel gene set (Zf S1500+ gene set); however, there is insufficient standardized expression data in the public domain to train the gene correlation model. Therefore, our strategy was to use human-zebrafish ortholog mapping of the human S1500+ genes and nominations from experts in the zebrafish scientific community. In this study, we present the bioinformatics curation and refinement process to produce the final Zf S1500+ gene set, explore whole transcriptome extrapolation using this gene set, and assess pathway-level inference. This gene set will add value to targeted high-throughput transcriptomics in zebrafish for toxicogenomic screening and other research domains.

TI  - A <i>Trans</i>-Ethnic Genome-Wide Association Study of Uterine Fibroids
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uterine fibroids affect up to 77% of women by menopause and account for up to $34 billion in healthcare costs each year. Although fibroid risk is heritable, genetic risk for fibroids is not well understood. We conducted a two-stage case-control meta-analysis of genetic variants in European and African ancestry women with and without fibroids classified by a previously published algorithm requiring pelvic imaging or confirmed diagnosis. Women from seven electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network sites (3,704 imaging-confirmed cases and 5,591 imaging-confirmed controls) and women of African and European ancestry from UK Biobank (UKB, 5,772 cases and 61,457 controls) were included in the discovery genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Variants showing evidence of association in Stage I GWAS (P < 1 x 10(-5)) were targeted in an independent replication sample of African and European ancestry individuals from the UKB (Stage II) (12,358 cases and 138,477 controls). Logistic regression models were fit with genetic markers imputed to a 1000 Genomes reference and adjusted for principal components for each raceand site-specific dataset, followed by fixed-effects meta-analysis. Final analysis with 21,804 cases and 205,525 controls identified 326 genome-wide significant variants in 11 loci, with three novel loci at chromosome 1q24 (sentinel-SNP rs14361789; P = 4.7 x 10(-8)), chromosome 16q12.1 (sentinel-SNP rs4785384; P = 1.5 x 10(-9)) and chromosome 20q13.1 (sentinel-SNP rs6094982; P = 2.6 x 10(-8)). Our statistically significant findings further support previously reported loci including SNPs near WT1 , TNRC6B, SYNE1 , BET1L, and CDC42/WNT4. We report evidence of ancestry-specific findings for sentinel-SNP rs10917151 in the CDC42/WNT4 locus (P = 1.76 x 10(-24)). Ancestry-specific effect-estimates for rs10917151 were in opposite directions (P-Hetbetween-groups = 0.04) for predominantly African (OR = 0.84) and predominantly European women (OR = 1.16). Genetically-predicted gene expression of several genes including LUZP1 in vagina (P = 4.6 x 10(-8)), OBFC1 in esophageal mucosa (P = 8.7 x 10(-8)), NUDT13 in multiple tissues including subcutaneous adipose tissue (P = 3.3 x 10(-6)), and HEATR3 in skeletal muscle tissue (P = 5.8 x 10(-6)) were associated with fibroids. The finding for HEATR3 was supported by SNP-based summary Mendelian randomization analysis. Our study suggests that fibroid risk variants act through regulatory mechanisms affecting gene expression and are comprised of alleles that are both ancestry-specific and shared across continental ancestries.

TI  - Quantifying methane emissions in the Uintah Basin during wintertime stagnation episodes
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a meteorologically-based methodology for quantifying basin-scale methane (CH4) emissions in Utah's Uintah Basin, which is home to over 9,000 active and producing oil and natural gas wells. Previous studies in oil and gas producing regions have often relied on intensive aircraft campaigns to estimate methane emissions. However, the high cost of airborne campaigns prevents their frequent undertaking, thus providing only daytime snapshots of emissions rather than more temporally-representative estimates over multiple days. Providing estimates of CH4 emissions from oil and natural gas production regions across the United States is important to inform leakage rates and emission mitigation efforts in order to curb the potential impacts of these emissions on global climate change and local air quality assessments. Here we introduce the Basin-constrained Emissions Estimate (BEE) method, which utilizes the confining topography of a basin and known depth of a pollution layer during multi-day wintertime cold-air pool episodes to relate point observations of CH4 to basin-scale CH4 emission rates. This study utilizes ground-based CH4 observations from three fixed sites to calculate daily increases in CH4, a laser ceilometer to estimate pollution layer depth, and a Lagrangian transport model to assess the spatial representativity of surface observations. BEE was applied to two cold-air pool episodes during the winter of 2015-2016 and yielded CH4 emission estimates between 44.60 +/- 9.66 x 10(3) and 61.82 +/- 19.76 x 10(3) kg CH4 hr(-1), which are similar to the estimates proposed by previous studies performed in the Uintah Basin. The techniques used in this study could potentially be utilized in other deep basins worldwide.

TI  - Global distribution of methane emissions, emission trends, and OH concentrations and trends inferred from an inversion of GOSAT satellite data for 2010-2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use 2010-2015 observations of atmospheric methane columns from the GOSAT satellite instrument in a global inverse analysis to improve estimates of methane emissions and their trends over the period, as well as the global concentration of tropospheric OH (the hydroxyl radical, methane's main sink) and its trend. Our inversion solves the Bayesian optimization problem analytically including closed-form characterization of errors. This allows us to (1) quantify the information content from the inversion towards optimizing methane emissions and its trends, (2) diagnose error correlations between constraints on emissions and OH concentrations, and (3) generate a large ensemble of solutions testing different assumptions in the inversion. We show how the analytical approach can be used, even when prior error standard deviation distributions are lognormal. Inversion results show large overestimates of Chinese coal emissions and Middle East oil and gas emissions in the EDGAR v4.3.2 inventory but little error in the United States where we use a new gridded version of the EPA national greenhouse gas inventory as prior estimate. Oil and gas emissions in the EDGAR v4.3.2 inventory show large differences with national totals reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and our inversion is generally more consistent with the UNFCCC data. The observed 2010-2015 growth in atmospheric methane is attributed mostly to an increase in emissions from India, China, and areas with large tropical wetlands. The contribution from OH trends is small in comparison. We find that the inversion provides strong independent constraints on global methane emissions (546 Tg a(-1)) and global mean OH concentrations (atmospheric methane lifetime against oxidation by tropospheric OH of 10.8 +/- 0.4 years), indicating that satellite observations of atmospheric methane could provide a proxy for OH concentrations in the future.

TI  - From the Pantheon to the Anthropocene: Introducing Resilience in Architectural History
T2  - ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Originally developed in the ecological circles of the 1970s that pursued critical alternatives to the modernist worldview, the concept of 'resilience' has pervaded 21st-century thought, from psychology to political theory, and from planning to architecture. But in most of its current guises, it has been used in positivist and future-oriented frames of thinking that limit it to an aspired benchmark for managing crises and withstanding catastrophic events. This Special Collection of Architectural Histories is an attempt to recuperate the overlooked potential of 'resilience' by asking whether and how its introduction in architectural history can transform current disciplinary practices. In their articles, the contributing authors revisit buildings that have been reused and transformed to withstand change over the centuries. Adopting the long-term perspective of 'resilience', they examine these physical objects as carriers of multiple layers of interventions, leading them to re-evaluate the intentions of architects and users and to reconsider the place of these buildings in architectural history. In most cases, 'resilience' offers a novel historiographical perspective that unveils long-standing conceptual schemata, from periodizations to methodological tropes, which still condition the historians' interpretation of the past. In the final instance, 'resilience' illuminates the deep-seated modernist dichotomy between 'innovation' and 'tradition' in architectural history. In keeping with its origins in the late 20th-century, the concept offers a significant alternative to 21st-century architectural historians' established views on modernity that are still embedded in their thought and practice.

T2  - ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article traces the re-emergence of historic forms in 20th-century architecture to approaches embedded within the modern project itself. As the history of modern architecture has focused on the production of the new, the resilience of the existing built environment and the implications of appropriating older structures for architectural development are often neglected. The article will look at formerly socialist East Germany, where the grand narrative of modernity was underpinned by a determinist worldview and an ideological urge to replace a doomed capitalist past with a promising socialist future. But despite the intentions of the socialist regime, the existing built environment in East Germany could not be immediately replaced. The old structures had to remain in continuous use.As exemplified by the notable work of Bernhard Klemm, East German architects attempted to recover the built environment in the GDR. To manage the building stock within the constraints of a centrally planned economy, they applied principles of industrial organization and industrial building technologies. Although these primarily local approaches could not entirely prevent dilapidation, the rationalization and industrialization of building repair and urban renewal resulted in the scientific idea of reproducibility and in a reappropriation of historic forms.

TI  - An ensemble model for landslide susceptibility mapping in a forested area
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a new methodological approach using a combination of expert knowledge-based (analytic hierarchy process, AHP), bivariate (statistical index, SI) and multivariate (linear discriminant analysis, LDA) models for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in Mazandran Province, Iran. Tolerance and variance inflation factor indicators were used for assessing multi-collinearity among parameters, and three (i.e. profile curvature, soil type and topography wetness index) of 18 factors were eliminated because of multi-collinearity issues. Fifteen geo-environmental conditioning factors including elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, plan curvature, slope length, convergence index, stream power index, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, distance from fault, lithology, rainfall, land use/landcover and normalized difference vegetation index and 321 landslide locations (testing data set, 70% of total landslides) were used for modeling. The importance of factors showed that distance to road (AHP = 0.201, LDA = 0.301) was the most important factor in landslide occurrence. The validation results using validation data set (138 landslide locations, 30% of total landslides) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that the ensemble models AHP-LDR (83%), AHP-SI (95%) and SI-LDR (83%) had higher prediction accuracies than the individual AHP (82%), SI (82%) and LDA (79%) models and combination of AHP and SI models along with ALOS-PALSAR remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) technique provide powerful tool in LSM in the study area. The results of proposed novel methodological framework can be used by decision-makers and forest engineers for forest management spatially forest roads conservation that have key importance in sustainable development in local and regional scales.

TI  - Directional and angular effects on the spectral reflectance of waters with variable amounts of total suspended solids
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Viewing geometry is one of the most important factors to consider when water bodies are observed from satellite sensors with large field of view. We examine the directional and angular effects on the reflectance of waters with different concentrations of total suspended solids (TSSs). In the laboratory, we measure the reflectance in five view zenith angles (VZAs) and eight view azimuth angles (VAAs) for optically shallow waters having four concentrations of TSSs. Seven empirical models to estimate TSSs based only on the reflectance of the red band (similar to 660 nm) are evaluated. In addition, we analyze Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra reflectance measured in 13 consecutive satellite overpasses. The results show that the reflectance of the inland-like water is affected by data acquisition geometry. The best wavelength to estimate TSS is 625 nm for most VZAs and VAAs. The lowest correlations between reflectance and TSS are observed at extreme viewing with the anisotropy decreasing with increasing concentrations of TSSs. Directional and angular effects are also observed for MODIS (acquired and simulated data) with TSS underestimates observed close to the orthogonal plane for all VZAs, and TSS overestimates observed in the principal scattering plane in the forward scattering direction. More anisotropic waters are observed for VZA greater than +/- 30 deg. Results highlight the need for correcting MODIS data for bidirectional effects in inland water studies.

TI  - Inversion Algorithm for Turbidity of Bohai and Yellow Seas Based on NPP-VIIRS Satellite Data
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is an important indicator for monitoring water environment and water quality, and the satellite remote sensing technology has the advantages of macroscopic spatial coverage and repeated sampling, which is an effective way of monitoring water turbidity. Based on the remote sensing reflectivity of NPP-VIIRS satellite, a water turbidity remote sensing inversion algorithm is developed and applied to the VIIRS satellite data to obtain a long-time series of satellite-derived water turbidity in the Bohai and Yellow seas. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a high accuracy with the R-2 of 0. 97, the root mean square error of 16 NTU, the mean absolute deviation of 23 NTU, and the mean relative error of 31.63%. On a spatial scale, the turbidity distributions arc generally high in the near-shore areas and low in the offshore areas. In contrast in the time scale, the water turbidity is at a high level in winter, but the regions with high turbidity shrink in spring. The turbidity is generally at the lowest level in summer and only the coastal waters show high turbidity values. In autumn, the turbidity gradually increases.

TI  - On-Orbit Spectral Calibration Algorithm of Infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometer
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The gcostationary interferometric infrared sounder (GIIRS) on-board FY-4A satellite is an infrared Fourier transform spectrometer. To improve the quantitative application level of observed data, it is necessary to conduct the on-orbit spectral calibration of the GIIRS accurately. Since the spectral positions arc determined by the reference laser frequency and the number of the sampling points collected from interferograms for the Fourier transform spectrometer, the key of the spectral calibration is to ensure the stability of the reference laser frequency. In this study, a line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) is used to calculate the reference atmospheric absorption spectra. The effective sampling frequency of the laser is determined empirically by comparing the root-mean-square error between the observed and the reference spectra of the detector, achieving the on-orbit high-precision spectral calibration of the detector. This method is used for the on-orbit spectral calibration of the GIIRS on-board FY-4A satellite, clearly demonstrating its application value.

T2  - AVIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding geographic distributions of species is a crucial step in spatial planning for biodiversity conservation, particularly as regards changes in response to global climate change. This information is especially important for species of global conservation concern that are susceptible to the effects of habitat loss and climate change. In this study, we used ecological niche modeling to assess the current and future geographic distributional potential of White-breasted Guineafowl (Agelastes meleagrides) (Vulnerable) across West Africa. MethodsWe used primary occurrence data obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and national parks in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and two independent environmental datasets (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index at 250m spatial resolution, and Worldclim climate data at 2.5 spatial resolution for two representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios and 27 general circulation models for 2050) to build ecological niche models in Maxent.ResultsFrom the projections, White-breasted Guineafowl showed a broader potential distribution across the region compared to the current IUCN range estimate for the species. Suitable areas were concentrated in the Gola rainforests in northwestern Liberia and southeastern Sierra Leone, the Tai-Sapo corridor in southeastern Liberia and southwestern Cote d'Ivoire, and the Nimba Mountains in northern Liberia, southeastern Guinea, and northwestern Cote d'Ivoire. Future climate-driven projections anticipated minimal range shifts in response to climate change.ConclusionsBy combining remotely sensed data and climatic data, our results suggest that forest cover, rather than climate is the major driver of the species' current distribution. Thus, conservation efforts should prioritize forest protection and mitigation of other anthropogenic threats (e.g. hunting pressure) affecting the species.

TI  - Spectral band adaptation of ocean color sensors for applicability of the multi-water biogeo-optical algorithm ONNS
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean color algorithm ONNS (OLCI Neural Network Swarm) is designed to process remote-sensing reflectances at 11 Sentinel-3/OLCI bands in order to derive water quality parameters for most natural waters [Hieronymi et al., Front. Mar. Sci. 4, 140 (2017)]. The present work introduces a spectral band-shifting procedure, which allows exploitation of atmospherically corrected input from SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS, OCM-2, VIIRS, SGLI, GOCI-2, EnMAP, or PACE/OCI and corresponding utilization of ONNS or other ocean color algorithms. The performance of the band adapters is evaluated in view of diverse optical water types. In the spectral range between 400 and 600 nm, the mean percentage retrieval error is mostly <5%. The band adaptation is a tool for cross-mission Earth observation and uncertainty estimate, as well as for extended possibilities of algorithm validation.

TI  - Reconstruction and evaluation of changes in hydrologic conditions over a transboundary region by a regional climate model coupled with a physically-based hydrology model: Application to Thao river watershed
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The differences among countries in terms of physical features, governmental policies, priorities in short-and long-term water resources management may lead to conflicts in managing and sharing of water resources over the transboundary regions. Due to no formal data sharing agreement between countries, there has been usually no data availability at transboundary regions. In this study, a methodology, in which a physically-based hydrology model was coupled with a regional climate model, is proposed to reconstruct and evaluate hydrologic conditions over transboundary regions. For the case study, Thao river watershed (TRW), within Vietnam and China, was selected. The Watershed Environmental Hydrology (WEHY) model was implemented based on topography, soil, and land use/cover information which was retrieved from global satellite data resources. The watershed model-WEHY was first validated over the TRW, and then was used to reconstruct historical hydrologic conditions during 1950-2007. The results of this study suggest no significant trend in the annual streamflow over the target watershed. In addition, there is a time shift in the wet season between the upstream sector in China and the downstream sector in Vietnam over the TRW. The annual flow contribution from the upstream sector in China to the outlet of TRW is estimated to be around 66%, and the remaining 34% contribution comes from the downstream sector in Vietnam territory. Last but not the least, the annual flow as a function of return period varies not only with the return period but also as a function of the time window, reflecting the effect of the changing regime on the streamflows at the TRW. The evolution of the flow frequency through time is an evidence of the ongoing non-stationarity in the hydrologic conditions over TRW. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban growth analysis and simulations using cellular automata and geo-informatics: comparison between almaty and astana in kazakhstan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, the SLEUTH urban growth model is calibrated and validated for the first time to post Soviet Union cities. The aim of the study is to monitor, assess, simulate and compare the spatiotemporal urban growth dynamics and spatial patterns of the two largest cities Almaty and Astana using free remote sensing data. The urban expansion metrics and SLEUTH model are used to assess the urban growth dynamics. Though the capital has been moved to Astana from Almaty in 1998, Almaty is still developing faster than Astana. The urban growth simulation results from SLEUTH show Astana will surpass the urban growth of Almaty to emerge as the largest city in Kazakhstan by 2030. Astana may experience more leapfrog and ribbon developments. In Almaty, the urban growth may likely to take place in north and north-west parts.

TI  - Exploring the spatial patterns of vegetation fragmentation using local spatial autocorrelation indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of urban vegetation obtained from discrete land cover classes is sensitive to classification errors and can result in a substantial loss of information, due to the degradation of continuous quantitative information. Although there is an increasing ecological need to use continuous methods to understand spatial heterogeneity and vegetation fragmentation, they remain unexplored. Since local indicators of spatial association (LISA) can capture important spatial patterns of clustering and dispersion at a local scale, it can capture important ecological patterns and process of vegetation fragmentation. This work examines the utility of LISA which allows exploration of local patterns in spatial data in identifying high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) spatial clusters of vegetation patches and fragmentation patterns in Harare metropolitan city in Zimbabwe. The LISA indices of Getis-Ord Gi* and local Moran's I are computed both on continuous normalized difference vegetation index and discrete land cover data of vegetation and nonvegetation of Sentinel 2016 and 2018. Local spatial clustering patterns are identified with Z-score values that indicate the significance of each statistic. High positive Z-scores are located in the large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation. Negative Z-scores are located in more dispersed and highly fragmented vegetation. The results suggest that there is a strong tendency for large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation patches to be spatially clustered and for small, isolated and sparse vegetation patches to be dispersed. The highly fragmented vegetation patches are located in the heavily urbanized part of the city. Overall, findings of this study underscore the relevance of the spatially explicit method of LISA as a valuable source of spatial information for the assessment of local spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches. This can be used to develop policies that support effective conservation and restoration strategies. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Phase III Trial Evaluating the Impact of Lymphoscintigraphy as Part of Sentinel Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer: SenSzi (GBG80) Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE The aim of the current work was to clarify whether a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) enhances staging accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).PATIENTS AND METHODS In a prospective, multicenter, randomized phase III trial, patients with cN0 early breast cancer or extensive/high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ planned for standard radioactive-labeled colloid LSG with subsequent SLNB were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive SLNB either with knowledge of the LSG findings or without. As the false-negative rate of SLNB correlates with the number of resected sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), our primary end point was the mean number of histologically detected SLNs per patient. One thousand one hundred two evaluable patients were necessary to demonstrate noninferiority of SLNB without LSG. Stratified one-sided 95% CI for the difference (without LSG - with LSG) in the mean number of histologically detected SLNs had to be greater than -0.27 (10% noninferiority margin). Stratification was performed according to tumor focality and trial site. Additional predefined secondary end points (rates of node-positive patients and of completion axillary lymph node dissection) were analyzed to rule out differences in the reliable detection of nodal metastases.RESULTS Between May 2014 and October 2015, 1,198 patients were randomly assigned in 23 German and Swiss breast centers. Modified intention-to-treat analysis (n = 1,163) showed a mean number of histologically detected SLNs of 2.21 with LSG and 2.26 without LSG (difference 0.05; stratified 95% CI, -0.18 to infinity), thus establishing noninferiority of omitting preoperative LSG. Secondary end points displayed no statistically significant differences.CONCLUSION We show that SLNB is equally effective irrespective of the surgeon's knowledge of preoperative LSG results. SLNB without LSG will speed up the preoperative workflow and reduce cost. (C) 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Semi-analytical algorithms of ocean color remote sensing under high solar zenith angles
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing interest in ocean color remote sensing in polar oceans and geostationary ocean color satellite with diurnal observations, it is unavoidable to encounter ocean color retrievals under high solar zenith angles. Under these scenarios, the capability of current remote sensing algorithms is poorly known. In this study, the performance of the two widely used semi-analytical algorithms for the water inherent optical properties (QAA and GSM01) under high solar zenith angle conditions were firstly evaluated based on global in situ data set (SeaBASS-NOMAD). The results showed that the performances of both QAA and GSM01 degraded significantly with the increasing in solar zenith angle (SZA), and the biases increased about 1.3-fold when SZA varied from 30 degrees to 80 degrees. The high uncertainties at high SZA was mainly induced by the systematic overestimation of the key parameter u (ratio of backscattering coefficient to the sum of absorption and backscattering coefficients) at high solar zenith angles. Based on the Hydrolight-simulated data set, a new model (NN-algorithm) for retrieving u from remote sensing reflectance was developed for high solar zenith angle conditions using the neural network method. The validation results revealed that the NN-algorithm could improve the estimation of parameter u and further ocean color products. In addition, our results indicate that a more accurate atmosphere correction is needed to deal with ocean color remote sensing data acquired under large solar zenith angle conditions.

TI  - Feasibility of hand-assisted laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy in open endometrial cancer surgery
T2  - MINIMALLY INVASIVE THERAPY & ALLIED TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this preliminary retrospective study was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of Indocyanine Green (ICG) sentinel node (SLN) sampling using a laparoscopic camera during open endometrial cancer surgery. Material and methods: Retrospective study. Fourteen women with endometrial cancer, not fit for a complete laparoscopic staging, underwent SLN mapping using the IMAGE1 camera during open surgery. Results: The median age of patients was 67 (range 33-86) years. Median BMI was 31 (range 23-58). Mean operative time 157.5 minutes and hospital stay three days. The overall detection rate of SLN mapping was 93%. Bilateral detection was 86%. No post-operative short or long-term complications were observed. Conclusions: Real-time NIR technology supported by the IMAGE1 S is a reliable system and represents a promising method for SLN mapping in selected cases with EC and severe surgical risks, during 48 traditional open approaches. The use of laparoscopy ICG in open surgery seems to be a feasible and useful tool for the detection of SLN in endometrial cancer patients with intraoperative and/or postoperative high morbidity risk. It represents a valid alternative to robotic surgery, particularly in countries and centers where the robotic platform or SPY system for open surgery are not available.

TI  - Application of feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms for saltmarsh biomass estimation using Worldview-2 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing large scale plant productivity of coastal marshes is essential to understand the resilience of these systems to climate change. Two machine learning approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) regression were tested to estimate biomass of a common saltmarshes species, salt couch grass (Sporobolus virginicus). Reflectance and vegetation indices derived from 8 bands of Worldview-2 multispectral data were used for four experiments to develop the biomass model. These four experiments were, Experiment-1: 8 bands of Worldview-2 image, Experiment-2: Possible combination of all bands of Worldview-2 for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) type vegetation indices, Experiment-3: Combination of bands and vegetation indices, Experiment-4: Selected variables derived from experiment-3 using variable selection methods. The main objectives of this study are (i) to recommend an affordable low cost data source to predict biomass of a common saltmarshes species, (ii) to suggest a variable selection method suitable for multispectral data, (iii) to assess the performance of RF and SVM for the biomass prediction model. Cross-validation of parameter optimizations for SVM showed that optimized parameter of e-SVR failed to provide a reliable prediction. Hence, nu-SVR was used for the SVM model. Among the different variable selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE) selected a minimum number of variables (only 4) with an RMSE of 0.211 (kg/m2). Experiment-4 (only selected bands) provided the best results for both of the machine learning regression methods, RF (R-2= 0.72, RMSE= 0.166 kg/m2) and SVR (R-2= 0.66, RMSE = 0.200 kg/m2) to predict biomass. When a 10-fold cross validation of the RF model was compared with a 10-fold cross validation of SVR, a significant difference (p = <0.0001) was observed for RMSE. One to one comparisons of actual to predicted biomass showed that RF underestimates the high biomass values, whereas SVR overestimates the values; this suggests a need for further investigation and refinement.

TI  - Remote Sensing to Estimate Sea-Surface Density of Yellow and Bohai Seas off the East Coast of China
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of our study of 55 samples collected during four cruises in the Yellow and Bohai Seas off the cast coast of China (November 2014, August 2015, July 2016, and January 2017), we developed an algorithm for estimating the sea-surface density (SSD) using remote-sensing reflectance. Our results show that the multivariate linear regression model performs the best, with a determination coefficient of 0.70 and a mean absolute percentage error of S-MAPE =3.49%. We used an independent dataset (27 in situ observations) to assess the performance of the model, yielding a validation result of S-MAPE =3.27%. In addition, the sensitivity experiment of the model show that the observed fluctuation in the S-MAPE values is <3%, indicating that our proposed model is relatively stable. Meanwhile, we applied our developed model to the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) satellite data recorded in July 2016 and successfully produced the SSD distribution pattern. The spatial characteristics show that the coastal waters, the central parts of the Bohai and Yellow Seas, and the waters off the northern Shandong Peninsula have relatively high SSD values, while relatively low values arc distributed along the Qingdao coast.

TI  - Hyperspectral analysis of objects under shadow conditions based on field reflectance measurements
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shaded objects in remote sensing data are usually neglected because of their low reflectance. The common treatment for detecting shadows consists of simple identification and straightforward removal; however, this approach is often criticized owing to the complexity and difficulty of its application and the incompleteness of the treated data. Recent efforts with hyperspectral field reflectance measurements have provided alternatives to scrutinize the issues of shadows. To demonstrate our proposed framework, we first gathered basic hyperspectral data with a spectrometer at Peking University, Beijing, China. Subsequently, we classified the spectral reflectances into three types: sunlight reflectance, shadow reflectance, and simulated reflectance. The spectral characteristics of shadows can provide pertinent classification information despite their low reflectance. Under full shadow conditions, the simulated reflectance was close to the sunlight reflectance because the same reduction ratio was used for the spectralon panel during the measurement process. In addition, the ratio of the shadow reflectance to the sunlight reflectance seemed to be related to the characteristics of the obstruction. The findings in this paper can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the influence of shadows in remote sensing research, demonstrating the potential of fully utilizing typically neglected shadow information.

AB  - Objective: To understand the characteristics relating to the etiology and complications of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) based on data from the pilot National Sentinel Surveillance (NSS) program so as to explore the feasibility, advantages and disadvantages of the NSS. Methods: Data were extracted from the NSS system, conducted in 11 provinces of China from November 2015 to October 2016. Characteristics regarding the etiology, complications of HFMD and factors related to the positive rates of HFMD specimens were analyzed under the logistic regression method by SPSS 20.0 software. Results: A total of 4 783 specimens were collected, including 3 390 from mild, 1 390 from severe and 3 from death cases. The overall positive rate was 81.43% (3 895/4 783). Other enteroviruses (non EV71/Cox A16 enteroviruses) appeared the major serotype (52.68%, 1 482/2 813) for mild infection of the disease while EV71 was for the severe cases (65.31%, 706/1 081). The serotype spectrum revealed by the pilot NSS was almost identical with the existing surveillance system. Other enteroviruses tended to infect younger children (chi(2)=130.17, P<0.001) than EV71 and Cox A16, in China. The multivariate logistic regression results showed that higher positive rate was associated with specimens which were collected from males, at children' hospitals, in peak seasons, timely and in stools. The positive rates presented downwarding trends with the extension of the onset-sampling interval (chi(2)=14.47, P<0.001 in stool specimen; chi(2)=31.99, P<0.001 in throat swab; chi(2)=24.26, P<0.001 in anal swab). Aseptic meningitis, non-brainstem encephalitis and brainstem encephalitis appeared the top three complications of both EV71-associated and other enteroviruses-associated severe HFMD cases. Conclusions: Factors as gender, season/place/timeliness of specimen collection, and types of hospital all appeared independently influenced the positive rates. NSS seemed feasible to be used as an alternative or supplement tool to the existing surveillance program in China.
AB  - 目的： 分析2015－2016年我国手足口病哨点监测系统的手足口病特征，探讨建立手足口病哨点监测的可行性、优势及不足。 方法： 数据来源于11个国家级哨点监测点2015年11月至2016年10月手足口病监测数据，描述手足口病的病原特征、代表性和重症病例并发症情况，采用多因素logistic回归分析手足口病哨点监测样本阳性率的相关影响因素。采用SPSS 20.0软件进行统计学分析。 结果： 共有4 783例手足口病病例样本，其中轻症病例3 390例，重症病例1 390例，死亡3例。肠道病毒（EV）阳性率为81.43%（3 895/4 783），轻症病例优势血清型为其他EV（52.68%，1 482/2 813），重症病例优势血清型为EV71（65.31%，706/1 081）。哨点监测显示的优势血清型与同时期现有监测血清型基本一致。其他EV所致病例中低年龄组儿童所占比例高于EV71和柯萨奇病毒A组16型（Cox A16）（chi(2)=130.17，P<0.001）。多因素logistic回归结果显示，样本阳性率高与男性、高发月份病例、儿童医院病例、样本为粪便、及时采样有关。不同类型样本阳性率均呈现随发病-采样间隔时间的延长而下降的趋势（粪便趋势chi(2)=14.47，P<0.001；咽拭子趋势chi(2)=31.99，P<0.001；肛拭子趋势chi(2)=24.26，P<0.001）。无菌性脑膜炎、非脑干脑炎、脑干脑炎为重症病例最常见的3种并发症，EV71和其他EV所致重症病例并发症差异无统计学意义。 结论： 哨点监测发现性别、发病月份、接诊医院类别、标本类型、采样及时性是影响手足口病样本阳性率的5个独立影响因素。哨点监测可以收集这些影响因素以提升监测质量。设立手足口病国家级哨点监测在我国是可行的。.

TI  - Fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series for permanent and temporary surface water mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatial and temporal extents of permanent and temporary bodies of surface water is important for various applications such as water resource management, climate modelling, and biodiversity conservation. Satellite remote sensing is an effective source of information to detect surface water over large areas and document their evolution in time. Recently, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched freely available SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical sensors (Sentinel-1 & 2) with high revisiting time and spatial resolution. The objective of this paper is to explore the contribution of multi-temporal and multi-source (passive and active) Sentinel observations for improving the detection and mapping of surface waters by applying decision-level image fusion techniques. The approach is tested over Central Ireland using a time series of 16 Sentinel-1 images and a few Sentinel-2 images for the period 2015-2016. Compared to a mono-date approach, the combination of Sentinel-1 & 2 observations provides better accuracy for mapping permanent surface water. Decision level fusion technique allows mapping temporary surface water (such as flooding) with a high accuracy. It also gives the possibility to monitor their dynamics by providing the probability of occurrence of flooded areas at the pixel level.

TI  - Evaluation of filtering effects on terrestrial water storage estimation from new GRACE releases
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to understand the effect of filtering on global and regional terrestrial water storage (TWS) signal derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data obtained from Centre for Space Research (CSR), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ). Our results show that the CSR and GFZ solutions were compatible after processing, while for JPL solutions were more challenging to eliminate data noises using filtering techniques. Concerning the effect of changing the Gauss filtering radius on TWS, differences were found to be at a maximum +/- 5 cm in annual amplitude and +/- 1 cm/yr in trend sections; mostly apparent in regions where the signal was anomalous. Various destriping methods may led to data misinterpretation, loss of available TWS signal or confusion. Finally, new releases of CSR (RL06) showed an improvement compared to former versions particularly for solutions for the specific time of year chosen in this study.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) methodology has been successfully employed to detect water level changes and produce corresponding water level variation maps. In this study, Agia and Kournas lakes, located in Western Crete, Greece, were used as pilot areas to monitor water level change with means of SAR interferometry and auxiliary Earth Observation (EO) data. The water level variation was monitored for the period 2015-2016, using Sentinel-1A imageries and corresponding stage water level data. Landsat 8 data were additionally used to study vegetation regime and surface water extent and how these parameters affect interferograms performance. The results highlighted the fact that the combination of SAR backscattering intensity and unwrapped phase can provide additional insight into hydrological studies. The overall analysis of both interferometric characteristics and backscattering mechanism denoted their potential in enhancing the reliability of the water-level retrieval scheme and optimizing the capture of hydrological patterns spatial distribution.

TI  - Evaluation of linear discriminant and support vector machine classifiers for classification of nitrogen status in mature oil palm from SPOT-6 satellite images: analysis of raw spectral bands and spectral indices
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) management is important in sustaining oil palm production. Remote sensing-based approaches via spectral index have promise in assessing the N nutrition content. The objectives of this study are; (i) to examine the N classification capability of three spectral indices (SI) such as visible (Vis), near infrared (NIR) and a combination of visible and NIR (Vis + NIR) from the SPOT-6 satellite, and (ii) to compare the performance of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) in discriminating foliar N content of mature oil palms. Nitrogen treatments varied from 0 to 2 kg per palm. The N-sensitive SIs tested in this study were age-dependent. The Vis index (BGRI(1)) (CVA = 79.55%) and Vis + NIR index (NDVI, NG, IPVI and GNDVI) (CVA = 81.82%) were the best indices to assess N status of young and prime mature palms through the SVM classifier.

TI  - Modelling <i>Parthenium hysterophorus</i> invasion in KwaZulu-Natal province using remotely sensed data and environmental variables
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, infestations of invasive plant species impact negatively on the environment, livelihoods and local and national economies. Therefore, understanding their potential distribution is paramount. In this study, we sought to model habitats susceptible to Parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) invasion using environmental and Sentinel 2 multi-spectral imagery variables in a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) environment. Using occurrence points we tested the utility of (i) spectral bands (ii) derived vegetation indices and (iii) the combination of spectral bands and vegetation indices. Area under curve (AUC) values in MaxEnt were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results show that the combination of environmental variables and spectral bands yielded superior AUC value of 0.976. Sentinel 2 red-edge band (705 nm) and the normalized red edge vegetation indices were the most influential variables in predicting habitat susceptible to Parthenium invasion. These results illustrate the potential of Sentinel 2 MSI and environmental variables in predicting Parthenium invasion.

TI  - Geographical random forests: a spatial extension of the random forest algorithm to address spatial heterogeneity in remote sensing and population modelling
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) are being increasingly applied on traditionally geographical topics such as population estimation. Even though RF is a well performing and generalizable algorithm, the vast majority of its implementations is still 'aspatial' and may not address spatial heterogenous processes. At the same time, remote sensing (RS) data which are commonly used to model population can be highly spatially heterogeneous. From this scope, we present a novel geographical implementation of RF, named Geographical Random Forest (GRF) as both a predictive and exploratory tool to model population as a function of RS covariates. GRF is a disaggregation of RF into geographical space in the form of local sub-models. From the first empirical results, we conclude that GRF can be more predictive when an appropriate spatial scale is selected to model the data, with reduced residual autocorrelation and lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. Finally, and of equal importance, GRF can be used as an effective exploratory tool to visualize the relationship between dependent and independent variables, highlighting interesting local variations and allowing for a better understanding of the processes that may be causing the observed spatial heterogeneity.

TI  - Geo-spatially modelling dengue epidemics in urban cities: a case study of Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study objective is to predict the epidemiological impact of dengue fever arbovirosis in urban tropical areas of Pakistan. To do so, we used the GPS-based data of the Aedes larvae collected during 2014-2015 in Lahore. We developed a Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR) model for Geospatially predicting larvae presence or absence in Lahore. Data on rainfall, temperature are included along with time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat imagery. We observed a high spatial variability of the GWLR parameter estimates of these variables in the study area. The GWLR model significantly ( = 0.78) explained the presence or absence of Aedes larvae with temperature, rainfall and NDVI variables in South and Southeast of the study area. In the North and North-West, however, GWLR relationships were observed weak in highly populated areas. Interpolating GWLR coefficients generate more accurate maps of Aedes larvae presence or absence

TI  - Incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with the MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product to improve burn date estimates and reduce burn date uncertainty in wildland fire mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildland fires result in a unique signal detectable by multispectral remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, in many regions, such as Southeast Asia, persistent cloud cover and aerosols temporarily obstruct multispectral satellite observations of burned area, including the MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area Product (BAP). Multiple days between cloud free pre- and post-burn MODIS observations result in burn date uncertainty. We incorporate cloud-penetrating, C-band SAR-with the MODIS MCD64A1 BAP in Southeast Asia, to exploit the strengths of each dataset to better estimate the burn date and reduce the potential burn date uncertainty range. We incorporate built-in quality control using MCD64A1 to reduce erroneous pixel updating. We test the method over part of Laos and Thailand during April 2016 and found average uncertainty reduction of 4.5 d, improving 15% of MCD64A1 pixels. A new BAP could improve monitoring temporal trends of wildland fires, air quality studies and monitoring post-fire vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Lithologic mapping of a forested montane terrain from Landsat 5 TM image
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Thick forest cover and poor infrastructures are the major hindrances for detailed lithologic mapping in an inaccessible montane landscape. To overcome these limitations, we utilize a Landsat 5 TM image to map lithology using vegetation and drainage pattern as an indicator of underlying rock types in a heavily forested region of the Chittagong Hill Tracts area located in southeastern Bangladesh. We use supervised and unsupervised classifiers for a vegetation-based approach while on-screen digitization is used for drainage patterns-based mapping. Field observations were used for mapping lithology and evaluating accuracy. Overall, our results agree well with the current geologic map and improve it by providing a more spatially detailed distribution of the sandstone and shale. The performances of all approaches are good at the inner and outer flanks of anticlines located in the study area while the drainage pattern mapping performs best at the mid-flank area.

TI  - Examining the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery for commercial forest species mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful launch and operation of the Sentinel satellite platform has provided access to freely available remotely sensed data useful for commercial forest species discrimination. Sentinel - 1 (S1) with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and Sentinel - 2 (S2) multi-spectral sensor with additional and strategically positioned bands offer great potential for providing reliable information for discriminating and mapping commercial forest species. In this study, we sought to determine the value of S1 and S2 data characteristics in discriminating and mapping commercial forest species. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm, S2 multi-spectral imagery showed an overall classification accuracy of 84% (kappa = 0.81), with bands such as the red-edge (703.9-740.2 nm), narrow near infrared (835.1-864.8 nm), and short wave infrared (1613.7-2202.4 nm) particularly influential in discriminating individual forest species stands. When Sentinel 2's spectral wavebands were fused with Sentinel 1's (SAR) VV and VH polarimetric modes, overall classification accuracies improved to 87% (kappa = 0.83) and 88% (kappa = 0.85), respectively. These findings demonstrate the value of combining Sentinel's multispectral and SAR structural information characteristics in improving commercial forest species discrimination. These, in addition to the sensors free availability, higher spatial resolution and larger swath width, offer unprecedented opportunities for improved local and large scale commercial forest species discrimination and mapping.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change in the surface temperature of Himalayan lake and its inter-relation with water quality and growth in aquatic vegetation
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface temperature (LST) monitoring is important as it plays a vital role in understanding the functioning of lakes and significantly shapes water ecological environments. A geospatial analysis was carried out to observe changes in LST for Wular lake during 1992 to 2017 using Landsat thermal data. This study revealed a warming trend in LST with increase in 1.82 degrees C for the period (1992-2017). It was perceived that LST significantly influences the water quality parameters and revealed a statistically significant relationship with R-2 > 0.5 with a significance value (p) < .001 for most of the parameters. Ground validation of satellite-derived LST was done with in situ measurement having R-2 and standard error of estimate equal to 0.71 and 0.77, respectively. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation indicated towards a significantly positive relationship between normalized difference vegetation index and LST is an indicative of growth of aquatic vegetation in lake bed over the years.

TI  - Long-term soil moisture content estimation using satellite and climate data in agricultural area of Mongolia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to estimate long-term SMC and find its relation with soil moisture (SM) of climate station in different depths and NDVI for the growing season. The study area is located in agricultural regions in the North of Mongolia. The Pearson's correlation methodology was used in this study. We used MODIS and SPOT satellite data and 14 years data for precipitation, temperature and SMC of 38 climate stations. The estimated SMC from this methodology were compared with SM from climate data and NDVI. The estimated SMC was compared with SM of climate stations at a 10-cm depth (r(2) = 0.58) and at a 50-cm depth (r(2) = 0.38), respectively. From the analysis, it can be seen that the previous month's SMC affects vegetation growth of the following month, especially from May to August. The methodology can be an advantageous indicator for taking further environmental analysis in the region.

TI  - Object-based classification of mixed forest types in Mongolia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to produce updated forest map of the Bogdkhan Mountain, Mongolia using multitemporal Sentinel-2A images. The target area has highly mixed forest types and it is very difficult to differentiate the fuzzy boundaries among different forest types. To extract the forest class information, an object-based classification technique is applied and a rule-base to separate the mixed classes is developed. The rule-base uses a hierarchy of rules describing different conditions under which the actual classification has to be performed. To compare the result of the developed method with a result of a pixel-based approach, a Bayesian maximum likelihood classification is applied. The final result indicates overall accuracy of 90.87% for the object-based classification, while for the pixel-based approach it is 79.89%. Overall, the research indicates that the object-based method that uses a thoroughly defined segmentation and a well-constructed rule-base can significantly improve the classification of mixed forest types and produce of a reliable forest map.

TI  - Exploring the inclusion of Sentinel-2 MSI texture metrics in above-ground biomass estimation in the community forest of Nepal
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of the improved resolution Sentinel-2 MSI data was explored through texture metrics, vegetation indices (VIs) and pooled dataset using the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to estimate Above-ground Biomass (AGB) in a sub-tropical forest of Nepal. Texture metrics were derived based on different working window sizes (3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7 and 9 x 9), and the results were compared with those obtained, using raw traditional bands (Analysis set 1: 2, 3, 4, 8, 11 and 12), raw traditional and red edge bands (Analysis set 2: Set 1 + Band 5, 6, 7 and 8A), and red edge bands (Analysis set 3) only. Comparatively, the use of pooled data (texture and VIs) yielded higher biomass estimates. The results from pooled data based on the 7 x 7 window size resulted in models with better model fitting parameters. For instance, pooled data produced an R-2 = 0.99 and a RMSE = 4.51 t ha(-1) (relRMSE = 2.82). Further, the RF model selected dissimilarity, variance and mean from Band 2 and SAVI (Soil adjusted vegetation index) as the most important AGB predictor variables. The results demonstrated that like the red-edge bands, traditional bands were equally important in AGB estimation.

TI  - Assessing land use-land cover change and soil erosion potential using a combined approach through remote sensing, RUSLE and random forest algorithm
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use-land cover (LULC) change and the associated risk of soil erosion have become a global environmental concern. We herein presented a geospatial analysis to detect LULC changes (1984-2010) in a Canadian watershed by using object-based classification of Landsat satellite images. We found that the watershed experienced a substantial increase in forest clear cutting and built-up areas. The detected LULC changes were implemented into the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to examine the soil erosion potential. We divided the soil erosion risk into five classes ranging from very low (<6 ton ha(-1) year(-1)) to severe (33 ton ha(-1) year(-1)) levels. The random forest algorithm was then implemented and detected that the topography and LULC conditions of 1999 and 2010 had the most influence on the erosion in 2010. The findings of this study will support efficient LULC management to reduce soil erosion and the consequent degradation of water quality.

TI  - Evaluation of ICA and CEM algorithms with Landsat-8/ASTER data for geological mapping in inaccessible regions
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many regions remain poorly studied in terms of geological mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions especially in the Arctic and Antarctica due to harsh conditions and logistic difficulties. Application of specialized image processing techniques is capable of revealing the hidden linear mixing spectra in multispectral and hyperspectral satellite images. In this study, the applications of Independent component analysis (ICA) and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) algorithms were evaluated for Landsat-8 and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) remote sensing data for geological mapping in Morozumi Range and Helliwell Hills areas, Northern Victoria Land (NVL), Antarctica. The results of this investigation demonstrate the capability of the two algorithms in distinguishing pixel and subpixel targets in the multispectral satellite data. The application of the methods for identifying poorly exposed geologic materials and subpixel exposures of alteration minerals has invaluable implications for geological mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential of Sentinel-1A SAR data was assessed for the time-series analysis of orchard biophysical parameters and crop system. The study revealed characteristics variations in the backscatter coefficient with respect to time and polarization for age in VH polarization than in VV and ratio of VV/VH polarization showing discrimination of young orchard particularly in VV polarization. The parameter of the orchard (age, DBH, canopy radius and visual height) shows a promising relationship with backscatter coefficient. Out of several regression models, VV channel responds with a fair regression coefficient of 0.54, 0.52, 0.48 and 0.44 for height with rmse of 0.5, 1.3, 0.7 and 0.6 for age, DBH, canopy radius and visual height, respectively. Multiple regression coefficient of 0.61 was observed for January 2018 in VV polarization as best date for study. These empirical relationships have potential for the inverse backscatter modelling.

TI  - Optimal datasets suitability for pearl millet (Bajra) discrimination using multiparametric SAR data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In view with the importance of coarse cereals, it was proposed to discriminate pearl millet crop in a mixed crop scenario using different combinations of time series multipolarized SAR with available optical data. Five date dual polarized Sentinel-1 DT classification was found to be optimum, as Bajra classification accuracy increased by 7.6% over four date. The improved Bajra accuracy of 85% was achieved when 2 date Sentinel-1was integrated with higher value quad polarized Radarsat-2 data. Similar structured crops like Sorghum and maize could be discriminated using difference in crop calendar and polarization response. Single date Sentinel-2 (near harvest stage as available) with 2 date Sentinel-1 yields 66% accuracy for Bajra crop but the attempt to extract temporal phenological profile was failed due to persistent cloud cover in the previous dates. Radarsat-2 data increased Bajra accuracy up to 89.5% when responsive polarimetric parameters were used in conjunction with multiple linear polarizations.

TI  - Surface displacements of the 12 November 2017 Iran-Iraq earthquake derived using SAR interferometry
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017 M-w 7.3 Iran-Iraq earthquake occurred in the seismically less active northern Zagros Mountains. In this study, DInSAR technique is used to derive the surface displacements of the earthquake using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 images. One preseismic, three coseismic and a postseismic interferogram are generated. The coseismic interferograms did not show any signs of a surface rupture and indicate a maximum of 80 cm uplift and 50 cm subsidence. The zenith total delay maps derived from the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR are used to correct tropospheric delays in the interferograms. After correction, an error of 0-2 cm is observed in the line of sight measurements. The preseismic displacement reveals an indication of ground motion before the earthquake occurrence. The postseismic phase indicates afterslip after the earthquake. Localized displacements corresponding to landslides are observed on the mountainous slopes. The 3D displacements reveal similar to 40 cm of surface motion suggesting westward movement and reverse faulting.

TI  - Increase of scabies infestations, Norway, 2006 to 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Between October and December 2018, several clinicians in Norway reported an increase in scabies diagnoses. We compared data from the Norwegian Syndromic Surveillance System on medical consultations for mite infestations with scabies treatment sales data to investigate this reported increase. From 2013 to 2018, consultations and sates of scabies treatments had almost increased by threefold, particularly affecting young adults 15-29 years. We recommend to increase awareness among clinicians to ensure time diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in cN0 neck management of parotid cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goals was to evaluate how sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) benefit neck management in patients with parotid cancer. Patients diagnosed with cNO parotid cancer by preoperative fine needle puncture were prospectively enrolled. The neck status was evaluated by SLNB. If node metastasis was proved by SLNB, a neck dissection of level I-V a was performed, or a wait-and-see policy was conducted for the patient. All related information was extracted and analyzed. Positive SLNB result occurred in 33 (16.7%) patients, and level II metastasis was noted in 100% of the patients. Isolated level III metastasis was noted in 3 (9.1%) patients. During our follow-up with mean time of 49.5 months, 20 patients developed regional recurrence, in which 6 patients had neck dissection as part of their initial management. All the recurrent neck disease was successfully salvaged. Therefore, SLNB was a reliable procedure for neck management in parotid cancer.

TI  - Evaluation of the influenza-like illness surveillance system in Tunisia, 2012-2015
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study was initiated to evaluate, for the first time, the performance and quality of the influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Tunisia.MethodsThe evaluation covered the period of 2012-2015 and used different data sources to measure indicators related to data quality and completeness, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, acceptability, flexibility, stability and utility.ResultsDuring the evaluation period, 485.221 ILI cases were reported among 6.386.621 outpatients at 268 ILI sentinel sites. To conserve resources, cases were only enrolled and tested for influenza during times when the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeded 7% (10% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients for the week. When this benchmark was met, five to 10 patients were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week. In total, The National Influenza Center (NIC) received 2476 samples, of which 683 (27.6%) were positive for influenza. The greatest strength of the system was its representativeness and flexibility. The timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the surveillance system performed moderately well; however, the utility of the data and the stability and simplicity of the surveillance system need improvement. Overall, the performance of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system was evaluated as performing moderately well for situational awareness in the country and for collecting representative influenza virologic samples.ConclusionsThe influenza surveillance system in Tunisia provided pertinent evidence for public health interventions related to influenza situational awareness. To better monitor influenza, we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well and the quality of data collected should be closely monitored and improved.

TI  - PET-CT scan in the preoperative workup of early stage intermediate- and high-risk endometrial cancer
T2  - MINIMALLY INVASIVE THERAPY & ALLIED TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) for the preoperative management of early-stage intermediate- and high-risk endometrial cancer (EC). Study design: Data of patients with intermediate- and high-risk early-stage EC were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. Patients with preoperative PET-CT followed by surgical staging including pelvic lymphadenectomy were analyzed. Diagnostic performance for lymph node (LN) metastasis was evaluated. Results: Overall, 45 patients were included: 27 (60%) and 18 (40%) with intermediate- and high-risk EC, respectively. Four patients (8.8%) had LN metastasis, three correctly identified at PET-CT, yielding a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI 21.9-98.7). Among 41 patients (91.2%) without LN metastasis, 38 had negative PET-CT with specificity of 92.7% (95% CI 78.9-98.1). The negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.4% (95% CI 84.9-99.9) and the positive predictive value was 50% (95% CI 13.9-86.1). Conclusions: The utility of PET-CT is limited by the low sensitivity for LN metastasis in intermediate- and high-risk early-stage EC, that may impede to consider PET-CT alone an adequate alternative to surgical retroperitoneal staging by lymphadenectomy or sentinel LN biopsy. However, the high diagnostic accuracy, specificity and NPV might support its adoption to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the sentinel LN algorithm.

TI  - National geohazards mapping in Europe: Interferometric analysis of the Netherlands
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of Copernicus, the largest Earth Observation program to date, is significant due to the regular, reliable and freely accessible data to support space-based geodetic monitoring of physical phenomena that can result in natural hazards. In this study, wide area interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) capability is demonstrated by processing 435 Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images (May 2015 May 2017) using the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) method to produce a wide-area-map (WAM) covering 53,000 km(2) of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The ISBAS-WAM contains over 19 million measurements, achieving a ground coverage of 94%. The retrieval of measurements over soft surfaces (i.e. agricultural fields, forests and wetlands) was crucial due the dominance of non-urban land cover. A statistical analysis of the velocities reveals that intermittently coherent measurements in rural areas can provide reliable, additional deformation information with a very high degree of confidence (5 sigma), which spatially correlates to known deformation features associated with compressible soils, infrastructure settlement, peat oxidation, gas production, salt mining and underground and opencast mining. The spatial distribution of deformations concurs with independent data sources, such as previous persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) deformation maps, models of subsidence and settlement susceptibility, and quantitatively with GPS measurements over the Groningen gas field.Remotely derived deformation products, with near complete spatial coverage, provide a powerful screening tool for mitigation and remediation of geological and geotechnical issues to help in the protection of assets, property and life. The ISBAS-WAM demonstrates that routine generation of such products on a continental scale is now theoretically achievable, given the establishment of the Copernicus programme and the development of state-of-the-art InSAR methods, such as ISBAS.

TI  - Cloud responses to climate variability over the extratropical oceans as observed by MISR and MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear temporal trends in cloud fraction over the extratropical oceans, observed by NASA's Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) during the period from 2000 to 2013, are examined in the context of coincident European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data using a maximum covariance analysis. Changes in specific cloud types defined with respect to cloud-top height and cloud optical depth are related to trends in reanalysis variables. A pattern of reduced high-altitude optically thick cloud and increased low-altitude cloud of moderate optical depth is found to be associated with increased temperatures, geopotential heights, and anti-cyclonic flow over the extratropical oceans. These and other trends in cloud occurrence are shown to be correlated with changes in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the North Pacific index (NPI), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).

T2  - IMAGING SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research work, a 40-km(2) SPOT-5 High-Resolution Imagery (HRI) of the Warsak locality in district Peshawar, Pakistan, was utilized to approximate the quantity of cultivated land lost to urbanization, due to the construction of new homes and buildings. The imagery from a period of 2005 to 2015 for wheat crop was taken, specifically during the months of March and June when the crop is rich green and golden ripe respectively. eCognition (R) program's Object-Oriented Classification Method (OOCM) was employed for recognition of land versus buildings. Nearest Neighbour (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF) were utilized for the classification process. The results demonstrated that the urbanized area had increased by approximately 28 per cent in the area considered. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed method is depicted by an accuracy of 97.9 per cent and a Kappa Statistics of 0.975 for the SVM classifier.

TI  - 2005-2017 ozone trends and potential benefits of local measures as deduced from air quality measurements in the north of the Barcelona metropolitan area
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed 2005-2017 data sets on ozone (O-3) concentrations in an area (the Vic Plain) frequently affected by the atmospheric plume northward transport of the Barcelona metropolitan area (BMA), the atmospheric basin of Spain recording the highest number of exceedances of the hourly O-3 information threshold (180 mu g m(-3)). We aimed at evaluating the potential benefits of implementing local-BMA short-term measures to abate emissions of precursors. To this end, we analyzed in detail spatial and time variations of concentration of O-3 and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2, including OMI remote sensing data for the latter). Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis is done with the air quality (AQ) data to evaluate potential O-3 reductions in the north of the BMA on Sundays compared with weekdays as a consequence of the reduction in regional emissions of precursors.The results showed a generalized decreasing trend for regional background O-3 as well as the well-known increase in urban O-3 and higher urban NO decreasing slopes compared with those of NO2. The most intensive O-3 episodes in the Vic Plain are caused by (i) a relatively high regional background O-3 (due to a mix of continental, hemispheric-tropospheric and stratospheric contributions); by (ii) intensive surface fumigation from mid-troposphere high O-3 upper layers arising from the concatenation of the vertical recirculation of air masses; but also by (iii) an important O-3 contribution from the northward transport/channeling of the pollution plume from the BMA. The high relevance of the local-daily O-3 contribution during the most intense pollution episodes is clearly supported by the O-3 (surface concentration) and NO2 (OMI data) data analysis.A maximum decrease potential (by applying short-term measures to abate emissions of O-3 precursors) of 49 mu g O-3 M-3 (32 %) of the average diurnal concentrations was determined. Structurally implemented measures, instead of episodically, could result in important additional O-3 decreases because not only the local O-3 coming from the BMA plume would be reduced, but also the recirculated O-3 and thus the intensity of O-3 fumigation in the plain. Therefore, it is highly probable that both structural and episodic measures to abate NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the BMA would result in evident reductions of O-3 in the Vic Plain.

TI  - Stereo rectification of pushbroom satellite images by robustly estimating the fundamental matrix
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stereo rectification is one of the most important steps for stereo matching and subsequently for digital surface model generation from satellite stereo images. This study proposes a new framework to rectify two pushbroom images along the epipolar geometry in order to omit the vertical parallax between two images. Here, we assume the interior and relative parameters between the two pushbroom images are not known and the images can be taken at different dates. Traditional stereo rectification methods of pushbroom images require metadata such as rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs), parameters of physical sensor model or ground control points (GCPs). In this study, we develop an image-based framework for stereo rectification, which works without the need for such data. In the proposed framework, the correspondences are densely extracted by a tilling strategy, and then the fundamental matrix is robustly estimated by two geometric constraints. Both affine and projective fundamental matrices could be used for stereo rectification from pushbroom stereo images. The results on IRS P5, World view III, GeoEye and IKONOS stereo pairs as well as on multi-date stereo images demonstrate that the pushbroom images are rectified with sub-pixel accuracy.

TI  - Modelling CO<sub>2</sub> weather - why horizontal resolution matters
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change mitigation efforts require information on the current greenhouse gas atmospheric concentrations and their sources and sinks Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Its variability in the atmosphere is modulated by the synergy between weather and CO2 surface fluxes, often referred to as CO2 weather. It is interpreted with the help of global or regional numerical transport models, with horizontal resolutions ranging from a few hundreds of kilometres to a few kilometres. Changes in the model horizontal resolution affect not only atmospheric transport but also the representation of topography and surface CO2 fluxes. This paper assesses the impact of horizontal resolution on the simulated atmospheric CO2 variability with a numerical weather prediction model. The simulations are performed using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) CO2 forecasting system at different resolutions from 9 to 80 km and are evaluated using in situ atmospheric surface measurements and atmospheric column-mean observations of CO2, as well as radiosonde and SYNOP observations of the winds.The results indicate that both diurnal and day-to-day variability of atmospheric CO2 are generally better represented at high resolution, as shown by a reduction in the errors in simulated wind and CO2. Mountain stations display the largest improvements at high resolution as they directly benefit from the more realistic orography. In addition, the CO2 spatial gradients are generally improved with increasing resolution for both stations near the surface and those observing the total column, as the overall inter-station error is also reduced in magnitude. However, close to emission hotspots, the high resolution can also lead to a deterioration of the simulation skill, highlighting uncertainties in the high-resolution fluxes that are more diffuse at lower resolutions.We conclude that increasing horizontal resolution matters for modelling CO2 weather because it has the potential to bring together improvements in the surface representation of both winds and CO2 fluxes, as well as an expected reduction in numerical errors of transport. Modelling applications like atmospheric inversion systems to estimate surface fluxes will only be able to benefit fully from upgrades in horizontal resolution if the topography, winds and prior flux distribution are also upgraded accordingly. It is clear from the results that an additional increase in resolution might reduce errors even further. However, the horizontal resolution sensitivity tests indicate that the change in the CO2 and wind modelling error with resolution is not linear, making it difficult to quantify the improvement beyond the tested resolutions.Finally, we show that the high-resolution simulations are useful for the assessment of the small-scale variability of CO2 which cannot be represented in coarser-resolution models. These representativeness errors need to be considered when assimilating in situ data and high-resolution satellite data such as Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), the Chinese Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite Mission (TanSat) and future missions such as the Geostationary Carbon Observatory (GeoCarb) and the Sentinel satellite constellation for CO2. For these reasons, the high-resolution CO(2 )simulations provided by the CAMS in real time can be useful to estimate such small-scale variability in real time, as well as providing boundary conditions for regional modelling studies and supporting field experiments.

TI  - Limitations Posed by Free DEMs in Watershed Studies: The Case of River Tanaro in Italy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography is a critical element in the hydrological response of a drainage basin and its availability in the form of digital elevation models (DEMs) has advanced the modeling of hydrological and hydraulic processes. However, progress experienced in these fields may stall, as intrinsic characteristics of free DEMs may limit new findings, while at the same time new releases of free, high-accuracy, global digital terrain models are still uncertain. In this paper, the limiting nature of free DEMs is dissected in the context of hydrogeomorphology. Ten sets of terrain data are analyzed: the SRTM GL1 and GL3, HydroSHEDS, TINITALY, ASTER GDEM, EU DEM, VFP, ALOS AW3D30, MERIT and the TDX. In specific, the influence of three parameters are investigated, i.e., spatial resolution, hydrological reconditioning and vertical accuracy, on four relevant geomorphic terrain descriptors, namely the upslope contributing area, the local slope, the elevation difference and the flow path distance to the nearest stream, H and D, respectively. The Tanaro river basin in Italy is chosen as the study region and the newly released LiDAR for the Italian territory is used as benchmark to reassess vertical accuracies. In addition, the EU-Hydro photo-interpreted river network is used to compare DEM-based river networks. Most DEMs approximate well the frequency curve of elevations of the LiDAR, but this is not necessarily reflected in the representation of geomorphic features. For example, DEMs with finer spatial resolution present larger contributing areas; differences in the slope can reach 10%; between 5 m and 12 m H, none of the considered DEMs can faithfully represent the LiDAR; D presents significant variability between DEMs; and river network extraction can be problematic in flatter terrain. It is also found that the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) is given by the MERIT, 2.85 m, while the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) is given by the SRTM GL3, 4.83 m. Practical implications of choosing a DEM over another may be expected, as the limitations of any particular DEM in faithfully reproducing critical geomorphic terrain features may hinder our ability to find satisfactory answers to some pressing problems.

TI  - Strong Temperature Dependence for Light-Duty Diesel Vehicle NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> Emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diesel-powered road vehicles are important sources for nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and the European passenger fleet is highly dieselised, which has resulted in many European roadside environments being noncompliant with legal air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). On the basis of vehicle emission remote sensing data for 300000 light-duty vehicles across the United Kingdom, light-duty diesel NOx emissions were found to be highly dependent on ambient temperature with low temperatures resulting in higher NOx emissions, i.e., a "low temperature NOx emission penalty" was identified. This feature was not observed for gasoline-powered vehicles. Older Euro 3 to 5 diesel vehicles emitted NOx similarly, but vehicles compliant with the latest Euro 6 emission standard emitted less NOx than older vehicles and demonstrated less of an ambient temperature dependence. This ambient temperature dependence is overlooked in current emission inventories but is of importance from an air quality perspective. Owing to Europe's climate, a predicted average of 38% more NOx emissions have burdened Europe when compared to temperatures encountered in laboratory test cycles. However, owing to the progressive elimination of vehicles demonstrating the most severe low temperature NOx penalty, light-duty diesel NOx emissions are likely to decrease more rapidly throughout Europe than currently thought.

TI  - Zn Isotope Fractionation in the Oyster <i>Crassostrea hongkongensis</i> and Implications for Contaminant Source Tracking
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in stable isotope ratios have been used to trace sources of contaminants as well as their biogeochemical pathways in the environment. In this study, we investigated the influences of internal redistribution among tissues and ambient water conditions on Zn isotope fractionation in oysters. There was no significant difference in Zn isotope ratios during in vivo Zn transportation among various oyster tissues. Estuarine oysters were exposed to additional Zn either at different salinities or at different Zn concentrations, following which the Zn isotope ratios in the oysters were measured. Results showed no significant difference in delta(66)/Zn-64 values in the oysters exposed at different salinities. Tissue Zn accumulation increased with increasing Zn levels in water over the 30 day exposure. Within this period, there was a nearly 0.3 parts per thousand difference in averaged delta(66)/Zn-64 values in the exposed oysters compared to the initial delta(66)/Zn-64 values in the oysters prior to exposure. However, there was no evidence of significant difference in delta(66)/Zn-64 values in oysters exposed at different Zn levels, with postexposure signatures similar to the delta(66)/Zn-64 values of the Zn solution added. Our results suggested that the delta(66)/Zn-64 values measured in the oysters were approaching the delta(66)/Zn-64 values of the "source" faster with increasing Zn concentrations added in the water. This study highlighted the absence of Zn isotope fractionation during Zn internal distribution and in vivo transport in oysters. The calculation of the contributions of different Zn sources demonstrated that oysters can be a sentinel animal for Zn source tracking in marine environments.

TI  - Status of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) of The Gambia
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundVector control activities, namely long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), have contributed significantly to the decreasing malaria burden observed in The Gambia since 2008. Nevertheless, insecticide resistance may threaten such success; it is important to regularly assess the susceptibility of local malaria vectors to available insecticides.MethodsIn the transmission seasons of 2016 and 2017, Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) larvae were sampled in or around the nine vector surveillance sentinel sites of the Gambia National Malaria Control Programme (GNMCP) and in a few additional sampling points. Using WHO susceptibility bioassays, female adult mosquitoes were exposed to insecticide-impregnated papers. Molecular identification of sibling species and insecticide resistance molecular markers was done on a subset of 2000 female mosquitoes.ResultsA total of 4666 wild-caught female adult mosquitoes were exposed to either permethrin (n=665), deltamethrin (n=744), DDT (n=1021), bendiocarb (n=990) or pirimiphos-methyl (n=630) insecticide-impregnated papers and control papers (n=616). Among the 2000 anophelines, 1511 (80.7%) were Anopheles arabiensis, 204 (10.9%) Anopheles coluzzii, 75 (4%) Anopheles gambiae (s.s.), and 83 (4.4%) An. gambiae (s.s.) and An. coluzzii hybrids. There was a significant variation in the composition and species distribution by regions and year, P=0.009. Deltamethrin, permethrin and DDT resistance was found in An. arabiensis, especially in the coastal region, and was mediated by Vgsc-1014F/S mutations (odds ratio=34, P=0.014). There was suspected resistance to pirimiphos-methyl (actellic 300CS) in the North Bank Region although only one survivor had the Ace-1-119S mutation.ConclusionsAs no confirmed resistance to bendiocarb and actellic 300CS was detected, the national malaria control programme can continue using these insecticides for IRS. Nevertheless, the detection of Ace-1 119S mutation warrants extensive monitoring. The source of insecticide pressure driving insecticide resistance to pyrethroids and DDT detected at the coastal region should be further investigated in order to properly manage the spread of resistance in The Gambia.

TI  - Estimation of turbulent heat flux over leads using satellite thermal images
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice leads are an important feature in pack ice in the Arctic. Even covered by thin ice, leads can still serve as prime windows for heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially in the winter. Lead geometry and distribution in the Arctic have been studied using optical and microwave remote sensing data, but turbulent heat flux over leads has only been measured on-site during a few special expeditions. In this study, we derive turbulent heat flux through leads at different scales using a combination of surface temperature and lead distribution from remote sensing images and meteorological parameters from a reanalysis dataset. First, ice surface temperature (IST) was calculated from Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal images using a split-window algorithm; then, lead pixels were segmented from colder ice. Heat flux over leads was estimated using two empirical models: bulk aerodynamic formulae and a fetch-limited model with lead width from Landsat-8. Results show that even though the lead area from MODIS is a little larger, the length of leads is underestimated by 72.9 % in MODIS data compared to TIRS data due to the inability to resolve small leads. Heat flux estimated from Landsat-8 TIRS data using bulk formulae is 56.70 % larger than that from MODIS data. When the fetch-limited model was applied, turbulent heat flux calculated from TIRS data is 32.34 % higher than that from bulk formulae. In both cases, small leads accounted for more than a quarter of total heat flux over leads, mainly due to the large area, though the heat flux estimated using the fetch-limited model is 41.39 % larger. A greater contribution from small leads can be expected with larger air-ocean temperature differences and stronger winds.

TI  - Local pesticide use intensity conditions landscape effects on biological pest control
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex landscapes including semi-natural habitats are expected to favour natural enemies thereby enhancing natural pest biocontrol in crops. However, when considering a large number of situations, the response of natural biocontrol to landscape properties is globally inconsistent, a possible explanation being that local agricultural practices counteract landscape effects. In this study, along a crossed gradient of pesticide use intensity and landscape simplification, we analysed the interactive effects of landscape characteristics and local pesticide use intensity on natural biocontrol. During 3 years, using a set of sentinel prey (weed seeds, aphids and Lepidoptera eggs), biocontrol was estimated in 80 commercial fields located in four contrasted regions in France. For all types of prey excepted weed seeds, the predation rate was influenced by interactions between landscape characteristics and local pesticide use intensity. Proportion of meadow and length of interface between woods and crops had a positive effect on biocontrol of aphids where local pesticide use intensity was low but had a negative effect elsewhere. Moreover, the landscape proportion of suitable habitats for crop pests decreased the predation of sentinel prey, irrespectively of the local pesticide use intensity for weed seeds, but only in fields with low pesticide use for Lepidoptera eggs. These results Show that high local pesticide use can counteract the positive expected effects of semi-natural habitats, but also that the necessary pesticide use reduction Should be associated with semi-natural habitat enhancement to guarantee an effective natural biocontrol.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Neonates exposed to perinatal insults typically present with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The aim of our study was to analyze the association between known risk factors for HIE and the severity of encephalopathy after birth and neurological outcome in neonates during the first 4 d of life. Methods: Retrospective cohort study including 174 neonates registered between 2011 and 2013 in the National Asphyxia and Cooling Register of Switzerland. Results: None of the studied perinatal risk factors is associated with the severity of encephalopathy after birth. Fetal distress during labor (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.02-4.25, p = .049) and neonatal head circumference (HC) above 10th percentile (p10) at birth (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.69, p = .02) were associated with neurological benefit in the univariate analysis. Fetal distress on maternal admission for delivery was the only risk factor for neurological harm in the univariate (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.57, p < .01) and the multivariate analysis (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.67, p = .013). We identified two different patient scenarios: the probability for neurological benefit during the first 4 d of life was only 20% in neonates with the combination of all the following risk factors (gestational age >41 weeks, chorioamnionitis, fetal distress on maternal admission for delivery, fetal distress during labor, sentinel events during labor, HC below 10th percentile), whereas in the absence of these risk factors the probability for neurological benefit increased to 80%. Conclusions: We identified a constellation of risk factors that influence neurological outcome in neonates with HIE during the first 4 d of life. These findings may help clinicians to counsel parents during the early neonatal period. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02800018).

TI  - Year-round tracking reveals multiple migratory tactics in a sentinel North Pacific seabird, Cassin's auklet
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonbreeding distributions and migratory phenology can vary within and among populations of many taxa, including seabirds. Such differences can drive variation in survival and reproduction. Knowledge of where, when, and why individuals move is therefore crucial to understanding and predicting population-level processes, particularly in the context of oceanographic change. Here we present the first year-round tracking data for Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, a small, zooplanktivorous North Pacific seabird, revealing the nonbreeding behavior of birds from colonies in British Columbia, Canada, across 3 years of variable oceanographic conditions. These birds moved both north (summer, fall) and south (fall, winter) from the colony, using 1 of 4 migratory tactics: North, South, North-South, or Local. Distributions ranged from the Aleutian Islands to Baja California, to maximum distances of 2757 and 3110 km, respectively. Within tactics there was additional spatiotemporal variation among individuals, resulting in diverse nonbreeding experiences. Some variability was explained by year and sex. Cassin's auklets appear to target distinct, ecologically differentiated areas within their nonbreeding range which may have good quality habitat. Variation in these target regions across years suggests somewhat flexible migratory behavior; however, consistent migration to the Southern California Bight despite very low productivity in one study year suggests that fixed tactics may exist. This work contributes to our understanding of predator movement in the North Pacific and highlights the importance of individual-level spatial data for studies of carryover effects and conservation planning.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 112nd Annual Conference and Exhibition of the Air-and-Waste-Management-Association (A&WMA)
CL  - Quebec City, CANADA
AB  - The potential environmental impact of air pollutants emitted from the oil sands industry in Alberta, Canada, has received considerable attention. The mining and processing of bitumen to produce synthetic crude oil, and the waste products associated with this activity, lead to significant emissions of gaseous and particle air pollutants. Deposition of pollutants occurs locally (i.e., near the sources) and also potentially at distances downwind, depending upon each pollutant's chemical and physical properties and meteorological conditions. The Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSM) was initiated in 2012 by the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta to enhance or improve monitoring of pollutants and their potential impacts. In support of JOSM, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) undertook a significant research effort via three components: the Air, Water, and Wildlife components, which were implemented to better estimate baseline conditions related to levels of pollutants in the air and water, amounts of deposition, and exposures experienced by the biota. The criteria air contaminants (e.g., nitrogen oxides [NOx], sulfur dioxide [SO2], volatile organic compounds [VOCs], particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 m [PM2.5]) and their secondary atmospheric products were of interest, as well as toxic compounds, particularly polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), trace metals, and mercury (Hg). This critical review discusses the challenges of assessing ecosystem impacts and summarizes the major results of these efforts through approximately 2018. Focus is on the emissions to the air and the findings from the Air Component of the ECCC research and linkages to observations of contaminant levels in the surface waters in the region, in aquatic species, as well as in terrestrial and avian species. The existing evidence of impact on these species is briefly discussed, as is the potential for some of them to serve as sentinel species for the ongoing monitoring needed to better understand potential effects, their potential causes, and to detect future changes. Quantification of the atmospheric emissions of multiple pollutants needs to be improved, as does an understanding of the processes influencing fugitive emissions and local and regional deposition patterns. The influence of multiple stressors on biota exposure and response, from natural bitumen and forest fires to climate change, complicates the current ability to attribute effects to air emissions from the industry. However, there is growing evidence of the impact of current levels of PACs on some species, pointing to the need to improve the ability to predict PAC exposures and the key emission source involved. Although this critical review attempts to integrate some of the findings across the components, in terms of ECCC activities, increased coordination or integration of air, water, and wildlife research would enhance deeper scientific understanding. Improved understanding is needed in order to guide the development of long-term monitoring strategies that could most efficiently inform a future adaptive management approach to oil sands environmental monitoring and prevention of impacts.Implications: Quantification of atmospheric emissions for multiple pollutants needs to be improved, and reporting mechanisms and standards could be adapted to facilitate such improvements, including periodic validation, particularly where uncertainties are the largest.Understanding of baseline conditions in the air, water and biota has improved significantly; ongoing enhanced monitoring, building on this progress, will help improve ecosystem protection measures in the oil sands region. Sentinel species have been identified that could be used to identify and characterize potential impacts of wildlife exposure, both locally and regionally. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are identified as having an impact on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife at current concentration levels although the significance of these impacts and attribution to emissions from oil sands development requires further assessment. Given the improvement in high resolution air quality prediction models, these should be a valuable tool to future environmental assessments and cumulative environment impact assessments.

TI  - Multi-scale approach to estimating aboveground biomass in the Brazilian Amazon using Landsat and LiDAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation from either natural or anthropogenic drivers involves processes that change the capacity of the ecosystem to provide services. In Brazil, estimates of carbon emissions do not currently take into account emissions from forest degradation caused by fire or by selective logging. Here, we present a methodology to estimate aboveground biomass in forest degradedareas, that can be accounted to estimate carbon emissions. We explored a multi-scale and temporal approach involving Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and orbital images from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor to estimate the aboveground biomass. Cross-validation results showed that 49% of the variation in biomass could be explained using this approach, with an estimation error 58 Mg ha(-1) (49.08%). Due to the difficulty in measuring biomass in tropical forests, the proposed methodology can be an alternative in future works to estimate aboveground biomass in order to improve the estimates of carbon emissions by the governmental organizations.

TI  - Homogeneity criteria from AVHRR information within IASI pixels in a numerical weather prediction context
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the selection of satellite infrared IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) observations in the global numerical weather prediction (NWP) system ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle). The observation simulation is performed with the sophisticated radiative transfer model RTTOV-CLD, which takes into account the cloud scattering and the multilayer clouds from atmospheric profiles and cloud microphysical profiles (liquid water content, ice content and cloud fraction).The aim of this work is to select homogeneous scenes by using the information of the collocated Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) pixels inside each IASI field of view and to retain the most favourable cases for the assimilation of IASI infrared radiances. Two methods to select homogeneous scenes using homogeneity criteria already proposed in the literature were adapted: the criteria derived from Martinet et al. (2013) for cloudy sky selection in the French mesoscale model AROME (Applications of Research to Operations at MEsoscale) and the criteria from Eresmaa (2014) for clear-sky selection in the global model IFS (Integrated Forecasting System). A comparison between these methods reveals considerable differences, in both the method to compute the criteria and the statistical results. From this comparison a revised method representing a kind of compromise between the different tested methods is proposed and it uses the two infrared AVHRR channels to define the homogeneity criteria in the brightness temperature space. This revised method has a positive impact on the observation minus the simulation statistics, while retaining 36% of observations for the assimilation. It was then tested in the NWP system ARPEGE for the clear-sky assimilation. These criteria were added to the current data selection based on the Mc-Nally and Watts (2003) cloud detection scheme. It appears that the impact on analyses and forecasts is rather neutral.

TI  - Detection and interpretation of local surface deformation from the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake using ALOS-2 SAR data
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We identified and analyzed surface displacements associated with the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake in northern Japan using satellite radar interferograms from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2. The data generally show elastic deformation caused by the main earthquake as well as numerous complex surface displacements that cannot be explained by the motion of the seismic source fault. We identified three distinct phenomena: linear surface displacements representing secondary earthquake faults west of the epicenter, surface deformation caused by liquefaction in urban and coastal areas, and coherence changes in the interferograms due to landslides in mountainous areas and liquefaction in urban areas. The linear surface displacements show reverse fault motion with low dip angles and appear to be a geographic extension of known active faults; however, it is unlikely that these displacements were directly connected to the source fault of the main earthquake. Although there is no evidence that they generated strong seismic waves at the time of the main earthquake, there is a possibility that they represent active fault traces and could be the sources of large earthquakes in the future. Therefore, such linear surface displacements can be used to identify potentially dangerous hidden active faults. The interferograms reveal that liquefaction in urban areas occurred in low areas artificially filled during past residential development. Coherence-change maps drawn from the interferograms were useful for detecting liquefaction, but their high sensitivity limited their application for landslide detection in mountainous areas; the phase noise deviation method was more practical for purposes such as rapid response or mitigation. Our methods have the potential to allow improved mapping of local hazards in other areas and can be applied to urban planning and/or safety assessments.

TI  - Long-term change of surface temperature in water bodies around Iran - Caspian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf - using 2001-2015 MODIS data
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - To answer the question "what has changed the surface temperatures of water bodies around Iran under climate change conditions," Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea surface temperature (SST) data with 9.2-km spatial resolution and monthly time step were evaluated. A significant increasing trend was obtained using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Mann-Kendall trend test on data from the Caspian Sea (June) and the Southern Gulfs (September). High correlations of 0.69 and 0.97 between remotely sensed data and ERA-Interim reanalysis data were also obtained for June and September, respectively. To assess the impact of some climatic parameters on SST variability in those two months, zonal and meridional wind at 10 m, wind speed at 10 m, air temperature at 2 m, and mean sea level pressure were evaluated. High correlations between meridional wind and the Southern Gulf SST, and meridional wind and Caspian SST were -0.86 and 0.75, respectively. Moreover, the results showed an important role of air temperature (0.96) and sea level pressure (-0.77) in the rising temperature trends of the Southern Gulfs. Wind speed was also detected in both regions as a booster of the trend.

TI  - Learning to match multitemporal optical satellite images using multi-support-patches Siamese networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, multi-support-patches Siamese networks are proposed to match multitemporal optical satellite images under land cover changes. To adequately use spatial and spectral information, a multi-support-patches extraction block is exploited to extract multispectral central-surround regions (including visible and near-infrared bands) as inputs, and a multi-support-patches convolutional layer block (including two weight-sharing channels) is used to extract deep features. Then, the learned deep features are concatenated and output with Sigmoid probabilistic labeling predictions for similarity measure. Furthermore, matching and non-matching probabilistic maps are used to determine matches by integrating an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. The proposed method is compared with four other algorithms by using three multitemporal satellite image datasets (i.e., Landsat-5/8, ZY-3, and GF-1) in terms of significant land cover changes. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method, particularly in the number of correct matches, is 10 times improved over manually designed methods.

TI  - An interesting case of persistent rain cells observed by RISAT-1 SAR over the Indian Ocean during a pair of depression-cyclone interactions (August, 2012)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that rain cells leave footprints on the sea surface that sometimes become visible on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. However, it is rare to be able to track the same raincell on subsequent optical satellite images, owing to the dynamical nature of the precipitation. In August 21-26, 2012, there were long distance multiple interactions between two, category-4 typhoons: Tembin and Bolawen, and two Tropical Depressions (TD) in Pacific Ocean. The rapid uplift of air masses due to these interactions coupled with the establishment of Asian Monsoon anticyclone led to the formation of small scale raincells in Indian Ocean as observed by RISAT-1 SAR. The raincells with spatial dimension of the order of similar to 3 km associated with precipitation (> 13 mm hour(-1)) and the significant wind speed changes of (similar to 5 m s(-1)) are seen to propagate towards Eastward direction. Later (after 5 hours), they are observed in MODIS Cloud Microphysical product. The novelty of the study lies in its approach to use an opportunistic synergy of independent sensors observing in different spatio-temporal and spectral domain to understand complex atmospheric interactions resulting in a peculiar phenomenon, which otherwise cannot be detected or resolved using single source information.

TI  - Uncertainty evaluation at three spatial scales for the NDVI-based VWC estimation method used in the SMAP algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation water content (VWC) is the key input parameter for a soil moisture retrieval algorithm based on microwave remote sensing, and VWC uncertainty can limit the estimated accuracy of soil moisture. There has been little research on VWC algorithm development and validation in China, and the uncertainty of the VWC estimation method has not been well evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the uncertainty of the VWC estimation method used in the SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) algorithm on three spatial scales (the point-scale, 30 m scale, and 1 km scale) for maize in northeast China. Results from three ground experimental datasets showed that the SMAP VWC estimation method was strongly biased with an average overestimation of 1.16 kg m(-2),1.04 kg m(-2), and 1.13 kg m(-2) for the point-scale, 30 m scale, and 1 km scale respectively, and maximum bias occurred in the mid-stage of maize. Also, a new power relationship between NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and VWC was proposed for the 30 m scale based on Sentinel 2 NDVI and field VWC values from 2017 experiment, with respective R-2 (coefficient of determination) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of 0.80 and 0.67 kg m(-2). The results confirmed that this power relationship was still suitable for VWC estimation at the 1 km scale, and it has smaller bias than the original SMAP VWC method. Future work will be carried out to evaluate the applicability of this VWC estimation method over a lager region. It is expected that it can improve the accuracy of soil moisture by providing high precision VWC input parameters.

TI  - Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Surface Water Extraction in a Landsat 8 Scene of Nepal
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With over 6000 rivers and 5358 lakes, surface water is one of the most important resources in Nepal. However, the quantity and quality of Nepal's rivers and lakes are decreasing due to human activities and climate change. Despite the advancement of remote sensing technology and the availability of open access data and tools, the monitoring and surface water extraction works has not been carried out in Nepal. Single or multiple water index methods have been applied in the extraction of surface water with satisfactory results. Extending our previous study, the authors evaluated six different machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes (NB), recursive partitioning and regression trees (RPART), neural networks (NNET), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosted machines (GBM) to extract surface water in Nepal. With three secondary bands, slope, NDVI and NDWI, the algorithms were evaluated for performance with the addition of extra information. As a result, all the applied machine learning algorithms, except NB and RPART, showed good performance. RF showed overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 1 for the all the multiband data with the reference dataset, followed by GBM, NNET, and SVM in metrics. The performances were better in the hilly regions and flat lands, but not well in the Himalayas with ice, snow and shadows, and the addition of slope and NDWI showed improvement in the results. Adding single secondary bands is better than adding multiple in most algorithms except NNET. From current and previous studies, it is recommended to separate any study area with and without snow or low and high elevation, then apply machine learning algorithms in original Landsat data or with the addition of slopes or NDWI for better performance.

TI  - Enhancement of Archaeological Proxies at Non-Homogenous Environments in Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing has been widely used for the identification of archaeological proxies. Such proxies, known as crop or soil marks, can be detected in multispectral images due to their spectral signatures and the distinct contrast that they provide in relation to the surrounding area. The current availability of high-resolution satellite datasets has enabled researchers to provide new methodologies and algorithms that can further enhance archaeological proxies supporting thus image-interpretation. However, a critical point that remains unsolved is the detection of crop and soil marks in non-homogenous environments. In these areas, interpretation is problematic even after the application of sophisticated image enhancement analysis techniques due to the mixed landscape and spectral confusion produced from the high-resolution datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose an image-based methodology in which the vegetation is suppressed following the forced invariance method and then we apply a linear orthogonal transformation to the suppressed spectral bands. The new Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image corresponds to a new three-band spectral space where the three axes are linked with the crop mark, vegetation, and soil components. The study evaluates the proposed approach in the archaeological site of Nea Paphos in Cyprus using a WorldView-2 multispectral image aiming to overcome the limitations of the mixed environments.

TI  - Relating X-band SAR Backscattering to Leaf Area Index of Rice in Different Phenological Phases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to provide complete information on the dynamic relationship between X-band (3.11 cm) backscattering intensity (sigma degrees) and rice crop's leaf area index (LAI) at all growth phases. Though the relationship between X-band sigma degrees and LAI has been previously explored, details on the relationship at the reproductive phase remain unstudied. LAI at the reproductive phase is important particularly at the heading stage where LAI reaches its maximum as it is closely related to grain yield, and at flowering stage where the total leaf area affects the amount of photosynthates. Therefore, this study examined the relationship of increasing LAI (vegetative to reproductive phase) and decreasing LAI (ripening phase) with TerraSAR-X (TSX) ScanSAR (3.11 cm) sigma degrees at HH polarisation and 45 degrees incidence angle. The results showed a statistically significant (R-2 = 0.51, p value < 0.001) non-linear relationship of LAI with sigma degrees at the vegetative to reproductive phase while no significant linear relationship was found at the ripening phase. This study completes the response curve of X-band sigma degrees to LAI by filling in the information on the reproductive phase which more accurately characterises the dynamic relationship between the rice crop's LAI and X-band's sigma degrees. This contributes to improved knowledge on the use of X-band data for estimating LAI for the whole crop cycle which is essential for the modelling of crop growth and estimation of yield.

TI  - Heterogeneous Behavior of the Campotosto Normal Fault (Central Italy) Imaged by InSAR GPS and Strong-Motion Data: Insights from the 18 January 2017 Events
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 18 January 2017, the 2016-2017 central Italy seismic sequence reached the Campotosto area with four events with magnitude larger than 5 in three hours (major event M-W 5.5). To study the slip behavior on the causative fault/faults we followed two different methodologies: (1) we use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) interferograms (Sentinel-1 satellites) and Global Positioning System (GPS) coseismic displacements to constrain the fault geometry and the cumulative slip distribution; (2) we invert near-source strong-motion, high-sampling-rate GPS waveforms, and high-rate GPS-derived static offsets to retrieve the rupture history of the two largest events. The geodetic inversion shows that the earthquake sequence occurred along the southern segment of the SW-dipping Mts. Laga normal fault system with an average slip of about 40 cm and an estimated cumulative geodetic moment of 9.29 x 10(17) Nm (equivalent to a M-W similar to 6). This latter estimate is larger than the cumulative seismic moment of all the events, with M-W > 4 which occurred in the corresponding time interval, suggesting that a fraction (similar to 35%) of the overall deformation imaged by InSAR and GPS may have been released aseismically. Geodetic and seismological data agree with the geological information pointing out the Campotosto fault segment as the causative structure of the main shocks. The position of the hypocenters supports the evidence of an up-dip and northwestward rupture directivity during the major shocks of the sequence for both static and kinematic inferred slip models. The activated two main slip patches are characterized by rise time and peak slip velocity in the ranges 0.7-1.1 s and 2.3-3.2 km/s, respectively, and by similar to 35-50 cm of slip mainly concentrated in the shallower northern part of causative fault. Our results show that shallow slip (depth < 5 km) is required by the geodetic and seismological observations and that the inferred slip distribution is complementary with respect to the previous April 2009 seismic sequence affecting the southern half of the Campotosto fault. The recent moderate strain-release episodes (multiple M similar to 5-5.5 earthquakes) and the paleoseismological evidence of surface-rupturing events (M similar to 6.5) suggests therefore a heterogeneous behavior of the Campotosto fault.

TI  - Classification of Tropical Forest Tree Species Using Meter-Scale Image Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate classification of tropical tree species is critical for understanding forest habitat, biodiversity, forest composition, biomass, and the role of trees in climate variability through carbon uptake. The aim of this study is to establish an accurate classification procedure for tropical tree species, specifically testing the feasibility of WorldView-3 (WV-3) multispectral imagery for this task. The specific study site is a defined arboretum within a well-known tropical forest research location in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station). An object-based classification is the basis for the analysis to classify six selected tree species. A combination of pre-processed WV-3 bands were inputs to the classification, and an edge segmentation process defined multi-pixel-scale tree canopies. WorldView-3 bands in the Green, Red, Red Edge, and Near-Infrared 2, particularly when incorporated in two specialized vegetation indices, provide high discrimination among the selected species. Classification results yield an accuracy of 85.37%, with minimal errors of commission (7.89%) and omission (14.63%). Shadowing in the satellite imagery had a significant effect on segmentation accuracy (identifying single-species canopy tops) and on classification. The methodology presented provides a path to better characterization of tropical forest species distribution and overall composition for improving biomass studies in a tropical environment.

TI  - Comparison of Pixel- and Object-Based Classification Methods of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Data Applied to Coastal Dune Vegetation Communities: Casal Borsetti Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dunes provide the hinterland with natural protection from marine dynamics. The specialized plant species that constitute dune vegetation communities are descriptive of the dune evolution status, which in turn reveals the ongoing coastal dynamics. The aims of this paper were to demonstrate the applicability of a low-cost unmanned aerial system for the classification of dune vegetation, in order to determine the level of detail achievable for the identification of vegetation communities and define the best-performing classification method for the dune environment according to pixel-based and object-based approaches. These goals were pursued by studying the north-Adriatic coastal dunes of Casal Borsetti (Ravenna, Italy). Four classification algorithms were applied to three-band orthoimages (red, green, and near-infrared). All classification maps were validated through ground truthing, and comparisons were performed for the three statistical methods, based on the k coefficient and on correctly and incorrectly classified pixel proportions of two maps. All classifications recognized the five vegetation classes considered, and high spatial resolution maps were produced (0.15 m). For both pixel-based and object-based methods, the support vector machine algorithm demonstrated a better accuracy for class recognition. The comparison revealed that an object approach is the better technique, although the required level of detail determines the final decision.

TI  - Landslide-Induced Damage Probability Estimation Coupling InSAR and Field Survey Data by Fragility Curves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are considered to be one of the main natural geohazards causing relevant economic damages and social effects worldwide. Italy is one of the countries worldwide most affected by landslides; in the Region of Tuscany alone, more than 100,000 phenomena are known and mapped. The possibility to recognize, investigate, and monitor these phenomena play a key role to avoid further occurrences and consequences. The number of applications of Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) analysis for landslides monitoring and mapping greatly increased in the last decades thanks to the technological advances and the development of advanced processing algorithms. In this work, landslide-induced damage on structures recognized and classified by field survey and velocity of displacement re-projected along the steepest slope were combined in order to extract fragility curves for the hamlets of Patigno and Coloretta, in the Zeri municipality (Tuscany, northern Italy). Images using ERS1/2, ENVISAT, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) were employed to investigate an approximate 25 years of deformation affecting both hamlets. Three field surveys were conducted for recognizing, identifying, and classifying the landslide-induced damage on structures and infrastructures. At the end, the damage probability maps were designed by means of the use of the fragility curves between Sentinel-1 velocities and recorded levels of damage. The results were conceived to be useful for the local authorities and civil protection authorities to improve the land managing and, more generally, for planning mitigation strategies.

TI  - Improvement and Assessment of the Absolute Positioning Accuracy of Chinese High-Resolution SAR Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, China has launched YaoGan-13 and GaoFen-3, high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites that can acquire global high-resolution images. The absolute positioning accuracy of such satellites is important for mapping areas without ground reference points and for automated processing. However, satellites without geometric calibration have poor absolute positioning accuracy, greatly restricting their application (e.g., land resource surveys). Therefore, they cannot meet national demands for high-resolution SAR images with good geometric accuracy. Here, we propose a series of methods to improve the absolute positioning accuracy of YaoGan-13 and GaoFen-3, such as the multiple-image combined calibration strategy and geometric calibration model for a real continuously moving configuration, including consideration of atmospheric propagation delay. Using high-accuracy ground control data collected from different areas, the 2-D and 3-D absolute positioning accuracies of YaoGan-13 and GaoFen-3 were assessed after implementation of the improvement measures. Experimental results showed that, after calibration, the 2-D absolute positioning accuracy of YaoGan-13 and GaoFen-3 are improved from 43.86 m to 2.57 m and from 30.34 m to 4.29 m, respectively. In addition, the 3-D absolute positioning accuracies of YaoGan-13 in plane and elevation are 3.21 m and 2.22 m, respectively. Improving the absolute positioning accuracy of these satellites could broaden the scope of their potential applications in the future.

TI  - Multiple-Scale Variations of Sea Ice and Ocean Circulation in the Bering Sea Using Remote Sensing Observations and Numerical Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bering Sea is located between the Aleutian Low and Siberian High, with strong seasonal variations in the oceanic circulation and the sea ice coverage. Within such a large-scale system, the physical processes in the Bering Sea carry interannual variability. The special topography in the Bering Sea traps a strong jet along the Bering Slope, whose instability enriches the eddy activity in the region. A Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS), coupled with a sea ice module, is employed to study multiple-scale variability in the sea ice and oceanic circulation in the Bering Sea for interannual, seasonal, and intra-seasonal eddy variations. The model domain covers the whole Bering Sea and a part of the Chukchi Sea and south of Aleutian Islands, with an averaged spatial resolution of 5 km. The external forcings are momentum, heat, and freshwater flux at the surface and adaptive nudging to reanalysis fields at the boundaries. The oceanic model starts in an equilibrium state from a multiple year cyclical climatology run, and then it is integrated from years 1990 through 2004. The 15 year simulation is analyzed and assessed against the observational data. The model accurately reproduces the seasonal and interannual variations in the sea ice coverage compared with the satellite-observed sea ice data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Sea surface temperature and eddy kinetic energy patterns from the ROMS agree with satellite remote sensing data. The transportation through the Bering Strait is also comparable with the estimate of mooring data. The mechanism for seasonal and interannual variation in the Bering Sea is connected to the Siberia-Aleutian index. Eddy variation along the Bering Slope is discussed. The model also simulates polynya generation and evolution around the St. Lawrence Island.

TI  - Crop NDVI Monitoring Based on Sentinel 1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agricultural crops is necessary for decision-making in the field. However, it is known that in some regions and periods, cloud cover makes this activity difficult to carry out in a systematic way throughout the phenological cycle of crops. This circumstance opens up opportunities for techniques involving radar sensors, resulting in images that are free of cloud effects. In this context, the objective of this work was to obtain a normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) cloudless product (NDVInc) by modeling Sentinel 2 NDVI using different regression techniques and the Sentinel 1 radar backscatter as input. To do this, we used four pairs of Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 1 images on coincident days, aiming to achieve the greatest range of NDVI values for agricultural crops (soybean and maize). These coincident pairs were the only ones in which the percentage of clouds was not equal to 100% for 33 central pivot areas in western Bahia, Brazil. The dataset used for NDVInc modeling was divided into two subsets: training and validation. The training and validation datasets were from the period from 24 June 2017 to 19 July 2018 (four pairs of images). The best performing model was used in a temporal analysis from 02 October 2017 to 08 August 2018, totaling 55 Sentinel 2 images and 25 Sentinel 1 images. The selection of the best regression algorithm was based on two validation methodologies: K-fold cross-validation (k = 10) and holdout. We tested four modeling approaches with eight regression algorithms. The random forest was the algorithm that presented the best statistical metrics, regardless of the validation methodology and the approach used. Therefore, this model was applied to a time series of Sentinel 1 images in order to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the model created. We observed that the data derived from Sentinel 1 allowed us to model, with great reliability, the NDVI of agricultural crops throughout the phenological cycle, making the methodology developed in this work a relevant solution for the monitoring of various regions, regardless of cloud cover.

TI  - Patterns of Arctic Tundra Greenness Based on Spatially Downscaled Solar-Induced Fluorescence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A general greening trend in the Arctic tundra biome has been indicated by satellite remote sensing data over recent decades. However, since 2011, there have been signs of browning trends in many parts of the region. Previous research on tundra greenness across the Arctic region has relied on the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this research, we initially used spatially downscaled solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) data to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of Arctic tundra greenness (2007-2013). The results derived from the SIF data were also compared with those from two NDVIs (the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies NDVI3g and MOD13Q1 NDVI), and the eddy-covariance (EC) observed gross primary production (GPP). It was found that most parts of the Arctic tundra below 75 degrees N were browning (-0.0098 mW/m(2)/sr/nm/year, where sr is steradian and nm is nanometer) using SIF, whereas spatially and temporally heterogeneous trends (greening or browning) were obtained based on the two NDVI products. This research has further demonstrated that SIF data can provide an alternative direct proxy for Arctic tundra greenness.

TI  - Land Subsidence and Ground Fissures in Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA): Evidence from Quasi-PS InSAR Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a global environmental geological hazard caused by natural or human activities. The high spatial resolution and continuous time coverage of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis techniques provide data and a basis for the development of methods for the investigation and evolution mechanism study of regional land subsidence. Beijing, the capital city of China, has suffered from land subsidence for decades since it was first recorded in the 1950s. It was reported that uneven ground subsidence and fractures have seriously affected the normal operation of the Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) in recent years before the overhaul of the middle runway in April 2017. In this study, InSAR time series analysis was successfully used to detect the uneven local subsidence and ground fissure activity that has been gradually increasing in BCIA since 2010. A multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique was performed on 63 TerraSAR-X/TanDem-X (TSX/TDX) images acquired between 2010 and 2017, then deformation rate maps and time series for the airport area were generated. Comparisons of deformation rate and displacement time series from InSAR and ground-leveling were carried out in order to evaluate the accuracy of the InSAR-derived measurements. After an integrated analysis of the distribution characteristics of land subsidence, previous research results, and geological data was carried out, we found and located an active ground fissure. Then main cause of the ground fissures was preliminarily discussed. Finally, it can be conducted that InSAR technology can be used to identify and monitor geological processes, such as land subsidence and ground fissure activities, and can provide a scientific approach to better explore and study the cause and formation mechanism of regional subsidence and ground fissures.

TI  - Deep Learning Neural Networks Trained with MODIS Satellite-Derived Predictors for Long-Term Global Solar Radiation Prediction
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy predictive models designed to emulate the long-term (e.g., monthly) global solar radiation (GSR) trained with satellite-derived predictors can be employed as decision tenets in the exploration, installation and management of solar energy production systems in remote and inaccessible solar-powered sites. In spite of a plethora of models designed for GSR prediction, deep learning, representing a state-of-the-art intelligent tool, remains an attractive approach for renewable energy exploration, monitoring and forecasting. In this paper, algorithms based on deep belief networks and deep neural networks are designed to predict long-term GSR. Deep learning algorithms trained with publicly-accessible Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data are tested in Australia's solar cities to predict the monthly GSR: single hidden layer and ensemble models. The monthly-scale MODIS-derived predictors (2003-2018) are adopted, with 15 diverse feature selection approaches including a Gaussian Emulation Machine for sensitivity analysis used to select optimal MODIS-predictor variables to simulate GSR against ground-truth values. Several statistical score metrics are adopted to comprehensively verify surface GSR simulations to ascertain the practicality of deep belief and deep neural networks. In the testing phase, deep learning models generate significantly lower absolute percentage bias (<= 3%) and high Kling-Gupta efficiency (>= 97.5%) values compared to the single hidden layer and ensemble model. This study ascertains that the optimal MODIS input variables employed in GSR prediction for solar energy applications can be relatively different for diverse sites, advocating a need for feature selection prior to the modelling of GSR. The proposed deep learning approach can be adopted to identify solar energy potential proactively in locations where it is impossible to install an environmental monitoring data acquisition instrument. Hence, MODIS and other related satellite-derived predictors can be incorporated for solar energy prediction as a strategy for long-term renewable energy exploration.

TI  - Monitoring Changes in the Cultivation of Pigeonpea and Groundnut in Malawi Using Time Series Satellite Imagery for Sustainable Food Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Malawi, in south-eastern Africa, is one of the poorest countries in the world. Food security in the country hinges on rainfed systems in which maize and sorghum are staple cereals and groundnut and pigeonpea are now major grain legume crops. While the country has experienced a considerable reduction in forest lands, population growth and demand for food production have seen an increase in the area dedicated to agricultural crops. From 2010, pigeonpea developed into a major export crop, and is commonly intercropped with cereals or grown in double-up legume systems. Information on the spatial extent of these crops is useful for estimating food supply, understanding export potential, and planning policy changes as examples of various applications. Remote sensing analysis offers a number of efficient approaches to deliver spatial, reproducible data on land use and land cover (LULC) and changes therein. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (fortnightly and monthly) and derived phenological parameters assist in mapping cropland areas during the agricultural season, with explicit focus on redistributed farmland. Owing to its low revisit time and the availability of long-term period data, MODIS offers several advantages, e.g., the possibility of obtaining cloud-free Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profile and an analysis using one methodology applied to one sensor at regular acquisition dates, avoiding incomparable results. To assess the expansion of areas used in the production of pigeonpea and groundnut resulting from the release of new varieties, the spatial distribution of cropland areas was mapped using MODIS NDVI 16-day time-series products (MOD13Q1) at a spatial resolution of 250 m for the years 2010-2011 and 2016-2017. The resultant cropland extent map was validated using intensive ground survey data. Pigeonpea is mostly grown in the southern dry districts of Mulanje, Phalombe, Chiradzulu, Blantyre and Mwanza and parts of Balaka and Chikwawa as a groundnut-pigeonpea intercrop, and sorghum-pigeonpea intercrop in Mzimba district. By 2016, groundnut extent had increased in Mwanza, Mulanje, and Phalombe and fallen in Mzimba. The result indicates that the area planted with pigeonpea had increased by 29% (75,000 ha) from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017. Pigeonpea expansion in recent years has resulted from major export opportunities to Asian countries like India, and its consumption by Asian expatriates all over the world. This study provides useful information for policy changes and the prioritization of resources allocated to sustainable food production and to support smallholder farmers.

TI  - A Novel Framework of Detecting Convective Initiation Combining Automated Sampling, Machine Learning, and Repeated Model Tuning from Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a complete framework of a machine learning-based model that detects convective initiation (CI) from geostationary meteorological satellite data. The suggested framework consists of three main processes: (1) An automated sampling tool; (2) machine learning-based CI detection modelling; (3) repeated model tuning through validation. In this study, the automated sampling tool was able to track the CI objects iteratively, even without ancillary data such as an atmospheric motion vector (AMV). The collected samples were used to train the machine learning model for CI detection. Random forest (RF) was used to classify the CI and non-CI. To enhance the advantages of the machine learning approach, we adopted model tuning to iteratively update the training dataset from each validation result by adding hits and misses to the CI samples, and false alarms and correct negatives to the non-CI samples. Using 12 interest fields from the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) over the Korean Peninsula, this simple and intuitive tuning process increased the overall probability of detection (POD) from 0.79 to 0.82 and decreased the overall false alarm rate (FAR) from 0.46 to 0.37 with around 40 min of the lead-time. Amongst the 12 interest fields, T-b(11.2) mu m was identified as the most significant predictor in the RF model, followed by T-b(8.6-11.2) mu m, and T-b(6.2-7.3) mu m. The effect of model tuning on the CI detection performance was also analyzed using spatiotemporal validation maps. By automatically collecting and updating the machine learning training dataset, the suggested framework is expected to help the maintenance of the CI detection model from an operational perspective.

TI  - Climate and Land-Use Change Effects on Soil Carbon Stocks over 150 Years in Wisconsin, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon is a sink for mitigating increased atmospheric carbon. The international initiative 4 per 1000 aims at implementing practical actions on increasing soil carbon storage in soils under agriculture. This requires a fundamental understanding of the soil carbon changes across the globe. Several studies have suggested that the global soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) have decreased due to global warming and land cover change, while others reported SOCS may increase under climate change and improved soil management. To better understand how a changing climate, land cover, and agricultural activities influence SOCS across large extents and long periods, the spatial and temporal variations of SOCS were estimated using a modified space-for-time substitution method over a 150-year period in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We used legacy soil datasets and environmental factors collected and estimated at different times across the state (169,639 km(2)) coupled with a machine-learning algorithm. The legacy soil datasets were collected from 1980 to 2002 from 550 soil profiles and harmonized to 0.30 m depth. The environmental factors consisted of 100-m soil property maps, 1-km annual temperature and precipitation maps, 250-m remote-sensing (i.e., Landsat)-derived yearly land cover maps and a 30-m digital elevation model. The model performance was moderate but can provide insights on understanding the impacts of different factors on SOCS changes across a large spatial and temporal extent. SOCS at the 0-0.30 m decreased at a rate of 0.1 ton ha(-1) year(-1) between 1850 and 1938 and increased at 0.2 ton ha(-1) year(-1) between 1980 and 2002. The spatial variation in SOCS at 0-0.30 m was mainly affected by land cover and soil types with the largest SOCS found in forest and wetland and Spodosols. The loss between 1850 and 1980 was most likely due to land cover change while the increase between 1980 and 2002 was due to best soil management practices (e.g., decreased erosion, reduced tillage, crop rotation and use of legume and cover crops).

TI  - Newly Built Construction Detection in SAR Images Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data can be utilized to help developing countries monitor the use of land. However, the problem of constant cloud coverage prevents us from taking full advantage of satellite optical images. Therefore, we instead opt to use data from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), which can capture images of the Earth's surface regardless of the weather conditions. In this study, we use SAR data to identify newly built constructions. Most studies on change detection tend to detect all of the changes that have a similar temporal change characteristic occurring on two occasions, while we want to identify only the constructions and avoid detecting other changes such as the seasonal change of vegetation. To do so, we study various deep learning network techniques and have decided to propose the fully convolutional network with a skip connection. We train this network with pairs of SAR data acquired on two different occasions from Bangkok and the ground truth, which we manually create from optical images available from Google Earth for all of the SAR pairs. Experiments to assign the most suitable patch size, loss weighting, and epoch number to the network are discussed in this paper. The trained model can be used to generate a binary map that indicates the position of these newly built constructions precisely with the Bangkok dataset, as well as with the Hanoi and Xiamen datasets with acceptable results. The proposed model can even be used with SAR images of the same specific satellite from another orbit direction and still give promising results.

TI  - Fast GPU-Based Enhanced Wiener Filter for Despeckling SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle noise is presented as an inherent dilemma that affects the image processing field, and in particular synthetic aperture radar images. In order to mitigate the adverse effects caused by this phenomenon, several approaches have been introduced in the scientific community during the last three decades including spatial-based and non-local filtering approaches. However, these proposed techniques suffer from some limitations. In fact, it is very difficult to find an approach that is able, on the one hand, to perform well in terms of noise reduction and image detail preservation and, on the other hand, provide a filtering output solution without high computational complexity and within a short processing time. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the performance of a newly-developed despeckling algorithm, presented as an enhancement of the classical Wiener filter and properly designed to work with a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The algorithm is tested on both a simulated framework and real Sentinel-1 SAR data. The results, obtained in comparison with other filters, are interesting and promising. Indeed, the proposed method turns out to be a useful filtering instrument in the case of large images by performing the processing within a limited time and ensuring good speckle noise reduction with a considerable image detail preservation.

TI  - Airborne Waveform Lidar Simulator Using the Radiative Transfer of a Laser Pulse
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - An airborne lidar simulator creates a lidar point cloud from a simulated lidar system, flight parameters, and the terrain digital elevation model (DEM). At the basic level, the lidar simulator computes the range from a lidar system to the surface of a terrain using the geomatics lidar equation. The simple computation effectively assumes that the beam divergence is zero. If the beam spot is meaningfully large due to the large beam divergence combined with high sensor altitude, then the beam plane with a finite size interacts with a ground target in a realistic and complex manner. The irradiance distribution of a delta-pulse beam plane is defined based on laser pulse radiative transfer. The airborne lidar simulator in this research simulates the interaction between the delta-pulse and a three-dimensional (3D) object and results in a waveform. The waveform will be convoluted using a system response function. The lidar simulator also computes the total propagated uncertainty (TPU). All sources of the uncertainties associated with the position of the lidar point and the detailed geomatics equations to compute TPU are described. The boresighting error analysis and the 3D accuracy assessment are provided as examples of the application using the simulator.

TI  - Mister Rogers' environmentalism: children's spirituality in a trash apocalypse
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHILDRENS SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1990, when Earth Day was set to go international, the iconic Mister Rogers' Neighborhood - which ran for 900 episodes from 1968 to 2001 and won a Peabody Award and 4 Emmy Awards and received 25 Emmy Award nominations - ran a series of episodes on 'Caring for the Environment.' The show grappled with how children might face the looming environmental crisis. In these episodes, Rogers offers a spirituality for children that enables them to grasp the severity of the issue but does so by situating the concern in a hopeful worldview and indicating ways that children can take action. Instead of instilling fear and apathy as popular environmental apocalypticism does, Rogers prepares children for the new social order that must emerge to address the environmental crisis. It is an approach that prevents children from being overwhelmed by anxiety in the face of the environmental crisis but instead develops in them a sense of responsibility for the environment.

TI  - Generating Red-Edge Images at 3 M Spatial Resolution by Fusing Sentinel-2 and Planet Satellite Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite images can be used to some extent to mitigate the mixed-pixel problem caused by the lack of intensive production, farmland fragmentation, and the uneven growth of field crops in developing countries. Specifically, red-edge (RE) satellite images can be used in this context to reduce the influence of soil background at early stages as well as saturation due to crop leaf area index (LAI) at later stages. However, the availability of high-resolution RE satellite image products for research and application globally remains limited. This study uses the weight-and-unmixing algorithm as well as the SUPer-REsolution for multi-spectral Multi-resolution Estimation (Wu-SupReME) approach to combine the advantages of Sentinel-2 spectral and Planet spatial resolution and generate a high-resolution RE product. The resultant fused image is highly correlated (R-2 > 0.98) with Sentinel-2 image and clearly illustrates the persistent advantages of such products. This fused image was significantly more accurate than the originals when used to predict heterogeneous wheat LAI and therefore clearly illustrated the persistence of Sentinel-2 spectral and Planet spatial advantage, which indirectly proved that the fusion methodology of generating high-resolution red-edge products from Planet and Sentinel-2 images is possible. This study provided method reference for multi-source data fusion and image product for accurate parameter inversion in quantitative remote sensing of vegetation.

TI  - Continuous Monitoring of the Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Surface Water in Response to Land Use and Land Cover Types in a Mediterranean Lagoon Complex
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean coastal lagoons and their peripheral areas often provide a collection of habitats for many species, and they often face significant threats from anthropogenic activities. Diverse human activities in such areas directly affect the spatio-temporal dynamic of surface water and its ecological characteristics. Monitoring the surface water dynamic, and understanding the impact of human activities are of great significance for coastal lagoon conservation. The Regional Natural Park of Narbonne includes a typical Mediterranean lagoon complex where surface water dynamic and its potential link with local diverse human activities has not yet been studied. In this context, based on all the available Landsat images covering the study area during 2002-2016, this study identified the water and non-water classes for each satellite observation by comparing three widely used spectral indices (i.e., NDVI, NDWI and MNDWI) and using the Otsu method. The yearly water frequency index was then computed to present the spatio-temporal dynamic of surface water for each year, and three water dynamic scenarios were also identified for each year: permanent water (PW), non-permanent water (NPW) and non-water (NW). The spatial and inter-annual variation in the patterns of the three water scenarios were characterized by computing the landscape metrics at scenario-level quantifying area/edge, shape, aggregation and fragmentation. Finally, the quantitative link between different land use and land cover (LULC) types derived from the LULC maps of 2003, 2012 and 2015 and the surface water dynamic scenarios was established in each of the 300 m x 300 m grid cells covering the study area to determine the potential impact of human activities on the surface water dynamic. In terms of the inter-annual variation during 2002-2016, PW presented an overall stability, and NPW occupied only a small part of the water surface in each year and presented an inter-annual fluctuation. NPW had a smaller patch size, with lower connectivity degree and higher fragmentation degree. In terms of spatial variation during 2002-2016, NPW often occurred around PW, and its configurational features varied from place to place. Moreover, PW mostly corresponded to the natural lagoon, and salt marsh (as a part of lagoons), and NPW had a strong link with arable land (agricultural irrigation) and salt marsh (salt production), sand beach/dune, coastal wetlands and lagoon for the LULC maps of 2003, 2012 and 2015. However, more in-depth analysis is required for understanding the impact of sand beach/dune, coastal wetlands and lagoon on surface water dynamics. This study covers the long-term variations of surface water patterns in a Mediterranean lagoon complex having intense and diverse human activities, and the potential link between LULC types and the water dynamic scenarios was investigated on different dates. The results of the study should be useful for environmental management and protection of coastal lagoons.

TI  - Accuracy Evaluation and Consistency Analysis of Four Global Land Cover Products in the Arctic Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is a fundamental component of crucial importance in the earth sciences. To date, many excellent international teams have created a variety of land cover products covering the entire globe. To provide a reference for researchers studying the Arctic, this paper evaluates four commonly used land cover products. First, we compare and analyze the four land cover products from the perspectives of land cover type, distribution and spatial heterogeneity. Second, we evaluate the accuracy of such products by using two sets of sample points collected from the Arctic region. Finally, we obtain the spatial consistency distribution of the products by means of superposition analysis. The results show the following: (a) among the four land cover products, Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) has the highest overall accuracy (63.5%) in the Arctic region, GlobeLand30 has an overall accuracy of 62.2% and the overall accuracy of the Global Land Cover by the National Mapping Organization (GLCNMO) is only 48.8%. When applied in the Arctic region, the overall accuracy of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is only 29.5% due to significant variances. Therefore, MODIS and GLCNMO are not recommended in Arctic-related research as their use may lead to major errors. (b) An evaluation of the consistency of the four products indicates that the classification of the large-scale homogeneous regions in the Arctic yields satisfactory results, whereas the classification results in the forest-tundra ecotone are unsatisfactory. The results serve as a reference for future research. (c) Among the four products, GlobeLand30 is the best choice for analyzing finely divided and unevenly distributed surface features such as waters, urban areas and cropland. Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) has the highest overall accuracy, and its classification accuracy is relatively higher for forests, shrubs, sparse vegetation, snow/ice and water. GlobeLand30 and CCI-LC do not vary much from each other in terms of overall accuracy. They differ the most in the classification accuracy of shrub-covered land; CCI-LC performed better than GlobeLand30 in the classification of shrub-covered land, whereas the latter obtained higher accuracy than that of the former in the classification of urban areas and cropland.

TI  - The Importance of Environmental Knowledge for Private and Public Sphere Pro-Environmental Behavior: Modifying the Value-Belief-Norm Theory
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The promotion of pro-environmental behavior is regarded as very important in solving environmental problems. The Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory usually emphasizes internal factors; however, we have transformed this theory by including the environmental knowledge as an external factor. The results showed that action-related environmental knowledge was related to the ecological worldview and directly influenced the private sphere behavior. The ecological worldview, which in this paper was operationalized as environmental concern, had a direct effect on public sphere behavior and an indirect effect on private behavior through awareness of behavioral consequences. Thus, in this paper we revealed how specific environmental knowledge influenced pro-environmental behavior. We also suggest that it is important to educate people about local and global environmental problems, about the impact of behavior on the environment not only in private but also in the public sphere, and to foster the ecocentrism, as well. In addition, we revealed the meaning and necessity of education for environmental citizenship.

TI  - Prediction of High-Quality MODIS-NPP Product Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is a key vegetation parameter and ecological indicator for tracking natural environmental change. High-quality Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Net primary productivity (MODIS-NPP) products are critical for assuring the scientific rigor of NPP analyses. However, obtaining high-quality MODIS-NPP products consistently is challenged by factors such as cloud contamination, heavy aerosol pollution, and atmospheric variability. This paper proposes a method combining the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for generating high-quality MODIS-NPP data. In this method, the DWT is used to remove noise in the original MODIS-NPP data, and the EKF is applied to the de-noised images. The de-noised images are modeled as a triply modulated cosine function that predicts the NPP data values when excessive cloudiness is present. This study was conducted in South China. By comparing measured NPP data to original MODIS-NPP and NPP estimates derived from combining the DWT and EKF, we found that the accuracy of the NPP estimates was significantly improved. The MODIS-NPP estimates had a mean relative error (RE) of 13.96% and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 15.67%, while the original MODIS-NPP had a mean RE of 23.58% and an rRMSE of 24.98%. The method combining DWT and EKF provides a feasible approach for generating new, high-quality NPP data in the absence of high-quality original MODIS-NPP data.

TI  - Improved Spring Vegetation Phenology Calculation Method Using a Coupled Model and Anomalous Point Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution remote sensing satellite data can be used to collect vegetation phenology observations over regional and global scales. Logistic and polynomial functions are the most widely used methods for fitting time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Furthermore, the maximum in the curvature of the fitted curve is usually considered as the spring green-up date. However, the existing green-up date calculation methods have low accuracy for sparse vegetation. This paper proposes an improved green-up date calculation method using a coupled model and anomalous point detection (CMAPD). This model is based on a combination of logistic and polynomial functions, which is used to fit time series vegetation index. Anomalous values were identified using the nearest neighbor algorithm, and these values were corrected by the combination of growing degree-days (GDD) and land use type. Then, the trends and spatial patterns of green-up date was analyzed in the Sanjiangyuan area. The results show that the coupled model fit the time series data better than a single logistic or polynomial function. Besides, the anomalous point detection method properly controlled the green-up date within the local threshold, and could reflect green-up date more accurately. In addition, a weak statistically significant advance trend for average vegetation green-up date was observed from 2000 to 2016. However, in 10.4% of the study area, the the green-up date has significant advanced. Regression analysis showed that the green-up date is correlated to elevation: the green-up date is clearly later at higher elevations.

TI  - Interaction of Seasonal Sun-Angle and Savanna Phenology Observed and Modelled using MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of phenology usually works at the regional and global scales, which imposes considerable variations in the solar zenith angle (SZA) across space and time. Variations in SZA alters the shape and profile of the surface reflectance and vegetation index (VI) time series, but this effect on remote-sensing-derived vegetation phenology has not been adequately evaluated. The objective of this study is to understand the behaviour of VIs response to SZA, and to further improve the interpretation of satellite observed vegetation dynamics, across space and time. In this study, the sensitivity of two widely used VIs-the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)-to SZA was investigated at four northern Australian savanna sites, over a latitudinal distance of 9.8 degrees (similar to 1100 km). Complete time series of surface reflectances, as acquired with different SZA configurations, were simulated using Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters provided by MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The sun-angle dependency of the four phenological transition dates were assessed. Results showed that while NDVI was very sensitive to SZA, such sensitivity was nearly absent for EVI. A negative correlation was also observed between NDVI sensitivity to SZA and vegetation cover, with sensitivity declining to the same level as EVI when vegetation cover was high. Different sun-angle configurations resulted in considerable variations in the shape and magnitude of the phenological profiles. The sensitivity of VIs to SZA was generally greater during the dry season (with only active trees present) than in the wet season (with both active trees and grasses), thus, the sun-angle effect on VIs was phenophase-dependent. The sun-angle effect on NDVI time series resulted in considerable differences in the phenological metrics across different sun-angle configurations. Across four sites, the sun-angle effect caused 15.5 days, 21.6 days, and 20.5 days differences in the start, peak, and the end of the growing season derived from NDVI time series, with seasonally varying SZA at local solar noon, as compared to those metrics derived from NDVI time series with fixed SZA. In comparison, those differences in the start, peak, and end of the growing season for EVI were significantly smaller, with only 4.8 days, 4.9 days, and 3 days, respectively. Our results suggest the potential importance of considering the seasonal SZA effect on VI time series prior to the retrieval of phenological metrics.

TI  - Capturing Coastal Dune Natural Vegetation Types Using a Phenology-Based Mapping Approach: The Potential of Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas harbor the most threatened ecosystems on Earth, and cost-effective ways to monitor and protect them are urgently needed, but they represent a challenge for habitat mapping and multi-temporal observations. The availability of open access, remotely sensed data with increasing spatial and spectral resolution is promising in this context. Thus, in a sector of the Mediterranean coast (Lazio region, Italy), we tested the strength of a phenology-based vegetation mapping approach and statistically compared results with previous studies, making use of open source products across all the processing chain. We identified five accurate land cover classes in three hierarchical levels, with good values of agreement with previous studies for the first and the second hierarchical level. The implemented procedure resulted as being effective for mapping a highly fragmented coastal dune system. This is encouraging to take advantage of the earth observation through remote sensing technology in an open source perspective, even at the fine scale of highly fragmented sand dunes landscapes.

TI  - Large-Area, High Spatial Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using Random Forests, GEOBIA, and NAIP Orthophotography: Findings and Recommendations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the need for quality land cover information, large-area, high spatial resolution land cover mapping has proven to be a difficult task for a variety of reasons including large data volumes, complexity of developing training and validation datasets, data availability, and heterogeneity in data and landscape conditions. We investigate the use of geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), random forest (RF) machine learning, and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) orthophotography for mapping general land cover across the entire state of West Virginia, USA, an area of roughly 62,000 km(2). We obtained an overall accuracy of 96.7% and a Kappa statistic of 0.886 using a combination of NAIP orthophotography and ancillary data. Despite the high overall classification accuracy, some classes were difficult to differentiate, as highlight by the low user's and producer's accuracies for the barren, impervious, and mixed developed classes. In contrast, forest, low vegetation, and water were generally mapped with accuracy. The inclusion of ancillary data and first- and second-order textural measures generally improved classification accuracy whereas band indices and object geometric measures were less valuable. Including super-object attributes improved the classification slightly; however, this increased the computational time and complexity. From the findings of this research and previous studies, recommendations are provided for mapping large spatial extents.

TI  - Effects of Expansive Agents on the Early Hydration Kinetics of Cementitious Binders
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The addition of expansive agents could overcome the main disadvantages of raw concrete including high brittleness and low tensile strength. Few studies have investigated the early hydration kinetics of expansive cementitious binders, though the findings from the early hydration kinetics are helpful for understanding their technical performances. In this study, mixtures of 3CaO center dot 3Al(2)O(3)center dot CaSO4 and CaSO4 (i.e., ZY-type (TM) expansive agent) with different proportions of mineral admixtures (e.g., fly ash and slag) were added into cement pastes to investigate the early hydration kinetics mechanism of expansive cementitious binders. Early hydration heat evolution rate and cumulative hydration heat were measured by isothermal calorimeter. Kinetic parameters were estimated based on the Krstulovic-Dabic model and Knudsen equations. Mechanical performances of expansive cementitious binders were tested in order to evaluate if they met the basic requirements of shrinkage-compensating materials in technical use. The early hydration heat released from cementitious binders containing ZY-type (TM) expansive agent was much greater than that released by pure cement, supporting the idea that addition of the expansive agent would improve the reaction of cement. The early hydration kinetic rates were decreased due to the reactions of the mineral admixture (e.g., fly ash or slag) and the ZY-type (TM) expansive agent in the cement system. The hydration reaction of cementitious binders containing ZY-type (TM) expansive agent obeyed the Krstulovic-Dabic model well. Three processes are involved in the hydration reaction of cementitious binders containing ZY-type (TM) expansive agent. These are nucleation and crystal growth (NG), interactions at phase boundaries (I), and diffusion (D). The 14-day expansion rates of cementitious binders containing ZY-type (TM) expansive agent are in the range of 2.0 x 10(-4) to 3.5 x 10(-4), which could meet the basic requirements of anti-cracking performances in technical use according to Chinese industry standard JGJ/T 178-2009. This study could provide an insight into understanding the effects of expansive agents on the hydration and mechanical performances of cementitious binders.

TI  - Pre-Collapse Space Geodetic Observations of Critical Infrastructure: The Morandi Bridge, Genoa, Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a methodology for the assessment of possible pre-failure bridge deformations, based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. We apply this methodology to obtain a detailed 15-year survey of the Morandi bridge (Polcevera Viaduct) in the form of relative displacements across the structure prior to its collapse on August 14th 2018. We generated a displacement map for the structure from space-based SAR measurements acquired by the Italian constellation COSMO-SkyMed and the European constellation Sentinel-1A/B over the period 2009-2018. Historical satellite datasets include Envisat data spanning 2003-2011. The map reveals that the bridge was undergoing an increased magnitude of deformations over time prior to its collapse. This technique shows that the deck next to the collapsed pier was characterized since 2015 by increasing relative displacements. The COSMO-SkyMed dataset reveals the increased deformation magnitude over time of several points located near the strands of this deck between 12th March 2017 and August 2018.

TI  - Synergy of ICESat-2 and Landsat for Mapping Forest Aboveground Biomass with Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially continuous estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential to supporting the sustainable management of forest ecosystems and providing invaluable information for quantifying and monitoring terrestrial carbon stocks. The launch of the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) on September 15th, 2018 offers an unparalleled opportunity to assess AGB at large scales using along-track samples that will be provided during its three-year mission. The main goal of this study was to investigate deep learning (DL) neural networks for mapping AGB with ICESat-2, using simulated photon-counting lidar (PCL)-estimated AGB for daytime, nighttime, and no noise scenarios, Landsat imagery, canopy cover, and land cover maps. The study was carried out in Sam Houston National Forest located in south-east Texas, using a simulated PCL-estimated AGB along two years of planned ICESat-2 profiles. The primary tasks were to investigate and determine neural network architecture, examine the hyper-parameter settings, and subsequently generate wall-to-wall AGB maps. A first set of models were developed using vegetation indices calculated from single-date Landsat imagery, canopy cover, and land cover, and a second set of models were generated using metrics from one year of Landsat imagery with canopy cover and land cover maps. To compare the effectiveness of final models, comparisons with Random Forests (RF) models were made. The deep neural network (DNN) models achieved R-2 values of 0.42, 0.49, and 0.50 for the daytime, nighttime, and no noise scenarios respectively. With the extended dataset containing metrics calculated from Landsat images acquired on different dates, substantial improvements in model performance for all data scenarios were noted. The R-2 values increased to 0.64, 0.66, and 0.67 for the daytime, nighttime, and no noise scenarios. Comparisons with Random forest (RF) prediction models highlighted similar results, with the same R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) range (15-16 Mg/ha) for daytime and nighttime scenarios. Findings suggest that there is potential for mapping AGB using a combinatory approach with ICESat-2 and Landsat-derived products with DL.

TI  - Investigation of Cutting Force in Longitudinal-Torsional Ultrasonic-Assisted Milling of Ti-6Al-4V
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose a longitudinal-torsion ultrasonic-assisted milling (LTUM) machining method for difficult-to-cut materials-such as titanium alloy-in order to realize anti-fatigue manufacturing. In addition, a theoretical prediction model of cutting force is established. To achieve this, we used the cutting edge trajectory of LTUM to reveal the difference in trajectory between LTUM and traditional milling (TM). Then, an undeformed chip thickness (UCT) model of LTUM was constructed. From this, the cutting force model was able to be established. A series of experiments were subsequently carried out to verify this LTUM cutting force model. Based on the established model, the influence of several parameters on cutting force was analyzed. The results showed that the established theoretical model of cutting force was in agreement with the experimental results, and that, compared to TM, the cutting force was lower in LTUM. Specifically, the cutting force in the feed direction, Fx, decreased by 24.8%, while the cutting force in the width of cut direction Fy, decreased by 29.9%.

TI  - Spatially Consistent High-Resolution Land Surface Temperature Mosaics for Thermophysical Mapping of the Mojave Desert
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Daytime and nighttime thermal infrared observations acquired by the ASTER and MODIS instruments onboard the NASA Terra spacecraft have produced a dataset that can be used to map thermophysical properties across large regions, which have implications on surface processes, thermal environments and habitat suitability for desert species. ASTER scenes acquired between 2004 and 2012 are combined using new mosaicking and data-fusion techniques to produce a map of daytime and nighttime land surface temperature with coverage exclusive of the effects of clouds and weather. These data are combined with Landsat 7 visible imagery to generate a consistent map of apparent thermal inertia (ATI), which is related to the presence of exposed bedrock, rocks, fine-grained sediments and water on the surface. The resulting datasets are compared to known geomorphic units and surface types to generate an interpreted mechanical composition map of the entire Mojave Desert at 100 m per pixel that is most sensitive to large clast size distinctions in grain size distribution.

TI  - Interferometric SAR Phase Denoising Using Proximity-Based K-SVD Technique
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of interferometric noise reduction in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry based on sparse and redundant representations over a trained dictionary. The idea is to use a Proximity-based K-SVD (ProK-SVD) algorithm on interferometric data for obtaining a suitable dictionary, in order to extract the phase image content effectively. We implemented this strategy on both simulated as well as real interferometric data for the validation of our approach. For synthetic data, three different training dictionaries have been compared, namely, a dictionary extracted from the data, a dictionary obtained by a uniform random distribution in <mml:semantics>[-pi,pi]</mml:semantics>, and a dictionary built from discrete cosine transform. Further, a similar strategy plan has been applied to real interferograms. We used interferometric data of various SAR sensors, including low resolution C-band ERS/ENVISAT, medium L-band ALOS, and high resolution X-band COSMO-SkyMed, all over an area of Mt. Etna, Italy. Both on simulated and real interferometric phase images, the proposed approach shows significant noise reduction within the fringe pattern, without any considerable loss of useful information.

TI  - Evaluation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithms over Spanish Inland Waters for Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imagery Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric contribution constitutes about 90 percent of the signal measured by satellite sensors over oceanic and inland waters. Over open ocean waters, the atmospheric contribution is relatively easy to correct as it can be assumed that water-leaving radiance in the near-infrared (NIR) is equal to zero and it can be performed by applying a relatively simple dark-pixel-correction-based type of algorithm. Over inland and coastal waters, this assumption cannot be made since the water-leaving radiance in the NIR is greater than zero due to the presence of water components like sediments and dissolved organic particles. The aim of this study is to determine the most appropriate atmospheric correction processor to be applied on Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imagery over several types of inland waters. Retrievals obtained from different atmospheric correction processors (i.e., Atmospheric correction for OLI lite' (ACOLITE), Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (here called C2RCC), Case 2 Regional Coast Colour for Complex waters (here called C2RCCCX), Image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR), Polynomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS (Polymer) and Sen2Cor or Sentinel 2 Correction) are compared against in situ reflectance measured in lakes and reservoirs in the Valencia region (Spain). Polymer and C2RCC are the processors that give back the best statistics, with coefficients of determination higher than 0.83 and mean average errors less than 0.01. An evaluation of the performance based on water types and single bands-classification based on ranges of in situ chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi disk depth values- showed that performance of these set of processors is better for relatively complex waters. ACOLITE, iCOR and Sen2Cor had a better performance when applied to meso- and hyper-eutrophic waters, compare with oligotrophic. However, other considerations should also be taken into account, like the elevation of the lakes above sea level, their distance from the sea and their morphology.

AB  - Our objective is to develop a framework for deriving long term, consistent Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) from Geostationary (GEO) satellites that is able to account for satellite sensor updates. Specifically, we use the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) model driven with Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) information and Combined ASTER and MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) products. We discuss the results from our comparison of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite East (GOES-E) with the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (MOD11) products, as well as several independent sources of ground observations, for daytime and nighttime independently. Based on a six-year record at instantaneous time scale (2004-2009), most LST estimates are within one std from the mean observed value and the bias is under 1% of the mean. It was also shown that at several ground sites, the diurnal cycle of LST, as averaged over six years, is consistent with a similar record generated from satellite observations. Since the evaluation of the GOES-E LST estimates occurred at every hour, day and night, the data are well suited to address outstanding issues related to the temporal variability of LST, specifically, the diurnal cycle and the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, which are not well represented in LST retrievals form Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.

TI  - Mapping Listvenite Occurrences in the Damage Zones of Northern Victoria Land, Antarctica Using ASTER Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Listvenites normally form during hydrothermal/metasomatic alteration of mafic and ultramafic rocks and represent a key indicator for the occurrence of ore mineralizations in orogenic systems. Hydrothermal/metasomatic alteration mineral assemblages are one of the significant indicators for ore mineralizations in the damage zones of major tectonic boundaries, which can be detected using multispectral satellite remote sensing data. In this research, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) multispectral remote sensing data were used to detect listvenite occurrences and alteration mineral assemblages in the poorly exposed damage zones of the boundaries between the Wilson, Bowers and Robertson Bay terranes in Northern Victoria Land (NVL), Antarctica. Spectral information for detecting alteration mineral assemblages and listvenites were extracted at pixel and sub-pixel levels using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)/Independent Component Analysis (ICA) fusion technique, Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) algorithms. Mineralogical assemblages containing Fe2+, Fe3+, Fe-OH, Al-OH, Mg-OH and CO3 spectral absorption features were detected in the damage zones of the study area by implementing PCA/ICA fusion to visible and near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER. Silicate lithological groups were mapped and discriminated using PCA/ICA fusion to thermal infrared (TIR) bands of ASTER. Fraction images of prospective alteration minerals, including goethite, hematite, jarosite, biotite, kaolinite, muscovite, antigorite, serpentine, talc, actinolite, chlorite, epidote, calcite, dolomite and siderite and possible zones encompassing listvenite occurrences were produced using LSU and CEM algorithms to ASTER VNIR+SWIR spectral bands. Several potential zones for listvenite occurrences were identified, typically in association with mafic metavolcanic rocks (Glasgow Volcanics) in the Bowers Mountains. Comparison of the remote sensing results with geological investigations in the study area demonstrate invaluable implications of the remote sensing approach for mapping poorly exposed lithological units, detecting possible zones of listvenite occurrences and discriminating subpixel abundance of alteration mineral assemblages in the damage zones of the Wilson-Bowers and Bowers-Robertson Bay terrane boundaries and in intra-Bowers and Wilson terranes fault zones with high fluid flow. The satellite remote sensing approach developed in this research is explicitly pertinent to detecting key alteration mineral indicators for prospecting hydrothermal/metasomatic ore minerals in remote and inaccessible zones situated in other orogenic systems around the world.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Effects of Urban Forms and Functions on Urban Heat Islands Based on Local Climate Zone Classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forms and functions have critical impacts on urban heat islands (UHIs). The concept of a local climate zone (LCZ) provides a standard and objective protocol for characterizing urban forms and functions, which has been used to link urban settings with UHIs. However, only a few structure types and surface cover properties are included under the same climate background or only one or two time scales are considered with a high spatial resolution. This study assesses multi-temporal land surface temperature (LST) characteristics across 18 different LCZ types in Beijing, China, from July 2017 to June 2018. A geographic information system-based method is employed to classify LCZs based on five morphological and coverage indicators derived from a city street map and Landsat images, and a spatiotemporal fusion model is adopted to generate hourly 100-m LSTs by blending Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and FengYun-2F LSTs. Then, annual and diurnal cycle parameters and heat island and cool island (HI or CI) frequency are linked to LCZs at annual, seasonal, monthly, and diurnal scales. Results indicate that: (1) the warmest zones are compact and mid and low-rise built-up areas, while the coolest zones are water and vegetated types; (2) compact and open high-rise built-up areas and vegetated types have seasonal thermal patterns but with different causes; (3) diurnal temperature ranges are the highest for compact and large low-rise settings but the lowest for water and dense or scattered trees; and (4) HIs are the most frequent summertime and daytime events, while CIs occur primarily during winter days, making them more or less frequent for open or compact and high- or low-rise built-up areas. Overall, the distinguishable LSTs or UHIs between LCZs are closely associated with the structure and coverage properties. Factors such as geolocation, climate, and layout also interfere with the thermal behavior. This study provides comprehensive information on how different urban forms and functions are related to LST variations at different time scales, which supports urban thermal regulation through urban design.

TI  - On the Automated Mapping of Snow Cover on Glaciers and Calculation of Snow Line Altitudes from Multi-Temporal Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping snow cover (SC) on glaciers at the end of the ablation period provides a possibility to rapidly obtain a proxy for their equilibrium line altitude (ELA) which in turn is a metric for the mass balance. Satellite determination of glacier snow cover, derived over large regions, can reveal its spatial variability and temporal trends. Accordingly, snow mapping on glaciers has been widely applied using several satellite sensors. However, as glacier ice originates from compressed snow, both have very similar spectral properties and standard methods to map snow struggle to distinguish snow on glaciers. Hence, most studies applied manual delineation of snow extent on glaciers. Here we present an automated tool, named ASMAG' (automated snow mapping on glaciers), to map SC on glaciers and derive the related snow line altitude (SLA) for individual glaciers using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM). The method has been developed using the example of the otztal Alps, where an evaluation of the method is possible using field-based observations of the annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and the accumulation area ratio (AAR) measured for three glaciers for more than 30 years. The tool automatically selects a threshold to map snow on glaciers and robustly calculates the SLA based on the frequency distribution of elevation bins with more than 50% SC. The accuracy of the SC mapping was about 90% and the SLA was determined successfully in 80% of all cases with a mean uncertainty of +/- 19 m. When cloud-free scenes close to the date of the highest snowline are available, a good to very good agreement of SC ratios (SCR)/SLA with field data of AAR/ELA are obtained, otherwise values are systematically higher/lower as useful images were often acquired too early in the summer season. However, glacier specific differences are still well captured. Snow mapping on glaciers is impeded by clouds and their shadows or when fresh snow is covering the glaciers, so that more frequent image acquisitions (as now provided by Sentinel-2) would improve results.

TI  - Rangeland Productivity Partitioned to Sub-Pixel Plant Functional Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and monitoring the dynamics of rangeland heterogeneity through time and across space is critical for the effective management and conservation of rangeland systems and the sustained supply of the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Conventional approaches (both field-based and remote sensing) to monitoring rangeland productivity fail to effectively capture important aspects of this heterogeneity. While field methods can effectively capture high levels of detail at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, they are limited in their applicability and scalability to larger spatial extents and longer time periods. Alternatively, remote sensing based approaches that scale broad spatiotemporal extents simplify important heterogeneity occurring at fine scales. We address these limitations to monitoring rangeland productivity by combining a continuous plant functional type (PFT) fractional cover dataset with a Landsat derived gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) model. Integrating the annual PFT dataset with a 16-day Landsat normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) composite dataset enabled us to disaggregate the pixel level NDVI values to the sub-pixel PFTs. These values were incorporated into the productivity algorithm, enabling refined estimations of 16-day GPP and annual NPP for the PFTs that composed each pixel. We demonstrated the results of these methods on a set of representative rangeland sites across the western United States. Partitioning rangeland productivity to sub-pixel PFTs revealed new dynamics and insights to aid the sustainable management of rangelands.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Newly Proposed Seaweed Enhancing Index (SEI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seaweed is a valuable coastal resource for its use in food, cosmetics, and other items. This study proposed new remote sensing based seaweed enhancing index (SEI) using spectral bands of near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) of Landsat 8 satellite data. Nine Landsat 8 satellite images of years 2014, 2016, and 2018 for the January, February, and March months were utilized to test the performance of SEI. The seaweed patches in the coastal waters of Karachi, Pakistan were mapped using the SEI, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and floating algae index (FAI). Seaweed locations recorded during a field survey on February 26, 2014, were used to determine threshold values for all three indices. The accuracy of SEI was compared with NDVI while placing FAI as the reference index. The accuracy of NDVI and SEI were assessed by matching their spatial extent of seaweed cover with FAI enhanced seaweed area. SEI images of January 2016, February 2018, and March 2018 enhanced less than 50 percent of the corresponding FAI total seaweed areas. However, on these dates the NDVI performed very well, matching more than 95 percent of FAI seaweed coverage. Except for these three times, the performance of SEI in the remaining six images was either similar to NDVI or even better than NDVI. SEI enhanced 99 percent of FAI seaweed cover on January 2018 image. Overall, seaweed area not covered by FAI was greater in SEI than NDVI in almost all images, which needs to be further explored in future studies by collecting extensive field information to validate SEI mapped additional area beyond the extent of FAI seaweed cover. Based on these results, in the majority of the satellite temporal images selected for this study, the performance of the newly proposed index-SEI, was found either better than or similar to NDVI.

TI  - VIIRS-Derived Water Turbidity in the Great Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite ocean color products from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) since 2012 and in situ water turbidity measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes Environmental Database System are used to develop a water turbidity algorithm for satellite ocean color applications in the Great Lakes for water quality monitoring and assessments. Results show that the proposed regional algorithm can provide reasonably accurate estimations of water turbidity from satellite observations in the Great Lakes. Therefore, VIIRS-derived water turbidity data are used to investigate spatial and temporal variations in water turbidity for the entirety of the Great Lakes. Water turbidity values are overall the highest in Lake Erie, moderate in Lake Ontario, and relatively low in lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron. Significantly high values in water turbidity appear in the nearshore regions, particularly in Thunder Bay (Lake Superior), Green Bay (Lake Michigan), and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron). Seasonal patterns of water turbidity are generally similar in lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Ontario, showing relatively high values in the spring and autumn months and lows in the winter season, while the seasonal pattern in Lake Erie is apparently different from the other lakes, with the highest value in the winter season and the lowest in the summer season. A strong interannual variability in water turbidity is shown in the time series of the VIIRS-derived water turbidity data for most of the lakes.

TI  - The Comparison of Fusion Methods for HSRRSI Considering the Effectiveness of Land Cover (Features) Object Recognition Based on Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficient and accurate application of deep learning in the remote sensing field largely depends on the pre-processing technology of remote sensing images. Particularly, image fusion is the essential way to achieve the complementarity of the panchromatic band and multispectral bands in high spatial resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we not only pay attention to the visual effect of fused images, but also focus on the subsequent application effectiveness of information extraction and feature recognition based on fused images. Based on the WorldView-3 images of Tongzhou District of Beijing, we apply the fusion results to conduct the experiments of object recognition of typical urban features based on deep learning. Furthermore, we perform a quantitative analysis for the existing pixel-based mainstream fusion methods of IHS (Intensity-Hue Saturation), PCS (Principal Component Substitution), GS (Gram Schmidt), ELS (Ehlers), HPF (High-Pass Filtering), and HCS (Hyper spherical Color Space) from the perspectives of spectrum, geometric features, and recognition accuracy. The results show that there are apparent differences in visual effect and quantitative index among different fusion methods, and the PCS fusion method has the most satisfying comprehensive effectiveness in the object recognition of land cover (features) based on deep learning.

TI  - Short-Term Variation of the Surface Flow Pattern South of Lombok Strait Observed from the Himawari-8 Sea Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal information on oceanic flow is fundamental to oceanography and crucial for marine-related social activities. This study attempts to describe the short-term surface flow variation in the area south of the Lombok Strait in the northern summer using the hourly Himawari-8 sea surface temperature (SST). Although the uncertainty of this temperature is relatively high (about 0.6 C), it could be used to discuss the flow variation with high spatial resolution because sufficient SST differences are found between the areas north and south of the strait. The maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method is used to estimate the surface velocity. The Himawari-8 SST clearly shows Flores Sea water intruding into the Indian Ocean with the high-SST water forming a warm thermal plume on a tidal cycle. This thermal plume flows southward at a speed of about 2 . The Himawari-8 SST indicates a southward flow from the Lombok Strait to the Indian Ocean, which blocks the South Java Current flowing eastward along the southern coast of Nusa Tenggara. Although the satellite data is limited to the surface, we found it useful for understanding the spatial and temporal variations in the surface flow field.

TI  - Canopy Height Layering Biomass Estimation Model (CHL-BEM) with Full-Waveform LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is an important descriptor for studying carbon storage, carbon cycles, and global change science. The full-waveform spaceborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) provides great possibilities for large-scale and long-term biomass estimation. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing research has utilized average tree height (or height metrics) within a GLAS footprint as the key parameter for biomass estimation. However, the vertical distribution of tree height is usually not as homogeneous as we would expect within such a large footprint of more than 2000 m(2), which would limit the biomass estimation accuracy vastly. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel canopy height layering biomass estimation model (CHL-BEM) with GLAS data in this study. First, all the trees with similar height were regarded as one canopy layer within each GLAS footprint. Second, the canopy height and canopy cover of each layer were derived from GLAS waveform parameters. These parameters were extracted using a waveform decomposition algorithm (refined Levenberg-Marquardt-RLM), which assumed that each decomposed vegetation signal corresponded to a particular canopy height layer. Third, the biomass estimation model (CHL-BEM) was established by using the canopy height and canopy cover of each height layer. Finally, the CHL-BEM was compared with two typical biomass estimation models of GLAS in the study site located in Ejina, China, where the dominant species was Populus euphratica. The results showed that the CHL-BEM presented good agreement with the field measurement biomass (R-2 = 0.741, RMSE = 0.487, %RMSE = 24.192) and achieved a significantly higher accuracy than the other two models. As a whole, we expect our method to advance all the full-waveform LiDAR development and applications, e.g., the newly launched Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI).

TI  - Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Images and Support Vector Machine to Assess the Changes in Agricultural Irrigated Areas in the Mogtedo Region, Burkina Faso
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades, small-scale irrigation has been implemented in Burkina Faso as a strategy to mitigate the impacts of adverse climate conditions. However, the development of irrigated perimeters around small and medium water reservoirs has put the water resources under significant pressure, given the uncontrolled exploitation and lack of efficacious management plan. Insights into changes in irrigated areas around these reservoirs are therefore crucial for their sustainable management while meeting the different agricultural water needs. They will help to center policy priorities in terms of major impacts on the reservoirs; and thereby elaborate relevant mitigation and/or adaptation strategies. The main objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the changes in irrigated land areas surrounding the Mogtedo water reservoir between 1987 and 2015; and (2) determine whether the irrigable potential of this reservoir could sustainably meet the agricultural water needs under a more variable and changing climate. A low-cost remote sensing method based on Landsat imagery (Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager) and using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was developed to detect the changes in proportion of land use/land cover (LULC) in the Mogtedo region. A forward and backward change detection analysis requiring agronomic expertise was also applied to correct the pixels temporal trajectories. In addition, an intensity analysis was performed to assess land changes at time intervals, category, and transition levels. Five main LULC classes were identified: bare and hydromorphic soils, irrigated and rainfed agricultural areas, and water bodies. Overall, the classification of LULC was satisfactory with the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients ranging from 94.22 to 95.60% and 0.92 to 0.94, respectively. Results showed that LULC transformations were faster between 2000 and 2015, compared to the 1987-2000 period. The majority of categories (LULC classes) were active in terms of intensity of change (gain or loss) during the 1987-2000 and 2000-2015 periods, except hydromorphic soils. During these periods, the transition from rainfed agricultural areas to irrigated agricultural areas were targeted and stationary. Our findings revealed a 54% increase in irrigated areas between 1987 and 2015. The reservoir water volume decreased markedly from 9,077,000 m(3) to 7,100,000 m(3) during the same period. Such a decrease threatens the satisfaction of agricultural water requirements, since the reservoir is the unique source of irrigation water in the region. It could potentially lead to conflicts between users if adequate strategies for the sustainable management of the Mogtedo reservoir are not implemented. The methodology used in this study also addressed the challenge of building up historical spatial information database in data-scarce environments, and could be replicated readily in regions or countries like Burkina Faso.
