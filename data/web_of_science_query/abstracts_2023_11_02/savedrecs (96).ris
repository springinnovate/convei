TI  - SENTINEL-1 MONITORING OF SANTORINI VOLCANO POST-UNREST STATE

AB  - At the beginning of 2011 Santorini volcano underwent a volcanic unrest, accompanied by an increase of the micro-seismic activity. The unrest that lasted for over a year, demonstrated substantial amounts of uplift, justifying the volcanic origin of the activity. The continuation of the deformation monitoring after the unrest event was deemed necessary, in order to validate the post-unrest state of the volcano and to recognize potential ground deformation signals. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is profoundly promising towards this direction, due to its systematic acquisition and short revisit. A multi-temporal SAR interferometric analysis was deliberated in a way to avoid significant phase changes and to retain high coherence. In this paper, DInSAR analysis was applied over Santorini to retrieve the actual deformation state of the volcano during the repose period 2014-2017. The results indicate subsidence rates on Nea Kameni of about 8-9 mm/yr, implying a gradual deflation of the magma chamber, while the rest of the area appears almost stable with negligible deformation.

T2  - ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) instrument series, on board the European Space Agency (ESA)'s European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, ERS-1/2 and the ENVIronmental SATellite (ENVISAT), covered the time period from 1991 to 2012. Using the infra-red channels at 11 and 12 microns (available for both day and night and for all the three instruments) and combining nadir and forward geometries, Total Column Water Vapour (TCWV) fields have been obtained over the sea in cloud free scenarios. The retrieval scheme, named Advanced InfraRed Water Vapor Estimator (AIRWAVE), exploits the instrument physical characteristics (dual view and two channels), in combination with advanced radiative transfer models and a sea surface spectral emissivity database. The algorithm makes use of a set of tabulated parameters, fixed along the whole globe.Here, the AIRWAVE dataset is compared with the satellite data of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSA/I) and with available stations from the Analyzed RadioSoundings Archive (ARSA). Both comparisons demonstrated the good quality of the AIRWAVE dataset. However, they also highlighted the presence of a dry bias at high latitudes. Globally, we found an average correlative-AIRWAVE bias of 0.72 kg/m(2) (RMSE--5.79 kg/m(2)) vs SSM/I and 0.80 kg/m(2) (RMSE=7.77 kg/m(2)) vs ARSA.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients by Means of Indocyanine Green Using the Karl Storz VITOM® Fluorescence Camera
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the use of radioisotope and blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for axillary staging in breast cancer is common. Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) has been proposed as an alternative sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracking agent. We evaluated the clinical value of ICG as an additional tracer in combination with Technetium(99m) and as an alternative to Technetium(99m) for the identification of SLN in 104 breast cancer patients. 21 patients had at least 1 histologically tumor-positive SLN. All 21 patients were detected by ICG; in one of these 21 sentinel-positive patients, Technetium(99m) was unable to identify lymph node involvement. Our results show that ICG is as effective as the radioisotope for SLNB. In addition, as a near-infrared dye, it has the advantages of real-time visualization, lower cost, and wider availability, since no radioactive material needs to be handled.

AB  - Groundwater in impermeable rock formations flows through fractured zones acting as groundwater conduits. Remotely sensed lineaments corresponding to fractures in rocks were mapped using Landsat TM and ETM+ band combinations in False Colour Composites and band ratios. Open Source/freeware GIS software was used to combine the Remote Sensing (RS) investigation results with ancillary data. Research results were evaluated using field observations and ground water data from water wells and borings in the implementation area. As resulted, the Geomatics Technologies used can provide reliable information and support decisions when prospecting for groundwater in rocky environments, thus reducing time and costs and leading to successful results.

AB  - Castile and Leon crops and natural land map is a highly detailed land cover layer, obtained through satellite imagery, which distinguishes between 122 land cover classes and includes 50 specific crop types. The project began in 2013 by using several satellites, with the production cost greatly reduced since 2016 when Sentinel-2 imagery became freely available, and is updated annually. The classification is performed using a machine learning algorithm trained with data retrieved from Integrated Administration and Control System and some other land use databases available in Spain. This map is also proposed as an advanced crop map, within SENSAGRI project (Sentinels Synergy for Agriculture) drafting in response of the EO Work programme "EO-3-2016: Evolution of Copernicus Services", as one of the four advanced proof-of-concept services. The algorithm will be validated in others European agricultural test areas which, along with Castile and Leon, are representative enough to show an overview of the European crop diversity.

T2  - REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The dynamics of land use and changes in vegetation cover is essential for natural resource management.Objetive: To analyze the land use change in the micro-watersed of Zoquiapan, between 1989 and 2009, and to estimate the change trend for the year 2020.Materials and methods: Two satellite images (March 21, 2009 and March 7, 1989) were taken, corresponding to the Landsat sensor, and were processed using the software IDRISI (c). The classes studied were forest, grassland and agricultural use. The Markov-Markovian transition estimator command was applied to estimate the stationary vector of the chain between the years of study and to know the future trends of vegetation cover.Results and discussion: Between 1989 and 2009, the agricultural and grassland area decreased 1.86 and 88.63 ha, respectively; the forest area increased 90.5 ha. By 2020, the micro-watershed of Zoquiapan will have a low probability of change. The probabilities of permanence are 94 % for forest, 88 % for grassland and 91 % for agricultural activities.Conclusion: The micro-watershed of Zoquiapan has not had any significant land use change. The areas covered by forests have a low probability of change, as long as the conservation efforts carried out so far continue.

AB  - Large-scale land use/land cover (LULC) changes in Portuguesa river basin have not been yet studied in detail. Therefore, the spatial and temporal variability of these changes during the period 2001-2012 was analyzed, by using transition matrices and the MCD12Q1 v 5.1 product derived from the MODIS sensor from NASA's Terra satellite, which provides annual information about the dominant LULC at a 25 ha spatial resolution. The most relevant results indicated that: 1) the conversion from crops to savannas and vice versa was the largest change; 2) the annual persistence capacity for the LULCs showed a negative slight trend; 3) The annual rate of deforestation was significantly variable, but a remarkable recovery in forested upland areas in Guanare and Acarigua river basins between 2010 and 2012 was found.

TI  - Estimating percent impervious cover from Landsat-based land cover with a simple and transferable regression model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Percent impervious cover (PIC) is a widely used metric in ecological and hydrological analyses because it is highly correlated with pollutant and storm water run-off. The moderate-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat), that are typically used to calculate PIC, tend to overestimate PIC for all but very rural and very urban landscapes. Existing models for calibrating PIC estimates (e.g. ISAT, ETIS) are limited in that they are applicable only for specific land cover datasets and may also require population data; furthermore, these models have not been tested for performance outside of the geographic locations in which they were developed. The goal of this study was to explore simple but widely applicable regression models as tools for calibrating PIC estimates based on moderate resolution satellite data. The regression models used impervious land cover, from Landsat-based datasets, as the sole predictor of actual PIC. PIC was calculated for analysis units, ranging in size from 2.25ha to 100ha, for locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Ohio in the United States. Regression models were fit for each size class of analysis unit at each study location; generalized versions of the models were created by fitting a regression to all size classes of analysis units at a given study location. Calibrated PIC estimates had root mean square error (RMSE) values that ranged from 1.5-10.7%; these values were considerably better than RMSE values for uncalibrated PIC estimates which ranged from 10.1-23.3%. For both calibrated and uncalibrated PIC, the accuracy of the estimates improved with the increasing size of the analysis units. Model regression coefficients were similar regardless of the analysis unit size, geographic location, or land cover dataset; model performance declined only slightly when applied outside the area in which it was developed. The simple regression models developed in this study had similar performance to previous calibration models (i.e. ISAT, ETIS) but are easier to apply and more widely applicable.

TI  - BATHYMETRY FROM WORLDVIEW-3 SATELLITE DATA USING RADIOMETRIC BAND RATIO
T2  - ACTA POLYTECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of optical satellite sensors allows to obtain bathymetry data on large area in a short time and in a cheap way. In addition, in particular places where it is difficult to carry out the survey by classic methods, the bathymetry from satellite data can be the only mode to obtain the depth of the backdrop. So, the aim of this research paper is to analyse the potential of the eight bands and the very high resolution of the commercial satellite WorldView-3 (WV-3) in order to obtain bathymetric data.Using WV-3 satellite data and the Stumpf method, the paper intends to investigate the possibility of obtaining bathymetric data in a specific area where the water is not particularly clear. To achieve this goal, in Geographic Information System (GIS) environment, several algorithms have been developed.The comparison between the results and the reference bathymetric data shows a huge potential of the WV-3 satellite data. The area of study concerns the port area of the city of Lisbon and a part of the river Rio Tejo, in Portugal.

AB  - Recognizing the potential utility and importance of a large quantity of spatial data generated using public funds by the Government Departments, organizations and institutions of the State for good governance and taking into consideration that most of such spatial data remains inaccessible to common citizen although most of such data may be unrestricted and not sensitive in nature and also most of such data generated at different State Government Departments do not have compatibility due to lack of common standards and non-interoperability and further taking note of that Government of India framed the "National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP)", National Map Policy (2005) and " Remote Sensing Data Policy (RSDP-2001 and 2011)" to spell out sharing principles of information generated using public funds, Government of Odisha has institutionalised "Odisha Spatial Data Infrastructure(OSDI)", in the line of National Spatial Data Infrastructure(NSDI)". The Government of Odisha gazetted "Odisha Spatial Data Policy (OSDP)" in 22nd August 2015, in the line of NDSAP, to institute a policy frame work to facilitate sharing of such Government owned data through OSDI, in open format, for supporting sustainable and inclusive governance and effective planning, implementation and monitoring of developmental programmes, managing and mitigating disasters and scientific research aiding informed decisions, for public good. The OSDI has already been operational and made live.This paper highlights the Data Model, Meta Data Standard and Sharing Policy adopted in OSDI, apart from other institutional / operational issues in smooth grounding and operationalisation of the OSDI in a State framework.

AB  - Active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors use their own source of illumination to sense the earth surface. SAR sensors have the ability to penetrate through clouds and smoke like conditions, can operate on day and night, and have a sensitivity to each property in the microwave region. Generally, speckle is found in SAR images at the time of image acquisition and transmission. Speckle in the satellite image degrades image quality and makes it less informative about the target/features in the image under study. Denoising SAR image or speckle reduction is a great challenge for the researchers worldwide as classification or recognition becomes difficult on speckled SAR image. Thus it is of prior importance to reduce the speckle in the image before applying any image processing technique. So far many filtering techniques have been developed for denoising SAR images. The prime aim of denoising is to eliminate speckle noise by retaining the important feature of the images. Experimental results of applying different noise reduction techniques on ALOS PALSAR data has been demonstrated in the paper and investigations were performed on these techniques out of which Intensity Driven Adaptive Neighborhood (IDAN) and Median filter technique perform better smoothing than other methods.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the relationship between the Agulhas Current system and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Specifically, it addresses monthly to yearly variations in Agulhas leakage where the Agulhas Current sheds waters into the Atlantic Ocean, in turn affecting meridional overturning circulation (MOC). Sea surface temperature (SST) data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) combined with sea surface salinity (SSS) from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis are used to explore changes in Agulhas leakage dynamics. Agulhas leakage is anomalously warm in response to El Nino and anomalously cool in response to La Nina. The corresponding SSS signal shows both a primary and secondary signal response. At first, the SSS signal of Agulhas leakage is anomalously fresh in response to El Nino, but this primary signal is replaced by a secondary anomalously saline signal. In response to La Nina, the primary SSS signal of Agulhas leakage is anomalously saline, while the secondary SSS signal is anomalously fresh. The lag between the peak of ENSO and the response in SST and the corresponding primary SSS signal of Agulhas leakage is about 20 months, followed by the secondary SSS signal at a lag of about 26 months. In general, increasing ENSO strength increases the extremes of the resulting anomalous SST and SSS signal and impacts the Agulhas leakage region earlier during El Nino and slightly later during La Nina.

AB  - Rose Auslander, born in Bukowina and Mascha Kaleko, born in Galicia, are both Jews and strangers. Both have overcome their sad fate by writing. In other words, writing was their lifesaving tool. Both were among the most important German poets of the 20th century.For Auslander, writing was synonymous with life and survival, as she herself wrote. Her poems differ from the Jewish poets, though they share common stories and language of the Jews. The first volume belongs formally and temporally to her first creative period, which followed the traditional laws of metric and rhyme, and at the same time proves her own tone in her poetry, by the extreme experience of the Shoah changes. The poet's relation to the German language as her mother tongue and the language of her poetic production as well as to the problems of speaking and silence shows us an absolute highlight of her art. She has realized the inner desire for home through the power of the Word and that also means the journey to the Self through writing.The verses of Kaleko are sparkling in tone and ingenious in the train of thought and came well with its mixture of sentiment, cynicism, melancholy worldview, swift joke and folksongness for the press and audience. However she is imposed by the Nazis a write ban and thus loses her job as a writer. Although she feared the loss of her native tongue and language too much, the family emigrated to the United States in 1938 as the Nazi attacks became more violent and found a home in New York. Here she earned the daily bread by making advertising slogans and only wrote casually. Many of her poems are full of homesickness, precocious disillusionment and secret despair such as the cycle “The Thousand Years”, in which she assesses her exile experiences critically-satirical. Her “Emigrant Monologue” is a sad song in which, in the tone of Heinrich Heine, she brings to light a piece of her own life and suffering history.Finally, we can say that the two poets experienced the most brutal Nazis in world history and from there became a “survivor” who left the traces of the horrors and scars of history. Moreover they were able to overcome their lives by singing their hopes and sublimating the suffering and pain of time by writing.

AB  - In this study, visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of WorldView-3 imagery were sharpened to the spatial resolution of a panchromatic image. We performed experiments on three band schemes according to a method for generating an optimal panchromatic image. Various pan-sharpening algorithms based on component-substitution (CS) and multi-resolution analysis (MRA) were applied to each band scheme. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were performed using the quality indices and visual inspection.

TI  - Integrated model for predicting rice yield with climate change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the chief agricultural product and one of the primary food source. For this reason, it is of pivotal importance for worldwide economy and development. Therefore, in a decision-support-system both for the farmers and in the planning and management of the country's economy, forecasting yield is vital. However, crop yield, which is a dependent of the soil-bio-atmospheric system, is difficult to represent in statistical language. This paper describes a novel approach for predicting rice yield using artificial neural network, spatial interpolation, remote sensing and GIS methods. Herein, the variation in the yield is attributed to climatic parameters and crop health, and the normalized difference vegetation index from MODIS is used as an indicator of plant health and growth. Due importance was given to scaling up the input parameters using spatial interpolation and GIS and minimising the sources of error in every step of the modelling. The low percentage error (2.91) and high correlation (0.76) signifies the robust performance of the proposed model. This simple but effective approach is then used to estimate the influence of climate change on South Korean rice production. As proposed in the RCP8.5 scenario, an upswing in temperature may increase the rice yield throughout South Korea.

AB  - The objective of this study is to monitor precision paddy field area and crop classification on a small town area. Monitoring of this agricultural sec tor is useful for evaluating the cultivated environmental condition, especially in mixed crop cultivated areas. This study evaluated the small town in Chungbuk, South Korea, using drone images for the years 2016. The images were acquired 15 times using the RGB and NIR sensors, respectively. Using the collaboration of drone images and smart farm map, we improved the accuracy of crop classification and crop identification. This study also evaluated the relationship between vegetation health and growth state of the study area using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The study area, Daeso town was produced by several crops such as rice, red pepper, corn, sweet potato, sesame, welsh onion, bean, tobacco, ginseng. This study acquired images using fixed wing drone from August 5 to August 6, 2016. It was found that the range of DN values of drone images by crop was different for each crop. The NDVI of this area showed the highest value in the rice with active vegetation and the value of 0 or more in the crops such as sweet potato, soybean, corn and grassland. An object-based technique is used for crop classification. The results showed that scale 250, shape 0.1, color 0.9, compactness 0.5 and smoothness 0.5 were the optimum parameter values in image segmentation. As a result, the collaborated method showed that the kappa coefficient was 0.85 and the overall accuracy of classification was 88.0 %. The result of the present study validates our attempts for crop classification using high resolution drone image and collaborated smart farm map (SFM) established the possibility of using such remote sensing techniques widely to access the difficulty of remote sensing data acquisition in agricultural sector.

AB  - The Christian feature of Yoon Dong-ju 's poem is as important as ‘resistance’. The Christian features of his poetry have not only served as a basis for studying his life, but have also been used as supplementary materials in explaining his poetry. However, the direction of the existing researches has only reinterpreted comparative researches that mediate between poetry and religious studies(Christianity).Christianity accepted in the present day was not limited to religious thought. It can not be overlooked that the Christian spirit was a treasure of the modern spirit, which contained refinement and modernity, in the ‘knowledge-based aspect of learning Western spiritualism’ (Kim Yun-sik). This study examines the poetic maturity of Yoon Dong-ju 's poetry through the process of clarifying Christianity as a Western modern thought that Yoon Dong-ju experienced and the romanticism contained in it.Especially, in 1940, when the “hospital” was created, Yoon Dong-ju 's poetic achievement was identified as the “shame of poetry”, and then the romanticism is called in his poetry. In addition, this study is meaningful in reviewing the ‘romanticism problem’ that was not studied mainly by covering the shade of resistance.

AB  - The fracture of the Larsen C ice shelf, which has been continuously monitored since the final months of 2016, started to grow rapidly in 2017 and, in February 2017, only a 20km ice strip kept a huge section of the shelf attached to the Antarctic Peninsula. The final collapse, expected in 2017, occurred indeed between July 10 and July 12, with a loss of an area of some 6,000km(2), corresponding to about 9-12% of the entire shelf. Following US National Ice Center (NIC) criteria, the calved iceberg was named A-68'. Responding to the ASI COSMO-SkyMed Open Call for Science Initiative', this paper presents a study of the initial phase of iceberg A-68 melting process and drifting trajectory. The analysis covers a period of six months and makes use of a set of COSMO-SkyMed ScanSAR Huge images.

AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA) STEAM (SaTellite Earth observation for Atmospheric Modelling) project aims at investigating new areas of synergy between high-resolution numerical atmosphere models and data from spaceborne remote sensing sensors, with focus on Copernicus Sentinels 1, 2 and 3 satellites. An example of synergy is the ingestion of surface information derived from Sentinel data in numerical weather prediction models. The rationale is that Sentinels 1, 2 and 3 are able to provide high spatio-temporal resolution information on the surface boundary (as well as the atmosphere column) and that an inaccurate representation of the boundary conditions represents a major source of uncertainty for weather forecasts. For a profitable ingestion of EO data in numerical weather prediction models, a critical aspect is the choice of a suitable model. Once the numerical model is chosen, the problem of the selection of the Sentinel-derived surface variables that have to be ingested in the model has to be tackled. While some data, such as sea and land surface temperature, are directly available, other surface data, such as soil moisture, have to be retrieved. Being STEAM currently in its initial phase, this paper gives a general overview of the project and focuses on the first activities performed in its framework. In particular, it describes the rationale behind the choice of the Numerical Weather Prediction Model and the multi-temporal approach designed to retrieve soil moisture from Sentinel-1 data. Moreover, the first results of the ingestion of Sentinel derived soil moisture, land surface temperature and sea surface temperature data into the selected model are shown. These results concern an extreme weather event that occurred in Tuscany (central Italy) in September 2017.

AB  - Wetlands and open waters are key components of the hydrological and carbon cycles but their spatio-temporal dynamics are still not well known, mostly over tropical areas. In this paper, a new water surface product at high spatial resolution (30 arcsec) and high temporal resolution (3 days) over the Amazon basin for recent years (2010-2016) is presented. This product comes from the synergy between recent products: (1) water surface fraction at coarse spatial resolution from L-band microwave sensor (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity - SMOS), (2) Global Surface Water Occurrence (GSWO) from Landsat sensor and (3) the new Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Multi-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain (MERIT) based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) observations.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Influenza is associated with severe illness, death, and economic burden. Sentinel surveillance systems have a central role in the community since they support public health interventions. This study aimed to describe and compare the influenza-coded primary care consultations with the reference index of influenza activity used in Portugal, General Practitioners Sentinel Network, from 2012 to 2017. An ecological time-series study was conducted using weekly R80-coded primary care consultations (according to the International Classification of Primary Care-2), weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence rates from the General Practitioners Sentinel Network and Goldstein Index (GI). Good accordance between these three indicators was observed in the characterization of influenza activity regarding to start and length of the epidemic period, intensity of influenza activity, and influenza peak. A high correlation (0.75) was obtained between weekly ILI incidence rates and weekly number of R80-coded primary care consultations during all five studied seasons. In 3 out of 5 seasons this correlation increased when weekly ILI incidence rates were multiplied for the percentage of influenza positive cases. A cross-correlation between weekly ILI incidence rates and the weekly number of R80-coded primary care consultations revealed that there was no lag between the rate curves of influenza incidence and the number of consultations in the 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons. In the last three seasons, the weekly influenza incidence rates detected the influenza epidemic peak for about a week earlier. In the last season, the GI anticipated the detection of influenza peak for about a two-week period. Sentinel networks are fundamental elements in influenza surveillance that integrate clinical and virological data but often lack representativeness and are not able to provide regional and age groups estimates. Given the good correlation between weekly ILI incidence rate and weekly number of R80 consultations, primary care consultation coding system may be used to complement influenza surveillance data, namely, to monitor regional influenza activity. In the future, it would be interesting to analyse concurrent implementation of both surveillance systems with the integration of all available information. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - In this paper, a review of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based techniques, for oil slick at sea observation is proposed. Compared with traditional on-site oil spill monitoring, the use of remote sensing technology has the possibility quickly and accurately find an oil spill area. Currently, for detection the marine oil spill are usually used two types - optical and synthetic aperture radar SAR remote sensing imagery. Among all satellite sensors, SAR is still the most utilized for operational oil spill detection. SAR represents a fundamental tool due to its almost all-weather and all-day imaging capability, providing synoptic maps of the observed scene with a fine spatial resolution and a dense revisit time.

CL  - AISECT Univ, Bhopal, INDIA
AB  - Bhopal district has been developing at a very fast pace with most of the developmental activities being concentrated in the Bhopal city and along its periphery mostly comprising of the urban-rural fringe areas. This has resulted in considerable changes in the land use in the city and its fringes, with substantial areas being converted to semi-pervious and impervious zones owing to the fast pace of urbanization. These drastic changes in the land use pattern have to a large extent changed the hydrology and drainage aspects of the city. Owing to the changes in the land use and pressures of increasing population, the runoff and drainage aspects have also been altered to some extent. Nowadays, it is very common to find large stretches of roads being submerged during small rainfall events, thereby causing hardships to the local population. An effort has therefore been made to identify the land use changes in the city and its surroundings and its possible impacts on the hydrology of the study area. The land use classification has been carried out for 1992, 2000, and 2014 using LANDSAT data with a resolution of 30 m. The changes in the land use/land cover categories were derived for three different time periods by spatial intersection of land use maps pertaining to 1992 and 2000, 2000 and 2014, and 1992 and 2014 using ERDAS Imagine 2011 and ArcInfo/ArcMap 10 software. The area under settlements has increased by 10.66% during the period between 1992 and 2014, whereas the area under wastelands decreased by 18.29% during the same period. However, the forested area initially decreased from 45.64 km(2) (1992) to 40.24 km(2) (2000) but subsequently increased to 48.62 km(2) in 2014. The soil conservation service-curve number (SCS-CN) method has been used to compute the surface runoff. The change in the runoff pattern has not been substantial in commensuration to these changes in the land use pattern as the runoff generation mechanism is also dominantly dependent on the rainfall pattern and its distribution and the antecedent moisture condition apart from the curve number.

AB  - Rainfall being a major component of the hydrologic cycle, influences the agricultural practices in an area. Thus, trends in rainfall as well as rainy days are of major concern to farmers. Present study focusses on understanding the rainfall trends and its spatial distribution along with the trends in vegetation. An approach where Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) procured from MODIS NDVI as an indicator for vegetation was used in this study. Mann Kendall trend test was performed on a 0.25-degree gridded data and the trends were then compared with the distribution of groundwater stress map of the study area. The study tries to examine the coupled use of NDVI and rainfall trends to decrypt the groundwater exploitation in the region. Further Ghataprabha river basin being susceptible to drought by hosting most of the significantly decreasing trend was investigated further. The propagation of severe drought return periods within the basin resembles the agro-meteorological trends. Even within the limitations of the present study, the methodology with further modifications promises to portray strong indication of groundwater exploitation.

AB  - Drought is commonly occurring natural hazard. It has vicious impact on agricultural production as well as on socioeconomic status of an area. Meteorological drought will induce with the deficit of rainfall and leads to agricultural drought as it prolongs. Rainfall is crucial parameter to assess meteorological drought and NDVI based indices can capture agricultural drought satisfactorily. The present study aims to assess meteorological and agricultural drought in the Ghataprabha river basin using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Monitoring of SPI and VCI will benefits to mitigate drought impacts with the proper water resources managements. Ghataprabha river basin is the sub basin of river Krishna, in India and is agriculturally dominated. Major portion of the basin is semiarid and rainfall is the major sources of water for agriculture. Average annual rainfall of the basin varies from 600 mm to 2000 mm. Gridded rainfall data was procured from the Indian Meteorological Department for the period of forty three years (19702013) and considered same as input for SPI. To calculate SPI with multiple time scale, two parameter gamma distribution was implemented. MODIS NDVI products from 2000-2013 was considered for calculation of VCI. Significant number of meteorological drought episodes were observed during the study period while severe agricultural drought was observed during 2001-2003 and in 2012. SPI and VCI were compared to quantify variation of VCI with respect to SPI. Good agreement between SPI and VCI was observed during drought and non-drought periods. Results indicates that eastern part of the basin was more prone to severe droughts as compare to other part of the basin. This study assistances to formulate drought mitigation strategies and to establish effective water resources policies in the study region.

AB  - Dashboards are technologies that bringing together a range of data sources for observational or analytical purposes. We have created a customised dashboard that includes all the key data elements required for monitoring flu vaccine effectiveness (FVE). This delivers a unique dashboard for each primary care provider (general practice) providing data to the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), one of the oldest European surveillance systems. These FVE studies use a test negative case control (TNCC) design. TNCC requires knowledge of practice denominator; vaccine exposure, and results of influenza virology swabs carried out to identify in an influenza-like-illness (ILI), a clinical diagnosis, really is influenza. The dashboard displays the denominator uploaded each week into the surveillance system, compared with the nationally known practice size (providing face-validity for the denominator); it identifies those exposed to the vaccine (by age group and risk category) and virology specimens taken and missed opportunities for surveillance (again by category). All sentinel practices can access in near real time (4 working days in areas) their rates of vaccine exposure and swabs conducted. Initial feedback is positive; 80% (32/40) practices responded positively.

AB  - Global climate changes are a main factor of risk for infrastructures and people living along the coasts around the world. In this context, sea level rise, coastal retreat and storm surges pose serious threats to coastal zones. In order to assess the expected coastal changes for the next decades, a detailed knowledge of the site's topography (coastline position, DTM, bathymetry) is needed. This paper focuses on the use of very high resolution satellite data and UAV imagery for the generation of accurate very-high and ultra-high mapping of coastal areas. In addition, the use of very high resolution multi-spectral satellite data is investigated for the generation of coastal bathymetry maps. The paper presents a study for the island of Lipari and the coasts of Cinque Terre (Italy) and the island of Lefkas (Greece). For Lefkas, two areas of the island were mapped (the city of Lefkas and its adjoining lagoon in the north side of the island, and the Bay of Vasiliki at the south part of the island) using World View 1, and Wolrd View 3 satellite images, and UAV imagery. The satellite processing provided results that demonstrated an accuracy of approximately 0.25 m plannimetrically and 0.70 m vertically. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of DTMs and orthophotos with an accuracy of approximately 0.03-0.04 meters. In addition, for the Vasiliki bay in the south of the island the World View 3 imagery was used for the estimation of a bathymetry map of the bay. The achieved results yielded an accuracy of 0.4 m. For the sites of Lipari and Cinque Terre (both in Italy), UAV surveys allowed to extract a DTM at about 2 cm of pixel resolution. The integration of topographic data with high resolution multibeam bathymetry and expected sea level rise from IPCC AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios, will be used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100, taking into account the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from CGPS data. The above-mentioned study was realized during the implementation of the SAVEMEDCOASTS project (Sea level rise scenarios along the Mediterranean coasts, funded by the European Commission ECHO A. 5, GA ECHO/SUB/2016/742473/PREV16, www. savemedcoasts. eu).

TI  - A multi-model ensemble approach for quantifying sub-pixel land cover fractions in the urban environments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information is essential for sustainable management of the environment in urban areas. Satellite images have increasingly been used to extract such information, yet the accuracy has been challenged by the spectral and spatial heterogeneity of urban land covers. This paper presents a framework to develop a more skilful and reliable model for estimating land cover fractions using a multi-model ensemble technique, named Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The BMA is a statistical technique that combines the estimates of different models using Bayesian probability theory. In the BMA, each individual estimate is assigned a weight that is optimised in such a way that the likelihood of an individual estimate given the observation is maximised. In this study, three methods, viz. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Pre-screened and Normalised Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (PNMESMA) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used to develop an Ensemble Model (EM). We used a cluster-based approach for applying the BMA to utilise the diverse advantages in individual models. First, the image pixels were separated into three clusters by applying Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholds. Second, an ensemble of models for each cluster was derived using the BMA, and these ensembles were finally combined to derive the final output. The EM was tested in a heterogeneous urban area, viz. South Delhi, India, using two multi-spectral images, including Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER). The modelled land cover fractions were compared with the reference land cover fractions derived from a high-resolution (approximately 1m) panchromatic image of the OrbitView-3 satellite. The accuracy assessment revealed that the EM estimates more accurate and reliable land cover fractions than the individual models on both the images. The performance of the EM in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and kappa coefficient (k) is generally superior to that of the best of the individual models. These findings can help improve the accuracy of land cover fractions in heterogeneous landscapes by combining the outputs of various diverse models.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - In this study, a methodology to retrieve Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) information for shallow snow coverage is proposed, something where traditional methods fail, as they require more snow depth to function properly. The proposed algorithm uses the thermal resistance of snowpack to retrieve the SWE by linearly relating the thermal resistance to the backscattering ratios of winter and autumn (snow-free) images acquired with C-band SAR (Sentinel-1A). The SWE (absolute value) is then estimated from the thermal resistance. The results are verified using field data collected at Dhundi observatory maintained by the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), located in the Himalaya (Himachal Pradesh, India; 32 degrees 21'N and 77 degrees 07'). One winter and two autumn images were used to check the feasibility of the algorithm. The RMSE of SWE estimated using the retrieval algorithm is 3 cm for Pair-1 (30 Jan 2016 and 02 Oct 2015), and 2.8 cm for Pair-2 (30 Jan 2016 and 20 Oct 2016).

TI  - CART and IDC - based classification of irrigated agricultural fields using multi-source satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand water productivity of crops cultivated in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, this study was conducted to generate a reliable crop type map using a multi-temporal satellite data (ASTER, Landsat-8 and MODIS) and crop phenology. Classification And Regression Tree (CART) and ISO-DATA Cluster (IDC) classification techniques were utilized for the identification of crops. The Ideal Crop Spectral Curves were generated and utilized for the formulation of CART decision rules. For IDC, the stacked images of the phenology-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were utilized for the classification. The overall accuracy of the classified maps of CART was 76, 77 and 81% for ASTER, MODIS and Landsat-8, respectively. For IDC, the accuracy was determined at 67, 63 and 60% for ASTER, MODIS and Landsat-8, respectively. The developed decision rules can be efficiently used for mapping of crop types for the same agro-climatic region of the study area.

TI  - Distribution and diversity of mosquitoes and the role of Aedes in the transmission of arboviruses in selected districts of Tanzania.
T2  - International Journal of Mosquito Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Arboviruses belong to various families of viruses that are transmitted by arthropods, mainly mosquitoes and often cause diseases in humans. The objective of this study was to determine mosquito diversity and transmission of arboviruses by Aedes in selected ecosystems in Tanzania. Adult mosquitoes were collected from rural and urban settings using carbon dioxide-baited CDC light traps, Biogent sentinel traps, and the Mosquito Magnet traps. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction assay was performed on pooled adult Aedes mosquitoes to detect the presence of Chikungunya, Dengue, Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Yellow fever (YF) viruses. A total of 42, 77 mosquitoes belonging to five genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia and Mimomyia) and 18 species were collected. Culex accounted for the largest (62.7%; n=2,682) proportion of the mosquitoes while Anopheles for the lowest proportion (5.7%; n=245). Of the total mosquitoes collected, Culex quinquefasciatus accounted for more than a half (53.4%; n=2692), followed by Aedes aegypti 12.1% (n=520). Of the 34 adult Ae. aegypti pools tested, arboviruses were detected in 33(97%) pools. Dengue virus was detected in 47.6% (10/21) pools which tested positive for Flaviruses. Chikungunya virus was detected in 30% (3/10) pools which were positive for Alphavirus genera. Of 2 pools tested positive for Bunyavirus genus, Rift Valley fever virus was detected in 1 pool (50%). The presence of various mosquito vectors and detection of arboviruses in aedes mosquitoes leave the population of Tanzania at great risk of transmission of different pathogens and highlight a need for vector control measures in the country.

AB  - Rain attenuation is the dominant impairment on terrestrial and microwave links, with attenuation growing significantly as the frequencies increase above 10 GHz to 100 GHz. The ITU-R rain fade models for terrestrial and Earthspace links require the one-minute rain rate exceeded for 0.01% of an average year, R0.01%, as a fundamental parameter. For locations without reliable long-term rainfall data, Rec ITU-R P. 837-7 provides a method for predicting one-minute rain rate distributions. This paper seeks to compare the one-minute rain rate distributions provided by Rec ITU-R P. 837-7 over the tropics with one-minute rain rate distributions derived from TRMM satellite data, and DBSG3 the propagation database of ITU-R Study Group 3.

T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The master's dissertation of prince Yevgeny Trubetskoy "Worldview of St. Augustine", which was written in 1891, became a notable event in Russian studies of Augustine. The aim of Trubetsoy was to carry out detailed and unbiased research and to draw a conclusion about the place and role of St. Augustine in the history of Western civilisation. The main point of his research is that St. Augustine should rather be regarded as the father of the "Latin idea" than father of the church in a broad sense. This is due to the fact that Augustine extremely strictly followed the judicial understanding of the evangelical doctrine and forceful arrangement of church life. Attentive reading of the disseration suggests that the main source of the core of Trubetskoy's conclusions were studies of his elder friend, Vladimir Solovyev. But the major interest in this case is that we can trace a parallelism between the inner evolution of St. Augustine (as it is refl ected in Trubetskoy's dissertation) and Solovyev, who at the end of the 1880s experienced fondness for Catholicism and was developing the idea of the reunion of the churches. The article also duscusses the hypothesis that this parallelism was not accidental but made up a signifi cant part of Trubetskoy's plan and back-infl uenced his reading of St. Augustine's texts.

The images were acquired by both aircraft and RPAS, equipped with a variety of sensors (such as multispectral, RGB, infrared, red-edge and thermal cameras), to serve as a source of information for archaeologists about the existence of unknown sites (hitherto not evidenced). The non-invasive character of remotely sensed data which brings important data on the buried archaeological features is valuable and, at the same time, more careful to archaeological heritage in contrast to traditional excavation methods.

TI  - Influence of historical land use and modern agricultural expansion on the spatial and ecological divergence of sugarcane borer, <i>Diatraea saccharalis</i> (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in Brazil
T2  - HEREDITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-mediated changes in landscapes can facilitate niche expansion and accelerate the adaptation of insect species. The interaction between the evolutionary history of the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius, and historical and modern agricultural activity in Brazil shaped its spatial genetic structure, facilitating ecological divergence and incipient host shifting. Based on microsatellite data, STRUCTURE analyses identified two (K = 2) and three (K = 3) significant genetic clusters that corresponded to: (a) a strong signal of spatial genetic structure and, (b) a cryptic signal of host differentiation. We inferred that K = 2 reflects the footprint of agricultural activity, such as expansion of crop production (sugarcane and maize), unintentional dispersion of pests, and management practices. In contrast, K = 3 indicated incipient host differentiation between larvae collected from sugarcane or maize. Our estimates of population size changes indicated that a historical bottleneck was associated with a reduction of sugarcane production approximate to 200 years ago. However, a more recent population expansion was detected (>1950s), associated with agricultural expansion of large crop production into previously unfarmed land. Partial Mantel tests supported our hypothesis of incipient host adaptation, and identified isolation-by-environment (e.g., host plant) in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, where sugarcane has been traditionally produced in Brazil. The impact of agricultural production on D. saccharalis may continue, as the current population structure may hinder the efficacy of refuge plants in delaying insect resistance evolution to Bt toxin.

TI  - Unplanned urban growth: land use/land cover change in the Guwahati Metropolitan Area, India
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned urban growth, particularly in developing countries has led to changes in land use/land cover (LULC). Numerous Indian cities face problems of unplanned LULC change due to nominal or non-existent planning efforts compounded by rapid urban population growth. The Guwahati Metropolitan Area (GMA) is one such urban centre. The present study assesses the trajectories of LULC change using Landsat imageries acquired in 1976, 1989, 2002 and 2015. Natural and semi natural vegetated area and artificial and natural water bodies decreased while built-up areas, cultivated and managed areas, and natural and semi natural non-vegetated areas increased. The built-up area increased from 23.9 in 1976 to 115.1km(2) in 2015 becoming the dominant land cover class accounting for 41.8% of the total geographical area. During this period, natural and semi natural vegetated land were reduced by 88.9km(2) at an annual rate of 2.2km(2). Over the years there was an increasing trend of built-up land and cultivated and managed areas in the peripheral areas of the city while natural and semi natural vegetated land diminished. Consequently, as in many other developing countries, there is an urgent need for the governmental authorities and other stakeholders to implement effective urban planning policies.

CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) aboard Landsat 9 will continue Landsat's four decade-long legacy of providing moderate resolution thermal imagery from low earth orbit (at 705 km) for environmental applications. Like the Thermal Infrared Sensor aboard Landsat 8, it is a pushbroom sensor with a cross-track field of view of 15 degrees and provides two spectral channels at 10.8 and 12 mu m. To ensure radiometric, spatial, and spectral performance, a comprehensive pre-launch testing program is being conducted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at the component, subsystem, and instrument level. This paper will focus on the results from the subsystem level testing where the instrument is almost completely assembled. This phase of testing is specifically designed to assess imaging performance including focus and stray light rejection, but is also used to provide a preliminary assessments of spatial and spectral performance. The calibration ground support equipment provides a flexible blackbody illumination source and optics to conduct these tests. The spectral response test setup has its own illumination source outside the chamber that propagates through the calibration ground support equipment in an optical configuration designed for this purpose. This test configuration with the calibration ground support equipment and TIRS-2 subsystem in the thermal vacuum chamber enables a large range of illumination angles for stray light measurements. The results show that TIRS-2 performance is expected to meet all of its performance requirements with few waivers and deviations.

TI  - Polio, terror and the immunological worldview
T2  - GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper adopts a socio-historical perspective to explore when, how and why the eradication of poliomyelitis has become politicised to the extent that health workers and security personnel are targeted in drive-by shootings. Discussions of the polio crisis in Afghanistan and Pakistan have tended to focus on Taliban suspicions of a US-led public health intervention and the denunciation of 'modernity' by Islamic 'extremists'. In contrast, this paper considers a broader history of indigenous hostility and resistance to colonial immunisation on the subcontinent, suggesting how interconnected public health and political crises today have reactivated the past and created a continuity between events. The paper explores how the biomedical threat posed by polio has become intertwined with military and governmental discourses premised on the 'preemptive strike'. Here, the paper tracks the connections between biological immunity and a postcolonial politics that posits an immunological rationale for politico-military interventions. The paper concludes by reflecting on the consequences for global public health of this entanglement of infectious disease with terror.

AB  - Predicting epidemic dynamics is of great value in understanding and controlling diffusion processes, such as infectious disease spread and information propagation. This task is intractable, especially when surveillance resources are very limited. To address the challenge, we study the problem of active surveillance, i.e., how to identify a small portion of system components as sentinels to effect monitoring, such that the epidemic dynamics of an entire system can be readily predicted from the partial data collected by such sentinels. We propose a novel measure, the gamma value, to identify the sentinels by modeling a sentinel network with row sparsity structure. We design a flexible group sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to mine the sentinel network suitable for handling both linear and non-linear dynamical systems by using the expectation maximization method and variational approximation. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed and empirically validated using both synthetic and real-world data.

AB  - This study proposed a remote sensing-based approach to quantify the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation dynamics and associated impact factors in typical karst regions of Southwest China. Google Earth engine (GEE), the world's most advanced geospatial data cloud computing platform, was employed to construct long time series satellite data set with 30 m resolution, composed of nearly 4,000 Landsat scenes from 1988 to 2016. Image preprocessing was also conducted on the GEE platform. The maximum value composite (MVC) method was used to produce annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the study areas. Annual maximum fractional vegetation cover (annFVC) was thus quantitatively estimated based on Dimidiate Pixel Model (DPM). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was adopted to identify the spatial patterns of the direction and rate of change in annFVC at a pixel scale. In addition, a terrain niche index (TNI) was used to investigate the influence of topographic factors on vegetation trends. Moreover, the relationships between annFVC and climatic factors were identified using correlation analysis. The results show that annFVC significantly increased at a rate of 0.0032/year in Nandong and 0.0041/year in Xiaojiang watershed for the period 1988-2016. Furthermore, 26.97% and 27.16% of pixels were found to undergo significant increase in terms of annFVC in Nandong and Xiaojiang, respectively. For both Nandong and Xiaojiang, decreasing vegetation trend was curbed with the increase of elevation and slope. Additionally, correlation analysis demonstrated that annFVC was more strongly and positively correlated with temperature than with precipitation in spite of insignificance.

TI  - Long-term afforestation efforts increase bird species diversity in Beijing, China
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bird communities are important components of biodiversity and provide terrestrial ecosystems with multiple functions. The impact of long-term afforestation and rapid urbanization on bird species diversity (BSD) is of interest and has attracted increasing attention from biologists, government officials and the public. This study focused on patterns of BSD and changes in forest coverage in an Asian mega-city (Beijing). Forest coverage in Beijing increased moderately from 1.3% (in 1949) to 21.26% (in 2003), and rapidly from 21.26% (in 2003) to 41% (in 2014). Natural types of land cover (i.e., woodland, grassland and water) increased from 55.25% (9070.29 km(2)) in 1985-63.41% (10411.16 km(2)) in 2013, while anthropogenic types (i.e., cultivated land, construction land and unutilized land) decreased from 44.75% to 36.59% based on remote sensing data. Three sets of BSD records were obtained from the published literature, revealing a species diversity of 344 in 1987, 375 in 1994, and 430 in 2014. Approximately 15% of bird species were endemic and 80% were migratory. From 1987-2014, Beijing gained 81 bird species (37 species disappeared while 118 species appeared), which could be a result of the progressive increase in forest coverage. The changes in BSD may be affected by long-term afforestation efforts and rapid urbanization, along with meteorological factors. This study sheds some light on the effects of afforestation and urbanization on biodiversity.

TI  - An improved phenology-based CASA model for estimating net primary production of forest in central China based on Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The optimum temperature (T-opt) in the current Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model was defined as the mean temperature of the month when normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) reaches its maximum. However, it requires improvements from a comprehensive perspective due to that the stability of the maximum NDVI acquisition is subjected to a variety of factors. The article proposed an improved CASA model by redefining the optimum temperature based on phenology (T-popt) to model the net primary production (NPP) of forest in Shennongjia, central China, and analysed the relationship between annual mean NPP and topography. Logistic function was used to model the phenological phases of forest and T-popt was redefined as the mean temperature during the period of maturity stability. The improved T-popt was lower than the T-opt for five forest types. Specifically, the average T-popt of evergreen broadleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous needleleaf forest, and mixed forest were 22.72 degrees C, 23.31 degrees C, 24.05 degrees C, 23.41 degrees C, and 23.18 degrees C, respectively, whereas the corresponding average T-opt were 24.42 degrees C, 24.90 degrees C, 24.54 degrees C, 24.57 degrees C, and 24.43 degrees C, respectively. The NPP observations transformed from field measured biomass were used to evaluate the accuracy of NPP estimated from the T-popt -based CASA model and the T-opt -based CASA model. The result indicated that the accuracy of the T-popt -based CASA model was higher than that of the T-opt -based CASA model, with the coefficients of determination of 0.837 (root mean square error (RMSE) = 75 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and 0.632 (RMSE = 122 g C m(-2) year(-1)), respectively. The total NPP of forest in Shennongjia modelled by the T-popt -based CASA model and the T-opt -based CASA model were 1.40 and 1.35 Tg C year(-1), respectively. The relationship between the annual mean NPP and altitude showed a quadratic polynomial function at the altitude from 500 to 3000 m, while the relationship between the annual mean NPP and aspect showed a sine function when aspect in the range of 4.5-360.0 degrees. The results demonstrate that the improvement of CASA model (T-popt-based CASA model) is of great significance in phenology and plays as a promising alternative method to model NPP for forest.

AB  - This study addresses the use of dual-polarimetric descriptors for ship detection and characterization from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Ship detection is usually performed independently on each polarization channel and the results are merged subsequently. We propose to extract polarimetric descriptors from the two polarization channels and to perform the vessel detection the vessels in this domain. Several polarimetric descriptors, such as those derived from the the Eigenvector-Eigenvalue decomposition, are employed for this purpose. A comparative assessment between the use of intensity images and polarimetric descriptors for the detection and identification of ships is then realized. The proposed methodology is tested on Sentinel-1 data acquired over the English channel. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data flows are considered as ground truth.

AB  - In this paper, with selected 16 Landsat images, we used RS and GIS technologies and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) method, to extract the surface water area of Changzhou, China, from 1986 to 2016. The spatio-temporal variation characteristics and trends of the surface water area in Changzhou City were analyzed during the past 30 years. Combined with the climate change and human activities in the same period, the main reasons for the temporal and spatial variation of surface water area were discussed. The results are as follows: The surface water area of Changzhou City had experienced a decline from 218.6 km(2) in 1986 to 187.4 km(2) in 1998, and had resumed to increase to 231.3 km(2) in 2010, and then decreased to 223.3 km(2) in 2016. The overall trend was divided into a shrinking-recovery-declining dynamic trend. The rapid development of economy and the construction of urbanization have led to the encroachment of the surface water area in the central urban; climate change and human activities have jointly led to the reduction of surface water area in Changzhou, in which human activities are the main factors.

TI  - Assessing spectral indices to estimate the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the vegetation canopy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) by the vegetation canopy (FPAR(canopy)) is an important parameter for vegetation productivity estimation using remote-sensing data. FPAR(canopy) is widely estimated using many different spectral vegetation indices (VIs), especially the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, there have been few studies into which VIs are most suitable for this estimation or into their sensitivities to the leaf area index and the observation geometry of remote-sensing data, which are very important for the accurate estimation of FPAR(canopy) based on the plant growth stage and satellite imagery. In this study, nine main VIs calculated from field-measured spectra were evaluated and it was found that the SR and NDVI underestimated and overestimated FPAR(canopy), respectively. It was also found that the enhanced vegetation index produced lesser errors and a higher agreement than other broadband VIs used to estimate FPAR(canopy). Among all the selected VIs, the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) turned out to have the lowest root mean square error of 0.17. The SR produced the highest errors (about 0.37) and lowest index of agreement (about 0.50) compared to the measured values of FPAR(canopy). Except for carotenoid reflectance index (CRI), FPAR(canopy) estimated by VIs are evidently sensitive to the leaf area index (LAI), especially for FPAR(canopy) (SR), which are also most sensitive to solar zenith angles (SZA). SR, CRI, PRI, and EVI have remarked variations with view zenith angles. Our study shows that FPAR(canopy) can be simply and accurately estimated using the most suitable VIs - i.e. EVI and PRI - with broadband and hyperspectral remote-sensing data, respectively, and that the nadir reflectance or nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function adjusted reflectance should be used to calculate these VIs.

AB  - Effective and dynamic recognition of winter wheat has important implications for the development of agriculture in In this paper, we proposed a method for winter wheat identification using particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) model and multi-temporal Sentinel-2A image. The eigenvector combination based on spectral information and the eigenvector combination based on texture information were constructed by using different phenological periods of winter wheat. The winter wheat was identified and extracted by PSO-SVM. The extraction accuracy under different feature band combinations was compared and analyzed. The results showed that PSO-SVM had higher accuracy than traditional SVM. Using PSO-SVM, the optimal combination was multi-temporal spectral and mean texture information combination and its classification accuracy was 91.25%. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the future use of Sentinel-2A data to extract other crop information.

AB  - This paper aims at investigating the use of microwave and optical images for the detection and characterization of fire scars in vegetated areas. To cope with this issue, Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and multispectral Sentinel-2 (S-2) multispectral data are used. First, a consolidated fuzzy-based methodology, specifically designed for retrieving burned areas, is considered. Then, an investigation based on the analysis of the maps of backscattering coefficients, as obtained by processing stacks of SAR images, is performed. The outcomes obtained with SAR data are validated by comparison with the results obtained with the optical multispectral data. Presented experiments are related to the Soberanes fires, California, which ignited on July 22, 2016, and affected more than 400 square kilometers. In addition, we explore the potential use of stacks of spatial coherence maps generated from pairs of complex-valued SAR images that encompass a fire event to recover new, additional information on the vegetation state and extent of the fire scars. To the purpose, stacks of S-1 SAR images acquired at different polarizations over the Mt. Vesuvius, Italy, in the 2017 summer season has been used. Some preliminary results, which evidence how the variations of the spatial coherence values can be somehow related to a fire and used to recover additional pieces of information, are presented.

AB  - Recently, a highway development is required as a liaison between regions to support the economic development of the regions. Even the availability of highways give positive impacts, it also has negative impacts, especially related to the changes of vegetated lands. This study aims to determine the change of vegetation coverage in Jagorawi corridor Jakarta-Bogor during 37 years, and to analyze landscape patterns in the corridor based on distance factor from Jakarta to Bogor. In this study, we used a long-series of Landsat images taken by Landsat 2 MSS (1978), Landsat 5 TM (1988, 1995, and 2005) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2015). Analysis of landscape metrics was conducted through patch analysis approach to determine the change of landscape patterns in the Jagorawi corridor Jakarta-Bogor. Several parameters of landscape metrics used are Number of Patches (NumP), Mean Patch Size (MPS), Mean Shape Index (MSI), and Edge Density (ED). These parameters can be used to provide information of structural elements of landscape, composition and spatial distribution in the corridor. The results indicated that vegetation coverage in the Jagorawi corridor Jakarta-Bogor decreased about 48% for 35 years. Moreover, NumP value increased and decreasing of MPS value as a means of higher fragmentation level occurs with patch size become smaller. Meanwhile, The increase in ED parameters indicates that vegetated land is damaged annually. MSI parameter shows a decrease in every year which means land degradation on vegetated land. This indicates that the declining value of MSI will have an impact on land degradation.

Comparisons of simulations made by the on-line coupled meteorological-chemistry model WRF-CHEM with MODIS, AERONET and in-situ observations result in a general agreement for the spatio-temporal variations of aerosol extinction at both local and regional scales. Simulated SSA reached elevated values between 0.88 and 0.96 along the visible/near-infrared in close agreement with AERONET inversions, suggesting the predominance of dust over Western Africa during this specific period. This predominance of dust is confirmed by in-situ measurements of the aerosol size distribution, fitting well with the aerosols size distribution simulated by WRF-CHEM. The impact of this large dust load on the radiative fluxes leads to large modifications of the shortwave and longwave radiative budget both at the ground and at the top of the atmosphere. In return, the response of the atmosphere to these dust-induced radiative changes is the alteration of the surface air temperature and wind fields, with non-negligible impact on the dust emission and transport.

AB  - The expansion of the Brazilian energy matrix foresees the sharing of renewable sources with 48% of the internal energy supply in the next 10 years, in accordance with the Brazilian commitments to the United Nations Paris agreement on climate change (NDC). Among the various alternatives for renewable sources stands out the solar, which experienced a national growth at more than 250% in the last two years. In order to support this robust growth and to provide a reliable source of solar data, the mapping of the Brazilian solar potential was carried out using a radiative transfer model adjusted for the tropical climate in Brazil and employing 17 years of satellite data.

AB  - The Ocean Color 2 (OC2), Ocean Color 3 (O C3) and Dall'Olmo three-band (TBDO) algorithms used for the estimation of the chlorophyll-a concentration [Chl-a] have been calibrated and validated for Sentinel-2 spectral bands. Measurements of in situ chlorophyll-a, radiometry and simulations with HydroLight have been used for this purpose within the Ecological Status of AQuatic Systems Satellites (ESAQS) Project to estimate water quality in aquatic systems in Spain.The results show that Sentinel-2 spectral bands are suitable for studying the chlorophyll-a concentration in inland waters. The TBDO algorithm have been applied to Sentinel-2 images and satisfactory results have been obtained in Albufera of Valencia region (Spain).

AB  - The work is devoted to the presentation of methodological issues of estimating the volumes of flaring of associated petroleum gas in oil fields by satellite images in the tasks of organizing operational monitoring of the ecological condition of oil producing territories. Using the official data on the total amount of burned associated gas in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug and the number of flares in this area, determined from the Landsat 8 satellite images, a regression model has been constructed that allows calculating the volume of gas combustion depending on the number of operating flares on territory. The analysis of the error of the developed model for estimating the volumes of gas combustion from the data on the number of flare units in the oil production area is analyzed. The model can be used in the tasks of satellite monitoring of volumes of combusted gas in the territory of oil production in the Tomsk region and other oil-producing regions.<bold> </bold>

AB  - Using the MODIS thematic products, the status of vegetation of oil producing areas in Western Siberia for the period 2010-2016 is monitored. An approach for estimating the impact of various factors on the ecology of oil producing areas using the NDVI coefficient and remote sensing data on the status of vegetation is proposed. The approach is tested within four technologically-disturbed lands four oil fields, Krapivinskoye, Myldzhenskoye, Luginetskoye, and Urmanskoye in Tomsk region. The territory of the Oglatsky Status Nature Reserve of regional importance is investigated as a reference area.<bold> </bold>

AB  - The One Environmental Health research approach, a subspecialty of the One Health initiative, focuses on toxic chemicals. Distinct disciplines work together to give a holistic perspective of a health concern through discrete disciplines, including, but not limited to, public health and the medical and veterinary sciences. In this article, we illustrate the concept of One Environmental Health with two case studies. One case study focuses on alligators and contributions to the field of endocrine disruption. The other case study focuses on whales and contributions to understanding carcinogenic metals. Both studies illustrate how the health of sentinel organisms has the potential to inform about the health of humans and the ecosystem.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to detect changes in satellite images taken from the same location at different timestamps. Different change detection methods are applied to multispectral satellite images taken with the Worldview-2 (WV-2) satellite, as well as to several of their feature indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference soil index (NDSI), non-homogeneous feature index (NHFD) and red-blue ratio (R/B). Besides, an additional image is used to remove temporary changes like vehicles, persons etc. The combination of changes is computed with a set of pixel-wise operations, and morphological filters are applied to improve the final change map. The combination of the satellite images with their feature indices proved to produce better results than computing the changes independently. This paper summarizes the methodology and presents the results obtained.

AB  - The present stage of development of linguistics is characterized by keen interest in comparative studying of languages. The problem of comparative studying of languages is a subject of linguistic researches in many works of domestic and foreign scientists. Article reveals features of realization of expressional syntax of the Tatar and French languages. Expressional offers of incomplete structure of the Tatar and French languages are specialized syntactic means and serve for realization of category of an emotional expression An integrated approach to studying of the syntactic units presented in different system languages in several aspects is represented relevant: substantial, structural, culturological within axiological approach and also from positions of linguistic and extralinguistic meanings that opens access to studying the way of worldview of representatives of different nationalities. The scientific novelty of a research is as well that in it the syntactic units of different structure languages functioning in different societies are for the first time studied in the comparative plan. The research showed existence of similar typological lines that, in turn, demonstrates a certain similarity of the Tatar and French languages belonging to various language families. The existing divergences are shown generally in the field of structure of the studied offers in the compared languages.

TI  - Modeling North Atlantic Nor'easters With Modern Wave Forecast Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three state-of-the-art operational wave forecast model systems are implemented on fine-resolution grids for the Northwest Atlantic. These models are: (1) a composite model system consisting of SWAN implemented within WAVEWATCHIII((R)) (the latter is hereafter, WW3) on a nested system of traditional structured grids, (2) an unstructured grid finite-volume wave model denoted SWAVE, using SWAN physics, and (3) an unstructured grid finite element wind wave model denoted as WWM (for wind wave model) which uses WW3 physics. Models are implemented on grid systems that include relatively large domains to capture the wave energy generated by the storms, as well as including fine-resolution nearshore regions of the southern Gulf of Maine with resolution on the scale of 25 m to simulate areas where inundation and coastal damage have occurred, due to the storms. Storm cases include three intense midlatitude cases: a spring Nor'easter storm in May 2005, the Patriot's Day storm in 2007, and the Boxing Day storm in 2010. Although these wave model systems have comparable overall properties in terms of their performance and skill, it is found that there are differences. Models that use more advanced physics, as presented in recent versions of WW3, tuned to regional characteristics, as in the Gulf of Maine and the Northwest Atlantic, can give enhanced results.

AB  - This study proposes a method to calibrate the semi-empirical CLAIR model, a simplified reflectance model used to estimate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) from optical data, using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager Surface Reflectance (OLISR) data over wheat cultivation areas.The procedure can be applied lacking both LAI field measurements and surface reflectance (SR) data by exploiting free of charge data, as the novel high-level Landsat8 OLISR and the Sentinel-2 LAI (S2 LAI) products. This last dataset was used as LAI reference at field size scale. Once calibrated, the model generates LAI information from OLISR data consistent with the S2 LAI. In this way it is possible merge the two products to obtain a finer temporal resolution LAI estimation during all the crop seasons.The method was tested and statistically assessed on three different wheat test fields located in the Capitanata area (Apulia region, Italy).

TI  - Crop Water Requirements estimation at irrigation district scale from remote sensing: a comparison between MODIS ET product and the Analytical Approach

CP  - 6th International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)
CL  - Paphos, CYPRUS
AB  - Remote sensing provides reliable information for the quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, essential for water management and irrigation scheduling. The ET represents the Crop Water Requirements (CWR) that must be provided by rainfall and/or irrigation to ensure the crop yield.During last decades different ET estimation methods were developed according to problem-specific requirements, characteristics of data input (e.g. data accuracy, availability and resolution) and temporal and spatial scale of interest. The selection of the best methodology has a great influence on the results of ET estimation. Generally, the comparison of ET estimated trough different methods is affected by many parameters: data input (different sources, typology, temporal and spatial resolutions), different scales of analysis (from field to global scale), contests, crop type and climate condition. For this reason, defining whether algorithm can capture spatial and temporal pattern of ET at the required accuracy is a significant challenge.In this study two different methods, both based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, were tested for ET trends estimation at irrigation district scale: the improved algorithm of the MODIS ET product (MYD16A2 V006) and the "Analytical Approach". While the MODIS product follows the energy balance method, the Analytical Approach exploits the single crop coefficient (Kc) approach proposed by the FAO in Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56. It combines agrometeorological data measured in situ and surface reflectance satellite derived data: the albedo (alpha) of the crop-soil surface and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). In order to compare the two ET trends, the satellite data input used in the present work were chosen from the MODIS products: MODIS LAI (MCD15A2H V006) and MODIS Albedo (MCD43A3 V006).The comparison was assessed in the study area of "Sinistra Ofanto" Irrigation district located in the Apulia Region (Italy) and characterized by an extremely heterogeneous and fragmented landscape.

TI  - THE IMAGE OF THE AUTHOR IN TATYANA TOLSTAYA'S BLOG
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of online journals and web diaries fostered the development of specific language environment in the blogosphere the writer's blog. The blog is a unique multifunction platform that enables creativity and self-expression and it is an effective tool of promoting the author's work and personality to potential readers. The main feature of the blog genre is its mediality and hypertextual principle of textual organization. This essay examines the specificity of author's image and its self-manifestations on the example of Tatyana Tolstaya's web diary. The theoretical part of article is devoted to the study of such concept as "the image of the author" in V.V. Vinogradov and M.M. Bakhtin's classical studies (the history of the term) and also in recent articles analyzing construction of the author's virtual identity in the blogosphere. Bearing on the comparative analysis of theoretical works, I argue that the term implies the reflection of the author's worldview at all the levels of the text (semantic, grammatical, structural, and ideological), however the full implementation of the "Image of the author" is impossible without the reader and her perception of the text. The practical part of the artide deals with Tolstaya's case comparing Tolstaya's image in her blog with her literary image. The structural and functional analysis of the online texts in her blog allows us to reconstruct the virtual identity of Tolstaya determined by her style of narration and authorial intention. The essay argues that Tolstaya's virtual image is a peculiar mixture of biography and literature: actual biographical facts merge with fiction, as a result of the mask she is putting on as a blog writer.

TI  - Quantification of Radiation Exposure of Non-Dominant Index for the Surgeon Performing Sentinel Lymph-Node Removal Procedure
T2  - CURRENT RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph-node scintigraphy is a useful method for accurate staging of different tumors and a helpful tool in personalized therapy for oncological patients. The radiation exposure for surgical staff has been a concern since the sentinel lymph-node detection method was developed.Objective: The objective of the study was to determine and quantify the exposure to radiation of the non-dominant index for the surgeon performing sentinel lymph-node removal and to determine, if there is an irradiation risk imposed during the surgical procedure.Method: We performed a study over a period of one year, where we evaluated the exposure of surgeon's non-dominant index during 196 sentinel lymph-node removal procedures. The pharmaceutical was administrated via subcutaneous injection in four peritumoral or perilesional injection sites. The equipment we used consisted of EuroProbe3 for sentinel lymph-node detection and ring TLD dosimeter placed on the surgeon's non-dominant index.Results: The clinical distribution was: 104 melanomas, 84 breast carcinomas, 6 vulvar carcinomas and 2 penial carcinomas. The administered activity showed an average of 39.55 MBq (SD +/- 1.96) Tc-99m nanoalbumin compound. The non-dominant index exposure ranged between 0.10 mSv and 0.13 mSv/month with a cumulative dose of 1.31 mSv/year, thus 6.69 Sv per procedure.Conclusion: The surgeon received a minimal dose for the non-dominant index. The values we recorded did not pose any additional concerns or restrictions, the exposure being under the limits and constraints established by regulations, close to the detectability limit of the dosimeter. The procedure is safe in terms of radiation protection, respecting the limitation and optimization principles.

AB  - Growing season temperature variability in Malawi (2016-2017) This raster structure data set depicts within-season land surface temperature variability trends in Malawi for the 2016-2017 growing season (November-April), categorized based on time-series observations from the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MOD11A2 V006). Outlier values were removed using Tukeys interquartile range algorithm and subsequently interpolated using inverse distance weighting. The classifications were generated using the Jenks natural breaks algorithm to identify areas of low, medium, or high temperatures (relative to observations under this spatiotemporal scale) and fluctuation in temperature over time (stable or variable). The resulting six classifications are low-stable (1), low-variable (2), medium-stable (3), medium-variable (4), high-stable (5), and high-variable (6). Data presented are masked to agricultural land.

TI  - Teaching belief systems in marketing classes: Preparing students for international stakeholder interactions
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN BUSINESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Marketing students need better grounding in understanding major worldviews of the twenty-first century, given nearly guaranteed, international interactions with stakeholders. As such, the purpose of this paper is to develop a pedagogy focused upon secular and religious worldviews that can be used effectively in the classroom.Design/methodology/approach A cross-cultural study using data from the USA and China examines current worldview understanding among business school students. A training session in worldviews is then conducted, and a follow-up study is used to assess worldview learning and further interest in learning more about worldviews.Findings Student understanding of worldviews is increased through a 1.5-h teaching session. Students' interest in learning more about worldviews significantly increased after the teaching session.Practical implications Worldview training is an effective way to prepare students for interacting with stakeholders in the increasingly global world in which these students will eventually work. Business schools need to incorporate worldview training in international marketing courses, at a minimum, or offer complete courses in worldviews and related applications to business operations.Originality/value Prior research has not tested worldview training on business students, especially when comparing student learning in a more religious-based culture (USA) and a more secular-based culture (China). Thus, this research shows that worldview training is effective regardless of the culture it is used in, which is important to informing students in a growing global marketplace.

CP  - 4th COMSYMBOL International Symposium on Believe in Technology - Mediatization of the Future and the Future of Mediatization
CL  - Aurel Vlaicu Univ, Arad, ROMANIA
AB  - Most of the research surveying the intriguing relationship between religion and technology is typically based on the traditional premise of non-overlapping magisteria (Gould, 1999), the complete separation of two in terms of the agency and telos. However, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate another perspective in which religion and technology could be perceived in a consubstantiation relation, meaning that the imagined presence of magic and sacred are emerging from the technological medium as a result of specific hieratic formulas and rituals. For this reason, we not are approaching the technology as a developmental mechanism to produce a technological society, but specifically as an explicit narrative employed to generate a certain worldview with the potential to become prescriptive. It is an attempt to understand the current conversation that revolves around the immanent capacity of the technological apparatus (Agamben, 2009) to generate either a utopian or a dystopian future with the help of the silicon machine. We are going to explore the mythological roots of the religion of technology (Noble, 1999), and its eschatological promise for a new transformative condition where a carbon-based individual might be very well superseded by a silicon constructed collective entity floating into a data-heaven. Because the inflation of information is generating obfuscation and redundancy, clarity as the new currency is the emerging power (Harari, 2018). This is why we are suggesting that only by understanding the metaphysical substratum of the technological machine we could pierce the fog of the mystification and really join the conversation within the same mythological paradigm, thus being able to participate somehow in the new advertised digital eschatology (Geraci, 2012).

M3  - Article
AB  - The article gives a brief overview of ancient and medieval programs that aimed to appropriate and transfer the legacy and scholarship from previous cultures. We consider the attitudes of Roman intellectuals towards the translation practices. The rendering of the authoritative works from Greek into Latin was not supposed to result in the exact communication of the contents and meaning of a foreign text by means of the Latin language and not the accurate reproduction of the original text, but the creation of a Latin equivalent that had to replace and even eliminate the original work. In this case, the "translation" was deliberately "adapted": it incorporated translator's commentaries and digressions of every kind; it also reflected the mentality and worldview of Roman readers. The practices of appropriating the legacy of the previous culture were formulated in terms of "capture", "military booty" and "expropriation". We observe in greater details the relevant arguments of Cicero, Horace, and Boethius and, with reference to the periods of cultural revival in the Middle Ages, excerpts from Alcuin, John Scottus Eriugena, and Heiric of Auxerre.

TI  - Methodology and results of integrated WNV surveillance programmes in Serbia
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.

AB  - In this work, the characterization and extraction of snowpack parameters from X-band SAR imagery is investigated.X-band is not yet the most suitable frequency for the retrieval of snow parameters, namely Snow Depth (SD) and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE); however, it is the higher frequency available in the existing SAR systems. Previous research demonstrated that retrieval of SD/SWE can be achieved at this frequency too for SWE > 100-150mm. A sensitivity analysis is carried out by exploiting datasets of in situ measurements (snow depth, density, snow grain radius, temperature and wetness) collected on two test sites in the Eastern Italian Alps: the Cordevole plateau (Dolomites) and the Ulten valley (South Tyrol). This analysis provides indications on the sensitivity of X band backscattering to the target snow parameters. As a second step of the analysis, simulations based on a forward electromagnetic model, namely the Dense Medium Radiative Transfer (DMRT), are considered for interpreting and assessing the experimental findings. Finally, an attempt of implementing a retrieval algorithm for estimating SWE from X-band data is carried out. The algorithm is based on machine learning approaches, namely Supported Vector Regressions (SVR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The training of both algorithms accounts for experimental data and DMRT model simulations. These algorithms are applied to time series of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) images collected on both test areas. The obtained results are encouraging, although more analysis and validation is needed for exploiting the potential of SAR X band in snow parameter retrieval.

T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of vegetation communities on floodplains within Kakadu National Park, in tropical northern Australia, is related to micro-topography and, therefore, water depth and duration of flooding. Floodplains of the Kakadu Region, because of their proximity to the coast, are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with saltwater intrusion, as a result of sea-level rise, being a serious risk. Our main objectives were to determine the variability of the distribution of plant communities on the floodplains and understand the potential risk of increased saltwater intrusion to these communities. We present data on the natural salinity-tolerance range of selected floodplain plants and discuss the likely effects of saltwater intrusion on floodplain plant distributions and productivity. The results of change analysis using high spatial-resolution satellite data showed the importance of the variation of water availability in determining patterns of plant communities. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests that sea level rises will result in 40% of the floodplain transformed into saline habitats by 2070. The most obvious effect of this would be the conversion of the freshwater vegetation to salt-tolerant mangroves and other salt-marsh plants, with a concomitant change in animals and their use of these areas.

TI  - Feature Profiles from Attribute Filtering for Classification of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a novel extension of morphological attribute profiles (APs) for classification of remote sensing data. In standard AP-based approaches, an input image is characterized by a set of filtered images achieved from the sequential application of attribute filters based on the image tree representation. Hence, only pixel values (i.e. gray levels) are employed to form the output profiles. In this paper, during the attribute filtering process, instead of outputting the gray levels, we propose to extract both statistical and geometrical features from the connected components (w.r.t. tree nodes) to build the so-called feature profiles (FPs). These features are expected to better characterize the object or region encoded by each connected component. They are then exploited to classify remote sensing images. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, supervised classification using the random forest classifier is conducted on the panchromatic Reykjavik image as well as the hyperspectral Pavia University data. Experimental results show the FPs provide a competitive performance compared against standard APs and thus constitute a promising alternative.

AB  - In this study, several georeferencing methods such as Polynomial, Thin Plate Spline (TPS) and geolocation transformations are applied on satellite images over Vietnam areas from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard Terra/Aqua satellites and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite. In comparison with global administrative areas data, the georeferenced images of TPS function have a better fitting than Polynomial function. In addition, the experimental results highlighted the effect of georeferencing methods on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in which TPS function produce a higher quality than Polynomial function on both MODIS Terra/Aqua and VIIRS AOD images. Validation results indicated strong correlation between AERONET AOD and TPS georeferenced images (R-2 = 0.739, 0.537 and 0.596 for MODIS Terra, MODIS Aqua and VIIRS AOD, respectively) meanwhile these correlations of Polynomial are lower (R-2 = 0.596, 0.443 and 0.475 for MODIS Terra, MODIS Aqua and VIIRS AOD, respectively). The correlations between MODIS AOD and VIIRS AOD images are also affected by georeferencing methods. The average of these correlations on TPS georeferenced images is 0.72 meanwhile mean correlation of Polynomial is 0.51. This study focused on the assessment of georeferencing methods and highlighted the effect of these methods on the quality and correlation of satellite AOD images.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In previous classification studies, three non-parametric classifiers, Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were reported as the foremost classifiers at producing high accuracies. However, only a few studies have compared the performances of these classifiers with different training sample sizes for the same remote sensing images, particularly the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI). In this study, we examined and compared the performances of the RF, kNN, and SVM classifiers for land use/cover classification using Sentinel-2 image data. An area of 30 x 30 km(2) within the Red River Delta of Vietnam with six land use/cover types was classified using 14 different training sample sizes, including balanced and imbalanced, from 50 to over 1250 pixels/class. All classification results showed a high overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 90% to 95%. Among the three classifiers and 14 sub-datasets, SVM produced the highest OA with the least sensitivity to the training sample sizes, followed consecutively by RF and kNN. In relation to the sample size, all three classifiers showed a similar and high OA (over 93.85%) when the training sample size was large enough, i.e., greater than 750 pixels/class or representing an area of approximately 0.25% of the total study area. The high accuracy was achieved with both imbalanced and balanced datasets.

AB  - The EUMETSAT Polar System - Second Generation (EPS-SG) Visible/Infrared Imaging mission supports the optical imagery user needs for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), Nowcasting (NWC) and climate in the timeframe beyond 2020. The VII mission is fulfilled by the METimage instrument, to be flown onboard the Metop-SG-A satellite series. The instrument itself is a cross-purpose medium resolution, multi-spectral optical imager, measuring radiation emitted and reflected by the Earth from a low-altitude sun synchronous orbit with a swath width of 2700 km. Measurements will be made in 20 spectral channels ranging from 443 nm in the visible up to 13.345 mu m in the thermal infrared at a spatial sampling distance of 500 m at nadir.This paper focuses on the Calibration and Validation (Cal/Val) activities planned for the METimage level 1B products to ensure that the calibrated and geolocated radiances meet the performance specifications for the lifetime of the mission. Such methods include cross-calibration with instruments on the same platform e.g. IASI-NG and Sentinel-5 measurements, inter-comparisons with other missions during simultaneous nadir overpasses, comparisons with ground based observations and lunar calibration. The level 1B product performance will be validated with respect to geometric, spectral, and radiometric requirements for all geographic regions including their seasonal variability. In particular the following specific activities are described:Calibration verificationValidation of radiometryGeometric verificationImage quality verificationAs the commissioning phase is limited in time, the products from METimage have to be confidence checked and validated with a concise focus on essential tests. The Ca/Nal activities will extend to routine operations in order to ensure long term stability of the calibrated radiances and continually improve the calibration throughout the lifetime of the mission.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are at increasing risk of thermal stress and recent work has shown that water temperature around seagrass meadows could be used as an indicator for seagrass condition. Satellite thermal data have not been linked to the thermal properties of seagrass meadows. This work assessed the covariation between 20 in situ average daily temperature logger measurement sites in tropical seagrass meadows and satellite derived daytime SST (sea surface temperature) from the daytime MODIS and Landsat sensors along the Great Barrier Reef coast in Australia. Statistically significant (R-2=0.787-0.939) positive covariations were found between in situ seagrass logger temperatures and MODIS SST temperature and Landsat sensor temperatures at all sites along the reef. The MODIS SST were consistently higher than in situ temperature at the majority of the sites, possibly due to the sensor's larger pixel size and location offset from field sites. Landsat thermal data were lower than field-measured SST, due to differences in measurement scales and times. When refined significantly and tested over larger areas, this approach could be used to monitor seagrass health over large (10(6)km(2)) areas in a similar manner to using satellite SST for predicting thermal stress for corals.

AB  - This study presents the potential of GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for the monitoring of water levels in the Mekong river delta (Vietnam). A geodetic GNSS station was installed at the Tran De port, Soc Trang province, over 23-30 August 2016. The method used to retrieve water levels from GNSS-R data is based on the Interference Pattern Technic of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). To validate our measurements, we used different radar altimetry data from Jason-2, SARAL, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A missions during the same period for measuring sea surface height (SSH) and in-situ tide gauge station as reference for both tides and floods. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performances GNSS-R, in complex environment, for monitoring at the same time river/tide stages and the possibility to use this technique for calibration/validation of altimetry data. Early results show the good agreement between in-situ gauge and GNSS-R based estimates with correlations which reach similar to 0.85.

AB  - Understanding where, when, and how conditions are changing along the extent of an energy pipeline system, which can be vast, is a challenging task. The challenge can be even greater when natural disasters' create a condition where access to affected pipelines, qualified personnel, and equipment is limited.To address these challenges, pipeline operators are working directly with experts in satellite technology to develop innovative applications incorporating the use of satellite technology and analytical processes to improve natural disaster monitoring and response. Through recent experiences following Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf Coast region of the United States in August-September 2017 and the wildfires and mudslides in Southern California that occurred in December 2017 to January 2018, space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data was shown to be a useful tool for wide area monitoring. Satellite-based SAR imagery has the unique advantage of penetrating through cloud cover and smoke and is capable of providing an early view of the extent of damage in both conditions.Satellite data and continuous improvements to their derived analytical products have resulted in significant benefits for pipeline operators preparing for and responding to the effects of potentially damaging natural processes, including river scour, erosion, avulsion, mudslides, and other threats to pipeline integrity and public safety. SAR change detection algorithms and processes can provide effective results in identifying areas affected by natural disasters that are not readily available by other means. These methods also provide timely information for allocating and directing resources to the most critical locations in support of post-disaster assessment and analysis. SAR satellite data and Amplitude Change Detection (ACD) algorithms provided the basis for confirming where flooding near pipeline infrastructure was most substantial following Hurricane Harvey. In the case of the Southern Californian forest fires and mudslides in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, recent investigations into ACD and Coherence Change Detection (CCD) algorithms showed promising results, providing a detailed view of damaged areas in near-real time.This paper describes the process of collecting, analyzing, and applying satellite data for assessing the impacts of natural disasters on pipeline infrastructure, and the methods applied, consisting primarily of multiple change detection algorithms, that are used to process the large volume of satellite archive images to extract relevant changes. This paper also describes how these tools and products were practically applied to support decisions by pipeline operators to protect and ensure the integrity and safety of pipelines in the affected areas.

AB  - A Neural Network approach to classify Sentinel-3 sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) pixels over polar regions is presented. The proposed approach is based on a careful preliminary analysis aimed to simulate SLSTR observation by means of MODIS data. The latter have been considered because of the long available time series and the quality of cloud mask products. A large set of MODIS AQUA and TERRA products has been applied to develop the training set of the Neural Network classificator that has been tuned to discriminate clear ocean, clouds and sea-ice surfaces on the scene.

TI  - Pansharpening of images acquired with color filter arrays
T2  - UNCONVENTIONAL OPTICAL IMAGING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Unconventional Optical Imaging
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In remote sensing, a common scenario involves the simultaneous acquisition of a panchromatic (PAN), a broad-band high spatial resolution image, and a multispectral (MS) image, which is composed of several spectral bands but at lower spatial resolution. The two sensors mounted on the same platform can be found in several very high spatial resolution optical remote sensing satellites for Earth observation (e.g., Quickbird, WorldView and SPOT)In this work we investigate an alternative acquisition strategy, which combines the information from both images into a single band image with the same number of pixels of the PAN. This operation allows to significantly reduce the burden of data downlink by achieving a fixed compression ratio of 1/(1+ b/rho(2)) compared to the conventional acquisition modes. Here, b and rho denote the amount of distinct bands in the MS image and the scale ratio between the PAN and MS, respectively (e.g.: b = rho = 4 as in many commercial high spatial resolution satellites). Many strategies can be conceived to generate such a compressed image from a given set of PAN and MS sources. A simple option, which will be presented here, is based on an application of the color filter array (CFA) theory. Specifically, the value of each pixel in the spatial support of the synthetic image is taken from the corresponding sample either in the PAN or in a given band of the MS upsampled to the size of the PAN. The choice is deterministic and done according to a custom mask. There are several works in the literature proposing various methods to construct masks which are able to preserve as much spectral content as possible for conventional RGB images. However, those results are not directly applicable to the case at hand, since it deals with i) images with different spatial resolution, ii) potentially more than three spectral bands and, iii) in general, different radiometric dynamics across bands. A tentative approach to address these issues is presented in this work.The compressed image resulting from the proposed acquisition strategy will be processed to generate an image featuring both the spatial resolution of the PAN and the spectral bands of the MS. This final product allows a direct comparison with the result of any standard pansharpening algorithm; the latter refers to a specific instance of data fusion (i.e., fusion of a PAN and MS image), which differs from our scenario since both sources are separately taken as input. In our setting, the fusion step performed at the ground segment will jointly involve a fusion and reconstruction problem (also known as demosaicing in the CFA literature). We propose to address this problem with a variational approach.We present in this work preliminary results related to the proposed scheme on real remote sensed images, tested over two different datasets acquired by the Quickbird and Geoeye-1 platforms, which show superior performances compared to applying a basic radiometric compression algorithm to both sources before performing a pansharpening protocol. The validation of the final products in both scenarios allows to visually and numerically appreciate the tradeoff between the compression of the source data and the quality loss suffered.

AB  - This work investigates the capability of Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technique to monitor the atmosphere. Changes in the Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) derived by InSAR are strictly related to changes in the atmosphere stratification and to the 2-D distribution of the water vapor columnar content. High spatial/temporal resolution APS maps provide by a SAR geosynchronous satellite (GEO-SAR) can be assimilated into limited area models (LAMs) for a better characterization of the local scale phenomena. As the observation of GEO-SAR are taken with high incidence angles, the path delay is measured along the slant direction (STD) and thus both the observation operator and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) products used for calibrating the APS must be considered along that direction. In this work, we compare the STD predicted by the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), and retrieved by a network of GNSS stations with the APS derived from Sentinel-1.

AB  - Measurements of soil moisture are needed for a better global understanding of the land surface-climate feedbacks at both the local and the global scale. Satellite sensors operating in the low frequency microwave spectrum (from 1 to 10 GHz) have proven to be suitable for soil moisture retrievals. These sensors now cover nearly 4 decades thus allowing for global multi-mission climate data records. In this paper, we assess the possibility of using L-band (SMOS) and C-band (AMSR2, ASCAT) remotely sensed soil moisture time series for the global estimation of soil moisture persistence. A multi-output Gaussian process regression model is applied to ensure spatio-temporal coverage of the satellite data sets. It allows a robust computation of temporal autocorrelation and e-folding times. Results over a selection of catchments reveals general agreement between the response of in-situ and satellite microwave observations to hydrological processes. The response of the uppermost-modeled soil moisture layer of GLDAS-1-Noah agrees well with that of the observations, whereas major differences are displayed by MERRA2 reanalysis. The temporal dynamics of the three microwave sensors are shown to be consistent, close to in-situ and to GLDAS-1-Noah, which supports their combination for the global estimation soil moisture persistence.

AB  - Remote sensing is the only feasible data source for distributed modelling of snow in mountain regions on medium to large scales, due to the limited access to these areas together with the lack of dense ground monitoring stations for snow variables. Observations worldwide identify snow cover persistence together with snowfall occurrence as the most affected variables by global warming. In Mediterranean regions, the spatiotemporal evolution of the snow cover can experiment quick changes that result in different accumulation-ablation cycles during the cold season. High frequency sensors are required to adequately monitor such shifts; however, for trend analyses, the Landsat time series constitute the only available source of data, being their frequency low for this regime, especially when cloudy conditions limit the available images. On the other hand, the MODIS daily series provide more than 15 years of continuous snow maps, despite the spatial resolution may pose a constraint in areas with abrupt topography; several approaches have been done to improve their spatial resolution from combining different information. This work presents a methodological approach to validate the improved MODIS daily snow cover maps from Notarnicola et al. (2013a, b), with 250 m spatial resolution, in Sierra Nevada (southern Spain), from a reference data set obtained by spectral mixture analyses of Landsat TM data by Pimentel et al. (2017b). This reference time series of fractional snow maps, with 30 m spatial resolution, were validated from high resolution local time series of snow maps obtained by terrestrial time-lapse cameras. The results show a significantly high correlation between the two snow map products both on a global and basin scales in the Sierra Nevada area. Selected areas and time periods are shown to address the convergence and divergence between both products and assess the development of a fusion algorithm to retrieve daily Landsat-resolution snow maps on a long term basis.

AB  - PURPOSE: In 2005, the Cervical Cancer Prevention Program in Zambia (CCPPZ) was implemented and has since provided cervical cancer screen-and-treat services to more than 500,000 women. By leveraging the successes and experiences of the CCPPZ, we intended to build capacity for the early detection and surgical treatment of breast cancer.METHODS: Our initiative sought to build capacity for breast cancer care through the (1) formation of a breast cancer advocacy alliance to raise awareness, (2) creation of resource-appropriate breast cancer care training curricula for mid- and high-level providers, and (3) implementation of early detection and treatment capacity within two major health care facilities.RESULTS: Six months after the completion of the initiative, the following outcomes were documented: Breast health education and clinical breast examination (CBE) services were successfully integrated into the service platforms of four CCPPZ clinics. Two new breast diagnostic centers were opened, which provided access to breast ultrasound, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, and needle aspiration. Breast health education and CBE were provided to 1,955 clients, 167 of whom were evaluated at the two diagnostic centers; 55 of those evaluated underwent core-needle biopsy, of which 17 were diagnosed with invasive cancer. Newly trained surgeons performed six sentinel lymph node mappings, eight sentinel lymph node dissections, and 10 breast conservation surgeries (lumpectomies).CONCLUSION: This initiative successfully established clinical services in Zambia that are critical for the early detection and surgical management of breast cancer.

TI  - Strong winds in a coupled wave-atmosphere model during a North Atlantic storm event: evaluation against observations
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong winds may be biased in atmospheric models. Here the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) coupled wave-atmosphere model is used (i) to evaluate strong winds against observations, and (ii) to test how alternative wind stress parametrizations could lead to a more accurate model. For the period of storms Kaat and Lilli (23-27 January 2014), we compared simulated winds with in situ-moored buoys and platforms-and satellite observations available from the North Atlantic. Five wind stress parametrizations were evaluated. The first result is that moderate simulated winds (5-20ms(-1)) match with all observations. However, for strong winds (above 20ms(-1)), mean differences appear, as much as -7ms(-1) at 30ms(-1). Significant differences also exist between observations, with buoys and Advanced Scatterometer ASCAT-KNMI generally showing lower wind speeds than the platforms and other remote-sensing data used in this study (AMSR2, ASCAT-RSS, WindSat, SMOS and JASON-2). Buoy and ASCAT-KNMI winds are likely to underestimate the real wind speed. It is difficult to conclude which dataset should be used as a reference. The second result is that common wave-age dependent parametrizations produce unrealistic drags and are not appropriate for coupling, whereas a newly empirically adjusted Charnock parametrization leads to higher winds compared to the default ECMWF parametrization. This proposed new parametrization may lead to more accurate results in an operational context.

TI  - Prediction of Topsoil Texture Through Regression Trees and Multiple Linear Regressions
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT: Users of soil survey products are mostly interested in understanding how soil properties vary in space and time. The aim of digital soil mapping (DSM) is to represent the spatial variability of soil properties quantitatively to support decision-making. The goal of this study is to evaluate DSM techniques (Regression Trees - RT and Multiple Linear Regressions - MLR) and the ability of these tools to predict mineral fraction content under a wide variability of landscapes. The study site was the entire Guapi-Macacu watershed (1,250.78 km2) in the state of Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast region of Brazil. Terrain attributes and remote sensing data (with 30 m of spatial resolution) were used to represent landscape co-variables selected as an input in predictive models in order to develop the explanatory variables. The selection of sampling sites was based on the Latin Hypercube algorithm. A representative set of one hundred points with feasible field access was chosen. Different input databases were tested for prediction of mineral fraction content (harmonized and original data). The Spline algorithm was used to harmonize data according to the GlobalSoil. Net consortium standards. The results showed better performance from the RT models, using input from an average of six covariates; the simplest MLR model used twice as many input variables, creating more complex models without gaining precision. Furthermore, better R2 values were obtained using RT models, irrespective of harmonization of soil data. The harmonized dataset from the 0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.15 m layers, in general, presented better results for the clay and silt, with R2 values of 0.52 (0.00-0.05 m) and 0.69 (0.05-0.15 m), respectively. Prediction of sand content showed better results when the original depth data was used as an input, although all regression tree models had R2 values greater than 0.52. The RT models provided a better statistical index than MLR for all predicted properties; however, the variance between models suggests similarity of performance. Regarding harmonization of soil data, both input databases (harmonized or not) can be used to predict soil properties, since the variance of model performance was low and generalization of the soil maps showed similar trends. The products obtained from the digital soil mapping approach make it possible to integrate the factor of uncertainties, providing easier interpretation for soil management and land use decisions.

TI  - Measuring the effects of bivalve mariculture on water quality in northern New Zealand using 15 years of MODIS-Aqua satellite observations
T2  - AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates that satellite information can be used to quantify the effect of a large coastal mussel farm on water quality. Our study focussed on a 1400 ha area of maricultured green-lipped mussels Perna canaliculus in the Firth of Thames in northern New Zealand. Observations by NASA's MODIS-Aqua sensor were used to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll a (chl a, as a proxy for phytoplankton), turbidity and sea surface temperature at 500 m resolution. We used approximately 890 single-pass satellite images, each with <50% cloud cover, spanning 2002 to 2017. For each image, the area over the mussel farm was removed and then filled in using kriging with parameters derived from semivariogram analysis of each individual image using linear and exponential models. Three control areas were used to test whether the differences between the kriged data and the observed data in the farm area were significant. We found that, over the 15 yr of the observation, the farm had a significant effect on chl a of -1.6% (reduction) averaged over an area of 1.5 times the area of the farm itself. No significant effect of the farm on turbidity was detected. The farm caused a seasonal pattern of winter warming (+0.03 degrees C) and summer cooling (-0.11 degrees C). The method described here could potentially be applied to other satellite data and other large (multi-kilometre) mariculture facilities to observe their effects on water quality.

TI  - SBAF for Cross-Calibration of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI over North African PICS
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Accurate radiometric cross calibration is critical for guaranteeing the consistency of measurements from different Earth observation sensors, and fully using the combined data in quantitative applications. It becomes even more indispensable with the rapid increase of remote sensing data availability from numerous sensors. The assessment of the Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) is a key component of the cross-calibration method. The SBAF compensates for intrinsic differences in sensor response caused by Spectral Response Function (SRF) mismatches. Currently, Sentinel and Landsat data represent the most widely accessible medium spatial resolution multispectral satellite data. Hence, in this study, the SBAF of the Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2 and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on-board Landsat-8 was estimated over pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS) located in North Africa. The SBAF depends on the hyperspectral profile of the target and the sensor SRF. Here, the hyperspectral profile was derived from the Hyperion hyperspectral imager on-board the EO-1. Finally, it is important to highlight that an estimate of the SBAF is incomplete unless accompanied with its uncertainty. The uncertainty analysis of the SBAF was implemented using Monte Carlo simulation. The results obtained in this study can be utilized by any user who needs the SBAF of the OLI and MS1 over North Africa Desert sites.

TI  - Monitoring Water Surface and Level of a Reservoir Using Different Remote Sensing Approaches and Comparison with Dam Displacements Evaluated <i>via</i> GNSS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing allowed monitoring the reservoir water level by estimating its surface extension. Surface extension has been estimated using different approaches, employing both optical (Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-Off, Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS and ASTER images) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (Cosmo SkyMed and TerraSAR-X). Images were characterized by different acquisition modes, geometric and spectral resolutions, allowing the evaluation of alternative and/or complementary techniques. For each kind of image, two techniques have been tested: The first based on an unsupervised classification and suitable to automate the process, the second based on visual matching with contour lines with the aim of fully exploiting the dataset. Their performances were evaluated by comparison with water levels measured in situ (r(2) = 0.97 using the unsupervised classification, r(2) = 0.95 using visual matching) demonstrating that both techniques are suitable to quantify reservoir surface extension. However similar to 90% of available images were analyzed using the visual matching method, and just 37 images out of 58 using the other method. The evaluation of the water level from the water surface, using both techniques, could be easily extended to un-gauged reservoirs to manage the variations of the levels during normal operation. In addition, during the period of investigation, the use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) allowed the estimation of dam displacements. The advantage of using as reference a GNSS permanent station positioned relatively far from the dam, allowed the exclusion of any interaction with the site deformations. By comparing results from both techniques, relationships between the orthogonal displacement component via GNSS, estimated water levels via remote sensing and in situ measurements were investigated. During periods of changing water level (April 2011-September 2011 and October 2011-March 2012), the moving average of displacement time series (middle section on the dam crest) shows a range of variability of +/- 2 mm. The dam deformation versus reservoir water level behavior differs during the reservoir emptying and filling periods indicating a hysteresis-kind loop.

AB  - Monitoring dam displacements using different techniques allows an evaluation of their structural behaviour over time. In this study, dam displacements (for the Castello dam, Agrigento, Italy) have been investigated using different Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques exploiting a freely available dataset from the EU Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR built by the European Space Agency (ESA). The dataset includes Sentinel 1A (S1A) images acquired in dual-polarization and Interferometric Wide (IW) swath using the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR) mode. Three main Multi-Baseline Construction methods based on the identification of Persistent Scatterers (PS) have been tested, within a scene including an extra-urban area surrounding the dam. The evaluation of the best strategy is carried out over few images (7) with a constant acquisition time-span of 12 days, except for the first image, acquired 24 days before the next one. Three different multi-baseline construction methods have been investigated in this preliminary research to test the capability of these InSAR techniques in finding a time series of displacements with high accuracy in extra-urban areas also. The star graph results in displacement appear to be more in agreement with GNSS measurements than other techniques.

AB  - Clumping index (CI) is a measure of foliage aggregation relative to a random distribution of leaves in space. The CI can help with estimating fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves for a given value of leaf area index (LAI). Both the CI and LAI can be obtained from global Earth Observing (EO) systems such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Here, the compatibility between CI and LAI products derived from EO data is examined independently using the theory of spectral invariants, also referred to as photon recollision probability theory (i.e. 'p-theory'), along with raw LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer data from 75 sites distributed across a range of plant functional types (PFTs). The p-theory describes the probability (p-value) that a photon, having intercepted an element in the canopy, will recollide with another canopy element rather than escape the canopy. Our results indicate that the integration of empirically-based CI maps with the MODIS LAI product is feasible, providing a potential means to improve the accuracy of LAI EO data products. Given the strong results for the large range of PFTs explored here, we demonstrate the capacity to obtain p-values for any location solely from EO data. This is relevant for future applications of the photon recollision probability concept for global and local monitoring of vegetation using EO data.

TI  - Development of a modified bare soil and urban index for Landsat 8 satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of urban area has always been a challenging task due to its similar spectral characteristics with bare soil. The spectral characteristics of urban and bare soil being similar, causes confusion and misclassification among themselves. A new modified normalized difference soil index (MNDSI) has been proposed using PAN and Band 7 of Landsat 8. PAN band of Landsat 8 provides increased contrast between vegetation and land areas without vegetation. Subsequently, MNDSI was used to develop a new normalized ratio urban index (NRUI) by enhancing the capability of biophysical composition index (BCI) in two stages. First, a ratio urban index (RUI) was developed which discriminates urban and soil better than BCI. Second, RUI was further enhanced, subsequently known as NRUI, which is able to discriminate urban area from soil even better than RUI. MNDSI and NRUI show a good discrimination between soil and urban and may be useful for such purposes.

TI  - PREVENTIVE ARCHEOLOGY IN PONTELATONE (CE): NEW DATA ON THE INSIDE DYNAMICS IN THE NEXT OF THE VOLTURNO RIVER
T2  - ARCHEOLOGIA E CALCOLATORI
M3  - Article
AB  - The research project, carried out as part of the preliminary planning for the environmental requalification of the Barignano area (Pontelatone, CE), consists in a multidisciplinary application model for the best practice of preventive archaeology. The project started thanks to a recent agreement between the Municipality of Pontelatone (CE) and the Institute for Technologies Applied to Cultural Heritage (ITABC) of the Italian CNR, encharged of drawing up an archaeological map of the territory of Barignano and the surrounding territory. Recent surveys increased the knowledge about the exploitation of the Pontelatone district since prehistoric times and defined a more articulated settlement model of the perifluvial part of the territory, providing it with a different economic position in the ancient world. Research data, confronted with geographically and historically comparable areas, propose a new territorial and economic development model for the areas located on the Volturno river, both in Roman and in earlier periods. Starting from archive research and published scientific literature, the survey was supported by remote sensing data and new software to map land markers - both historical and archaeological - and for their 3D representation. The dataset have been organized in different topics and informative layers on a GIS platform. The survey and the interpretation of remote sensing data provided new elements for the topography of the area. Traces that suggest a different environmental model for some regions of the Volturno plain have been identified. Furthermore, today's research supported by targeted geophysical surveys represents an actual prospect for future research.

T2  - SURANAREE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion and soil salinity are major environmental problems in Thailand because they create seriously negative impacts on agricultural and environmental sustainability. In addition, soil erosion leads to the depletion of organic matter in soil. In the meantime, soil erosion, salinity, and organic matter depletion are significant indicators for a soil degradation assessment. The main objectives of the study were (1) to classify land use and land cover, (2) to assess soil loss and its severity, (3) to assess soil salinity and its severity, (4) to assess soil organic matter and its depletion, and (5) to assess soil degradation and its severity. In this study, the LULC classification using the decision tree classifier, soil erosion with the RMMF model, soil salinity and depletion of organic matter content with linear and non-linear regression analysis were firstly analyzed separately and their results then were combined to evaluate soil degradation using the multiplication method. For the results, an optimum CART model, which applied blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR-1, SWIR-2 bands, wetness index, and elevation to construct a decision tree for LULC classification from Landsat 8 images and DEM, provided an overall accuracy at 87.50% and a Kappa hat coefficient at 80.10%. Meanwhile, the average erosion rate in the study area was 3.37 ton/ha/year. The most dominant soil erosion severity class was very slightly eroded (<6.25 ton/ha/year) and it covered an area of 437.70 km(2) or about 94.14% of the total study area. In the meantime, the most dominant soil salinity severity class was very low and covered an area of 415.55 km(2) or about 89.37% of the total study area. At the same time, the dominant soil biological degradation class was moderate and covered an area of 296.05 km(2) or 63.67% of the total study area. According to the soil degradation assessment using the multiplicative method, the most dominant soil degradation class was very low and covered area of 443.00 km(2) or 95.28% of the total study area. These findings implied that a serious problem of soil degradation did not exist in the study area. In conclusion, it appeared that geoinformatics technology can be efficiently used as a tool to assess soil loss, soil salinity, and soil organic matter depletion and their severities for a soil degradation assessment.

TI  - Hierarchical Bayesian models for small area estimation of forest variables using LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data have become almost ubiquitous as a remote sensing tool in forestry estimation and mapping applications. Such initiatives commonly rely on spatially aligned forest inventory plot measurements and LiDAR covariates to inform model-based estimators for small area estimation. There are many examples where such linking models provide the desired accuracy and precision of forest parameter estimates for small areas where paucity of inventory plot observations preclude design-based inference. This paper builds on previous small area estimation (SAE) work by linking LiDAR covariates with variable radius forest inventory plot measurements within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Using this framework, we compare SAE of forest aboveground biomass using: i) Fay-Herriot (FH); ii) FH with conditional autoregressive random effects (FHCAR); and ill) FHCAR with smoothed sampling variance (FHCAR-SMOOTH) models. Candidate models and the direct estimate based on plot measurements alone were compared using coefficient of variation (CV). On average, the FH model reduced the CV by 52.3% compared to the direct estimate. Incorporating spatial structure via the FHCAR model reduced the CV by 56.9% and 10.8% relative to the direct and the FH model estimates, respectively. Overall, these results illustrate the applicability and utility of using a SAE framework for linking LiDAR with typical forest inventory data.

AB  - Fire is both a natural disturbance regime and a threat to infrastructure, forestry and human lives. Satellite remote sensing offers a fast and efficient way to reliably estimate the burnt area. In most cases, optical satellite data are used for burn scar detection. Nevertheless, smoke, clouds or rain can decrease the quality of classification. In these cases, SAR data can be a good alternative. Using quad-polarized SAR data, the backscatter can be decomposed into different scattering mechanisms, describing the scatterer more precisely. Here, we will present the possibilities and limitations of using quad-polarimetric ALOS-2 data for burnt area mapping using an object-based image analysis approach based on change-detection. As a case study the big fire event which affected Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada in May/June 2016 was investigated.

AB  - Spatio-temporal estimation of the erosion of arable soils is still an urgent task, in spite of the numerous methods of such assessments. Development of information technologies, the emergence of high and ultra-high resolution images allows reliable identification of linear forms of erosion to determine its dynamics on arable land. The study drew attention to the dynamics of the most active erosion unit - an ephemeral gully. The estimation of the dynamics was carried out on the basis of different space images for the maximum possible period (from 1986 to 2016). The cartographic method was used as the main research method. Identification of a belt of ephemeral gully erosion based on materials of multi-zone space surveys and GIS-technology of their processing was carried out. In the course of work with satellite imagery and subsequent verification of the received data on the ground, the main signs of deciphering the ephemeral gully network were determined. A methodology for geoinformation mapping of the dynamics of ephemeral gully erosion belt was developed and a system of indicators quantitatively characterizing its development on arable slopes was proposed. The evaluation of the current ephemeral gully network based on the interpretation of space images includes the definition of such indicators of ephemeral gully erosion as the density of the ephemeral gully net, the density of the ephemeral gullies, the area and linear dynamics of the ephemeral gully network. Preliminary results of the assessment of the dynamics of the belt erosion showed an increase in all quantitative indicators of ephemeral gully erosion for the observed period.

T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of reflection in the poetic text of the individual author's language worldview through a conceptual metaphor. The aim of the study is to analyze the development of thought patterns in the poetry of Joseph Brod-sky, the subject of study is the metaphorical representation of the concepts MEMORY and LANGUAGE in the cycle of Joseph Brodsky's poems "Part of Speech". The cognitive metaphorical models that represent one of the key concepts in the structure of the individual author's language worldview are described with the method of frame analysis. As a result of the research, conclusions on the development of thought images associated with these concepts and their perception in the analyzed work were obtained. It was found that the dynamics of the metaphorical projection of the concepts MEMORY and LANGUAGE in the cycle of Joseph Brodsky's poems "Part of Speech" corresponds to the dynamics of the whole work, as well as to the general way of development of the poetics of the author, which can be conditionally designated as the path "from romanticism to rationalism". The conclusions obtained as a result of the research can be applied in the work on translations of Joseph Brodsky's works, in philological studies aimed at conceptual content of the work analysis, as well as in studying the metaphorical representation of the MEMORY and LANGUAGE concepts in other works of the author.

TI  - To the question of typology of space in the Nenets heroic epos (habitat)
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the structural-typological analysis of the heroic epos of any nation, on the one hand, is important for folklore studies with the discovery of textual patterns, both in a given people and in their neighbors. On the other hand, it is a valuable ethnological source on the peculiarities of the worldview, the mechanism of thinking, the system of values and behavior patterns. Nenets traditional culture is based on a nomadic way of life. In the geographical space occupied by the Nenets, as a rule, settlements and towns are on the periphery of the Nenets settlement; there are few of them and they belong to the peoples adjacent to the Nenets. Therefore, in the Nenets heroic epic, with rare exceptions space is completely occupied by nomadic reindeer herders, where the awareness of " one-to-other " is differ from sedentary cultures. The task of the research is the identification of functional and descriptive textual universals of the perception of space.Objective: to make a structural and typological analysis of the Nenets heroic songs, concerning the imagery of human habitats from concrete to abstract in the search for certain patterns and explanation of their semantic content.Research materials: published texts of Nenets heroic songs in the amount of 50 works.Results and scientific novelty: for the first time a structural and typological analysis of the Nenets heroic songs was made. It is given in relation to one of the types of descriptive elements which accompany a plot. Certain patterns were found in the texts of the Nenets heroic songs in relation to specific descriptions of habitats in the general structure (beginning - plot - final) and their independence from the character of the heroes (positive or negative); in relation to abstract descriptions we found the worldview notions which are still not described as well as their relation to the heroic epos as a folklore genre.

TI  - Blogging about Climate Change in Russia: Activism, Scepticism and Conspiracies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the new media's role in climate change communication in Russia. By providing an open space for the expression of very diverse points of view, the internet creates a substitute media reality where both climate activists and climate sceptics can question the established discourse. Analysis of 374 entries published on the LiveJournal blogging platform has resulted in the identification of four discursive categories: "conspiracies of climate change," "climate change impact," "political games of climate change" and "online (anti-)environmentalism." Each category demonstrates how the same topic can be framed in very different ways depending on bloggers' worldview rather than the nature of the discussed environmental problem. The findings also show that the blogs act as "echo-chambers" for both climate deniers and climate activists reinforcing their behold beliefs. Finally, the analysis discovers some parallels with the traditional media coverage in their minimal critique of Russian state policy on climate.

TI  - Comparison of estimators and feature selection procedures in forest inventory based on airborne laser scanning and digital aerial imagery
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital maps of forest resources are a crucial factor in successful forestry applications. Since manual measurement of this data on large areas is infeasible, maps must be constructed using a sample field data set and a prediction model constructed from remote sensing materials, of which airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and aerial images are currently widely used in management planning inventories. ALS data is suitable for the prediction of variables related to the size and volume of trees, whereas optical imagery helps in improving distinction between tree species. We studied the prediction of forest attributes using field data from National Forest Inventory complemented with ad hoc field plots in combination with ALS and aerial imagery data in Aland province, Finland. We applied feature selection with genetic algorithm and greedy forward selection and compared multiple linear and nonlinear estimators. Maximally around 40 features from a total of 154 were required to achieve the best prediction performances. Tree height was predicted with normalized root mean squared error value of 0.1 and tree volume with a value around 0.25. Predicting the volumes of spruce and broadleaved trees was the most challenging due to small proportions of these tree species in the study area.

T2  - Gynecologic oncology research and practice
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gynaecological cancers may be the sentinel malignancy in women who carry a mutation in BRCA1 or 2, a mis-match repair gene causing Lynch Syndrome or other genes. Despite published guidelines for referral to a genetics service, a substantial number of women do not attend for the recommended genetic assessment. The study aims to determine the outcomes of systematic follow-up of patients diagnosed with ovarian or endometrial cancer from Gynaecologic-oncology multidisciplinary meetings who were deemed appropriate for genetics assessment.METHODS: Women newly diagnosed with gynaecological cancer at the Royal Hospital for Women between 2010 and 2014 (cohort1) and 2015-2016 (cohort 2) who were identified as suitable for genetics assessment were checked against the New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory genetic database. The doctors of non-attenders were contacted regarding suitability for re-referral, and patients who were still suitable for genetics assessment were contacted by mail. Attendance was again checked against the genetics database.RESULTS: Among 462 patients in cohort 1, flagged for genetic assessment, 167 had not consulted a genetic service at initial audit conducted in 2014. 86 (18.6%) women whose referral was pending clarification of family history and/or immunohistochemistry did not require further genetic assessment. Letters were sent to 40 women. 7 women (1.5%) attended hereditary cancer clinic in the following 6months.The audit conducted in 2016 identified 148 patients (cohort 2) appropriate for genetic assessment at diagnosis. 66 (44.6%) had been seen by a genetics service, 51 (34.5%) whose referral was pending additional information did not require further genetic assessment. Letters were sent to 15 women, of whom 9 (6.1%) attended genetics within 6months.CONCLUSIONS: To improve the effectiveness of guidelines for the genetic referral of women newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer, clinicians need to obtain a thorough family history at diagnosis; arrange for reflex MMR IHC according to guidelines; offer BRCA or panel testing to all women with non-mucinous ovarian cancer prior to discharge and systematically follow up all women referred to genetics at the post-op visit.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the entry of the peoples of the North Caucasus into the Russian socio-cultural space on the basis of the entry of the region into the Russian Empire. In the research the authors focus their attention on the issues of implementing such socio-cultural activity as charity within the mentioned process. Being traditional phenomena for worldview bases and cultural practices of the peoples of the North Caucasus that joined the Russian Empire and the peoples of the Russian Empire itself, encouragement for doing good and charity as such became significant factors contributing to peoples' cultural rapprochement. This is confirmed by the analysis of specific historical data, facts of creating charity communities and diverse charity activities in Terek Oblast in particular, covering the second half of XIXth - early XXth centuries, that is presented in the article. At the same time the authors primarily consider the process of public care of the development of education in the region and the substitution of the efforts of the state that were organised into charity communities by society in the sphere of concern for socially disadvantaged groups of the region's population.

AB  - Relevance of the research is caused by the need to determine the kind of law of lake size-distribution for modeling and predicting the dynamics of thermokarst lakes fields and methane reserves in them in vast areas of the Arctic and subarctic zones in Siberia and other regions of the world.The main aim of the research is to determine the kind of law of thermokarst lake size-distribution in the cryolithozone of Western Siberia in a wide range of their sizes on the basis of a synthesized histogram of lake distributions obtained from medium and high-resolution space images.Methods: remote methods of studying the fields of thermokarst lakes using satellite imagery; method of test (key) sites; method for determining zones of active thermokarst from satellite imagery; methods of geoinformation systems for spatial analysis of data on thermokarst lakes derived from satellite imagery; statistical methods in determining the kind of distribution law of random variables from empirical data using the Pearson criterion.Results. The paper considers briefly the methodological issues of synthesizing two histograms of the lake size-distribution, one of which is obtained from mid-resolution space images, another one - from high-resolution imagery on a limited set of test sites in the study area. The authors have used the images of the average resolution of LandSat-8 and high-resolution images of Canopus-V, BKA and Alos to construct histograms. Remote studies on high resolution images were carried out on 66 test sites, located fairly evenly in the territory of the cryolithozone of Western Siberia. As a result, the authors obtained the synthesized histogram of lake size-distribution in a very wide range of their sizes from 50 m(2) to 20000 hectares. Statistical analysis showed that the empirical distribution of lakes by area, according to the Pearson criterion, corresponds to the lognormal distribution law. The authors determined the parameters of the lognormal law of lake areas distribution by empirical data.

T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus and nitrogen are key nutrients that affect abundance and growth of aquatic primary producers but cannot be directly remotely sensed as their dissolved or organic forms do not interact with the remote sensing signal. In addition, other lake water quality variables such as chlorophyll a and Secchi disk depth, have been previously successfully estimated with remote sensing, but the retrieval algorithms are site-, season-, and/or scene-specific. Such algorithms do not take into account lake typological features, which can affect the sensitivity of lake to change, or catchment characteristics, for example, land cover that is a major driver of lake water quality change. Here we propose a novel approach that utilises remotely sensed land cover information in the catchment to estimate phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations in lake waters. We use land cover type-specific nutrient export coefficients and the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Cover Type product showing that nutrient loading based on remote sensing can explain up to 75% of variability in lake nutrient concentrations and 58% of variability in lake chlorophyll a concentrations. In addition, we show that land cover information, supplemented by satellite measurements and lake morphometry data are good predictors of chlorophyll a (R-2 = 0.77) and Secchi disk depth (R-2 = 0.87) in lakes with different trophic statuses and in different months and years.

AB  - This work shows the strength of combining different data sources and modelling to generate long time map series of snow variables in Sierra Nevada (Spain), an alpine environment within a semiarid region in which the snowpack variability is greatly enhanced by the topographic gradients and the sea influence. Different control areas monitored by time-lapse terrestrial cameras validate a spectral mixture algorithm on Landsat TM data to derive snow cover fraction maps in the study site. These maps are the basis to calibrate an energy balance snow model on a distributed scale, from which long-term series of snow cover fraction and snow water equivalent maps are finally obtained. The results prove this methodological approach to be efficient to overpass to some extent the individual limitations of each data source/model, and generate distributed variables relevant for water resource assessment in these regions.

AB  - The aim of the study was to characterise the occurrence of hot days and heat waves in Pozna in the 1966-2015 period, as well as to describe the thermal conditions in the city during selected heat waves between 2008 and 2015. The basis of the study was the daily maximum and minimum air temperature values for Pozna-awica station from 1966-2015 and the daily values of air temperature from eight measuring points located in the city in various land types from 2008 to 2015. A hot day was defined as a day with T-max above the 95th annual percentile (from 1966 to 2015), while a heat wave was assumed to be at least five consecutive hot days. The research study conducted shows the increase of T-max, number of hot days and frequency of heat waves in Pozna over the last 50 years. Across the area of the city (differentiation of urban area types according to Urban Atlas 2012), there was a great diversity of thermal conditions during the heat waves analysed.

M3  - Article
AB  - Changes that occurred in Europe during the transition to the Modern Era had a strong impact on theology. The author of this paper accepts the definition of Modernity given by J. Habermas and demonstrates how theology in the 16th century was influenced by the three "threshold events of Modernity" identified by the German philosopher, namely the discovery of the New World, the Renaissance and the Reformation. One of the consequences of geographical discoveries was the acceleration of the process of secularisation and the formation of a new vision of goals and tasks of theology and its place among other scientific disciplines. The main features of the Renaissance relevant to theology were the anthropocentric worldview that replaced the theocentric worldview as well as the emergence of historical consciousness. The rise of classical philology and the new attitude towards the phenomenon of text led to the new way of reading and interpreting the Holy Scriptures. Many of these tendencies had a strong effect on the development of the Reformation and later came to be reflected in its theology. This paper demonstrates how the rejection of scholastic schemes, which was prepared by humanists, was realised to its full extent in Protestant theology. On the other hand, the ideas of the Catholic Counter-Reformation were very important for further development of theology. Among these one can point out measures taken with regard to the reformation of theological education, introducing methods of adjacent academic spheres to theology, a new rise in scholasticism. The conclusion of the paper points to the importance for present-day theology to rethink and creatively assimilate the developments that occurred in European theology during the transition to Modernity in the 16th century.

AB  - In this manuscript, we address the problem of change detection for Sentinel-2 data. The proposed method is based on deep features representation. First, multilevel convolutional neural network (CNN) features are extracted from input images acquired at different times. Then, euclidean distance is applied to generate dissimilarity map that indicate change probabilities of each pixel. Finally, bounding boxes corresponding the change areas can be obtained with clustering and an optimizing connected component labeling algorithm. Experiments on a manually annotated dataset demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Structural similarity index (SSIM) is a widely used full-reference metric for assessment of visual quality of images and remote sensing data. It is calculated in a block-wise manner and is based on multiplication of three components: similarity of means of image blocks, similarity of contrasts and a correlation factor. In this paper, two modifications of SSIM are proposed. First, a fourth multiplicative component is introduced to SSIM (thus obtaining SSIM4) that describes a similarity of predictability of image blocks. A predictability for a given block is calculated as a minimal value of mean square error between the considered block and the neighboring blocks. Second, a simple scheme for calculating the metrics SSIM and SSIM4 for color images is proposed and optimized. Effectiveness of the proposed modifications is confirmed for the specialized image databases TID2013, LIVE, and FLT. In particular, the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (SROCC) for the recently introduced FLT Database, calculated between the proposed metric color SSIM4 and mean opinion scores (MOS), has reached the value 0.85 (the best result for all compared metrics) whilst for SSIM it is equal to 0.58.

TI  - Urban evolution along a vitoria (es) metropolitan area's highway by using geotechnologies
T2  - REVISTA ACTA GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of urban areas along axes of flow in Brazil is a reality that follows the country since its colonization, resulting in the creation of huge metropolitan centers of high economic influence (POLIDORO, et al. 2012). In this context, this article tends to analyse from a geographic view the multitemporal evolution of the urban spot along the BR-101 highway stretch known as Vitoria Highway Contour, crossing the municipalities of Cariacica and Serra, by using concomitantly Geographical Information Systems and Remote Sensing products, making possible the confirmation of the urban sprawl by the treatment of orbital images and the integration with others sources of data, such as populational ones. The conceptual and theoretical support counted on authors such as Benevolo, Correa, Campos Jr, besides others who discuss modern urbanistic, spatial organization and city building. It was observed in the thematic maps that the urban area suffered a huge growth between the studied years, being able to help elaborating municipal guidelines for the urban planning and for the land use and occupation in the area.

TI  - Do Groin Drains Reduce Postoperative Morbidity in Women Undergoing Inguinofemoral Lymphadenectomy for Vulvar Cancer?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been widely adopted in the surgical management of women with early-stage vulvar cancer, but many patients require inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL). Following IFL, many surgeons drain the groin to prevent lymphocyst formation despite a lack of evidence to support this practice. Our objective was to investigate whether groin drains after IFL are associated with reduced postoperative morbidity in women undergoing surgery for vulvar cancer.Methods A retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed as having primary vulvar cancer who underwent vulvectomy/radical local excision and unilateral or bilateral IFL was conducted. Cases were ascertained from the weekly outcome reports of a statewide tertiary gynecologic oncology tumor board. Data including postoperative outcomes were abstracted from medical records. Patients were stratified into 1 of 2 groups according to whether a groin drain had been used.Results Seventy-one patients were included. Inguinal drains were used in 48 patients (67.6%) and 23 patients (32.4%) did not have their groin wound(s) drained. The most common postoperative complications recorded were wound infection (59.2%), groin lymphocyst (32.4%), and cellulitis (25.4%). The mean length of hospital admission was 11.5 days (2-40 days). Compared with patients in whom inguinal drains were placed, those in the no drain group had a significantly lower incidence of postoperative groin cellulitis (8.7% vs 25.4% P = 0.039). No significant differences were observed between patients in the drain and no drain groups in lymphocyst formation, wound infection, return to the operating room, duration of hospital stay, readmission post-discharge, and lower-limb lymphedema.Conclusions In this study of patients undergoing inguinofemoral dissection for primary vulvar cancer, postoperative cellulitis occurred less frequently in patients without an inguinal drain. The incidence of other postoperative complications was no different whether or not a groin drain was used. Prospective studies may be warranted.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the use of plants by Besermans in folk hygiene, prevention of diseases, childcare and cleaning of premises. The types of plant raw materials used for hygiene purposes as well as the methods of their preparation and use are related to the sphere of folk knowledge about local resources. They are part of the existing life support system and related to the habitat and knowledge of local plant resources. The choice of raw materials is determined by natural and climatic conditions, economic structure, people's knowledge and world-view. The assortment of plants used is represented by forest, meadow, marsh and cultivated, weed and ruderal species. Many possess a complex of properties and were applied as hygienic, medical and cosmetic drugs. The most effective types of plants and derived raw materials were selected on an empirical basis, their bactericidal and anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, sedative and astringent properties were taken into account. The choice of plants was sometimes determined by the mythological notions of a particular plant or of the prevention of a particular disease. The use of most plant species ceased in the second half of the twentieth century as a result of the spread of industrial and household chemical products. Complex socio-economic conditions have actualized national knowledge about plant resources, preserving them as a family and rural narrative. In modern culture, the appeal to plant resources is associated with practical necessity and interest in traditional knowledge and the eco-movement.

M3  - Article
AB  - This olonkho, made by the founder of the Yakut literature, the first Sakha linguist, Platon Oyunsky, is first time undergoing through a vast specific cultural analyses due to the 125th anniversary of its author. As known, this work is said to be a literature olonkho, but it can claim the role of a canonic text of an olonkho. Unlike the classical olonkho, the author enriched this epic text by one significant character, named Taas kiele ogo, who, in our understanding, reveals the core thought of the Sakha people about the taboo to violate the cosmic balance among the three worlds, the Upper, Middle and Lower. Hereof we come to the highlighted normative function of the text and that is the rational outcome of our research. In general, the semantic range contains value and cognitive aspects. The other methods of interpretation also reveal the newly found aspects in the text of this olonkho, which is like representative one for the Sakha culture. This is the result of hermeneutic analysis. Other methods of reading used in the study are narrative, semiotic, symbolic, and information analysis. They consistently complement each other and bring the researcher to the understanding of the hidden meaning in the text. Methods of ethnomethodology, ethological research, the study of communicative intention, functional and structural analysis reveal ethno-cultural social features. They also show the degree of stability of the system under study. All the methods used reveal previously identified aspects in the text. The olonkho is a hallmark of the Sakha culture. The perspectives of the detailed work in future make us feel sure of the theoretical and practical significance of the gained results, which are based on cultural scientific methodology. Non-classical approach of scientific methodology is used by the author. According to this approach, the parts are integrated and the text of the culture is an indivisible whole. The text contains a linguistic entity and the coded address information.

AB  - The article pays attention to the problem of misunderstanding between teachers and students that causes the lack of motivation to the process of learning on the part of both teachers and students. Generation gap and difference of ideas and values are considered as the main reasons for the situation.The theoretical basis of the article is the Theory of Generations by William Strauss and Neil Howe and its interpretation for the Russian environment by Eugenia Shamis. Several generations of teachers and students are characterized according to historical, social, political and economic circumstances that influenced their personalities and worldview. The article also points out strategies used by people of different age group for finding and processing information. The author provides tips for successful collaboration of different generations.The Internet is stated to be the main area that is able to unite and to conciliate modern teachers and students. Every teacher is to catch up with the changing technologies and master new Internet resources in order to be up to date and on the edge of news, innovation and expertise. The generation of Web 1.0 recourses is becoming obsolete and the new type of platforms belonging to Web 2.0 is taking their place.Teachers are advised about how not to lose their way in the great amount of online resources available and to manage time properly in order to have an opportunity to make lessons informative, interesting and useful for the coming generation of students. Students are suggested a few tips to help them find their way in the world of information, organize, store and use the existing knowledge assets properly in order to enjoy the process of learning and to avoid possible conflicts and misunderstanding.

AB  - In thIS study we present advances in the analysis of environmental variables obtained from moderate resolution satellite images and their association with infestation indexes by Triatoma infestans (vector of Chagas disease). The environmental variables considered are the result of climatology and anomalY summaries derived from MODIS sensor time series (products MOD11A2 and MOD13A2) for the period 2000 to 2015), land use from Serena and precipitation from TRMM.The infestation, which was measured at the locality / rural LOCATION level, is expressed as a percentage of households with presence of T. infestans. Data was collected from the National Chagas service. Generalized linear models are proposed to associate the infestation with the environmental variables OBTAINED FROM SATELLITE IMAGES and other local conditions (characteristics of the dwellings and the presence of domestic animals).In general, the environmental variables considered in the models have more influence on Infestation indexes than the locals variables. The variables with the best adjustment were: annual average of LST of the years 2013 and 2015, the NDVI of 2014 and the anomalies of NDVI of the same year. These variables showed higher weights than the variables representing local conditions.From an eco-epidemiological perspective, the usage of products derived from sensors with Medium resolution with national coverage are tools which allow decision makers to generate more accurate responses in less time.

AB  - After more than 8 years in orbit the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is still in good health and several algorithms for improving its spatial resolution have been proposed and validated in a variety of catchments. However, none of them has yet been applied at the global scale. In this article we present: i) a review of the latest SMOS-BEC downscaling algorithm, which allows for its global application using an adaptive moving window and ii) a thorough validation of the resulting maps over two in-situ networks: REMEDHUS in Spain and OzNet in Australia. The proposed algorithm combines SMOS brightness temperatures (at similar to 40 km spatial resolution), and MODIS-derived Land Surface Temperature and Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (at 1 km), into 1km soil moisture maps. This paper also presents a variant of the algorithm, which allows for cloud-free retrievals. A statistical comparison has been carried out when the MODIS Land Surface Temperature is replaced in the algorithm by the one provided by the ERA5 reanalysis. Fine-scale estimates show good agreement in terms of correlation and root-mean-squared error with in-situ soil moisture.(1)

AB  - This study is a pilot project for the "San Francisco Flood Plain Project" (SFFPP), meant to delimit flood plain areas owned by the Brazilian federal government. The objective is to determine the attainable accuracy in river water surface delineation using satellite imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-1 and -2. We prioritize the evaluation of Landsat data due to its long systematical time series, allowing hydrological analysis requiring observations of at least 40 to 60 years and data from the Sentinel missions with their high frequency of revisit, improved spatial resolution (compared with Landsat) and possibility of observation in wet season (S-1). In our approach, we evaluated the accuracy by spectral bands individually and in combination, as well as polarization. We also tested a number of thematic information extraction techniques unsupervised (K-means and EM Cluster Analysis) and supervisioned (Random Forest - RF, k-nearest neighbors - KNN, Maximum Likelihood Classification - ML, Support Vector Machine - SVM, Mahalanobis). To validate our results, we used a PlanetScope mosaic (3 m). Results indicate that shortwave infrared bands have a higher capacity to separate water surface from other classes. For SAR data, the best separation was obtained by VV polarization (compared with VH). Techniques all reached agreement values >94% for the Sentinel-2 image, >93% for the Sentinel-1 image and >86% for the Landsat-8. We consider both methodologies effectives to extract the water surface and appropriate for the real estate issues of the SFFPP project.

AB  - SAR images are increasingly used for delineating water bodies. The high revisit frequency of Sentinel-1A and -1B make these images ideal for studies in hydrology that require data during the wet seasons and intense precipitation events. The aim of our study consisted in determining the attainable accuracy in delineating water bodies using Sentinel-1 data and propose a scheme for the extraction of the water surface. We chose a study site of three small reservoirs in the Pampulha area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used to separate water surfaces from the land using a probability threshold of 95%. In our scheme, we combined a SVM classification with a probability map to estimate the partial water area of the pixels within the transition zone between water and land. The VV polarization provided the best separation between water and land and the best geometric accuracy for the study area. Following the proposed approach, adding the water area of the marginal pixels to the water surface yielded accuracies better than 90% and above 80% when the geometry errors were also considered. Our results demonstrated the applicability of using high-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR data for the accurate mapping of water surfaces.

AB  - Alqueva reservoir located in southeast of Portugal has a surface area of 250 km(2) and total capacity of 4150 hm(3). Since 2006 the water quality of this reservoir is explored by the authors using remote sensing techniques. First using MERIS multi-spectral radiometer on-board of ENVISAT-1 and presently with MSI multi-spectral radiometer on-board SENTINEL-2. The existence of two satellites (A and B) equipped with MSI enable the area to be revisited, under the same viewing conditions, every 2-3 days. Since 2017 the multidisciplinary project ALOP (ALentejo Observation and Prediction systems) expands the team knowledge about the physical and bio-chemical properties of the reservoir. This project includes an integrated field campaign at different experimental sites in the reservoir and its shores, at least until September 2018. Previous algorithms developed by the team for MERIS are tested with the new MSI instrument for water turbidity, chlorophyll a concentration and density of cyanobacteria. Results from micro-algae bloom occurred in late summer/early autumn 2017 on the reservoir are presented, showing the capabilities of MSI sensor for detection and high resolution mapping over the reservoir. The results are compared with in situ sampling and laboratorial analysis of chlorophyll a associated with the bloom.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY BRACHYTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate long-term outcome of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and perioperative brachytherapy in early mobile tongue cancer.Material and methods: Seventy-three patients with clinically staged T1/T2 N0 M0 of mobile tongue cancer were studied retrospectively. Between January 2000 and September 2010, 47 patients underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) alone and 26 patients underwent perioperative brachytherapy (PB). Endpoints were overall survival, disease-free survival, loco-regional control, and late side effects.Results: Median age was 52 years and median follow-up was 74 months (range, 60-180). There were no local recurrences in the PB group. Overall survival at 6 years was 74.7% vs. 92.3% in HBR BT and PB group, respectively (p = 0.032). Disease-free survival at 6 years was 55.3% vs. 92.3% respectively in HDR-BT and PB (p = 0.002). Disease-free survival at 6 years in tumor histologic grade 1/2 patients was 76.3 months versus 40% in grade 3 patients. Nodal recurrence-free rate at 6 years was 67.5% with HDR-BT only, and 96.2% with PB (p = 0.007). In HDR BT only group, nodal recurrence-free rate at 6 years in T1 patients was 89.8% versus 29.4% in T2 patients. 16% and 7% patients developed soft tissue necrosis and osteoradionecrosis, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed significant correlation of local recurrence with tumor grade (p = 0.029), nodal recurrence with T-stage (p = 0.007), and disease-free survival with age (p = 0.003) and T stage (p = 0.026).Conclusions: HDR-BT alone gives acceptable loco-regional control in T1 tumors. T2 stage tumors should not be treated by brachytherapy alone in view of high failure rates in nodal regions and should undergo either neck dissection or nodal irradiation. Perioperative brachytherapy is investigational and can be considered in patients who are at highrisk for local recurrence in patients undergoing surgery alone.

AB  - As part of the European Copernicus programme, the Sentinel-1 mission, based on a constellation of two SAR satellites, ensures continuity for C-band SAR observations for Europe. Both satellites have been launched from Kourou on a Soyuz rocket, Sentinel-1A on 3rd April 2014, Sentinel-1B on 25 April 2016. Following the completion of the constellation operational qualification phase, the routine operations of the constellation are on-going and performed close to the full mission and system capacity. The mission is characterized by large-scale, frequent and repetitive observations, systematic production and a free and open data distribution policy.The paper provides high-level information on the ongoing mission operations. It describes at high level the system operations, incl. ground segment operational activities, as well as some user data access statistics. It presents few examples of mission results achieved since the operations of Sentinel-1A, in some key application domains.

AB  - The animal rights movement has pioneered new, diverse forms of social activism that have rapidly redefined how we view animals. But those remarkable successes have been met with an increasingly aggressive backlash, including new terrorism laws, widespread surveillance, experimental prisons, and legislation explicitly criminalizing journalists and whistle-blowers. This Article will explain how, if left unchecked, these attacks on animal advocacy will become a blueprint for the wider criminalization of dissent.

TI  - Incidence of Viruses in Two Large-Scale Plantings of Blackberry in South Carolina as Detected Through the Use of Sentinel Plants and RT-PCR
T2  - PLANT HEALTH PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Some plants in two large-scale blackberry plantings established from virus-indexed planting material displayed symptoms typical of virus infection in the early days of the growing season immediately after planting. Groups of sentinel plants exposed within the plantings for 30-day periods over additional growing seasons, and subsequently screened for the presence of five viruses by reverse transcription PCR, detected Blackberry yellow vein-associated virus (BYVaV), Blackberry virus Y (BVY), Blackberry chlorotic ringspot virus (BCRV), Blackberry virus E (BVE), and Blackberry leaf mottle-associated virus (BLMaV). Because these viruses are thought to be transmitted through the actions of arthropods, and bearing in mind that the plantings had been established with virus-indexed material, it seems that the viruses must be moving into the new crops from adjacent native vegetation and once established moving freely within the crops. BYVaV has been reported from South Carolina previously. A recent publication reports the detection of BLMaV in samples originating from South Carolina and demonstrates transmission of the virus by mites. This is the first report of the detection of BCRV, BVY, and BVE within the state and provides support for the movement of the latter two viruses (BVY and BVE) within established plantings of blackberry as a result of vector activity.

TI  - Reconstruction of Landsat time series in the presence of irregular and sparse observations: Development and assessment in north-eastern Alberta, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis of Landsat is limited by sparse and irregular sampling of clear-sky observations due to acquisition limitations, clouds, shadows, atmosphere, and sensor artifacts. Many remote sensing applications utilizing coarse spatial resolution time series methods are not suitable for Landsat due to observation sparsity. In this research we develop an imputation based approach to constrain the harmonic modeling method of Zhu et al. (2012, 2015) and Zhu and Woodcock (2014b) to reconstruct Landsat time series at a regular temporal interval. The approach was assessed for a boreal forest region in central Canada for different sparsity conditions. The imputed Landsat estimates for a specific pixel were predicted from climate or AVHRR data. These estimates were given a small weight relative to available Landsat observations in fitting the final harmonic model essentially constraining it to a more plausible range. In addition we implemented the model in a piecewise manner to handle non-linear temporal drift related to factors such as climate change, drought, or the allometric nature of vegetation regrowth. Results show that the inclusion of imputed estimates improved model predictions in the presence of observation sparsity. Where there were less than 3 observations within +/- 20 days the imputation approach performed better, with a reduction in average reflectance error of 0.001 to 2.5. Error assessment with hold out observations, comparison to MODIS time series, and example predicted images are presented.

TI  - Habitual Personal Movement Patterns in a Structured Environment.
T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This paper presents an approach for describing personal movement patterns for typical daily activities undertaken by subjects within free living structured environments (e.g. home or office). Conventionally this requires specialized technology for personal movement monitoring involving measurement of location and motion, and results in the collection of large datasets in order to provide sufficient descriptive power. Here we advocate the preferential observation of sentinel activities based on the expectation of routine and repetitive personal movement episodes, which can be considered as 'habits'. These identified habitual patterns provide a useful context for understanding the dominant characteristics of typical daily activities, enabling purposeful design of behaviour change interventions to improve healthy living. This approach has been applied here to office stepcount data from consumer wearables.

AB  - Antarctica remains a remote and logistically difficult region in which to conduct geological fieldwork, making the data collected there of significant value. Actually, many parts of the continent still remain poorly known in regional geological scale and structural architecture. Remote sensing imagery is capable to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties associated with field mapping in the Antarctic. Advanced optical and radar satellite imagery is the most applicable tool for mapping and identification of inaccessible and un-exposed regions in Antarctic. Consequently, an improved scientific research using remote sensing technology would be essential to provide new and more complete lithological and structural data to fill the numerous knowledge gaps on Antarctica's geology. In this study, the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is selected to conduct a regional remote sensing investigations. The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is the northernmost part of the continent of Antarctica. Despite more than 50 years of geological mapping of the Antarctic Peninsula there are still significant gaps in the coverage in difficult to access areas and many regions where mapping is based upon sparse or inferred field observations. Recent generation of multi-platform satellite sensors could be investigated to extract geological information for Antarctic environments. Landsat-7 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were used in this study for regional geological mapping. The improvised image processing algorithms and Systematic GIS techniques were implemented to detect structural elements and geological features for producing regional image maps of the Antarctic Peninsula especially for Oscar II coast area, north-eastern Graham Land. The outcomes of the investigation demonstrated the applicability of satellite remote sensing data to produce new revisions of geological maps with high accuracy for the regions with exposed rocks in the Antarctica.

TI  - Towards More Representative Gridded Satellite Products
T2  - Code Ocean
M3  - Software
AB  - The most widely used satellite products are averages of data onto a regular spatio-temporal grid, known as Level~3 data. Some atmospheric variables can vary rapidly in response to changing conditions. Over the scales of Level~3 averaging, the combination of observations across different conditions may result in data that is not normally distributed, such that a simple mean is not representative. The problem is illustrated by the distribution of aerosol optical depth from different sensors and algorithms. A simple statistical technique is proposed to better convey the diversity of satellite observations to users whereby a multi-modal log-normal distribution is fit to the distribution of data observed within each grid cell. Allowing multiple modes within each cell is shown to improve the agreement between satellite products by highlighting regions of significant variability and isolating systematic differences between instruments.

AB  - Amiantos Mine, in Cyprus, which is an abandoned Asbestos mine has been selected as a pilot within the GEO-CRADLE project (http://geocradle.eu/en/). Main selection criteria were the user's needs and the spatial distribution of the sites that had to be placed in the Region of Interest (RoI) (Balkans, Middle East and North Africa). Following the termination of the mining activities and the mining lease in 1992, after a long operation period of the mine (1904-1988), Cyprus Government undertook rehabilitation works, which are in progress. Geological Survey Department of Cyprus has undertaken the monitoring of the rehabilitated slopes mainly with in situ measurements. The usage of space born data together with the in-situ data will enhance the evaluation of the stability of the rehabilitation works and the assessment of any environmental pollution in the surrounding area. Main activities that are discussed in this paper and are extensively analyzed in respective pilot - feasibility study, focus on (1) monitoring progress of restoration works - using estimates of various biophysical parameters like NDVI, soil moisture, Fe / mineral alteration indexes and land use changes extracted from the analysis of multi-temporal Sentinel 2 data, (2) the determination of ground stability of the mining waste dumps, taking under special consideration the slope mass movements and vertical ground motions - using satellite interferometry method and (3) the identification of the potential pollution sources - air and water monitoring with support of multispectral satellite images of new generation which identify and map materials through spectroscopic remote sensing.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, sand dunes are a major environmental problem that causes damage to urban areas, transportation, and population. The current study proposes a comprehensive investigation on sand dune risk modeling in Sabha located in the southwestern part of Libya. Data from various sources were collected and prepared in a GIS database. Data from 2016 were used to derive several controlling factors, such as altitude, rainfall, soil texture, wind direction and speed, land cover, and population density. Next, sand dune susceptibility, hazard and vulnerability assessments were performed. Finally, a risk map was produced. Results indicate that land use and soil are the most influential factors affecting the sand dunes in the study area, whereas rainfall is the least significant factor. Results indicate that, southern part has a higher chance of sand dune occurrence than the northern part, whereas the highest risk zone is located in the middle part, where the urban and agricultural lands are present. More than 200km(2) of the study area are under high and very high risk zones. Overall, this study provides an effective tool for assessing sand dune risk in Sabha, which can be useful for land management.

TI  - Glacial lake changes and outburst flood hazard in Chandra basin, North-Western Indian Himalaya
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic change-induced glacier recession has been accompanied by formation and growth of proglacial lakes in the Himalayan region, which pose an emerging significant threat to the downstream communities/settlements in the form of outburst floods. To understand spatiotemporal evolution patterns, sources and driving mechanism of formation and expansion of glacial lakes, a temporal inventory of glacial lakes (area > 2000 m(2)) in Chandra basin has been developed from 2000 to 2014 using IRS LISS-III images. From 2000 to 2014, the total number of glacial lakes in Chandra basin increased from 28 to 46 and area expanded from 1.91 +/- 0.24 km(2) to 3.26 +/- 0.24 km(2). Glacier recession and increased glacier melt runoff due to climate warming led to the formation and expansion of glacial lakes in space vacated by glacier recession. The increase in number and area of ice-dammed lakes at higher elevations confirms the continued glacier retreat in the basin. Lakes in contact or in the proximity of the mother glacier exhibit higher growth and formation rate. The accelerated growth of glacial lakes has resulted in increased hazard and damage potential of glacial lake outburst floods in Chandra basin. Seven potentially dangerous lakes are identified and analysed qualitatively for outburst probability.

AB  - By accurately measuring and predicting ocean currents we can influence multiple industries including commercial fishing, recreational boating, shipping, and tourism, as well as assist with hazardous material cleanup (i.e. oil and chemical spills) and aid in search and rescue missions. Surface current data was collected from five (5) High Frequency (HF) radar stations located on the west and south coast of Puerto Rico. The surface currents from the HF radar were compared against the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) for the American Seas (AMSEAS) as well as surface drifters that were deployed in April 2017. In the Mona Passage the flow is predominantly from south to north at a monthly average of 15 cm/s in the central part of the passage. On the south shore of Puerto Rico, the flow is predominantly from east to west at a monthly average of 18 cm/s. The surface current data around Puerto Rico was used as one component of a Sargassum seaweed tracking system was developed by the authors. Satellite data made available by the University of South Florida was used to calculate the location and amount of Sargassum around Puerto Rico. By collecting high spatial and temporal resolution information on the ocean currents, as well as fine tuning the ocean models to make them more accurate this can better predict the movement of items floating on the surface like Sargassum or a person lost at sea. This paper will also chronicle the repair of the HF radar network after Hurricane Maria in September 2017.

AB  - Indian cities are expanding not only in terms of built environment but also in population. Multi-story buildings are rising rapidly to accommodate the growing population, undesirably even in hazard prone areas. Such a scenario calls for a proper disaster risk reduction program and plan to control the inevitable damage to lives and properties. Earthquakes are destructive only if the factors that increase the damages prevail. Attention should be given to crowded cities with people and infrastructure vulnerable to hazard. This study presents the details of deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) done for Coimbatore city of the state of Tamil Nadu, India using the latest available information on seismicity of the region. The earthquake data was compiled from different agencies and homogenized in a unified moment magnitude scale to create an updated earthquake catalog. Seismotectonic map for the study area was prepared by superimposing the earthquake events on the seismogenic sources. DSHA was then performed by dividing the study area into grids of size 0.02 degrees x 0.02 degrees (approximately 2 km x 2 km) using a MATLAB code, considering three different attenuation relationships for the stable continental region. Land use (LU) map for the region was developed from LANDSAT 8 data using various GIS platforms. Hazard contour map prepared using ArcGIS, was then overlaid on the LU map to comprehend the seismic risk of the region. It was observed that, though the wards south-west of the city shows higher Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values, the wards north-east of the city have larger and denser built-up areas, increasing its vulnerability, in the event of an earthquake.

AB  - Major redevelopment or utility projects requires classified information about building maps of cities. Remote sensing and satellite imagery has become good alternative source of data generation technology in recent years. In this study, our attempt is to validate SVM (Support Vector Machine) method of classification to extract buildings from the complex urban scene using high-resolution satellite imagery. Building extraction is performed using multispectral satellite dataset IRS (Indian Remote Sensing) Indian - Resourcesat 2 - LISS IV imagery. An attempt has been made to use multiple kernel functions of SVM classifier, and it is found that radial basis function performs best followed by linear, sigmoid and polynomial respectively. Signature data prepared are divided into a training dataset and validation dataset in 7:3 ratios, in which training dataset are used in training, fitting the model and validation dataset are used for accuracy assessment of the algorithm.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF NEW RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a study into the implementation of environmental and spiritual ideas of alternative communitarian movements during the establishing of quickly spreading nature-based spirituality communities and their settlements in the East-Central European region. It focuses on the Anastasia "spiritual" movement, classifiable as New Age, which emerged in Russia in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and since has spread to East-Central Europe and beyond. It considers the process of indigenization via assembled nature-based spiritualities and traditionalistic ideas in the movement. It will discuss how the Anastasian process of sacralization of natural space, together with the romantic mode of a narrativization of the archaic past, serve as a source for the formation of images of "indigenousness" in the movement. During the process of "indigenization," a negotiation, interpretation and presentation of nationalistic and traditionalistic ideas serve as a basis for an imagination of (trans)local prehistoric and local national pasts-including a golden age myth, a "back to nature" worldview with attempts to reconstruct variously perceived traditions, as well as a development of utopian visions of a prospective heaven on earth-intended to widely spread future social projects. The findings are based on data obtained from fieldwork in 2005-2015, including participant observation and interviews with respondents in the Baltic countries and Russia.

AB  - Reservoir sedimentation is the major problem, due to it every year the reservoir capacity is lost to considerable amount. Surveying for assessment of the reservoir by conventional approach is time and money consuming. Geospatial technology provides ample opportunity in this field through the availability of high resolution satellite data from sensors such as Sentinel, Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, Landsat, and SPOT have been used to calculate the water spread area of the reservoir. However, due to presence of cloud in most of the optical data during onset of monsoon, the water spread at the lowest reservoir level could not be mapped. In turn the revised capacity or sedimentation is generally assessed between either below full reservoir level (FRL) or above maximum draw down level (MDDL). Nowadays, the microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at reasonable spatial resolution is available freely in public domain. Moreover, microwave data has capability to penetrate cloud and the information below cloud can easily be retrieved. To overcome the issues related to optical data, in the present study, the reservoir sedimentation for Ghataprabha reservoir was estimated using SAR data. Sentinel-1A data was used to delineate the water spread area for the water year of 2016-17. The original live storage capacity (1974) was estimated to be 1434.14 Mm(3) at FRL 662.940 m by the authorities using the hydrographic survey during the commissioning of the reservoir in the year 1974. The live storage capacity was found out to be 1366.14 Mm(3) at FRL, however, as per original elevation-area-capacity curve the live capacity is around 1262.404 Mm(3) at 660.50 m. Estimated live storage capacity from Remote sensing approach (2016-17) was assesses as 1182.5 Mm(3) at 660.51 m. The storage capacity has reduced from 1262.40 Mm(3) (1974) to 1182.51 M m3 i.e. around 171.732 Mm(3). As per present analysis the rate of sedimentation is around 4 Mm(3)/yr. It was realized that using the SAR microwave data, the revised capacity of the reservoir from its near MDDL to FRL could be assessed through remote sensing approach.

AB  - The reclamation program carried out in most cities in North Jakarta is directly adjacent to the Jakarta Bay. Beside this program, the density of population and development center in North Jakarta office has increased the need for underground water excessively. As a result of these things, land subsidence in North Jakarta area is relatively high and so intense. The research methodology was developed based on the method of remote sensing and geographic information systems, expected to describe the spatial correlation between the land subsidence and flood phenomenon in North Jakarta. The DInSAR (Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) method with satellite image data Radar (SAR Sentinel 1A) for the years 2015 to 2016 acquisitions was used in this research. It is intended to obtain a pattern of land subsidence in North Jakarta and then combined with flood patterns. For the preparation of flood threat zoning pattern, this research has been modeling in spatial technique based on a weighted parameter of rainfall, elevation, flood zones and land use. In the final result, we have obtained a flood hazard zonation models then do the overlap against DInSAR processing results. As a result of the research, Geo-hazard modelling has a variety results as: 81% of flood threat zones consist of rural area, 12% consists of un-built areas and 7% consists of water areas. Furthermore, the correlation of land subsidence to flood risk zone is divided into three levels of suitability with 74% in high class, 22% in medium class and 4% in low class. For the result of spatial correlation area between land subsidence and flood risk zone are 77% detected in rural area, 17% detected in un-built area and 6% detected in a water area. Whereas the research product is the geo-hazard maps in North Jakarta as the basis of the spatial correlation analysis between the land subsidence and flooding phenomena. double point.

AB  - Rice is one of the most important agriculture crops in many countries, and it is a primary food source for more than three billion people worldwide. The global rice consumption is projected to be 873 million tonnes in 2030. Based on national socio-economic survey (susenas) data from Indonesia Statistic Agency (BPS), Indonesia's population of rice consumption 2016 reached 78,816 kg per capita per year. In the recent decades, two major issues like population growth (in particular in the major rice producing or consuming countries) and climate change put enormous pressure on the global food demand and its production. Almost all countries made the issue of food as a major issue. Now, Indonesian government wants to realize Indonesia became self-sufficient of rice in 2017. Some food security programs implemented to achieve it. One of them is predicting or estimation rice production and consumption. Prediction or estimation rice productivity before harvest is crucial, especially in regions characterised by climatic uncertainties. It is also enables governments to put in a good strategic contingency plans for the redistribution of food during times of famine. Satellite remote sensing has been widely applied and recognised as a powerful and effective tool for identifying agriculture crops. An important goal of agricultural remote sensing research is to spectrally estimate crop variables related to crop conditions, which can subsequently be entered into crop simulation and production models. In this research will be use a global and medium resolution of satellite remote sensing imagery (Landsat 8 ETM+) with 2016-2017 acquisition year in order to estimation of rice productivity. The rice productivity prediction modeling methods will be build in this research based on regression and spectral pattern analysis of NDVI (and LSWI (Land Surface Water Index in multi temporal satellite imagery. In addition, this prediction model will be tested against fact the level of productivity in the rice field. We will take a proportional field sampling test using cluster sampling test and random spectral value checking in order to measure accuracy level of rice productivity prediction model. The results of this research indicate that NDVI and LSWI algorithm is the best combination of linear regression in estimation of rice productivity level with coefficient of determination equal to 0.639. Validation of regression model equation to data of Agriculture Agency of Demak has difference or RMSE 8,394 Quintal/Ha

AB  - Indonesia is a country located in the presence of three large tectonic plates like the Indo-Australian, Eurasian and Pacific plates. The path of plate movement approaching or steering away each other leads to high volcanic and earthquakes activity. As a proof of the active path of this plate movement can be seen from the series of active volcanoes lies from the island of Sumatra, Java, Nusa Tenggara into Papua. The impact of active volcano activity will be felt in the densely populated area where the island of Java became one of the islands with the largest residential area in Indonesia. This impact needs to be anticipated with an integrated high-tech technology and volcanic disaster mitigation system. One of the most active volcanoes in the island of Java is Merapi mount which is experienced the last major eruption peak on October 26th, 2010. This volcanic eruption is effusive eruption type where magmatic gas pressure in the crater is not too strong and magma eruption is just flowing out past the slopes of the Merapi mount area. However, magmatic gas pressure and magma volume still result in deformation changes that have a direct impact on residential areas throughout the Merapi mount area. Therefore, this research performs deformation calculation using DInSAR (Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) method on Sentinel 1 SAR and ALOS PALSAR 1 satellite images between 2005-2015 acquisition year. Then the deformation patterns obtained from the DInSAR method will be spatially correlated with residential areas throughout the Merapi mount area. Residential areas were obtained through supervised classification process from Landsat 5 and 8-satellite imagery in the 2005-2015 acquisition year. The reason of observation year selection is based on pre and post eruption concept to get pattern of Merapi's mountain body change through deformation analysis. The result of the combination of deformation pattern and residential area changes was further analysed to obtain spatial correlation. The value of this spatial correlation will be an indicator of how's far the deformation changes due to volcanic activity will have an effect on the residential areas in the Merapi mount area. The output of this research is a map of Merapi mount deformation (due to volcanic activity) impacts on the residential area. The results are expected to contribute to the volcanic disaster mitigation system and the development of residential area plans in Merapi mount area.

AB  - Banjarnegara district is located from 7 degrees 12'S-7 degrees 31'S latitude and 109 degrees 29'E-109 degrees 45'E longitude. Spreading on the mountain valley in the middle of west side of Central Java which across from west to east. Banjarnegara is a district that has lies on mountain area with high level of landslide hazard. One of the main cause factors of the vulnerability escalation is improper land-use planning. Vulnerability escalation can get intense worse if the government as well as the people do not realize or anticipate any threat of natural disaster coming in their area. Landslide disaster in Banjarnegara District caused economic collapse, building damages, fatalities and property losses. In order to determine and identify landslide hazard vulnerability, it was used a six parameters in Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) such as landslide vulnerability, slope gradients, soil types, land cover types, hydrogeology and accessibility. This research used AHP method in determining the weight value of each parameter which then are classified into land suitability value with 0-30 interval as unsuitable land, 30-70 less suitable land and > 70 as suitable land for relocation. Identified residences affected by the land movement disasters are 88 points with area in total of 196 hectare or 0.114% from total area of Banjarnegara residential widespread in the north side of Banjarnegara. In addition, the vulnerability analysis of landslide disaster is also based on data processing using DInSAR method. This method is applied using SENTINEL SAR satellite imagery for the 2015 into 2016 acquisition period. This DInSAR result is combined with analysis of geological data that includes hydrogeological, geomorphological and geotechnical data to obtain spatial distribution of landslide disaster. The three methods that include AHP, DInSAR and Geology will be combined with overlay concepts to obtain comprehensive spatial analysis.

AB  - In this article, the WUDAPT methodology was applied to Metropolitan Regions (RM) in the state of Sao Paulo/Brazil. The objective was to identify the influence of the typologies of urban versus rural occupation for a region with predominantly agricultural characteristics. The state of Sao Paulo/Brazil has six Metropolitan Regions and the choice of these regions was due to their socioeconomic and technological importance and because there is a concentration of agroindustrial and urban areas. The scarcity of data on urban form/occupation and on the function of cities makes it difficult to understand the climatic conditions of occupied space. Analyses were carried out, based on mappings developed by supervised classification and by treatment of MODIS satellite images. These resulted in the LCZ - Local Climate Zone classification; the mapping of the annual average Land Surface Temperature and the Surface Heat Island, all for the year 2016. Significant differences in surface temperature were found in the RM of Sao Paulo and Ribeirao Preto, mainly due to the type of LCZ class, soil type, solar incidence and topographic differences. Thermal images can serve as indicators of anomalies present in the analyzed areas and, associated with the LCZ classification, can support the formulation of spatial planning guidelines.

AB  - In the framework of the H2020 APOLLO project a significant focus has been put on the use of high resolution satellite based products to serve small farmers in their agricultural practices. This paper presents first results achieved by using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data as input to a semi-empirical soil moisture (SM) retrieval model based on an algorithm originally developed for ERS SAR data and successively modified to handle ENVISAT ASAR acquisitions. In this work the model has been adapted to Sentinel-1 images and calibrated by using ground measurements taken in two test sites characterized by bare soil and cotton cultivation, aiming at testing its capability to represent the SM behavior at different stages of the vegetation cycle. The model performance has been assessed through the correlation R and root mean squared error (RMSE) between in situ and satellite retrieved SM data. Very good results have been achieved for bare soil (R>0.8, RMSE<0.04 m(3)m(-3)); however, the model performed worse in the cotton fields (R<0.6, RMSE>0.08 m(3)m(-3)).

AB  - This paper presents first results of a snow cover detection algorithm applied to high resolution Sentine-1 images of two different mountainous protected areas: the Hardangervidda National Park (Norway), and the Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain). The products have been compared with the snow maps generated by using Sentinel-2 acquisitions taken on the same or closest day as the SAR images. This work highlighted issues that require further investigation to improve the snow cover detection in areas characterized by a complex topography, climate and land cover. High quality SAR snow products are very much desirable to be used together with less frequent optical snow products, aiming at a continuous monitoring of protected areas.

On unwrapped interferogram time series, the PM method provides a satisfactory separation of the displacement signal from the spatially correlated perturbations, while on wrapped interferogram time series, the PM method can highlight fringe patterns where they are more or less significantly hindered by the decorrelation noise.

TI  - The <i>Alagaddupama Sutta</i> as a Scriptural Source for Understanding the Distinctive Philosophical Standpoint of Early Buddhism
T2  - BUDDHIST STUDIES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alagaddupama Sutta is the 22nd discourse of the Majjhima-nikega of the Pali canon. in the sutta itself it is mentioned that the Buddha's delivery of this discourse was necessitated by the need to refute a wrong view held by one of his disciples named Arittha. Parallel versions of the sutta are found preserved in the Chinese Agamas. The two main similes used in the sutta, those of the snake and of the raft, are referred to in the scriptures of a number of non-Theravada Buddhist traditions as well, showing that the Buddhist doctrine represented in it is early and authentic and the message contained in the sutta was considered to be extremely significant by many early Buddhist traditions. The Alagaddupama Sutta shows the Buddha's role as one of the earliest thinkers in the history of philosophy who engaged in a critique of the craving for metaphysics and dogma frequently exhibited in those who propound worldviews. The Buddha did not value a belief or a worldview on grounds of the logical skill with which it was constructed but on grounds of the transformative effect it could have on the character of an individual and the sense of wellbeing it could promote. There are several discourses of the Pali canon which give prominence to this aspect of the Buddha's teaching. Among them the Brahmajala Sutta of the Digha-nikaya and the Atthakavagga of the Suttanipata need special mention. The Buddha is seen to have consistently avoided engagement in speculative metaphysics, pointing out that the goal of his teaching goes beyond all such engagement. The Buddha himself distinguished his own worldview as a Teaching in the Middle (rnajihena) avoiding the common tendency of humankind to be trapped by either of the two extremes, Eternalism or Annihilationism. These distinctive standpoints of the Buddha are all seen to be amply represented in the Alagaddupama Sutta.

AB  - The TerrA-P project is developing a new global monitoring system for primary production by land ecosystems, designed for Sentinel-3 green vegetation cover and land surface temperature inputs. At its core is a universal, parameter sparse, first-principles light use efficiency model (the 'P' model) for gross primary production (GPP) by C-3 and C-4 plants. The P model is derived mathematically from the standard model of photosynthesis, with the addition of optimality hypotheses that skilfully predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacities and the leaf-internal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2). The system has no need of biome-specific parameter values, and realistically incorporates the influence of rising atmospheric CO2. Multiple seasonal cycles of modelled and observed GPP were compared in a calibration data set of eddy-covariance GPP data at 17 sites. Optimal agreement was obtained after a small adjustment, within the accepted range, of the intrinsic quantum efficiency for C-3 photosynthesis.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Pattern Recognition and Tracking XXIX
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) benefits from persistent imaging capabilities that are not reliant on factors such as weather or time of day. One area that may benefit from readily available imaging capabilities is road damage detection and assessment occurring from disasters such as earthquakes, sinkholes, or mudslides. This work investigates the performance of a pre-screener for an automatic detection system used to identify locations and quantify the severity of road damage present in SAR imagery. The proposed pre-screener is comprised of two components: advanced image processing and classification. Image processing is used to condition the data, removing non-pertinent information from the imagery which helps the classifier achieve better performance. Specifically, we utilize shearlets; these are powerful filters that capture anisotropic features with good localization and high directional sensitivity. Classification is achieved through the use of a convolutional neural network, and performance is reported as classification accuracy. Experiments are conducted on satellite SAR imagery. Specifically, we investigate Sentinel-1 imagery containing both damaged and non-damaged roads.

AB  - Landslide is a common natural disaster often happened in Indonesia. Those natural disaster has caused many victims. It can occur because Indonesia has tropic climate, so that the weathering procces does rapidly, and may rain water enters the rock or soil's pores increasing mass of the rock or soil. Lithology and structural geology condition also influence the landslide. The most of area in Indonesia has landslide potential. The research area is located at Ngawen Regency, Gunungkidul District, Yogyakarta. That place consist of ancient volcanic rock such as laharic breccia, andesite lava, tuffaceous sandstone and lapilli. Radial pattern of the fault growth in Ngawen because the procces of ancient volcanic activity. The research methods using remote sensing methods and qualitative methods. Remote sensing methods are interpretation using DEM-SRTM, Landsat 8 and Aerial Photo, while qualitative methods using weighing factor, scoring, and overlay maps. The geological controls of landslide using in the interpretation are lithology, structural geology, geomorphology, slopes and the rate of rainfall. The result of the research is zonation map of landslide potential. The zonation of landslide potential divided into three there are high, medium and safe. The zonation of landslide potential map of Ngawen may help the government to make a mitigation and evacuation plan appropriately.

AB  - In the present study, the paleo-river channels in the midland and coastal plain region of the Periyar and Chalakudy river basins, central Kerala, west coast of India were delineated applying remote sensing techniques and electrical resistivity methods. The river basin areas are flanked by Western Ghats in the eastern side and Lakshadweep Sea in the western side. Geologically, the area is overlain by charnockites and biotite gneiss in the midland and foothill region and fluvial and paleo-beach deposits in the western parts adjoining the sea. Laterite deposits are seen at several locations in the midland region of the basin. The main course of the river cuts across all the lithological units; the northern branch directly joins with sea and southern branch cut across older alluvial plain and reaches the Vembanad backwater system. Geomorphological mapping of the study area using IRS P6 LISS III data revealed the presence of two sets of paleochannels in the northern side of current channel of the river. The migratory trace of the river is indicated in the satellite images by the presence of meandering scars, crescent-shaped oxbow lakes in the older floodplain areas. Distinct vegetation alignment along the paleochannels is noted indicated by abrupt changes in tone and texture. Vertical electrical sounding (VES) survey was carried out at eight locations along the paleochannels demarcated. Good resistivity contrast obtained in five locations between the first and second layers. Apparent resistivity values obtained for the first layer (rho(1)) varied from 22 to 422 Omega m with thickness similar to 1-2 m and the second layer (rho(2)) varied from 5 to 80 Omega m with thickness similar to 2-7 m.

AB  - Advanced method for calibrating individual modules of active phased antenna arrays (APAA) has been introduced earlier [1-4]. This method allows fast and accurate characterization of every modules. As calibrating sequences set pseudo-noise sequences (PN-sequences, Kasami codes, Gold sequences etc.) can be used, but introduced additional measurement error due to mutual interference between sequences in one set. Decorrelation algorithm of reducing this error has been introduced earlier [5]. But it requires sequences set size as large as number of APAA-channels so it can be costly to implement it for large-size APAA. In this paper authors discuss variant of decorrelation algorithms with repeated use of sequences which allow of using small set of pseudo-noise sequences in calibrating systems.

TI  - Landsat approaches to map agro-pastoral farming in the wetlands of southern Sudan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine-learning algorithms (MLA) are coming of age within satellite remote sensing (SRS). This study compares the performance of a number of MLAs with more traditional indices and algorithms to map annual agro-pastoralist farming activity in southern Sudan. Two Landsat images from the early dry season 2014 and 2015 were analysed thoroughly and evaluated by interpretation of farming cover from very high resolution (VHR) images on Google Earth (GE). Traditional SRS indices based upon red and near infrared (NIR) bands used for monitoring rangelands did not perform well for the wet rangeland conditions compared to the use of blue and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. The species distribution model programme, MaxEnt, was used to produce a continuous farming activity indices using only Landsat-derived variables. Compared to other SRS classification approaches, maximum entropy (MaxEnt) showed the best overall performance to map farming activity followed by classification tree analysis (CTA). Overall mapping agreement >95.0% was reached for most methodologies, with MaxEnt showing very high mapping agreement (>= 98.5%) for both years. When the result of MaxEnt's good performance is put together in a 2014-15 or a 1999-2002 change detection scenario, it corroborates ground reports on massive human abuses that have taken place in Unity state of southern Sudan.

TI  - Estimation of Water-Spread Area of Singoor Reservoir, Southern India by Super Resolution Mapping of Multispectral Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of reservoir water-spread area is often carried out by field surveys which are cumbersome, time consuming, expensive and involves more man power. Hence, such surveys cannot be carried out periodically. To overcome this issue, satellite images are used, wherein the reservoir water-spread is estimated by conventional per-pixel classification such as the maximum likelihood and minimum distance to mean approaches that often results in inaccurate estimate of water-spread area due to the presence of mixed pixels. High cost and non-availability of high resolution images demands the use of an alternative approach that can give accurate information about the reservoir water-spread area. In this work, IRS, LISS III images of moderate (24 m) resolution were used for accurate estimation of the water-spread area of Singoor reservoir, southern India. The reservoir water-spread areas were extracted using per-pixel classification, sub-pixel classification and super resolution mapping approaches. These results were validated with the water-spread areas obtained from field data of the same dates. The error produced by the per-pixel approach was 6.66%, while it was 4.37% for the sub-pixel approach and a meagre 1.71% for the super-resolution approach. Fairly less error produced by the super resolution mapping technique implies that it is an efficient approach for accurate quantification of reservoir water-spread area. The estimated water-spread can be used in a simple volume estimation formula to estimate the capacity of the reservoir.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data have inherent noise due to clouds and poor atmospheric conditions that limit its applicability for environmental applications. This study was carried out with an objective of noise removal and reconstruction of time series MODIS EVI data (16 day) for the period 2010-2014 using de-noising algorithms. Relative evaluation of de-noising algorithms for smoothing temporal data with ideal noise free data is not possible in actual scenario. Hence, synthetic signals were generated and introduced Gaussian noise at different variance levels for evaluation purpose. Spatial analysis was carried out by introducing noise at different variance levels into the noise free EVI images from the raw EVI stacked image. Spatio-temporal analyses of noise signals in the reconstructed EVI images were evaluated in terms of performance indicators, namely Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Mean Square Error.

TI  - WATER USE EFFICIENCY OF SELECTED CROPS IN THE ROMANIAN PLAIN - MODEL STUDIES USING SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES E-LAND RECLAMATION EARTH OBSERVATION & SURVEYING ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Romanian Plain is dominated by intensively used, fertile cropland with large agricultural potentials. Nutrient supply and water availability are major determinants of crop yields. Achievable yield is strongly influenced by fertilization and irrigation -depending on the local conditions. Increasing water use efficiency (WUE) is an important objective for distributing the limited water for irrigation. We present a study which determines scenario-based yields and WUE of winter wheat and maize throughout the Romanian Plain (2015-2017). The study compares results of the biophysical crop growth model PROMET with data on actual plant development derived from Sentinel-2 time series. Actual crop yields and WUE are compared to their potentials which are determined by assuming optimal fertilization for both rainfed and optimal irrigated agriculture. The winter wheat simulations show that, under rain-fed conditions, optimal fertilization can more than double yields and maximize WUE, whereas irrigation hardly affects yield. Since maize is more affected by water stress in the Romanian Plain, optimal fertilization can double maize yields and maximize WUE under irrigation only.

AB  - In this paper, study on monitoring of kind, extent and degree of severity of degraded lands was conducted in Sirsa district (29.53 degrees N 75.02 degrees E) of north western Haryana with the help of geo-spatial techniques. Efforts have been made to identify and map the degraded lands of the district on 1: 50.000 scale using LANDSAT TM (1995) and IRS LISS-III (1A/B FCC; 2005-06 and 2015-16) satellite imagery. The area under various degraded land categories was computed for different seasons which reveal that wind erosion was major cause of soil degradation problem in the district since 1995. The area under degradation due to wind erosion was followed by water logging, anthropogenic activities and salinisation. Although the area occupied by anthropogenic activities was found to be low but their impact on environment is long term than naturally degraded soils. A significant decline is observed in all the degradation classes (except brick kilns) in successive years but however, water logging (permanent) shows increasing trend in 2005-06 and then decline in 2015-16. The reasons have been sorted out to explain the changing dynamics of degradation. The district was found to be degraded by various categories of land degradation subjected to slight to moderate degradation. The degraded lands have shown sharp decline from 28.4% in 1995 to 6.22% in 2015-16 of total geographical area of the district.

AB  - The article is dedicated to the different leisure practices of the French in the occupied Cairo. The alien culture of the Arab-Muslim world made the French to feel a longing for Europe, and therefore they tried to reproduce their habitual cultural environment and forms of leisure in Egypt, that was a natural reaction to the meeting with the oriental "Other". There were published newspapers and books; theater performances, musical evenings and balls were organized for the members of the expedition. Convinced of their high level of the civilization development, disregard for the "oriental people" and a profound difference in a worldview between the representatives of two cultures determined the desire to imitate the French way of life on the eastern land.

AB  - Objective. The aim of the study based oil CT images was to assess the age-related changes in maxillary sinus diameters in relation to diameters of the facial skeleton. Materials and Methods. The retrospective analysis of CT images of the head of 170 patients aged 0-18 years (85 females and 85 males) was performed. Specific orientation points (zy, zm, pr, ns, n, and P) were identified in every patient and the following distances were measured: zy-zy, maximum facial width; zm-zm, midfacial width; n-pr, upper facial height; ns-pr, alveolar facial height; and ns-P, distance not indicated in craniometry. Results. The maxillary sinuses of every patient were bilaterally measured in three planes. Three diameters were obtained: maximum transverse (horizontal) diameter called MSW, maximum vertical diameter called MSH, and maximum anteroposterior diameter (length) called MSL. In females, the correlation of MSW, MSH, and MSL and zy-zy, as well as n-pr distances, is very strong. Moreover, the significant correlation was found between all measurements of maxillary sinus and ns-pr as well as ns-P distances in females. The correlation between MSL and all measurements of midface as well as MSH and MSW and all measurements except ns-P is stronger in females than in males. In males, all measurements of max illary sinus correlate with ns-P distance very strongly. Conclusions. The statistical analysis (correlation and determination coefficient) showed that all measurements of maxillary sinuses correlate with midface dimensions.

AB  - Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has attracted special interests in ocean applications, but the fast estimation of ship velocity remains a big problem. A fast along-track velocity estimation method for moving targets is proposed in this manuscript. In our method, several defocusing filters are applied to the imaging result firstly. Exploiting the differences of the maximum of the filtered images, the along-track velocity of all moving targets can be estimated. Subsequently, instead of iterative estimation, a Look-Up-Table (LUT) technique is used to accelerate the estimation to satisfy the real-time processing demand. Finally, proposed method has been shown effective on both simulated and real TerraSAR-X dataset, demonstrating capabilities of accurately estimating along-track velocity.

CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The multi-season Pleiades image data were compared and analyzed for their capabilities of classifying and mapping the seven urban forest tree species in the City of Tampa, FL, USA to understand the seasonal effect on tree species classification accuracy. The seven species and groups included sand live oak (Quercus geminata), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), live oak (Q. virginiana), pine (species group), palm (species group), camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), and magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). A multi-level classification system was adopted to classify image objects of the tree species. Shade image objects (IOs) were spectrally normalized to similar sunlit IOs, and the tree species fractions were extracted from the seasonal images using a spectral unmixing approach and used as additional features. Using selected features extracted from the five individual season and the two dry-wet season combined Pleiades images, tree species were identified and mapped using a random Forest, support vector machines and a linear discriminant analysis classifiers. The experimental results indicate significantly improved tree species mapping accuracies using late spring season (April) image compared to all other seasonal images (p<0.01), and combined dry-wet season images performed even better. Results suggest a significant seasonal effect on tree species classification. The novel significance of this study was to demonstrate the potential of multi-season Pleiades imagery in improving urban tree species mapping. Therefore, in practice, it is important to choose appropriate seasonal remote sensing data for mapping tree species.

Fifty years on from Steinbeck's death, looking back on the range of his great achievement and his even greater range of productive experimental endeavor, we honor him best by collaborative engagement with his material and by forthright critique. Steinbeck died in 1968, just six years after receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature, but looking back across that great divide of social upheaval that followed, his readers will find much more than historical reflection, as important as that is.

T2  - Annals of Silvicultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially-explicit information on forest composition provides valuable information to fulfil scientific, ecological and management objectives and to monitor multiple changes in forest ecosystems. The recently developed Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery holds great potential for improving the classification of forest types at medium-large scales due to the concurrent availability of multispectral bands with high spatial resolution and quick revisit time. In this study, we tested the ability of S2 for forest type mapping in a Mediterranean environment. Three operational S2 images covering different phenological periods (winter, spring, summer) were processed and analyzed. Ten 10 m and 20 m bands available from S2 and four vegetation indices (Vls) were used to evaluate the ability of S2 to discriminate forest categories (conifer, broadleaved and mixed forests) and four forest types (beech forests: mixed spruce-fir forests; chestnut forests; mixed oak forests). We found that a single S2 image acquired in summer cannot discriminate neither the considered forest categories nor the forest types and therefore multitemporal images collected at different phenological periods are required. The best configuration yielded an accuracy > 83% in all considered forest types. We conclude that S2 can represent an effective option for repeated forest monitoring and mapping.

TI  - Combining UAV and Sentinel-2 auxiliary data for forest growing stock volume estimation through hierarchical model-based inference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed (RS) data are becoming increasingly important as sources of auxiliary information in forest resource assessments. Data from several satellites providing moderate image resolution are freely available (e.g. Sentinel-2). In addition, very-high-resolution three-dimensional data are available due to the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The increasing availability of auxiliary data offers new opportunities for largescale forest surveys using UAVs. A recently developed hierarchical model-based mode of inference makes it possible to use hierarchically nested auxiliary data in estimating population properties, such as total or mean biomass or volume, and their corresponding uncertainties in a statistically appropriate manner. In this study, hierarchical model-based inference was used to estimate growing stock volume (GSV; m(3) ha(-1)) and its variance using a small sample of field data, a larger sample of UAV data, and wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data in a study area in SE Norway. The main objective of the study was to compare the performance, in terms of precision, of hierarchical model-based inference (denoted Case C) against two alternative cases. These were (1) model-based inference based on field data and wall-to-wall data, collected either with airborne laser scanning (Case A.1) or Sentinel-2 data (Case A.2), and (2) hybrid inference using a small sample of field data and a larger sample of UAV data (Case B). A second objective was to assess the possibility of reducing the UAV sampling intensity when adopting Case C rather than 13, without decreasing the precision of the GSV estimates. The results, calculated as standard error as percentage of the mean ((SE) over cap (%)), indicated that in case C the precision was of similar magnitude ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.44%) as for Case A.1 ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.69%) and for Case B ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.58%). The standard error of Case A.2 was nearly twice as large ((SE) over cap (%) = 5.81%) as the rest of the cases. The results also indicated possibilities of reducing the UAV sampling intensity without losing precision in cases where wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data are available (Case C). The same precision for Case C with only five UAV samples was achieved as for Case B with 55 UAV samples. Thus, the study highlights the cost-efficiency of applications of UAV as in Case C and also provides first insights in the use of Sentinel-2 data for GSV estimation in boreal conditions.

AB  - The STEAM (SaTellite Earth observation for Atmospheric Modelling) project, funded by the European Space Agency, aims at investigating new areas of synergy between high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and data from spaceborne remote sensing sensors. An example of synergy is the incorporation of high-resolution remote sensing data products in NWP models. The rationale is that NWP models are presently able to produce forecasts with a spatial resolution in the order of 1 km, but unreliable surface information or poor knowledge of the initial state of the atmosphere may imply an inaccurate simulation of the weather phenomena. It is expected that forecast inaccuracies could be reduced by ingesting high resolution Earth Observation derived products into models operated at cloud resolving grid spacing. In this context, the Copernicus Sentinel satellites represent an important source of data, because they provide a set of high-resolution observations of physical variables (e.g. soil moisture, land/sea surface temperature, wind speed, columnar water vapor) used NWP models runs. This paper presents the first results of the experiments carried out in the framework of the STEAM project, regarding the ingestion/assimilation of surface information derived from Sentinel data into a NWP model. The experiments concern a flood event occurred in Tuscany (Central Italy) in September 2017. Moreover, in view of the assimilation of water vapor maps obtained by applying the SAR Interferometry technique to Sentinel-1 data, the results of the assimilation of Zenith total delay data derived from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) are also presented.

AB  - Water Quality assessment of lakes, rivers, and reservoirs is a key issue for environmental monitoring and management. Lakes are subjected to sudden environmental changes caused by anthropogenic activities due to their multiple uses (agriculture, fishing, and boating, industrial and water supply). One of the most important issues in lake water management is water quality. Water quality assessments are being carried out using conventional methods which are very common and accurate, however, have the disadvantage of being expensive and labor-intensive. Further, sampling method and frequency are the major constraints to obtain representative samples. In order to overcome such hurdles in water quality management remote sensing approach has become more user-friendly and quite reliable. Remote sensing approach to water quality assessment is based on the optical bands in the region from blue to near infrared. These data are then used to explore the relation between the reflectance of water bodies and biophysical parameters such as: transparency, chlorophyll concentration (phytoplankton), and the organic and mineral suspended sediments. In the present study, an attempt has been made to understand the water quality characteristics of a lake situated in coastal, Kerala, known as Vembanad lake (a Ramsar site in south India) using Landsat-TM data. A relationship between Landsat-TM bands and suspended sediment concentration has been arrived at and compared with the field monitored data. It is noticed that TM bands such as TM5, TM6, and TM7 show higher correlation with observed data than bands 1, 2, and 3.

AB  - The rise in water level of river may lead to changes in geological and artificial environments, thus triggering the possibility of different scales of geohazards on the slopes adjacent to the river. Therefore, initiation to detect and monitor the water levels of river with remote sensing data should be developed. In this research, a method in detecting the rise in river water level was developed. The principle of this method was to compare the camera's image keypoint features from before the overflow of river with the occurrence of the overflow of river in a determined span of time. This research used Color Differences to compare the images. The Delta E* distance metric was used to calculate the change in structural information of the images. It will be used as a reference in determining the river water level during normal conditions, rise and overflow. Keypoint value of an image may change if geohazard on the riverbank undergo a change caused by the inundation over the grass, soil, rocks on the riverbank. Determination of river water level was successfully done with the category of image difference consisting of normal level (Diff <= 20%), stand-by level (20% < Diff <= 30%), warning level (30% < Diff <= 40%) and alert level (Diff >= 50%). This system only works well in bright lighting conditions and not in dim conditions.

TI  - The Impact of Law on Syndromic Disease Surveillance Implementation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Legal environments influence how health information technologies are implemented in public health practice settings. Syndromic disease surveillance (SyS) is a relatively new approach to surveillance that depends heavily on health information technologies to achieve rapid awareness of disease trends. Evidence suggests that legal concerns have impeded the optimization of SyS.Objectives: To (1) understand the legal environments in which SyS is implemented, (2) determine the perceived legal basis for SyS, and (3) identify perceived legal barriers and facilitators to SyS implementation.Design: Multisite case study in which 35 key informant interviews and 5 focus groups were conducted with 75 SyS stakeholders. Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by 3 coders using thematic content analysis. Legal documents were reviewed.Setting: Seven jurisdictions (5 states, 1 county, and 1 city) that were purposively selected on the basis of SyS capacity and legal environment.Participants: Health department directors, SyS system administrators, legal counsel, and hospital personnel.Results: Federal (eg, HIPAA) and state (eg, notifiable disease reporting) laws that authorize traditional public health surveillance were perceived as providing a legal basis for SyS. Financial incentives for hospitals to satisfy Meaningful Use regulations have eased concerns about the legality of SyS and increased the number of hospitals reporting SyS data. Legal issues were perceived as barriers to BioSense 2.0 (the federal SyS program) participation but were surmountable.Conclusion: Major legal reforms are not needed to promote more widespread use of SyS. The current legal environment is perceived by health department and hospital officials as providing a firm basis for SyS practice. This is a shift from how law was perceived when SyS adoption began and has policy implications because it indicates that major legal reforms are not needed to promote more widespread use of the technology. Beyond SyS, our study suggests that federal monetary incentives can ameliorate legal concerns regarding novel health information technologies.

TI  - A Stochastic Approach to Estimate Distribution of Built-Up Area in Regions with Thick Tree Cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Buildings and other human-made constructions have been accepted as an indicator of human habitation and are identified as built-up area. Identification of built-up area in a region and its subsequent measurement is a key step in many fields of studies like urban planning, environmental studies, and population demography. Remote sensing techniques utilising medium resolution images (e.g. LISS III, Landsat) are extensively used for the extraction of the built-up area as high-resolution images are expensive, and its processing is difficult. Extraction of built land use from medium resolution images poses a challenge in regions like Western-Ghats, North-East regions of India, and countries in tropical region, due to the thick evergreen tree cover. The spectral signature of individual houses with a small footprint are easily overpowered by the overlapping tree canopy in a medium resolution image when the buildings are not clustered. Kerala is a typical case for this scenario. The research presented here proposes a stochastic-dasymetric process to aid in the built-up area recognition process by taking Kerala as a case study. The method utilises a set of ancillary information to derive a probability surface. The ancillary information used here includes distance from road junctions, distance from road network, population density, built-up space visible in the LISS III image, the population of the region, and the household size. The methodology employs logistic regression and Monte Carlo simulation in two sub processes. The algorithm estimates the built-up area expected in the region and distributes the estimated built-up area among pixels according to the probability estimated from the ancillary information. The output of the algorithm has two components. The first component is an example scenario of the built-up area distribution. The second component is a probability surface, where the value of each pixel denotes the probability of that pixel to have a significant built-up area within it. The algorithm is validated for regions in Kerala and found to be significant. The model correctly predicted the built-up pixel count count over a validation grid of 900 m in 95.2% of the cases. The algorithm is implemented using Python and ArcGIS.

AB  - Hydrocarbon microseepage is a common phenomenon occurring in areas with the presence of onshore oil and gas reservoirs, characterized by the abnormal natural surface spectral landscape characteristics of mineral alteration features and geobotanic anomalies that can be detected by satellite imagery. Therefore, this study aims to find spatial models of oil and gas reservoirs through detection approaches of hydrocarbon microseepage and its relation with the physical condition of study area by utilized the satellite imagery. The parameters used in are alteration symptoms of clay-carbonate, ferric iron, and ferrous iron minerals, geobotanic anomaly symptoms, geology characteristic, and geomorphology characteristic. A multispectral satellite imagery of Sentinel 2 was used as an input for the directed principal component analysis (DPCA) method and vegetation index, to detect mineral alteration phenomenon and geobotanic anomaly, respectively. Then each parameter was integrated using fuzzy logic method giving a result of the distribution of hydrocarbon microseepage area. As a results, this study indicates the presence of hydrocarbon microseepage phenomenon in the research area with the extent of 488,3 Ha or 1,46% of the total of research area. The distribution of hydrocarbon microseepage is distributed in area around oil and gas field, and also linear distributed around Merang River. The distribution of hydrocarbon microseepage in study area also agglomerated in Kasai Formation, area near fault, and the area with lacustrine landform characteristics.

AB  - Volcanic ash produced by eruptions has been significantly dangerous towards aviation. The necessity of volcanic ash early warning system distribution is crucial to reduce casualties on aircraft accident. In this paper, some techniques of volcanic ash detection were compared to find the proper algorithm to visualize the volcanic ash distribution. The multispectral image was acquired from the geostationary satellite (Himawari - 8 satellite) in specific time observation. The reference data were collected from the MODIS sensor in the Aqua satellite to monitor the volcanic ash distribution at the same time and place. The first method is to generate the value of brightness temperature differences (BTD) at 11 mu m and 12 mu m wavelengths. The second method is conducted by inserting 3.9 mu m information from the product of three-band volcanic ash known as (TVAP). The third method is a combination of the first and second method while the last method utilizes RGB composite color combination from several bands of Himawari - 8. The reference data collected by MODIS Observation at 06.00 UTC. The BTD technique unable to detect low-intensity volcanic ash, while combining it with the TVAP method can increase the standard method performance. Based on expert judgment, BTD technique has a good performance for thick volcanic ash although unable to detect thin volcanic ash distribution. Three-band Volcanic Ash Product (TVAP) method could detect thick and thin volcanic ash. The combination of BTD and TVAP method has an excellent result to observe volcanic ash distribution, but the result tends to overestimate like TVAP distribution. RGB Methods from JMA Configuration have the same pattern and distribution of volcanic ash as MODIS observation. Based on the study results, BTD, TVAP, and RGB composite methods can produce good results compared to MODIS imagery for monitoring the volcanic ash distribution.

AB  - Pandeglang district is one of the fishery production centers in Banten province which is the largest producer of high economic fish in Banten province. One of the dominant species caught is mackerel (Rastrelliger spp). Production of mackerel is fluctuated due to the condition of fishing areas that are always changing related to the fertility of the waters. Lack of information to fishermen associated with fishing areas leads to unstable catches. This study aims to provide an overview of the fertility of waters around Pandeglang waters using sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a parameters based on satellite data during the western and transitional season (January to May) 2017. The method used in this study is survey method by collecting primary data in the form of catch and capture data, sea surface temperature and chlorophylla data in some fishing areas, and secondary data of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a during the west season and transitional seasons taken from AQUA MODIS satellite images. The results of this study indicated that the highest yield of mackerel fish obtained in May is about 98 kg/trip with sea surface temperature conditions ranging from 30.49 degrees C 31.10 degrees C and chlorophyll-a concentrations between 0.21 - 0.58 mg/L. This condition can be used as a reference in determining potential fishing areas that are beneficial to fishermen, especially in Pandeglang regency.

AB  - An automatic multi-temporal method is proposed in this paper for cloud detection without known the reference image in prior. A series of reference images are provided by fitting robustly of the pixels of multi-temporal images contaminated by clouds to show the inherent gradual change of the landscape with time instants. Then the cloud is detected by thresholding the difference between the target and the reference images, which is found to be merely composed of the regression model error modeled as Gaussian noise and outliers corresponding to cloud and its shadow. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on the LANDSAT dataset, and shows a better discrimination of cloud and cloud shadow covered pixels from the uncontaminated ones.

AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data contains near continuous spectral information of the object, which is very suitable for mineral classification and geologic body mapping. However, the collecting of a lot of labeled hyperspectral data is expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive. We choose a semi-supervised method to classify hyperspectral data based on a generative adversarial nertwork (GAN), just use a small amount of labeled data, named HSGAN. The GAN is made up of a generator and a discriminator, and the generator generates data similar to the real data so that the discriminator cannot tell if it is real data or generated data. We designed a one-dimensional GAN to extract spectral features from hyperspectral data. Using this method, we test the Tianshan hyperspectral data and use the actual geological map as the ground-truth produced by us. We find that HSGAN still achieves better results than the traditional CNN and SVM.

TI  - Comparison of deterministic and data-driven models for solar radiation estimation in China
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Solar radiation is an indispensable input for many applications, contributing to different fields, including energy, meteorology, ecology, agriculture and industry. A lot of parameterization schemes have been developed for estimating solar radiation in sites around the world. This paper presented a comparative study on the performances of four shortwave solar radiation (SSR) models in different climates, including Yang's hybrid model (YHM), an efficient physically based model (EPP), an hourly solar radiation model (HSRM) and a neural network model (ANNM). Daily meteorological variables observed at 837 stations in China were used as model inputs for YHM and ANNM. MODIS atmospheric and land products (MOD08_D3, MYD08_D3, MOD08_M3, MYD08M3, MOD09CMG, and MYD09CMG) were used to derive the required parameters for EPP and HSRM. Cloud fraction and solar zenith angle were found to be the major parameters influencing the model accuracies. The results indicated that YHM performed superior to EPP, ANNM and HSRM with daily mean RMSE of 2.414, 2.535, 2.855 and 3.645 MJm(-2)day(-1), respectively. The monthly mean RMSE for all models were generally higher in July (3.37 MJm(-2)day(-1)) and lower in January (1.997 MJm(-2)day(-1)). It was observed that the monthly mean RMSE was 2.95 MJm(-2) day(-1) in humid areas, while it is 2.773 MJm(-2)day(-1) in semi-arid areas. Monthly and annual mean SSR (ASSR) during 2002-2015 were calculated to reveal the spatial and temporal variations of SSR across China using daily meteorological data, MOD08_M3 and MOD08_M3 products based on YHM and EPP models. The result showed that there was not obvious variation trends for ASSR in China, the largest value (14.521 MJm(-2)day(-1)) was observed in 2003, while the smallest ASSR (14.182 MJm(-2)day(-1)) was in 2014; the ASSR values were generally higher in Qinghai-Tibet and lower in northeastern China.

AB  - This study presents a classification framework for the urban Local Climate Zones (LCZs) based on a Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet) architecture. In order to make full use of the temporal and spectral information contained in modern Earth observation data, multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images are exploited. After training the ResNet, independent predictions are made from the multi-seasonal images. Subsequently, the seasonal predictions are fused in a decision fusion step based on majority voting. A systematical experiment is carried out in a large-scale study area located in the center of Europe. A significant accuracy improvement can be achieved by applying majority voting on multi-seasonal predictions. Based on the results, the main challenges and possible solutions of urban LCZ classification are further discussed, providing guidance for large-scale urban LCZ mapping.

AB  - This paper evaluates different spectral-spatial features that can be extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery regarding their relevance for discriminating different Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classes. The features include spectral reflectance, spectral indices, Morphological Profiles (MPs), as well as Global Urban Footprint (GUF), the Open Street Map layers buildings and land use, and their combinations. Using a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet), a systematic analysis of feature importance is performed with a manually generated dataset distributed in Europe. The results of this evaluation are meant to provide guidance about the choice of both spectral and spatial features for the task of LCZ classification on a global scale. The results show that GUF and OSM can contribute to the classification performance, and ResNet relies less on additional features with the highest accuracy provided by the reflectance only.

AB  - Thanks to the development of satellite remote sensing technology, more observing data are acquired and can be used for various purposes. However, statistical data show that half of the earth's surface is covered by clouds, which may seriously influence the usability of remote sensing data. Most existing cloud detection methods are manual or semi-automatic methods with low efficiency. This paper focuses on automatic cloud detection over sea surface from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. A novel cloud detection framework named DBN-Otsu Hybrid Model (DOHM) has been proposed, which combines Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Otsu's method for the first time. DOHM adopts adaptive thresholds to replace manual interventions, implementing full automation. Experimental results show that DOHM achieves the highest average accuracy ratio among the six detection methods. Moreover, DOHM makes a good balance between False Alarm Rate (FAR) and Miss Rate (MR).

TI  - Passive microwave remote sensing of lake freeze-thawing over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The freezing of the lake is one of the sensitive factors of g lobal climate change, which affects regional and global climate. There are many lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, however, the freeze-thawing ground monitoring data is very seriously lacking. The microwave has the characteristics of water phase sensitivity, hi g h temporal resolution and long historical data, which are of great value for the monitoring of long-term lake ice phenology. However, the passive microwave has a low spatial resolution, and the brightness temperature of the lake has the challenge of positioning accuracy. The paper obtained the orbital brightness temperature data of AMSR-E/2 from the Aqua and Gcom-W1 satellite, and constructed the method of threshold freeze-thawing, which were based on the orbital brightness temperature data. These two methods were tested in different re g ions and sizes of lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Lake Qinghai, Siling Co, Lake Hala and Lake Aqikekule).The results showed that the maximum error of the freeze-up end date and the break-up start date were less than 3 days in comparison with the g round observation of Lake Qinghai, and compared with the results of the non-cloud optical remote sensing test, the parameters of the freeze-thawin g parameters of the four lakes were 2-4 days. The study suggests that based on the brightness temperature data of passive microwave orbit, it is possible to achieve the acquisition of freeze-thawin g information of sub-pixel large and medium-sized lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and using historical satellite data can provide an important reference for the monitoring of lake ice.

TI  - Lithostratigraphic Classification Method Combining Optimal Texture Window Size Selection and Test Sample Purification Using Landsat 8 OLI Data
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), as a measure of spatial features has been used as supplemental information to improve image classification accuracy for lithological recognition. Window size is an important parameter for texture extraction, which will affect the extracted texture results. Besides, the existence of mixed pixels in image usually causes errors in test samples, which significantly influences the credibility of accuracy assessment. Thus, this paper proposes a lithological classification method combined with optimal texture window size selection and test sample purification. Firstly, optimal window size pre-estimated based on semivariogram was used to calculated GLCM texture of image. Secondly, based on multidimensional textural and spectral features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was employed to classify the image. Thirdly, using the proposed sample purification method and textural features of image, sample purification rules were created based on attribute coherence to remove the test sample points that conflicted with the rules. Finally, the validity of the semivariogram-based texture extraction window selection was verified by classifications based on Angular Second Moment (ASM) of different window sizes combined with spectral features. Also, the accuracies between different combinations of classifications were assessed by test samples with and without sample purification. Experimental results show that the pre-estimated texture window size can guarantee a classification result with high classification accuracy for lithological classification. The results also demonstrated that the accuracy of lithological classification based on spectral features and ASM textural features was the highest. The overall lithological classification accuracy and kappa value, without sample purification selected by stratified sampling, were respectively 87.4% and 0.84, however those with sample purification were respectively 88.01% and 0.85. The results show that the proposed method is capable of yielding more reliable lithostratigraphic identification.

AB  - Global climate change has been resulting in more extreme weather and climate events, such as drought and heat wave. Food security has become a critical issue because of global population increase and extreme weather and climate events. The Horn of Africa (HOA, including Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia) is one of the most food-insecure regions in the world. Millions of people in the HOA are undernourished and at the risk of famine. Food security is a very complicated and interdisciplinary problem across many sectors. To study food security, it is essential to investigate innovative solutions to integrate and analyze various related data and information, especially satellite remote sensing measurements from space, and weather and climate information from ground observations. Satellite Remote sensing measurements have advantages in spatial and temporal coverage and can be used for long-term monitoring of crop status and drought events from space. This study aims to investigate the impacts of extreme agriculture drought and food security in the HOA region using the remote sensing data products from the NASA MODIS Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), a key instrument onboard the NASA satellites Terra and Aqua. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Vegetation Health Index (VIII) data from year 2000 to 2017 are derived from the MODIS land surface reflectance and land surface temperature products and analyzed for assessment of vegetation health and the impacts of extreme drought events. The spatial patterns and temporal trends of vegetation stress and extreme drought events are discovered, which demonstrates the critical regions and period with food security. The results also show that the drought and food insecurity have increasing trends. For a case study, the strongest El Nino event of 20152016 impacting on extreme drought events in the HOA is analyzed. This study provides an integrated approach to food security monitoring and assessment, which is very helpful for in decision making and strategic planning for agriculture management, disaster relief and food security.

AB  - The Tonle Sap Lake plays a very important role in regulating the downstream flood of the Mekong River. It is necessary to understand its temporal changes of water area of the lake and to analyze its relation with the flood processes of the Mekong River. Monthly water area from June 2013 to May 2014 were monitored based on the multi- temporal images of HJ- 1 satellite in this paper. Normalized difference water index (NDWI) was used to extract the water area. It is found that the water area of the lake had a dramatic increase from September to December. Moreover, after reaching its maximum in December 2013, the water area quickly decreased by 11463km(2) in only half month time from December to January. It kept rather stable at a lower level from February to May in 2014. It is feasible, fast and reliable to monitor and analyze the change of lake water area based on remote sensing method with important application prospect.

TI  - Modeling leaf area index in North America using a process-based terrestrial ecosystem model
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is often used to quantify plant production and evapotranspiration with terrestrial ecosystem models (TEMs). This study evaluated the LAI simulation in North America using a data assimilation technique and a process-based TEM as well as insitu and satellite data. We first optimized the parameters related to LAI in the TEM using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and AmeriFlux site-level and regional LAI data from advanced very high-resolution radiometer. The parameterized model was then verified with the observed monthly LAI of major ecosystem types at site level. Simulated LAI was compared well with the observed data at sites of Harvard Forest (R-2 = 0.96), University of Michigan Biological Station (R-2 = 0.87), Howland Forest (R-2 = 0.96), Morgan Monroe State Forest (R-2 = 0.85), Shidler Tallgrass Prairie (R-2 = 0.82), and Donaldson (R-2 = 0.75). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between modeled and satellite-based monthly LAI in North America is 1.4 m(2)/m(2) for the period of 1985-2010. The simulated average monthly LAI in recent three decades increased by (3 +/- 0.5)% in the region, with 1.24, 1.46, and 2.21 m(2)/m(2) on average, in Alaska, Canada, and the conterminous United States, respectively, which is consistent with satellite data. The model performed well for wet tundra, boreal forest, temperate coniferous forests, temperate deciduous forests, grasslands, and xeric shrublands (RMSE < 1.5 m(2)/m(2)), but not for alpine tundra and xeric woodlands (RMSE > 1.5 m(2)/m(2)). Both the spring and fall LAI in the 2000s are higher than that in the 1980s in the region, suggesting that the leaf phenology has an earlier onset and later senescence in the 2000s. The average LAI increased in April and September by 0.03 and 0.24 m(2)/m(2), respectively. This study provides a way to quantify LAI with ecosystem models, which will improve future carbon and water cycling studies.

TI  - Extremely Sparse Stripe Noise Removal From Nonremote-Sensing Images by Straight Line Detection and Neighborhood Grayscale Weighted Replacement
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods of stripe noise removal based on space domain or transformation domain generally cannot handle the case where the noise is extremely sparse. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach to accurately detect and remove the stripe noise by analyzing the directional and structural information of the stripe noise. First, we build a preselected stripe noise lines set by using local progressive probabilistic Hough transform. Subsequently, the real stripe noise lines are screened out from this set according to the feature of grayscale discontinuities. Finally, our approach uses the strategy of neighborhood grayscale weighted replacement and a local Gaussian filter to perform image destriping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach proposed in this paper outperforms other recent promising methods in terms of quantitative assessments, qualitative assessments, and computing time.

AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) is a critical factor in assessing wildfire risk and its behaviour. Traditional field measurement of this variable is time-consuming and is impossible to extend to large-scale and dynamic applications. The canopy water has strong absorption characteristic in near and shortwave infrared spectra, allowing the near-real-time, multi-temporal and -spatial estimation of the FMC from remotely sensed data available. During last decade, numerous statistic-or physical model-based studies were carried out for the estimation of this variable. As FMC is responsive to weather variations, diurnal determination of this variable is essential for wildfire early-warning. With the launch of Himawari-8 in 2014, 10 mins images are available from this satellite, making real-time retrieval of the FMC achievable. Thus, this is the first study to retrieve diurnal FMC from Himawari-8 images, with the purpose for real-time wildfire risk assessment in near future.

AB  - Crop residues protect the soil against erosion, improve runoff water quality and determine C sequestration. Thus, the capability to assess crop residue cover can improve predictions of the impact of agricultural practices. Our objective was to develop a method to alleviate the adverse effect of variable moisture conditions on crop residue estimates from satellite imagery. Fields with uneven and with uniform water distribution were identified in satellite images (WorldView-3) from Maryland (USA). The results showed that moisture correction of spectral bands based on a water index reduced the root mean square error of most common residue indices, NDTI (Normalized Difference Tillage Index) and SINDRI (Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index). If bands are available, crop residue estimation should be based on SINDRI. If only Landsat or Sentinel-2 satellites are available, crop residues estimated combining NDTI with a water index could alleviate the adverse effect of variable moisture conditions.

TI  - Primitive Liberals and Pirate Tribes: Black-Flag Radicalism and the Kibbo Kift
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMPERIAL AND COMMONWEALTH HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Age of Catastrophe (1914-1945) has long been considered a crisis of liberalism. As a political platform and moralistic worldview, the hollowness of liberalism's promise was exposed when total war struck at the heart of Europe, undermining its presumption of imperial hegemony over much of the world. What emerged in its wake, amid the swells of irremediable nationalisms, is the subject of this article. Blinded by the fog of war and bright lights of modernity, historians often fail to catch the glimpses of alternative aspirations, which escaped the age's ruptures so as to reinvent and redeem humanity from the depths of its bloody past. Against a backdrop of neglected case studies from Britain and elsewhere - from the Luddites to the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift - this article seeks to show how the spectre of death inspired new ideals of youth and civility that rejected the arrogance of imperial masculinity and industrialised oppression, turning instead to visions of global kinship that were socialist and anarchic, romantic and utopian, primitive and piratical.

TI  - Thermally-enhanced spectral indices to discriminate burn severity in Mediterranean forest ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING OF ECOSYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY XV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Fires are a problematic and recurrent issue in Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Accurate discrimination of burn severity level is fundamental for the rehabilitation planning of affected areas. Though fieldwork is still necessary for measuring post-fire burn severity, remote sensing based techniques are being widely used to predict it because of their computational simplicity and straightforward application. Among them, spectral indices classification (especially difference Normalized Burn Ratio -dNBR-based ones) may be considered the standard remote sensing based method to distinguish burn severity level. In this work we show how this methodology may be improved by using land surface temperature (LST) to enhance the standard spectral indices. We considered a large wildfire in August 2012 in North Western Spain. The Composite Burn Index (CBI) was measured in 111 field plots and grouped into three burn severity levels. Relationship between Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) LST-enhanced spectral indices and CBI was evaluated by using the normalized distance between two burn severity levels and spectral dispersion graphs. Inclusion of LST in the spectral index equation resulted in higher discrimination between burn severity levels than standard spectral indices (0.90, 8.50, and 17.52 NIR-SWIR Temperature version 1 vs 0.60, 2.83, and 6.46 NBR). Our results demonstrate the potential of LST for improving burn severity discrimination and mapping. Future research, however, is needed to evaluate the performance of the proposed LST-enhanced spectral indices in other fire regimes, and forest ecosystems.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Mapping semi-natural grassland has become increasingly important with regard to climate variability, invasive species, and the intensification of land use. At the same time, adequate field data collection is of pivotal importance for national and international reporting obligations, such as the European Habitats Directive. We present a remote-sensing-based monitoring framework for a Natura 2000 site with a heterogeneous composition of different grassland communities, using the Random Forest algorithm. Automated training data selection was successfully implemented based on the Random Forest proximity measure (Overall Accuracy ranging from 77.5-86.5%). RapidEye acquisitions originating from the onset of vegetation (prespring and first spring) and senescence (late summer and first autumn) were identified as important phenological phases for mapping semi-natural grassland communities. The derived probability maps of occurrences for each grassland class captured transitions between grassland communities and are therefore a better approximation of real-world conditions compared to classical, discrete maps.

TI  - The influence of an environmental management system on the environmental worldviews of selected Namibian and South African in-service teachers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A recurring theme in contemporary environmental theory is the need for society to change to a new ecological paradigm. This study informs on the influence of an environmental management system on the environmental worldviews of selected Namibian and South African in-service teachers. A pre and post structural questionnaire based on the new ecological paradigm was developed and tested to understand teacher's implementation of environmental management in schools. The findings revealed a positive inclination by the teachers to subscribe their personal and collective agency to pro-ecological tendencies. The Mann-Whitney test revealed a moderate size shift in worldview towards the pro-ecological and anti-anthropocentric tendencies of the new ecological paradigm The latter shows that teachers still believe in the dominant social paradigm and attitudes towards the environment and values may shift. It is recommended that teachers and schools be encouraged to support the inclusion of an environmental management system to enhance sustainability practices.

AB  - Remote sensing has established as key technology for monitoring of environmental degradation such as forest clearing. One of the state-of-the-art microwave EO systems for forest monitoring is Japan's L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 which provides outstanding means for observing tropical forests due its cloud and canopy penetration capability. However, the complexity of the physical backscattering properties of forests and the associated spatial and temporal variabilities, render straightforward change detection methods based on simple thresholding rather inaccurate with high false alarm rates. In this paper, we develop a framework to alleviate problems caused by forest backscatter variability. We define three essential elements, namely "structures of density", "speed of change", and "expansion patterns" which are obtained by differential computing between two repeatpass PALSAR-2 images. To improve both the detection and assessing of deforestation, a "deforestation behavior pattern" is sought through temporal machine learning mechanism of the three proposed elements. Our results indicate that the use of "structure of density" can introduce a more robust performance for detecting deforestation. Meanwhile, "speed of change" and "expansion pattern" are capable to provide additional information with respect to the drivers of deforestation and the land-use change.

AB  - The track record of livestock development interventions in promoting sustained poverty reduction is believed to be meagre. Could it be that the track record of livestock development interventions is so meagre because of the influence of a reductionistic worldview? The Cartesian worldview has been extremely influential in Western culture and broader. Central in this worldview is a thinking in terms of traditional versus modern and subject (ive) versus object(ive). It has been argued that in development cooperation this has given rise to projectivistic thinking and acting where reality, including the realities of farmers and others, is only meaningless material, to be freely given shape based on a rational design. This is accompanied by an attitude in which our by and large individualistic Western society with its (presumed) institutional mechanicism - such as the market mechanism - is seen to be the model for other societies as well. Finally, we can note a marginalisation of religion and worldview in the public debate. The aim of this contribution is thereforeto analyse in a qualitative way whether such traces of the Cartesian worldview can be linked to development programmes' successes or failures in achieving impact. To this end, a set of eight impact evaluations of dairy development interventions in Kenya are considered, spanning the period 2007-2014. We (1) analyse what positive and negative effects - as emerging from the evaluation documents - have resulted from these interventions; (2) normatively reflect on what the evaluation documents posit as positive and negative effects; (3) analyse whether we can speak of a significant influence of the Cartesian worldview in such interventions; and (3) establish whether there is a relationship between the degree to which projects and programs embody a Cartesian worldview and their respective success or failure. Even though results are not available yet, and the relationship between the influence of a Cartesian worldview and a project or program's success is hypothetical, we at least expect to provide a typology of positive and negative effects of Kenyan dairy development interventions, and be able to show to which degree projects and programs are influenced by the Cartesian worldview.

AB  - Nowadays, the ecosystem service framework can be accepted for designing and completion of different management strategies to preserve and restore ecosystems. The present study will contribute to increase the stakeholders' interest to wetlands condition and possibilities for better management aiming at improving the ecosystems services they provide. For the research of the wetland in the area of quarry lakes in Negovan village interim ecological monitoring (IEM) using remote sensing data after restoration measures have been implemented. The aim of IEM is to obtain results for the wetland actual condition and restoration process efficiency for ecosystems services assessment. Based on the generated data an interim ecological monitoring methodology (MIEM) implying different remote sensing data (different temporal intervals, spectral and spatial resolution) has been designed. The model functions entirely within Geographical Information System (GIS). It generates data for the actual environmental condition of the wetland in different temporal intervals. The obtained results for the wetland actual condition have been used for defining the values of Disturbance Index (DI), which in turn is defined based on orthogonalization of multispectral satellite data from Sentinel 2 -Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat for different temporal intervals. DI rates are determined through Wetness component and Greenness component. Ecosystem services are assigned based on the correlation between vegetation and water surface area that is connected to water balance/budget. The space distribution of vegetation is specified on the base of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI) for different temporal intervals of the research. This paper presents results for evaluation the potential for delivery of ecosystem services taking into consideration the environmental and ecological processes behind the services that have been assessed at a relevant scale generated.

AB  - In recent years on the territory of Bulgaria it has been observed the existence of events with extreme character - floods, forest fires, etc.- that have a negative effect on ecosystems and ecosystem services. The purpose of the present research is the application of remote sensing for ecological monitoring implementation for the ecosystems upon the appearance of natural hazards. In this paper a methodology for ecological monitoring in different temporal intervals has been proposed and additionally the results from the application of remote sensing for the purpose of ecosystem monitoring and risk assessment in case of events that induce negative effect on ecosystems have been presented. The methodology and criteria have been implemented in observing different types of ecosystems. For the purpose of the present investigation satellite data with different spatial, temporal and spectral resolution from Sentinel 2, Landsat and air photo images have been used. Terrestrial data have been used for results verification and validation. The introduced results have been obtained for different temporal intervals from ecological monitoring, on which base criteria for optimization of the temporal characteristics of the ecological monitoring have been suggested. The present research is with conformance of Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora and Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds. The results from the completed research can be of benefit for defining concrete actions for the implementation of measurements appointed in the Action Plan for nature, people and the economy of 27.4.2017 COM(2017) 198.

AB  - Paradigm is the biggest framework of difference in science. Lincoln and Guba (2000) define it as a system of basic assumptions, a worldview that directs research in determining the methodology and ontological framework. Paradigm restricts and extends objects, paradigm leads to the formulation of problems with ways of solving them. The practice of art education requires the theory of art education, because the theory of art education benefits, among others (1) as a guide to knowing the direction and objectives to be achieved (2) reducing errors in educational practices because by understanding which theories can be chosen and which should not be done and (3) as a benchmark to find out how far the success of education is. Education as a process of self-help, in fact, something attempts to cultivate human beings with all their human qualities. The elaboration of the aspects of the theater includes text/play, plot (plot), characterization (characteristics or character), setting (setting).

AB  - Rooftop rainwater harvesting refers to the collection and storage of water from rooftops whereby the quality of harvested rainwater depend on the types of roof and the environmental conditions. This system is capable to support the water supply in almost any place either as a sole source or by reducing stress on other sources through water savings. Remote sensing and GIS have been widely used in urban environmental analysis. Thus, this study aimed to develop the roofing layer in order to assess the potential area for rooftop rainwater harvesting adoption by integrating remote sensing and GIS approach. An urban area containing various urban roofing materials and characteristics was selected. High resolution satellite imagery acquired from WorldView-3 satellite systems with 0.3 m of spatial resolution was used in order to obtain spectral and spatial information of buildings and roofs. For quality assessment, the physical and chemical parameters of the rooftop harvested rainwater were performed according to the Standard Tests for Water and Wastewater. The potential area for rooftop rainwater harvesting adoption can be identified with the detail information of the rooftops and quality assessment in geospatial environment.

AB  - We have examined the land surface changes in the Lidder Valley of Kashmir in the context of socio-economy, climate and environmental aspect using geoscience technology. It was found that there are large-scale changes in agriculture, horticulture and built-up in the subject area. Records for horticulture, agriculture and built-up were generated from satellite data. A geodatabase of socio-economic data is examined and corelated with the land system changes. Furthermore, environmental driving factors like precipitation, temperature, snowfall and black carbon (BC) data were used to relate with the changes in LU/LC over the study area. This study reports decrease in agricultural area from 189.73 km2 in 1979 to 77.18 km2 in 2011 while the horticulture is increasing by 3 km2 annually from last three decades. With the increase of about 95% in horticulture, the concentration of BC has also increased. BC is showing a significant decadal increase of 10.5 mg/m2 which is mainly attributed to the biomass burning from horticulture waste. Rainfall, as well as snowfall over the study area, is decreasing by an amount of 2.95 and 15 mm per decade, respectively, and also their pattern is changing. These variations over the study area result in water scarcity forcing people to implement horticulture.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccine was introduced into the Extended Program on Immunization in Madagascar in May 2014. We analyzed trends in prevalence of all cause diarrhea and rotavirus hospitalization in children <5years of age before and after vaccine introduction and assessed trend of circulating rotavirus genotypes at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Mere Enfant Tsaralalana (CHU MET).METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2016, we reviewed the admission logbook to observe the rate of hospitalization caused by gastroenteritis among 19619 children <5years of age admitted at the hospital. In June 2013-December 2016, active rotavirus surveillance was also conducted at CHUMET with support from WHO. Rotavirus antigen was detected by EIA from stool specimen of children who are eligible for rotavirus gastroenteritis surveillance at sentinel site laboratory and rotavirus positive specimens were further genotyped at Regional Reference Laboratory by RT-PCR.RESULTS: Diarrhea hospitalizations decreased after rotavirus vaccine introduction. The median proportion of annual hospitalizations due to diarrhea was 26% (range: 31-22%) before vaccine introduction; the proportion was 25% the year of vaccine introduction, 17% in 2015 and 16% in 2016. Rotavirus positivity paralleled patterns observed in diarrhea. Before vaccine introduction, 56% of stool specimens tested positive for rotavirus; the percent positive was 13% in 2015, 12% in 2016. Diverse genotypes were detected in the pre-vaccine period; the most common were G3P[8] (n=53; 66%), G2P[4] (n=12; 15%), and G1P[8] (n=11; 14%). 6 distinct genotypes were found in 2015; the most common genotype was G2P[4] (n=10; 67%), the remaining, 5, G12[P8], G3[P8], G1G3[P4], G3G12[P4][P8] and G1G3[NT] had one positive specimen each.CONCLUSIONS: Following rotavirus vaccine introduction all-cause diarrhea and rotavirus-specific hospitalizations declined dramatically. The most common genotypes detected in the pre-vaccine period were G3P[8] and G2P[4] in 2015, the post vaccine period.

AB  - Due to the issue of climate change as a public concern, information of carbon stock availability play an important role to describe the condition of forest ecosystems in the context of sustainable forest management. This study has the objective to identify land cover change during 2 decades (1996 - 2016) in the forest region and estimate the value of forest carbon stocks in west Java Province using remote sensing imagery. The land cover change information was obtained by visually interpreting the Landsat image, while the estimation of the carbon stock value was performed using the transformation of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which extracted from Landsat image. Biomass value is calculated by existing allometric equations. The results of this study shows that the forest area in the forest region of West Java Province have decreased from year to year, and the estimation value of forest carbon stock in the forest region of West Java Province also decreased from year to year.

TI  - Marx-From Hegel and Feuerbach to Adam Smith: A New Synthesis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - In The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (completed in August 1844), Marx takes two crucial steps in the formation of his worldview. The first relates to his rejection of all "old" materialism, including Feuerbach's, and the adoption of his own version, which he called "communist," "practical." This view was later presented definitively in the first thesis on Feuerbach (spring of 1845) and elaborated in The German Ideology (1845-1846). The second step relates to Marx's synthesising of the philosophical standpoint that he had developed up to this point (around the spring of 1844) with political economy. Up to this point, he had spoken of alienation in largely philosophical terms; now it is rooted in the process of production. On both counts Adam Smith was an important influence. This claim provides the focus of this paper. To make this point successfully, the author has found it necessary to trace briefly the development of Marx's philosophical standpoint up to the writing of the Manuscripts, and to distinguish between the two methodologically distinct aspects of Adam Smith's thought: the one that Marx accepted and the other that he rejected.

TI  - Youths' navigations of botanical gardens: bids for recognition, ways to desettle practice
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - How can we desettle' the colonial discourse and worldview of botanical gardens and its practices in teaching about plants? How can we move towards engaging deeply with who we are and think we are in relation to place, land, and the world, grounded in an intricate sense of harmony? How can we move our work in botanic gardens beyond regarding land, plants, and nature as commodities for causal consumption, or as places to rapidly observe but typically not touch? I explore these three questions in this paper through a weaving together of some of the literature on education and informal learning in botanical gardens and narratives from my research with urban youth of color in the Botanical Garden of Montreal. In doing so, I make evident youths' navigations of botanical gardens and their bids for recognition as other than detached from nature. Together, these narratives help to rethink taken for granted practices of education about plants in gardens grounded in Western views of science and lack of a more serious engagement with holistic perspectives of humans in and with nature.

AB  - Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to sea level rise due to the climate change. Soil salinity is one of the potential threat to the coastal ecosystem and agriculture which might hinder the country's future food security. Conventional field-based soil salinity monitoring over vast region may not be cost and time efficient. Satellite remote sensing is offering an efficient way to monitor soil salinity via different indices. This study monitors soil salinity in five years interval from 1990 to 2015 using a regression equation which is developed and tested in the same geographical area to calculate soil salinity from Landsat images. The result shows that soil salinity increases significantly in most of the part of the study area in 25 years period. The percentage of very high saline soil is increased from less than 1% in 1990 to 33% in 2015 which is very alarming for the agriculture growth in this area.

AB  - The main objective of this report is to examine the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) stability in the NOAA/NESDIS Global Vegetation Index (GVI) data, which was collected from five NOAA series satellites. An empirical distribution function (EDF) was developed to decrease the long-term inaccuracy of the NDVI data derived from the AVHRR sensor on NOAA polar orbiting satellite. The instability of data is a consequence of orbit degradation, and from the circuit drifts over the life of a satellite. Degradation of NDVI over time and shifts of NDVI between the satellites were estimated using the China data set, because it includes a wide variety of different ecosystems represented globally. It was found that the data for six particular years, four of which were consecutive, are not stable compared to other years because of satellite orbit drift, AVHRR sensor degradation, and satellite technical problems, including satellite electronic and mechanical satellite systems deterioration. The data for paired years for the NOAA-7, NOAA-9, NOAA-11, NOAA-14, and NOAA-16 were assumed to be standard because the crossing time of the satellite over the equator (between 13: 30 and 15: 00 hours) maximized the value of the coefficients. These years were considered the standard years, while in other years the quality of satellite observations significantly deviated from the standard. The deficiency of data for the affected years were normalized or corrected by using the EDF method and compared with the standard years. These normalized values were then utilized to estimate new NDVI time series that show significant improvement of NDVI data for the affected years so that the dataset is useful in climate studies.

TI  - Ride to die: masculine honour and collective identity in the motorcycle underworld
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGICAL RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the nature and extent of violent practice in the motorcycle underworld. It does this by considering the murder of Gerry Tobin, and then uses the biography of the founding member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle club (HAMC) for a critical analysis. The authors are interested in understanding the role of masculine honour and collective identity, and its influences in relation to violence - namely, fatal violence in the motorcycle underworld. The authors argue that motorcycle gangs are extreme examples of what Hall (2012) considers criminal undertakers - individuals who take special liberties often as a last resort.Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach seeks to analyse the paradigm of masculine honour, and how the Outlaws MC (OMC) applied this notion when executing the seemingly senseless murder of Gerry Tobin. So too, the author triangulate these findings by critically analysing the biography of the founding member of the Californian chapter of the HAMC - Sonny Barger. Further to this, a case study inevitably offers constraints and opportunities (Easton, 2010, p. 119). Through the process of triangulation, which is a method that utilises multiple sources of data, the researcher can be confident that the truth is being conveyed as truthfully as possible (Merriam, 1995, p. 54).Findings What is clear within the OB worldview is that it can only be a male dominant ideology, with no allowance for female interference (Wolf, 2008). Thus, Messerschmidt's (1993) notion of hegemonic masculinity fits the male dominated subcultures of the HAMC and OMC, which therefore provides the clubs with exclusive masculine identities (Wolf, 2008). For organisations like the HAMC, retaliation is perceived as an alternative form of criminal justice that is compulsory to undertake in order to defend their status of honour and masculinity.Originality/value Based on our understanding, this is the first critical think piece that explores a UK case of homicide within the context of the motorcycle underworld. It also provides a comprehensive understanding of violent practice with the motorcycle underworld from criminological and sociological perspectives. This paper will inform readers about an overlooked and under researched underworld culture.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Saudi capital city of Riyadh has experienced rapid population growth and urban expansion over the past 4 decades. One major consequence of such growth is the rising of the city's land surface temperature (LST). This study used Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor data to map the distribution of Riyadh's LST and then examined and modelled the impacts of five contributing factors known to increase urban LST. The contributing factors are size/area and population density of each neighbourhood, along with amounts of impervious surfaces, vegetations, and soil/sand measured through remote sensing indices NDBI, NDVI, and NDBsI. The data were analyzed using Pearson's Product Moment Correlation values, Path Analysis, and Multiple Regression analysis. The result shows that neighbourhood population densities and NDBsI index have strong positive correlations (r=0.68 and r=0.60) with LST. Neighbourhood area showed significant but low positive correlation (r=0.33) and the NDBI and NDVI indices showed strong negative correlations (r=-0.55 and r=-0.64) with the LST. The multiple regression model explained about 77% of the total variation in the LST. The model can be used to predict and simulate future LST distribution for Riyadh as well as other cities in the Kingdom and the region.

AB  - Fire severity indices have been using to assess the level of fire severity and extent of burned areas. Three established fire severity indices - differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relativized dNBR (RdNBR) and Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) - from three optical satellite sensors (MODIS, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A) were compared in this study. Fire Severity Indices were derived for initial (immediately after the fire) and extended (a certain time after the fire) fire severity assessment. During the Kains Flat Fire, New South Wales, Australia, Callitris, Eucalypt Medium Woodland and Other Native Forest were the three-major fire affected forest types. Sentinel-2A derived fire indices showed better assessment of fire severity compared to the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Landsat 8 sensor. Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A derived fire severity indices showed higher similarities in fire severity indices inter-comparisons. This study will facilitate the selection of appropriate fire indices and indices combinations for fire severity assessment in heterogeneous landscapes, burn severity mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of freely available multispectral remotely sensed imagery in mapping American bramble (<i>Rubus cuneifolius</i>)
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, alien invasive plant species are considered a serious threat to native flora and fauna. In the eastern parts South Africa, the American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) has been identified as one of the major threats to social and ecological systems. Optimal management and mitigation of American bramble spread requires reliable and cost effective approaches to determine invaded spatial extents. In this study, we test the value of the recently launched, freely available Sentinel-2 (S2), as opposed to conventional Landsat 8 imagery in mapping the American bramble. Using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm, we seek to identify the optimal season for mapping the American bramble as well as the most influential bands in the classification process. Results show that Sentinel-2 out-performed Landsat 8 in all seasons, with summer providing the highest classification accuracy (77% accuracy). The study also shows that strategically placed Sentinel-2 bands of Near Infrared, Red edge and Short Wave Infrared significantly contribute to an increase in overall bramble mapping accuracy. This study demonstrates the value of freely available multispectral imagery in mapping American bramble at large spatial extents, hence valuable for cost-effective operational use.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Surface water mapping has been widely used in various remote sensing applications. Water indices have been commonly used to distinguish water bodies from land; however, determining the optimal threshold and discriminating water bodies from similar objects such as shadows and snow is difficult. Deep learning algorithms have greatly advanced image segmentation and classification. In particular, FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) is state-of-the-art in per-pixel image segmentation and are used in most benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC2012 and Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context). However, these data sets are designed for daily scenarios and a few studies have conducted on applications of FCN using large scale remotely sensed data set. This paper aims to fine-tune the pre-trained FCN network using the CRMS (Coastwide Reference Monitoring System) data set for surface water mapping. The CRMS provides color infrared aerial photos and ground truth maps for the monitoring and restoration of wetlands in Louisiana, USA. To effectively learn the characteristics of surface water, we used pre-trained the DeepWaterMap network, which classifies water, land, snow, ice, clouds, and shadows using Landsat satellite images. Furthermore, the DeepWaterMap network was fine-tuned for the CRMS data set using two classes: water and land. The fine-tuned network finally classifies surface water without any additional learning process. The experimental results show that the proposed method enables high-quality surface mapping from CRMS data set and show the suitability of pre-trained FCN networks using remote sensing data for surface water mapping.

TI  - A hybrid colour model based land cover classification using random forest and support vector machine classifiers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED PATTERN RECOGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Classification is a supervised learning method which maps a data item into predefined classes. Colour is an important feature used in image classification since humans tend to distinguish images mostly based on colour feature. This paper proposes a hybrid colour model for land cover classification in which colour features are extracted by combining the hue (H) values of HSV colour space and luminance (L) values of LUV colour space. The extracted features are trained and tested with random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The performance of the proposed hybrid colour model is compared with the existing HSV colour space model using RF and SVM classifiers based on several metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and f-score. Hyper spectral dataset of Pavia University and an IRS LISS IV orthorectified dataset are chosen as the input image for this experiment.

AB  - Recent advancements in the field of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) have made it possible to conduct large-scale water remediation studies. Using improved spectral and spatial resolution sensors and geospatial modeling techniques, water quality parameters such as chlorophyll- a, algae bloom, turbidity, suspended sediments, and mineral content in water bodies including groundwater are being monitored at low cost and with greater accuracy. Integration of these technologies with field monitoring have successfully aided in identification of contamination zones and sources of contamination, and for developing strategies for remediation. High-resolution mapping of contamination zones will further help in allocating remediation efforts to the critically affected areas. This chapter investigates the status of ongoing research in the domain of remote sensing and GIS for water quality monitoring and management, and remediation of water resources.

AB  - Development of multi-media technologies large number of images are used in various fields such as video satellite data, medical treatment and digital judicial systems and surveillance systems. An efficient representation of features from an image for retrieval process is a challenging task. In this paper provides the feature extraction of an image using deep learning technique to tackle the differences between low-level features and high-level semantic features of basic CBIR systems. In this technique feature database can be created from each image in the database using VGG 16 model. By using Euclidean distance metrics an image analogous to the image of the query was retrieved by comparing the feature vector of the query image (compute similar to the data base images) and the feature database. The results suggest that the proposed CNN techniques yields better results than the other existed techniques.

AB  - Starting from a stack of co-registered SAR images in interferometric configuration, SAR tomography performs a reconstruction of the reflectivity of scatterers in 3-D. Scatterers seen within the same resolution cell in each SAR image can be separated by jointly unmixing the SAR complex amplitude observed throughout the stack. In urban areas, Compress Sensing (CS) approaches have been applied to achieve super-resolution in the estimation of the position of the scatterers. However, even if all the local information coming from a stack at a given pixel is used, the structural information that is inherent to the image is not directly used to improve the rendering of the scene. This paper addresses the problem of adding structural constraints to sparse tomographic reconstructions of urban areas. We derive an algorithm allowing the inversion of tomographic data under structural constraints and illustrate its performances on a stack of Spotlight TerraSAR-X images.

CL  - AISECT Univ, Bhopal, INDIA
AB  - Remote sensing offers an efficient and reliable means of collecting the information required for mapping, assessing and monitoring of agricultural crop conditions and production. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have led to the development of hyperspectral remote sensing imaging devices which can obtain high-resolution radiance data. This study evaluates the potential of the hyperspectral data in discrimination and mapping of agricultural crops using EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral image over the Thalasseri Taluk, Kerala, India. Five agricultural crops such as arecanut, banana, cashew, coconut and rubber were considered for the study. The EO-1 was pre-processed using minimum noise fraction (MNF) transform to reduce the atmospheric effects on the imagery. Support vector machine classification and minimum distance classification were applied in order to perform image data classification based on different crops. The optimum wavelengths suitable for crop discrimination were derived by analysing the spectral reflectance curve as well as by using the techniques such as stepwise discriminant analysis and partial least square regression (PLSR). This study establishes that the Hyperion bands 53, 56, 62, 74, 79 and 84 are suitable for crop-type discrimination. The support vector machine classification is suitable for mapping the crops from Hyperion imagery with a higher accuracy of about 80% and above.

AB  - Three vegetation indexes derived from remote sensing (NDVI, SAW and EVI) were used to assess, in a citrus orchard, the performance of three irrigation treatments: control (full irrigation), regulated deficit irrigation and partial root-zone drying. In addition, midday steam water potential and canopy temperature were measured for comparison with the vegetation indexes values. No statistically significant differences were found among treatment in the evaluated parameters, indicating the irrigation treatments did not induce a severe soil water deficit affecting tree water status. The good agreement found between the ground measurements and the indexes derived from remote sensing highlights the potentialities of this technology for assessing the performance of different irrigation methods.

AB  - Burned area (BA) estimates based on moderate resolution (500 meters) MODIS instruments show that globally, 3,500,000 hectares burns each year. MODIS has difficulty capturing fires smaller than 25 ha and studies estimate this lost variability up to 24%. These estimates are highly uncertain.We use burnt area from the Sentinel 2 Small Fire Database (SFD) at 20m spatial resolution for six tiles (5x5 degrees) in northern hemisphere Africa in areas that burn frequently. We find that in large fires (>100 ha), MODIS (MCD64) and SFD show a reasonable agreement (92%). However, MODIS misses most small fires (<25 ha) that add an additional 37% area burnt. SFD reveals a total burnt area that is 50% higher than MODIS for the studied areas.We then calculate fire emissions from the SFD and we compare to the Global Fire Emissions Database GFED4 and GFED4s. The contribution of small fires in terms of total burned area and emissions has been significantly underestimated and we find emissions up to 56% higher than GFED4 and 37% higher than GFED4s for this regions. This analysis highlights the importance of accounting for small fires for both burned area and fire emissions.

TI  - Unintended Consequences: Scottish Political Economy as a Reaction to Mercantilism
T2  - SHIFTING CAPITAL: MERCANTILISM AND THE ECONOMICS OF THE ACT OF UNION OF 1707
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter asserts that the vacuum left by the departure of the Scottish Parliament allowed Scotland's other institutions to continue to develop, which helped to lay the groundwork for the emergence of the Scottish Enlightenment. Scotland's changed economic circumstances and governance post-Union necessitated the emergence of Scottish political economy. The work of Sir James Steuart and Adam Smith is explored as a reaction against the worldview of mercantilism on growth, trade, poverty, and independence. Each author's growth theory demonstrates a growth theory based on interdependence among individuals in society rather than the competition and dependence of nation-states. Rather than interference, the role of government is reassigned as one that supports commerce in the case of Smith and prevents crises in Steuart.

TI  - Spatially distributed ice-thickness modelling for Chhota Shigri Glacier in western Himalayas, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of glacier ice-thickness distribution is important for many glacio-hydrological applications such as runoff projections, glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) predictions, future evolution of glaciers. Varieties of modelling approaches are available for estimating ice-thickness distribution depending upon the data availability. In the present study, we estimated the ice-thickness distribution and total ice volume of Chhota Shigri Glacier using an optimally parameterized Glacier Bed Topography version 2 (GlabTop2) model, a shallow ice approximation (SIA)-based spatially distributed approach. Among the model input parameters, the shape factor (f), a non-measurable factor compensating for unaccounted effects such as valley shape needs to be calibrated using field measurements of ice-thickness. However, the lack of direct measurements of ice-thickness over many glaciers worldwide restricts model calibration and effective implementation. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, in this study, a novel approach using a relationship between shape factor, glacier cross-sectional width, and ice-thickness at the centre of a cross-section has been proposed and also tested to estimate optimal shape factor of the study glacier. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the effect of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resolution and shape factor parameterization on the modelled ice-thickness estimates indicate that improving either the DEM resolution or calibrating the shape factor individually will not lead to improved ice-thickness estimates. In fact, both are necessary for better estimation of ice-thickness distribution. The high resolution DEM used in this study is TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) DEM of 10 x 10 m grid size. Finally, a comparison of the results from a previous study where they used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 90 m DEM indicates that the improved parameterisation of GlabTop2 model has led to a reduction in the error bounds of the estimated ice-thickness including the total glacier stored ice volume for the year 2013, which is estimated to be 1.74 +/- 0.25 km(3). Furthermore, based on the obtained results, it can be said that the GlabTop2 model combined with the proposed parameterization approach is having enormous potential to be applied over the wide range of data scarce Himalayan glaciers to quantify reliable ice-thickness estimates.

AB  - In order to accelerate the calculation of the similarity metric between two patches in non-local means filter of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images, this paper proposes a weighted acceleration algorithm to eliminate redundant operations. It can greatly reduce the computational complexity by using the accumulated covariance data to avoid repeated computations. Furthermore, the algorithm introduces the polarization similarity parameter to preserve the details of the image. It also processes the covariance matrix of each pixel. Thus, the polarimetric properties are maintained. The results of the C-band RadarSat-2 data are provided to demonstrate its rapidity and competitive general performance of speckle reduction and edge preservation.

AB  - A first attempt to adopt an automated selection of optimal processing local scales within the LG-Mod algorithm is presented. Aimed at Sea Surface Wind (SSW) directions retrieval from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, the novel LG-Mod multi-scale analysis mainly relies on an accuracy maximization criterion, based on the use of the marginal error parameter. Results achieved by the algorithm on both artificial and real SAR images appear very encouraging.

TI  - BLUEWATER EYE: Using satellite as a low cost water pollution sensor: Analytics for deriving long term pollution insights based on mapping water turbidity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Bluewater EYE analytics bring the power of remote sensing backed by artificial intelligence to address several water pollution related challenges at low cost as it requires minimal calibration with Internet of Things (IoT) data and can provide useful water quality insights via spatio-temporal pollution signatures mapped over possibly large distances, applicable to any global water body. We leverage geo-spatial data analytics in combination with cloud based, real-time in-situ sensing, that is capable of mapping changes in water turbidity of a water resource. Spatio-temporal pollution insights are derived and represented via color-based heatmaps and matrices that are overlaid on Google maps and facilitate visualization and identification of pollution hotspots. Methods include first-order correlations derived from surface reflectance of different satellite band/s (single or a normalized difference combination) and high resolution, geo-tagged, in-situ turbidity sensing via a moving multi-parameter sensor platform. Significant improvements in correlation (upto similar to 80%) were obtained by using statistical methods such as moving average for filtering out the sensing data associated noise. Moreover, we use machine learning based approach for training a turbidity model based on Support vector machine (SVM) regression with Radial Basis Kernel (RBF). The predicted turbidity values for the selected region based on Landsat 8 Level 2 surface reflectance data, was then applied for time-series data for historical years of 2016 and 2017. The turbidity time series so obtained is analyzed to capture any significant variations in water quality due to various factors (event or season based). We propose a method to analyze pollution contributions from different individual sources, that is based on assigning an individual spatio-temporal signature in the form of a color-coded matrix. Overall, Bluewater EYE could be useful for capturing water quality spatio-temporal information and trends, providing data driven proofs for timely alerts and advisory and other useful insights for implementation of appropriate remediation measures and interventions{all this at an affordable cost.

TI  - sen2r: an R toolbox to find, download and preprocess Sentinel-2 data
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - This is an improvement of version 0.3.1, with several fixes and improvements. New functions check_sen2r_deps(): a new GUI to help checking dependencies. Add function s2_perc_masked() to compute the percentage of cloud-masked surface. GUI changes Major GUI improvements in the definition of the extent: now the main map is used only to show the extent and the tiles, while the definition of the extent (drawn, specified with a bounding box or taken from a loaded polygon) is donee in separate maps (this allows to avoid many errors). Add radiobutton for index datatype, to choose the datatype when an index is generated. Add maximum cloud cover threshold. Implement seasonal time period (#74). Implement the download with aria2c. Processing chain Major commit: retrieve also existing filenames. Before this commit, if some products were partially retrieved (e.g. output BOA) and some depending on them are missing (e.g. an index) but SAFE were not required, the corresponding expected vectors were not retrieved (missing SAFE tile names nothing was generated). Now, existing names matching the parameters are attached to each "_exp" vector. Manage parallelisation: add partial parallelisation in s2_calcindices() (on infiles, not on indices); add "parallel" argument in sen2r() to allow singlecore mode; fix parallel=FALSE in function (force n_cores=1). In general, now the whole processing chain can be optionally launched in single core. Addition to existing functions Improvement in integer / byte data types for generation of indices: Int16 is now the default data type; chosing an integer data type the output values are clipped on the valid format range, and the scaling factor can be chosen by the user; chosing Byte, interval -1 to 1 is coherced to 0-200 (with nodata=255). Use standard nodata values to compute indices. Return the list of created files after processing. Accept custom mask combinations: now it is possible to define masks with a custom combination of SCL classes to be masked. Allow argument "timewindow" in sen2r() to be a single integer value, which is interpreted as the period between today and n days ago. Uniform temporary directories (#73). Now the principal functions have the parameters tmpdir and rmtmp to set the temporary directory and the choice to delete /not to delete temporary files. Only two exceptions: create_indices_db() uses a fixed temporary directory (since it is a function intended not to be run by endusers); sen2cor() launched from sen2r() uses a default temporary directory if tempdir is in a SAMBA mountpoint over Windows. Other changes Update to sen2cor 2.5.5, and manage S2A L2A operational products (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/news/News00305). Add a welcome message and a logo. Change package name from SALTO to sen2r, and rename the main function consequently to sen2r(). Remove s2download as dependence (now it is integrated within the package). Remove sprawl dependencies. Major fixes Avoid blurs and artifices in thumbnails. stack2rgb() now works with GDAL routines; gdalwarp is used instead than gdal_translate for reducing the size of input images (to avoid averaging NA values, which produced blurs on borders of BOA thumbnails); intermediate GTiff files are used to bypass the presence of artifices in SCL PNG thumbnails and to produce JPEG multiband TOA/BOA thumbnails. Load python modules correctly. Now on Windows all the modules are imported using import_from_path() in init_python(), which is called anywhere modules are needed. Fix unrecognised osgeo in Windows. When running gdal_calc in Windows with multiple Python installlations, the wrong one (i.e. Anaconda) is used, and "no module names osgeo" error is returned. Other minor fixes. Copyright: Open Access

AB  - Whale sharks are a leading species in Cendrawasih Bay due to its benign nature and its regular appearance. Recently, whale sharks are vulnerable to scarcity and even extinction. One of the efforts to maintain the existence of the whale shark population is by knowing its spatial distribution. This study aims to analyze how the oceanographic factors affect the spatial distribution of whale sharks in Cendrawasih Bay National Park. The method used in this research is descriptive with the quantitative approach using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) analysis. The data consisted of the whale shark monitoring data in TNTC taken by WWF-Indonesia, and image data of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration of Aqua-MODIS, and also sea surface current from Aviso. Analyses were conducted for the period of January 2012 until March 2015. The GAM result indicated that sea surface current was better than the other environment (SST and chlorophyll-a concentration) as an oceanographic predictor of whale shark appearance. High probabilities of the whale shark's to appear on the surface were observed in sea surface current velocities between 0.30-0.60 m/s, for SST ranged from 30.50-31.80 degrees C, and for chlorophyll-a concentration ranged from 0.20-0.40 mg/m(3).

T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to demonstrate air pollution spatial distribution as it is related to weather conditions, location, topography, and the area. Air pollution is studied by remote sensing techniques less than other techniques due to lack of sensors capable of detecting emissions, and hence, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) method is used for investigation. Aerosol optical depth is a measure of the extinction of the solar beam by dust and haze. In this study, the linear regression analysis was used to develop a relationship between AOD measures by MODIS and daily air pollution (CO, O-3, NO AOD , SO2 and PM2.5) in six consecutive years (2011-2016) at 22 stations in Tehran. Matrix correlation between AOD values and air pollution parameters indicated a significant relationship for O-3 and NO2 with regression squared from 0.631 to 0.764, respectively. Linear regression between AOD and the parameters was separately developed and pollution maps were produced for CO, O-3, NO2 and PM2.5 parameters within 2011-2016. Spatial distribution map of the aforementioned gases revealed that NO2 and CO were higher than the regular standards in the studied region during 2011-2016; PM2.5 was desirable in the northern areas; however, its concentration was larger than the standard level in southern and central regions. Comparison of pollution maps and land surface temperature (LST), picked up by MODIS satellite, indicated that the correlation between PM2.5 and temperature is R = 0.55; in addition, it largely influences higher air pollution increases in Tehran comparing other gases.

AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) controls the the energy and water transfers between soil, vegetation and atmosphere. A better representation of this variable in Land Surface Models (LSMs) could reduce significantly the uncertainties associated to future climate predictions. Thanks to its large spatio-temporal coverage, the new ESA CCI multi-instruments dataset offers a good opportunity to benchmark LSMs and improve their parametrization with data assimilation techniques. In this study, the ESA CCI surface soil moisture (SSM) combined product is confronted with the different simulated soil layers of the ORCHIDEE LSM (the continental part of the IPSL earth system model), in order to assess whether it can be used to improve the model using data assimilation.

TI  - Structural and functional mapping of geosigmeta in Atlantic coastal marshes (France) using a satellite time series
T2  - PLANT BIOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geosynphytosociology deals with the study of combinations of vegetation series - or geosigmeta - within landscape. Its main advantage is to assess conservation status based on vegetation dynamics. However, this field-based approach has not been widely applied, because local surveys are not representative of spatio-temporal landscape complexity, which leads to uncertainties and errors for geosigmeta structural and functional mapping. In this context, satellite time series appear as relevant data for monitoring vegetation dynamics. This article aims to assess the contribution of an annual satellite time series for geosigmeta structural and functional mapping. The study area, which focuses on the French Atlantic coast (4630km(2)), includes salt, brackish, sub-brackish and fresh marshes. A structural vegetation map was derived from the classification of an annual time series of 38 MODIS images validated with field surveys. The functional vegetation map was derived from the annual Integral of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI-I), as an indicator of above-ground net primary production. Results show that geosigmeta were successfully mapped at a scale of 1:250,000 with an overall accuracy of 82.9%. The geosigmeta functional map highlights a strong gradient from the lowest NDVI-I values in salt marshes to the highest values in fresh marshes.

T2  - ETHNOGRAPHY AND EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Arguably an essential element of a doctoral study is to establish and acknowledge a philosophical worldview. As part of this, researchers need to engage with and challenge their assumptions about the nature of being, the nature of knowledge, and what can be known. Only then can methodological designs, approaches to data analysis, and relationships between researchers and participants be established and situated within a particular research paradigm. Contextualised within a PhD study concerning teacher pedagogic practice, this paper describes the process of abandoning a positivist worldview in favour of interpretivism. The paper describes the process of developing an ethnographically inspired methodology combining practice theory [Kemmis, S., and P. Grootenboer. 2008. Situating Praxis in Practice. In Enabling Praxis: Challenges for Education, edited by S.Kemmis, and T.Smith, 37-64. Rotterdam: Sense] and constructivist grounded theory [Charmaz, K. 2006. Constructing Grounded Theory. A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis. London: Sage] to study teacher pedagogic practice. The methodological framework is shared to enable others to use it to provide fresh opportunities to look at specific educational settings in order to explore, understand and enhance teacher practice.

TI  - Predicting aboveground biomass in Arctic landscapes using very high spatial resolution satellite imagery and field sampling
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Remote sensing based biomass estimates in Arctic areas are usually produced using coarse spatial resolution satellite imagery, which is incapable of capturing the fragmented nature of tundra vegetation communities. We mapped aboveground biomass using field sampling and very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite images (QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3) in four different Arctic tundra or peatland sites with low vegetation located in Russia, Canada, and Finland. We compared site-specific and cross-site empirical regressions. First, we classified species into plant functional types and estimated biomass using easy, non-destructive field measurements (cover, height). Second, we used the cover/height-based biomass as the response variable and used combinations of single bands and vegetation indices in predicting total biomass. We found that plant functional type biomass could be predicted reasonably well in most cases using cover and height as the explanatory variables (adjusted R2 0.21-0.92), and there was considerable variation in the model fit when the total biomass was predicted with satellite spectra (adjusted R2 0.33-0.75). There were dissimilarities between cross-site and site-specific regression estimates in satellite spectra based regressions suggesting that the same regression should be used only in areas with similar kinds of vegetation. We discuss the considerable variation in biomass and plant functional type composition within and between different Arctic landscapes and how well this variation can be reproduced using VHSR satellite images. Overall, the usage of VHSR images creates new possibilities but to utilize them to full potential requires similarly more detailed in-situ data related to biomass inventories and other ecosystem change studies and modelling.

T2  - DISEASE MARKERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Luminal B breast cancers (BC) have a more aggressive behavior associated with a higher rate of tumor relapse and worse prognosis compared to luminal A tumors. In this study, we evaluated the involvement of specific epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-(EMT-) and immune-related pathways in the dissemination of luminal B BC cells. The expression of 42 EMT- and immune-related genes was evaluated in matched sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) analyzed by the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay (OSNA) and primary tumors of 40 luminal B BC patients by gene array and immunohistochemistry. The results were validated in an independent group of 150 luminal B tumors by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence and using gene expression data from 315 luminal B BC patients included in the Metabric dataset. We found that the expression of CXCR4 (p = 3.28E - 02) and CD163 (p = 6.92 E - 03) was significantly upregulated in SLNs of recurrent luminal B BC patients. Luminal B primary tumors overexpressing CXCR4 were characterized by an increased expression of vimentin and a high content of CD163-positive macrophages. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed the correlation of CXCR4 with CXCL12, VIM, and CD163 expression and LN involvement. Our results suggest that the upregulation of the CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway and the presence of protumor macrophages in the primary tumor and SLNs sustain the aggressiveness of an important subgroup of luminal B BC.

AB  - Flood is one of the most the most re-occurring natural hazard in the state of Bihar, as well as in India. The major rivers responsible for flood in the state of Bihar are Kosi, Gandak, Ghagra and Bagmati, which are the tributary rivers of Ganges. The head water catchment area of these rivers lies in the Himalayan state of Nepal. The high rainfall in Nepal, siltation of hydraulic structures, rivers and low topography of North Bihar causes flood occurrence in these areas on regular basis. Remote sensing and GIS plays an important role in mapping, monitoring and providing spatial database for all flood related studies. The present work focuses on the use remote sensing based topography and images in GIS environment for integrated flood study of Bagmati River, which is one of the most flood prone rivers of North Bihar. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) was used to create detailed sub-basin and river network map of entire Bagmati basin. The floods of July-August 2002 were mapped using RADARSAT-1 data using threshold based method. The SRTM DEM and ground based river cross-section from Dheng to Benibad stretch of Bhagmati River were used to create 1-dimensional hydrodynamic (1-D HD) model for simulating flood water level, discharge and flood inundation. Validation of simulated flood flows was done using observed water level of central water commission (CWC) from Dheng to Runisaidpur stations, with coefficient of correlation of 0.85. Finally, an integrated framework for flood modelling and management system is proposed.

TI  - Unsupervised Classification of PolSAR Data Using a Scattering Similarity Measure Derived From a Geodesic Distance
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel technique for obtaining scattering components from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data using the geodesic distance on the unit sphere. This geodesic distance is obtained between an elementary target and the observed Kennaugh matrix, and it is further utilized to compute a similarity measure between scattering mechanisms. The normalized similarity measure for each elementary target is then modulated with the total scattering power (Span). This measure is used to categorize pixels into three categories, i.e., odd-bounce, double-bounce, and volume, depending on which of the above scattering mechanisms dominate. Then the maximum likelihood classifier of Lee et al. based on the complex Wishart distribution is iteratively used for each category. Dominant scattering mechanisms are thus preserved in this classification scheme. We show results for L-band AIRSAR and ALOS-2 data sets acquired over San Francisco and Mumbai, respectively. The scattering mechanisms are better preserved using the proposed methodology than the unsupervised classification results using the Freeman-Durden scattering powers on an orientation angle corrected PolSAR image. Furthermore: 1) the scattering similarity is a completely nonnegative quantity unlike the negative powers that might occur in double-bounce and odd-bounce scattering component under Freeman-Durden decomposition and 2) the methodology can be extended to more canonical targets as well as for bistatic scattering.

TI  - A SCATTERING POWER FACTORIZATION FRAMEWORK USING A GEODESIC DISTANCE IN RADAR POLARIMETRY

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - This paper presents a novel scattering power factorization framework in radar polarimetry using a geodesic distance between the 4 x 4 real Kennaugh matrices of the observed and the elementary targets (viz. dihedral, trihedral, dipole etc.). The framework provides both qualitative and quantitative estimates of the dominance of elementary scattering mechanisms in a pixel. It is also flexible in terms of the number of elementary models against which an observed backscattering may be compared. Under this framework, the observed scattering is evaluated in terms of scattering similarities which provide the dominance of scattering mechanisms. This is then further utilized for a convex splitting of unity to obtain the intermediate weights. This leads to the weights being the product of similarity and dissimilarity of the observed pixel with the elementary scattering models. Finally, these weights are modulated with the total power (Span) to obtain the non-negative scattering powers. The results are shown for full polarimetric single-look ALOS-2 L-band dataset and a multi-look RADARSAT-2 C-band dataset.

TI  - Dispersion categories from visual observations compared to those derived by a ceilometer system and satellite cloud cover information
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric dispersion models require information on atmospheric stability. The use of dispersion categories like the Klug/Manier scheme (German guideline) or Reuter categories (Austrian guideline) is still widespread. Although atmospheric stability can be determined by a variety of methods such as three-dimensional ultrasonic anemometers or radiation balance measurements, deriving the dispersion category from cloud cover data is still one of the most often used schemes for a parameterization. As the number of meteorological stations with visual observations is decreasing worldwide, the database for hourly observed cloud cover has come down to a few stations in Austria. In Austria, an effort is now undertaken to use both the ZAMG (6 stations) and the ACG (approximately 50 stations) ceilometer networks for spatially representative cloud cover and mixing height information. In this paper, ceilometer and satellite data are used to quantify cloud cover and to determine dispersion categories. The results are compared to cloud cover and dispersion categories from the visual observations. With some restrictions, a fair agreement is derived in the frequencies of dispersion categories between the different methods. This is mostly in the range between 76 % and 86 % for the Klug/Manier scheme and between 62 % and 78 % for the Reuter scheme.

TI  - Observing water-level variations from space-borne high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image correlation
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of correlating high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar images to estimate local water-level variations is analysed based on observing the motions of floating structures. By computing range and azimuth offsets on a COSMO-SkyMed multi-temporal data-set in an area of the French Atlantic Coast, displacement signatures were detected in several harbours of the region. They can be associated with specific floating structures, whose vertical motion is mostly driven by tides. Although the image resolution is not the best achievable for the COSMO-SkyMed sensor, comparison with ground-based tide information revealed that the obtained space-borne measurements are consistent with the tide gauges to a decimetric accuracy. Even if the requirements for traditional users of tidal data are not met by the current revisit time of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, the method proposed here provides complementary measures, which are already well aligned to requirements of users concerned with long-term sea-level variation and river or lake water stocks.

AB  - In the presented study our purpose is to show the interest of space-borne high-resolution L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (ALOS-2/PALSAR2 data in SM1 mode) for mapping deformation of slow landslides. The methods we combined are sub-pixel correlation offset tracking techniques and differential SAR interferometry. Hell-bourg and Grand Ilet landslides (our test cases) are located on La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean with motions up to about 1 m/y. The produced deformation maps resulted better than those obtained in previous studies with C or X band SAR data or with current Sentinel-1 data as L-band data are less affected by the vegetated cover than X-or C-band data. Finally, the possibility of deriving 3D mapping of the displacement by combining ascending and descending acquisitions (each one provides 2 components of the deformation: line of sight and azimuth) is investigated.

AB  - The slope stability of altered rocks that can behave as soils (generally referred to as "soft rocks") can be a major concern when these slopes are surrounding key infrastructures. This paper describes the role of satellite technologies, and specifically InSAR (Interferometry of Synthetic Aperture Radar), as a tool for monitoring precursor ground displacement in the case of a massive slope in Northern Spain affecting a major European link highway. The slope failed at least two times in the period between March and November 2015. The first failure resulted in the highway blocked and the necessity of implementing an emergency project and remediation works. During the remediation works a second failure occurred.The geological profile of the site is made of alluvial soils, altered rock mainly due to previous landslide in the same area, and rock mass, also affected by faulting, made by breccia, limolite and mylonite.A stack of images from the European Space Agency satellite Sentinel was processed for a period starting before the first failure and up to several months after the highway reopening. This ground motion analysis aimed to help understand the mechanism of failure as well as the precursory movements before the failures.

AB  - Intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) method is an exceptional mixing moving towards with computational capability and spatial classification holding. An isolated identifying picture blend count in light of HIS change and neighbourhood grouping and its interaction with little computational flightiness are projected. Visual impact and total examination happens as expected demonstrate that the proposed crucial estimation out plays out the standard picture mix procedures in the spectre space with the spatial excellence like that of un-obliterated wavelet change related course of action. The proposed changed procedure can secure the relative spatial assurance of the solidified picture with the IHS-related blend computation and the improved spooky excellence. In this paper, we develop our past results for picture mix estimations by including the strategies to satellite images against night vision and single-metric biomedical picture blend examination. Multispectral outlines consolidate satellite descriptions for arrive cover examination. In this manuscript, we explored grouping of estimations which are used to assess the execution of the entwined picture things. In this manuscript we assemble the distinctive estimations into multiple categories and show a utilisation of the estimations to satellite descriptions with an entropy-dependant picture mix technique.

TI  - Integration of Earth Observation Data and Spatial Approach to Delineate and Manage Aeolian Sand-Affected Wasteland in Highly Productive Lands of Haryana, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The western part of the country India is surrounded by Thar desert. Due to climate change, many regions in the world are facing different challenges. The objective of the study was to quantify the aeolian sand-affected land through integrated approach. The LANDSAT-ETM + satellite image of 2009 has been used to distinguish recently affected areas by aeolian sand. Acombined approach of digital classification backed with visual interpretation and ground verification was adopted. In addition to classification accuracy assessment was performed using field observations. Evidence based results of aeolian sand-affected areas have suggested that wasteland area has increased up to 4,427.55 ha (6.79%) of total geographical area. Two types of aeolian sands areas have been detected, namely, moderately affected (3,881.77 ha) and severely affected (545.79 ha). Moderately and severely affected aeolian soil lands have been more accurately mapped with reasonably good accuracy whereas smaller aeolian affected areas within croplands are mapped with low accuracy.

AB  - In this research article, the Sabarmati river basin, India, which joins the Gulf of Khambhat, has been chosen to demonstrate the limitation of various automatic watershed delineation tools. The basin area of the river has been delineated using CARTOSAT 1 (20 m), ASTER V2 (30 m) and SRTM (90 m) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with ArcGIS Hydrology, ArcHydro and ArcSWAT automatic watershed delineation tools. Delineation of Sabarmati river using ASTER V2 (30) DEM by ArcSWAT automatic watershed delineation tool produced the best results with an error of only 0.75%, as compared to the area reported in India WRIS. The SRTM DEM performed consistently better than other two DEMs in case of all three automatic watershed delineation tools and produced only 2.99% average error. ArcSWAT automatic watershed delineator is the most accurate watershed delineation tool in comparison to other two tools and produced a lowest average error of 1.57%. ArcGIS Hydrology tool, using all the DEMs, produced an average error of 11.55%, which is the highest amongst all of the three tools. In general, the automatic delineated stream network fails to join the main river and some area of the watershed is always left out.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy, safety, and outcome of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early-stage vulvar cancer and determine the applicability of this procedure for selected patients in Israel. Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients with T1 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the vulva who underwent surgery with SLNB between 2002-2011 were included. SLN was detected using both radioactive tracer and blue dye. All resected nodes underwent pathological examination. The accuracy, recurrence rates, and complications of the procedure were analyzed. Results: There was a significant correlation between radioactive reading intensity and SLN detection in frozen section (p < 0.0003, p < 0.0001). A weaker correlation existed with use of blue dye (p = 0.04, p = 0.09). For metastatic LNs, the detection rates of both agents were similar. The false negative for metastatic SLN detection in frozen section was 12.5%, while the false positive was 2%. The rate of inguinal recurrence without local recurrence was 4.4%. For patients with unifocal vulvar disease and a negative sentinel node the seven-year survival rate was 94%. Conclusion: SLNB is an effective and safe procedure for Israeli patients with earlystage SCC of the vulva. Recurrence rates and disease-free survival are similar to the reported literature and morbidity is low compared to radical inguinal LNs resection.

TI  - A comparative study of libRadtran and RTTOV predicted satellite images using the WRF forecasting output
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of cloudy radiances remains important in improving precipitation and severe weather forecasting. In practice, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models frequently do not predict meso-scale phenomena, so the phenomenon is either predicted but not realised, or is well predicted but not where it is observed. Radiative Transfer Models such as TIROS-Television and Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV) and libRadtran are the mathematical operators used in the simulation of satellite data. In the data assimilation process, an effective reproduction of the mesoscale convective phenomenon leads to high quality data analysis. Therefore, we are looking for an operator that reproduces the NWP model's behaviour in a realistic way. Several cloud parameterisation schemes are available in RTTOV and libRadtran to simulate the satellite cloudy radiances. Each selected scheme may result in different simulated brightness temperature data compared to those observed by satellite. However, the source of errors is still unknown: are they generated by the RT model, are they coming from the predicted fields of the NWP Model used as input, or from both? This study aims to investigate the impact of libRadtran or RTTOV operators on the quality of the predicted satellite image. The same mandatory forecasted fields are used as input for both models and derive from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Limited-Area Model. In this study, we did not investigate the total capability of RT models, but we have focused on a standard and specific physical parameterisation scheme. As reference data, Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) images have been used to compute the deterministic and probabilistic scores. The results for the deterministic scores show that libRadtran reproduces the cold temperatures predicted by WRF well, but these are sometimes slightly distant from their geographical location. Conversely, for the RTTOV, there is a tendency to miss more cases of good detection of the events predicted by WRF. Probabilistic analyses confirm an improvement in libRadtran scores when the neighbourhood size is increased, and a boxplot analysis of the bootstrap method confirms the stability of scores for both models.

AB  - Kelok Sembilan area, West Sumatra, Indonesia located in 'V' contour shape is playing an important role to support the transportation connection in the center of Sumatra. However, in the rainy season, landslide event was high along this way, then monitoring and mapping a necessity to for minimizing its impact. Quasi-Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (Q-PSI) technique was applied for extracting information of land deformation on the area from time to time. Beside have high performance for detecting land deformation, Q-PSI technique was selected to improve the number of PS point. It's required because the method applied to vegetation area with short wavelength SAR (C-Band). This research was supported by 90 scenes of Sentinel-1A taken from October 2014 to November 2017 for ascending and descending orbit. Both satellite orbits detected two critical location of land deformation namely as zone A and Zone B located in steep slope that more than 500 mm movement in the line of sight (LOS).

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex topography and geological formation are the primary causes of frequent land deformation occurrence at Kelok Sembilan area, West Sumatra, Indonesia. This paper presents a research work on land mapping and land deformation monitoring carried out using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique at Kelok Sembilan bridge region. In this paper, 13 ascending Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) scenes, taken from July 2007 to November 2010, were processed using PSI-SAR technique. Then, the land deformation analysis was performed in two of the critical landslide areas near the Kelok Sembilan bridge. For validation purpose, the results were compared with in situ ground measurement data obtained using both differential global positioning system technique, and 3-D photogrammetry technique based unmanned aerial vehicle. The land deformation analysis showed that both of the investigation areas are suffering a severe land movement of approximately -100 mm every year. In addition to that, the validation results showed erroneousness of less than 0.3%.

AB  - The Purus River is one of the major tributaries of Solimoes River in Brazil, draining an area of 370,091 km(2) and stretching over 2765 km. Unlike those of the other main tributaries of the Amazon River, the Purus River's sediment discharge is poorly characterized. In this study, as an alternative to the logistic difficulties and considering high monitoring costs, we report an experiment where field measurement data and 2700 satellite (MODIS) images are combined to retrieve both seasonal and interannual dynamics in terms of the Purus river sediment discharge near its confluence with the Solimoes River. Field radiometric and hydrologic measurements were acquired during 18 sampling trips, including 115 surface water samples and 61 river discharge measurements. Remote sensing reflectance gave important results in the red and infrared levels. They were very well correlated with suspended sediment concentration. The values of R-2 are greater than 0.8 (red band) and 0.9 (NIR band). A retrieval algorithm based on the reflectance in both the red and the infrared was calibrated using the water samples collected for the determination of the surface-suspended sediment concentration (SSS). The algorithm was used to calculate 16 years of SSS time series with MODIS images at the Purus River near its confluence with the Solimoes River. Results from satellite data correlated with in situ SSS values validate the use of satellite data to be used as a tool to monitor SSS in the Purus River. We evidenced a very short and intense sediment discharge pulse with 55% of the annual sediment budget discharged during the months of January and February. Using river discharge records, we calculated the mean annual sediment discharge of the Purus River at about of 17 Mt.yr(-1). (C) 2017 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Remote sensing methodology was applied to assess two land cover parameters (elevation and soil moisture) in the first stage. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) was used to build a map of the water catchment basins within the Wadi El K'sob area. Relative soil moisture for the territory of the Wadi El K'sob catchment area was estimated by using the Sentinel-1/Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) optical multispectral data. Elevation data of the sampling points range from 398 to 1081 meters above sea level. Soil moisturevaried from 0.2 to 0.37 relative units. The effects of altitude and physico-chemical properties of soil on soil microflora communities in the catchment area of Wadi El K'sob M'sila (Algeria) were investigated in the second stage. The work presented here identified three groups of microorganisms in the soil samples collected in spring 2017from 7 locations situated in the catchment area of Wadi El K'sob M'sila (Algeria) along with 11 physico-chemical characteristics. Statistical tests showed that actinomycetes, fungi and mesophilic bacteria were positively correlated to the altitude. The results revealed that the microflora communities was very dependent on soil physico-chemical characteristics, the main parameters were relative soil moisture, texture, pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, organic matter, total nitrogen and available potassium. Generally, the parameters analyzed in this study, indicate a change in the soil microflora community according to the altitudinal and soil physico-chemical variations.

AB  - Delay/Doppler processing for radar altimeters allows to improve the along-track resolution, but it can be affected by Doppler ambiguities depending on the design of the instrument. If not accounted for, Doppler ambiguities can cause a distortion of the multilooked waveforms and a loss of accuracy in retrieved geophysical parameters. This paper presents a waveform model based approach to define a Doppler ambiguity mask to filter out the samples affected by the ambiguous returns before multilooking, assuming a uniform rough scattering surface. The effectiveness of the proposed method for Doppler ambiguities masking has been verified on Sentinel-6 simulated data and on in-orbit data from CryoSat SARin acquisitions over ocean.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem forecasting has potential societal value, for industry, recreation, and human health applications to name a few. The complexities of ecological systems, the expenses associated with monitoring them, and the suddenness at which forecasts become needed often make forecasts impractical. We tested a novel rapid spin-up daily forecasting system for jellyfish - Cyanea capillata (lion's mane jellyfish), Aurelia aurita (moon jellyfish), and Staurostoma mertensii (whitecross jellyfish) in the Gulf of Maine. The system blended satellite data with citizen reports collected via email and social media. The forecasting system took 1-3 weeks of tuning before performance plateaued, after which forecast performance was consistently high. Good model performance did not always correspond with good forecast performance, and predictor variables whose contribution improved model performance in some cases had the opposite effect on forecast performance. An adaptive model learning mode provided a very modest improvement in performance. In a test of forecast range, forecast performance decreased significantly at a forecast range of around 1 week. Overall, the approach appeared to be a promising avenue toward rapid spin-up of forecasts for undermonitored systems.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of Earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Satellite remote sensing, with its synoptic view of the Earth's features, regular repetitive coverage over large areas, and digital mode of data capture, offers an effective means of mapping, monitoring, and management of land resources and environmental impacts near real time, providing a historical profile for monitoring the Earth's features. Satellite sensors record information about the Earth's surface by measuring the transmission of energy from the surface in different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The optical remote sensing devices operate in the visible, near-infrared, middle-infrared, and shortwave infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. These devices are sensitive to the wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 3000 nm. The sensors, which operate in thermal range of electromagnetic spectrum, record the energy emitted from the Earth features in the wavelength ranges of 3000-5000 nm and 8000 nm to 14,000 nm. A microwave remote sensor records the backscattered microwaves in the wavelength range of 1 mm-1 m of electromagnetic spectrum. A wide variety of satellite remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, IRS-IC, IRS-ID, IRS-P6, Cartosat-1, Cartosat-2, QuickBird, and Google are available to the Earth scientists for generation of spatial database on natural resources for various applications. Analysis of multiple-date satellite imagery provides information in mapping, monitoring, and management of land resources on periodical basis.

AB  - Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-assisted system for capture, storage, retrieval, analysis, and display of spatial data and nonspatial attribute data. The data can be derived from different sources such as survey data, geographical/topographical/aerial maps, satellite data, or archived data. Data can be in the form of locational data (such as latitudes/longitudes) or tabular (attribute) data. The introduction of modern technologies has led to an increased use of computers and information technology in all aspects of spatial data handling. The handling of spatial data involves data acquisition, storage and maintenance, processing, analysis, and output. GIS is a computerized database management system for capturing, storing, validating, maintaining, analyzing, displaying, and managing spatially referenced data with a primary function to integrate data from a variety of sources. GIS constitutes hardware, software, data, people, and methods. Advanced GIS can address questions related to location, condition, trends, patterns, and modeling. Manual digitization of existing paper maps, existing digital data, aerial photographs, remote-sensing satellite imagery, and global positioning system (GPS) are promising sources for data input in GIS. Before generation of any spatial data, one has to understand the available data types, data analysis procedures, and their capabilities in GIS to get realistic outputs. GIS is being widely used as spatial analysis tool for effective and efficient means of data generation, management, analysis, and display. Recent advances in computer technology, remote sensing, GPS, and communication technology augmented the development of enhanced functions of GIS in the field of data generation, management, analysis, and display. Data derived from remote sensing, GPS, and field surveys could be effectively used in GIS in mapping, monitoring, and management of land resources and dissemination of information at appropriate destinations in various location-based applications.

AB  - Digital image processing is an important part in digital analysis of remote sensing data. It allows one to enhance image features of interest while attenuating irrelevant features of a given application and then extract useful information about the scene from the enhanced image. It comprises the four basic steps, which include image correction/restoration, image enhancement, image transformation, and image classification. Image restoration is basically aimed to compensate the data errors, noise, and geometric distortions introduced during the scanning, recording, and playback operations. Image enhancement helps to alter the visual impact that the image has on the interpreter, that improve the information content and information extraction ability by utilizing the decision-making capability of the computer in order to recognize and classify the pixels on the basis of their digital signatures. The information extracted by comparing two or more images of an area that were acquired at different times. Unsupervised classification distinguish the patterns in the reflectance data and groups them into a pre-defined number of classes without any prior knowledge of the image. Whereas, in supervised classification, the user trains the computer, guiding it what type of spectral characteristics to look for and what type of land cover they represent, and guides the image processing software how to classify certain features. Change-detection analysis provides information about the changes in different seasons or dates. In post-classification analysis, image smoothing and accuracy assessment are important to generate the output from digital image processing.

AB  - Geomorphology is the study of the landforms, their processes, form and sediments at the surface of the earth. Geomorphological maps are very effective tools in management of land resources and help in various types of resources inventory, mapping and management. Running water, wind, glaciers, karst and sea waves are powerful erosional and depositional agents, which are acting over a long period of time and produce systematic changes leading to sequential development of landforms. The traditional mapping approaches emphasized qualitative interpretation, as frequently dictated by the inherent limitations associated with fieldwork, paucity of digital data and lack of prior field/geographic experience and domain knowledge. Recent advances in remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and availability of satellite-based digital elevation models and developments in numerical modelling capabilities enhance the ability to understand the surface processes more clearly in the field of geomorphology. Geomorphological mapping and analysis of various processes using advance tools like remote sensing and GIS act as preliminary tools for land resources inventory, mapping and management, geomorphological and geological risk management, as well as providing baseline data for other applied sectors of environmental research such as landscape ecology, soil science, hydrology and forestry, etc.

AB  - The information on the extent and spatial distribution of various kinds of degraded lands is essential for strategic planning and development of degraded lands. Processes of land degradation can be broadly grouped into physical, chemical, and vegetal (biological) degradation. The physical processes include land degradation mainly due to water and wind erosion, compaction, crusting, and waterlogging. The chemical process includes salinization, alkalization, acidification, pollution, and nutrient depletion. The vegetal or biological processes on the other hand are reduction of organic matter content in the soils and degradation of vegetation. The use of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques makes land degradation estimation and its spatial distribution feasible with reasonable costs and better accuracy in larger areas. The use of spaceborne multispectral data shown its potential in deriving information on the nature, extent, spatial distribution, and magnitude of various kinds of degraded lands. Assessment and monitoring of land degradation through remote sensing offer a series of advantages such as consistency of data, fairly near real-time reporting, and a source for having spatially explicit data. The integration of high-resolution remote sensing data and digital elevation models derived from satellites data like Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with ground data has immense potential in assessment and monitoring of land degradation in local scales. In this chapter, application of remote sensing and GIS in assessment and mapping of physical, chemical, and vegetal degradation has been discussed. The study indicates that integrated remote sensing and GIS applications have immense potential in assessment, mapping and monitoring of land degradation with reasonable cost and better accuracy in larger areas that would otherwise require large inputs of human and material resources.

AB  - A pragmatic, data driven approach, which for the first time combines existing in situ and remote sensing data sets with a networked mobile air pollutant measurement strategy in the urban space is an objective of the Smart Air Quality Network (SmartAQnet) project. It aims to implement an intelligent, reproducible, finely-tuned (spatial, temporal), yet cost-effective air quality measuring network, initially in the model region of Augsburg, Germany. Central to this is the development and utilization of partial, already existing (but not yet combined) data on the one hand and the collection and integration of relevant missing data on the other hand Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with low-weight meteorological sensors and particle counter are used to monitor the three-dimensional dynamics of the lower atmosphere. Ground-based remote sensing by ceilometer for mixing layer height detection as well as a Radio-Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) for temperature and wind profile measurements at the University campus complete the new network architecture and UAV height profiling of atmospheric parameters.The SmartAQnet research initiative focuses on the subject of data access and data-based applications. Such complex monitoring provides the basis of deeper process understanding of air pollution exposure. The network architecture is shown and first results about spatial variation of meteorological influences upon air pollution exposure is presented using ceilometer, UAV and the existing monitoring network data.

AB  - In July 2020, NASA will launch the Mars2020 mission. This mission, very similar to the Mars Science Laboratory and its rover Curiosity, consists in landing an instrumented rover on the Martian surface in order to characterize the geology and history of a new landing site on Mars, investigate Mars habitability, seek potential biosignatures, cache samples for an eventual return to Earth, and demonstrate in-situ production of oxygen needed for human exploration.The rover will carry several different instruments to perform field analyses in biology, climatology, mineralogy, geology and geochemistry. Among this payload, the SuperCam instrument, an improved new generation of the ChemCam instrument on Curiosity, has been developed for remote microscale characterization of the mineralogy and elemental chemistry of the Mars surface, along with the search for extant organic materials. In addition to the elemental characterization offered by Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), a new remote Raman spectroscopy analysis and an infrared spectrometer have been added for a complete mineralogical and chemical characterization of the samples. A context color imaging capability is also implemented to place the analyzed samples in their geological context.SuperCam consists of three units. The "Body Unit" built by the LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratories) in the US, the "Mast Unit" built by a French consortium of 5 laboratories (IRAP as leader, LESIA, LATMOS, IAS, and LAB) funded by the French Space Agency (CNES), and a "Calibration Target Unit" under the responsibility of the University of Valladolid in Spain.A very compact IRS (Infrared Spectrometer) is part of the SuperCam-MU payload. The IRS concept is based on the spectral selection by an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF) in the 1.3-2.6 mu m range with a spectral resolution better than 30 wavenumbers. The AOTF is driven by radio frequencies injected in a transducer mounted directly on a birefringent crystal. This coupling creates acoustic waves in the crystal that behave like a Bragg grating. The incident light is then diffracted in two orders (e-ray and o-ray) at the same wavelength following a so-called tuning relation law (relation between diffracted wavelength and injected radio frequency). Each diffracted order is focused on a photodiode. A complete spectrum is obtained after the scan of all individual wavelengths.The IRS is built by LESIA and LATMOS, two French laboratories located in Paris area.After intensive performance and qualification tests as well as a calibration on a flight-representative model, the team has built the flight model. The qualification results and the performances of the instrument are presented.

AB  - Multi-sensor, multi-band and multi-temporal remote sensing data can be very useful in precise flood monitoring. In this paper, we describe DAFNE, a Matlab (R)-based, open source toolbox, to produce flood maps from remotely sensed and other ancillary information, through a data fusion approach. DAFNE is based on Bayesian Networks, and is composed of several independent modules, each one performing a different task. Multi-temporal and multi-sensor data can be easily handled, with the possibility of producing time series of output flood maps, and thus follow the evolution of single or recurrent flood events. Here, an application of the toolbox is illustrated to delineate a flood map, close to the peak of inundation occurred in April 2015 on the Strymonas river (Greece), from multi-band optical and SAR data.

TI  - Polarized-neutron investigation of magnetic ordering and spin dynamics in BaCo<sub>2</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> frustrated honeycomb-lattice magnet
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnetic properties of the cobaltite BaCo2(AsO4)(2), a good realization of the quasi two-dimensional frustrated honeycomb-lattice system with strong planar anisotropy, have been reinvestigated by means of spherical neutron polarimetry with CRYOPAD. From accurate measurements of polarization matrices both on elastic and inelastic contributions as a function of the scattering vector Q, we have been able to determine the low-temperature magnetic structure of BaCo2(AsO4)(2) and reveal its puzzling in-plane spin dynamics. Surprisingly, the ground-state structure (described by an incommensurate propagation vector k(1) = (k(x), 0, k(z)), with k(x) = 0.270 +/- 0.005 and k(z) approximate to -1.31) appears to be a quasi-collinear structure, and not a simple helix, as previously determined. In addition, our results have revealed the existence of a non-negligible out-of-plane moment component approximate to 0.25 mu(B)/Co2+, representing about 10% of the in-plane component, as demonstrated by the presence of finite off-diagonal elements P-yz and P-zy of the polarization matrix, both on elastic and inelastic magnetic contributions. Despite a clear evidence of the existence of a slightly inelastic contribution of structural origin superimposed to the magnetic excitations at the scattering vectors Q = (0.27, 0, 3.1) and Q = (0.73, 0, 0.8) (energy transfer Delta E approximate to 2.3 meV), no strong inelastic nuclear-magnetic interference terms could be detected so far, meaning that the nuclear and magnetic degrees of freedom have very weak cross-correlations. The strong inelastic P-yz and P-zy matrix elements can be understood by assuming that the magnetic excitations in BaCo2(AsO4)(2) are spin waves associated with trivial anisotropic precessions of the magnetic moments involved in the canted incommensurate structure.

TI  - Cartography of area burned in Galicia in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century: presentation of the product and webmapping application
T2  - NACC-Nova Acta Cientifica Compostelana Bioloxia
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this work is to produce an updated cartography of areas affected by wildfires in Galicia (between 2001 and 2017), as well as to ensure potential users free accessibility to this spatial dataset through a webmapping application. The baseline information is the Burned Area product derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, on-board NASA's Term and Aqua satellites. From this infonnation, we generated the following secondary products: 1) annual burned area, 2) total area burned between 2001 and 2017, 3) fire recurrence and 4) time since last fire; at 500-m resolution, in raster and vectorial format. The annual burned area was compared with official fire statistics at the province level from Spanish Government. The results showed a high statistical correlation between the burned area estimated from MODIS product and official fire statistics (Pearson coef. = 0.92). However, MODIS product tends to overestimate the official burned area (mean = 2.76%), but in more or less extent depending on the year and province (SD = +/- 103%). Despite these limitations, these products constitute a key source of freely-available spatial information on wildfires in Galicia, with a wide range of potential applications for biodiversity conservation, forest management and land planning.

TI  - Automatic day time cloud detection over land and sea from MSG SEVIRI images using three features and two artificial intelligence approaches
T2  - SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fuzzy logic and neural network approaches are proposed to generate a cloud mask for Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG SEVIRI) images. MSG images are classified into land/sea clear sky or cloudy. A spatial and temporal properties of three solar channels (0.6, 0.8 and 1.6 mu m), and three thermal infrared channels (3.9, 6.2 and 10.8 mu m) are used for this aim. The proposed methods were tested and evaluated using seventy-two MSG images taken at different times and dates. The fuzzy logic method leads to cloud detection accuracy of 84.41%, and the neural network achieved an average accuracy of 99.69%. Our proposed methods detected not only thick clouds but also thin and the less bright clouds. To give more support to our results, we made a comparison between the proposed approaches and the cloud mask product which is one of the applications integrate into software package Satellite Application Facility to NoWCasting and Very Short Range Forecasting (SAFNWC/MSG) by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites EUMETSAT applied on the same MSG data. The high average accuracy achieved by our neural network proposed method (and more less for fuzzy logic) demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness and also the utility to benefit of using the artificial intelligent techniques in remote sensing imagery applications.

TI  - Adequate lymph node evaluation in the elderly is associated with improved survival in patients with stage I-III colon cancer: A validation study using the National Cancer Data Base
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph node involvement (LNI) is an important prognostic factor in colon cancer. But, variations in LNI among different age groups are less known. Adequate lymph node evaluation (LNE) requires assessment of >= 12 nodes. In our previous study, using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, we demonstrated that older patients are less likely to have LNI (Khan et al. 2014). Our current study validates those findings using National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).Methods: NCDB was queried for patients diagnosed with stages I-III colon adenocarcinoma from 2004 to 2008 who underwent surgical resections. Pearson Chi-square test and Cox proportional hazards regression model were utilized for statistical analysis.Results: A cohort of 97,831 patients was identified for analysis. Among patients belonging to 18-64, 65-74 and >75 years age groups, frequency of adequate LNE was 73.6%, 69% and 67.4% respectively, with pathologically confirmed LNI rates being 44.7%, 37.8% and 29.3% respectively (p < 0.0001). Adequate LNE was associated with improved 5-year overall survival (OS) regardless of age, gender, race, comorbidity index, insurance, income, year of diagnosis, pathologic tumor status, stage, grade, type of colectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy or academic level of facility. Rates of adequate LNE increased from 2004 to 2008, with a corresponding increase in survival outcomes (p < 0.0001).Conclusion: Adequate LNE is very crucial for appropriate staging of colon cancer, and carries a high prognostic value. This study validates our previous findings of lower rates of LNI in elderly and reiterates the importance of adequate LNE, which is associated with improved survival. Also identified were increasing rates of adequate LNE over the years, with corresponding improvement in OS.

TI  - Improving near-real time deforestation monitoring in tropical dry forests by combining dense Sentinel-1 time series with Landsat and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining observations from multiple optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites can provide temporally dense and regular information at medium resolution scale, independently of weather, season, and location. This has the potential to improve near real-time deforestation monitoring in dry tropical regions, where traditional optical only monitoring systems typically suffer from limited data availability due to persistent cloud cover. In this context, the recently launched Sentinel-1 satellites promise unprecedented potential, because for the first time dense and regular SAR observations are free and openly available. We demonstrate multi-sensor near real-time deforestation detection in tropical dry forests, through the combination of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR time series with ALSO-2 PALSAR-2 L-band SAR, and Landsat-7/ETM + and 8/OLI. We used spatial normalisation to reduce the dry forest seasonality in the optical and SAR time series, and combined them within a probabilistic approach to detect deforestation in near real-time. Our results for a dry tropical forest site in Bolivia, showed that, as a result of high observation availability of Sentinel-1, deforestation events were detected more timely with Sentinel-1 than compared to Landsat and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The spatial and temporal accuracies of the multi-sensor approach were higher than the single-sensor results. We improved the precision of the reference data derived from the multi-sensor satellite time series, which enabled a more robust estimation of the temporal accuracy. We quantified how the near real-time deforestation detection is associated with a trade-off between the confidence in detection and the temporal accuracy. We showed that the trade-off affects the choice on how to use the near-real time data for different applications such as fast alerting with high temporal accuracy but lower confidence versus accurate detection at lower temporal detail. When aiming for a high confidence in change area estimates for example, deforestation was detected with a user's accuracy of 88%, a producer's accuracy of 89% (low area bias), and a mean time lag of 31 days using all sensors. This is on average 7 days earlier than when using only Sentinel-1 observations, and six weeks earlier than when relying only on Landsat observations. We showed that confident near real-time deforestation alerts can be provided with a mean time lag of 22 days, but these are associated with a higher commission error. With more dense time series data expected from the Sentinel-1 and -2 sensors for the upcoming decade, spatial and temporal detection accuracy of multi-sensor deforestation monitoring in the tropics will improve further.

TI  - Columbia River flood basalt flow emplacement rates-Fast, slow, or variable?
T2  - FIELD VOLCANOLOGY: A TRIBUTE TO THE DISTINGUISHED CAREER OF DON SWANSON
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Emplacement models for voluminous sheet flows of the Columbia River flood basalts vary significantly in style and duration, with the latter ranging from as little as one week to decades and even centuries. Testing the efficacy of such models requires detailed field studies and close examination of each stratigraphic unit. The Steens Basalt, the oldest formation of the Columbia River flood basalts, differs from the later formations in that it is composed of stacked successions of thin, commonly inflated flow lobes combined into thicker compound flows, or flow fields. These flow lobes are of limited geographic extent, with relatively high emplacement rates, but they are otherwise similar to modern examples. Evidence for flow inflation in the much larger sheet flows of the Grande Ronde Basalt, Wanapum Basalt, and Saddle Mountains Basalt is also apparent, but with more variable rates of emplacement. For example, the Asotin and Umatilla Members (Saddle Mountains Basalt) and Sentinel Bluffs Member flows (Grande Ronde Basalt) erupted distinct compositions along their linear vent systems, but over 200 km west of their vents, these flows are no longer distinct. Instead, they exist as compositional zones of a single, moderately mixed lava flow. Such flows must have been emplaced rapidly, in perhaps weeks to months, while others have been shown to erupt over much longer time periods. We conclude that emplacement rates may be quite variable throughout the Columbia River flood basalt province, with thin flow units of Steens Basalt erupting continuously and rapidly, and larger inflated sheet flows erupting over variable time spans, some from a few weeks to months, and others over a duration of years.

TI  - Is Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Required in Patients Who Undergo Primary Breast Surgery?
T2  - BREAST CARE

AB  - Local treatment of the axilla in clinically node-negative (cN0) early breast cancer patients with routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is debated for various reasons: i) pN staging information may not be necessary for the postoperative treatment decision regarding adjuvant systemic therapy in the great majority of patients; ii) the SLNB-positive rate is declining below 20% in specialized breast centers; iii) albeit being a minimally invasive procedure, SLNB causes a significant reduction in quality of life in 23% of patients; and iv) previous randomized trials from the pre-SLNB era did not show a disadvantage for patients without axillary surgery with regard to overall survival. These data support the hypothesis that avoiding axillary treatment in patients with clinically and sonographically unsuspicious lymph nodes seems to be a safe option, although omitting axillary surgery may increase the risk of locoregional recurrence. Currently, the information regarding node-positive status is essential to guide postoperative treatment such as systemic or radiation therapies in a non-negligible minority of patients. Three ongoing prospective European trials (SOUND, INSEMA, BOOG 2013-08) with axillary observation alone versus SLNB in cN0 patients and primary breast-conserving surgery have the objective to evaluate oncologic safety when omitting SLNB.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in porocarcinoma: A case reports
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a slow-growing carcinoma arising from the eccrine sweat glands. Based on its clinical presentation it can be confused with malignant and benign skin lesions, both. Histological examination is essential to formulate a correct diagnosis. Surgical excision with clear margins is the standard therapeutic approach while the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) remains controversial.CASE PRESENTATION: The Authors report two cases of EPC of the lower limbs occurred in two women. Patients were treated by wide surgical excision of the lesion and SNLB. 6 months follow-up was disease free for both patients.CONCLUSION: Although a rare cutaneous tumor, EPC has to be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of malignant skin lesions because of its possible loco-regional aggressiveness and related morbidity. Among the available treatment options, surgical excision is considered the standard approach whereas the role of SNLB is controversial although the Authors discuss a possible usefulness for staging and diagnosis.

TI  - Relationship Between Spectral Data and Dendrometric Variables in Eucalyptus sp. Stands
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT The present study aims (a) to assess the correlations between forest stand characteristics (viz., basal area, dominant height, and volume) and the reflectance values derived from Landsat 5 TM spectral bands as well as from vegetation indices and (b) to understand how Eucalyptus sp. stand age influences these correlations. Sampling data comprised a set of 35 permanent plots from a forest inventory conducted annually between 2006 and 2011. Spectral data were derived from Landsat 5 TM images. The results showed that TM4 and TM5 spectral bands, as well as vegetation indices ND54 and TM5/4, were better correlated with basal area and volume, while the TM2 spectral band was better correlated with dominant height. Eucalyptus sp. stand age directly influenced the correlations between spectral data and forest stand characteristics, and could not be disregarded in the spectral characterization of the forest variables.

TI  - PolSAR image classification via multimodal sparse representation-based feature fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that various features extraction approaches are utilized in polarimetric synthetic aperture (PolSAR) terrain classification for representing the data characteristic. It needs relevant and effective feature fusion algorithms to process complicated features. To address this issue, this article presents a multimodal sparse representation (MSR) framework based algorithm to fuse the different feature vectors from the complicated data space. Polarimetric data features, decomposition features, and the texture features from Pauli colour-coded image are selected to represent multimodal data in different observation modes. The corresponding multimodal manifold regularizations are added to MSR framework to approximate the data structure. Considering the independence and correlation of features, the intrinsic affinity matrices are calculated from this framework. They are processed via local preserve projection algorithm to project the multimodal features into a low dimensionally intrinsic feature space for subsequent classification. Three datasets are utilized in experiments, Western Xi'an, Flevoland, and San Francisco Bay datasets from the Radarsat-2 system in C-band. The effect of regularization parameters and different dimensional fused features are analysed in visualization and quantitation performance. The experiment results demonstrate that the effectiveness and validity of proposed method are superior to other state-of-art methods.

AB  - Bathymetry provides important information for marine environment with various hydrological applications. Traditional acoustic echo-sounding techniques have been developed for several decades which can measure water depth more than hundreds of meters. However, they have their limitation in the shallow area when it is difficult to access by ships. Recent airborne bathymetry LIDAR systems can access coastal area without restriction and can measure water depth up to tens of meters in clear water, but the operational expanse is high. The economic approach for bathymetry estimation in coastal area is optical satellite images. They can survey a large area with single or multiple satellite images and the penetration of visible light in water merely reaches 30 meters. In this study, a three-layer back propagation neural network is proposed to estimate bathymetry with limited number of training samples. The experiments show the mean square errors are less than 5 meters.

TI  - Estimation of litter mass in nongrowing seasons in arid grasslands using MODIS satellite data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Litter has a special ecological functioningin grasslands. Few studies have been conducted to estimate litter mass using remotely sensed data during nongrowing seasons in arid grasslands although it is important forage for livestock sustainability. With MODIS data, estimation methods were developed for litter mass in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia calibrated with field surveys. As MODIS Band 7 is located in the lignocellulose absorption pit of litter near 2100 nm, the best models were obtained for NDTI (normalized difference tillage index) (normalized difference between Bands 6 and 7) and STI (soil tillage index) (ratio of Band 6-7) among soil-unadjusted indices, and for MSACRI (modified soil-adjusted crop residue index) (modification of NDTI by incorporating soil line) among soil-adjusted indices. NDTI and STI explained 63% of the variance of litter mass, while MSACRI explained 71% of the variance. If data are not available for calculating soil line, it may be appropriate to use the soil-adjusted NDTI (S-NDTI), a new index proposed in the study that incorporates a soil adjustment factor into the NDTI equation. The optimal S-NDTI explained 66% of the variance. The NDTI, STI, MSACRI and S-NDTI can be applied to estimate litter mass in arid grasslands.

TI  - The biological impact of blood pressure-associated genetic variants in the natriuretic peptide receptor C gene on human vascular smooth muscle
T2  - HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major global risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic variants at the NPR3 locus associated with BP, but the functional impact of these variants remains to be determined. Here we confirmed, by a genome-wide association study within UK Biobank, the existence of two independent BP-related signals within NPR3 locus. Using human primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) from different individuals, we found that the BP-elevating alleles within one linkage disequilibrium block identified by the sentinel variant rs1173771 was associated with lower endogenous NPR3 mRNA and protein levels in VSMCs, together with reduced levels in open chromatin and nuclear protein binding. The BP-elevating alleles also increased VSMC proliferation, angiotensin II-induced calcium flux and cell contraction. However, an analogous genotype-dependent association was not observed in vascular ECs. Our study identifies novel, putative mechanisms for BP-associated variants at the NPR3 locus to elevate BP, further strengthening the case for targeting NPR-C as a therapeutic approach for hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention.

TI  - Diverse Responses of Vegetation Phenology to Climate Change in Different Grasslands in Inner Mongolia during 2000-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology in temperate grasslands is highly sensitive to climate change. However, it is still unclear how the timing of vegetation phenology events (especially for autumn phenology) is altered in response to climate change across different grassland types. In this study, we investigated variations of the growing season start (SOS) and end (EOS), derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2000-2016), for meadow steppe, typical steppe, and desert steppe in the Inner Mongolian grassland of Northern China. Using gridded climate data (2000-2015), we further analyzed correlations between SOS/EOS and pre-season average air temperature and total precipitation (defined as 90-day period prior to SOS/EOS, i.e., pre-SOS/EOS) in each grid. The results showed that both SOS and EOS occurred later in desert steppe (day of year (doy) 114 and 312) than in meadow steppe (doy 109 and 305) and typical steppe (doy 111 and 307); namely, desert steppe has a relatively late growing season than meadow steppe and typical steppe. For all three grasslands, SOS was mainly controlled by pre-SOS precipitation with the sensitivity being largest in desert steppe. EOS was closely connected with pre-EOS air temperature in meadow steppe and typical steppe, but more closely related to pre-EOS precipitation in desert steppe. During 2000-2015, SOS in typical steppe and desert steppe has significantly advanced by 2.2 days and 10.6 days due to a significant increase of pre-SOS precipitation. In addition, EOS of desert steppe has also significantly advanced by 6.8 days, likely as a result from the combined effects of elevated preseason temperature and precipitation. Our study highlights the diverse responses in the timing of spring and autumn phenology to preceding temperature and precipitation in different grassland types. Results from this study can help to guide grazing systems and to develop policy frameworks for grasslands protection.

TI  - A real-time pluvial flood forecasting system for Castries, St. Lucia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, real-time flood forecasting has become a more feasible approach to reducing the impacts of flooding in urban areas. Two key tools in this context are high resolution hydrodynamic modelling in combination with accurate hydrological forcing. In some cases, when it is not possible to produce such accurate flood forecasts based on high resolution models and data, it may nevertheless be possible to use the resources currently available, accepting that there is a greater degree of uncertainty involved. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a remotely controlled, real-time, pluvial flood forecasting system for Castries, St. Lucia that utilises the limited data available locally. The results from the study suggest that although Global Forecast System (GFS) rainfall data may be considered coarse for urban applications, there is still a significant amount of skill and usability after it is postprocessed and used in combination with observed rainfall data. Evidence from the study also suggests that the use of images from different sources is invaluable for 2D overland model calibration and validation in urban areas. Conclusions from the study are potentially transferable to other sites in similar data-scare and resource-limited locations.

M3  - Article
AB  - This publication focuses on the development of Russian liberalism as an ideology in 1855-1881. This study is a vigorous, focused attempt to examine the initial phase of radicalization of the liberal intelligentsia during the Great Reforms Era, as well as its perception of itself as a distinct social group. The liberal worldview, based on universalism, anti-militarism, and seeking meritocracy. This outlook ultimately prevented liberals from supporting the autocracy and led many of them to include the justification of some revolutionary ideas in their discourse. Subsequently, they created a climate supportive of Russia's early revolutionary movement.

AB  - Satellite images are information rich snapshots of ecosystems and landscapes. In consequence, the features in the images strongly depend on the environmental conditions. Such dependency between climate and landscapes has been regarded since the beginning of earth sciences; however, it has never been taken as literally as in the present study. We adapted a deep learning generative model as a first demonstration of the potential behind deep learning for spatial pattern generation in geoscience. The purpose is to build a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) useful to establish the relationship between two loosely linked set of variables that show multitude of complex spatial features such as climate conditions to aerial image. We trained a custom cGAN to generate Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery given a set of climatic and terrain predictors. Results show that the generated imagery shares many characteristics with the real one. In some cases, the quality of the generated imagery is high enough to deceive humans. We envision that such use of deep learning for geoscience could become an important tool to test the effects of climate on landscapes and ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluation of the elevation model influence on the orthorectification of Sentinel-2 satellite images over Austria
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA) is using PlanetDEM for the generation of their Sentinel-2 Level-1C orthophotos. There are concerns that this DEM is not accurate enough for this purpose, especially over mountainous regions like in Austria. In this study, we investigate the height accuracy of PlanetDEM in Austria by comparing it with a reference DEM that is derived from airborne laser scanning. Afterwards, we predict the errors in the Sentinel orthophotos that are caused by these DEM errors: 99.8% of all pixels have a PlanetDEM-induced displacement between +/- 10 m (i.e. one Sentinel-2 pixel) for all investigated four satellite tracks over Austria. Still, at a few spots, the location errors can reach 60 m. ESA's goal is to achieve a multi-temporal geo-registration quality (for Level-1C products) of 3 m (95.5% confidence) once the Global Reference Image is established. If we assume that this error budget consists partly of a georeferencing and partly of a DEM-induced error and both are equal, then the DEM-induced error may only amount to 2 m. In this case, PlanetDEM would not allow for this accuracy in the mountainous regions, because there, according to the predictions of this study, 95.5% of the errors are between +/- 3.8 m.

TI  - Estimating forest parameters using Landsat ETM plus spectral responses and monocultured plantation fieldwork measurements data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest parameters, such as mean diameter at breast height (DBH), mean stand height (H) or volume per hectare (V), are imperative for forest resources assessment. Traditional forest inventory that is usually based on fieldwork is often difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to conduct over large areas. Therefore, estimating forest parameters in large areas using a traditional inventory approach combined with satellite data analysis can improve the spatial estimates of forest inventory data, and hence be useful for sustainable forest management and natural resources assessment. However, extracting practical information from satellite imagery for such purpose is a challenging task mainly because of insufficient knowledge linking forest inventory data to satellite spectral response. Here, we present the use of a cost-free Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) in order to explore whether it is possible to combine all available optical bands from a specific sensor for improving forest parameter spatial estimates, based on fieldwork at Lahav and Kramim Forests, in the Israeli Northern Negev. A generic strategy, based on morphological structuring element, convex hall and spectral band linear combination algorithms, was developed in order to extract the mathematical dependencies between the forest inventory measurements and linear combination sets of Landsat-7 ETM+ spectral bands, which yields the highest possible correlation with the forest inventory measured data. Using the mathematical dependency functions, we then convert the entire Landsat-7 ETM+ scenes into forest inventory parameter values with sufficient accuracy and tolerance errors needed for sustainable forest management. The root mean square error obtained between the measured and the estimated values for Lahav Forest are 0.70 cm, 0.29m, and 1.48m(3)ha(-1) for the mean DBH, H, and V, respectively, and for Kramim forest are 0.61 cm, 0.70m, and 6.31m(3)ha(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the suggested strategy could also be applied with other satellites data sources.

TI  - Estimation of Crop Evapotranspiration Using Satellite Remote Sensing-Based Vegetation Index
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation water is limited and scarce in many areas of the world, including Comarca Lagunera, Mexico. Thus better estimations of irrigation water requirements are essential to conserve water. The general objective was to estimate crop water demands or crop evapotranspiration (ETc) at different scales using satellite remote sensing-based vegetation index. The study was carried out in northern Mexico (Comarca Lagunera) during four growing seasons. Six, eleven, three, and seven clear Landsat images were acquired for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively, for the analysis. The results showed that ETc was low at initial and early development stages, while ETc was high during mid-season and harvest stages. These results are not new but give us confidence in the rest of our ETc results. Daily ETc maps helped to explain the variability of crop water use during the growing season. Based on the results we can conclude that ETc maps developed from remotely sensed multispectral vegetation indices are a useful tool for quantifying crop water consumption at regional and field scales. Using ETc maps at the field scale, farmers can supply appropriate amounts of irrigation water corresponding to each growth stage, leading to water conservation.

AB  - Acquiring information about forest stands such as individual tree species is crucial for monitoring forests. To date, such information is assessed by human interpreters using airborne or an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which is time/cost consuming. The recent advancement in remote sensing image acquisition, such as WorldView-3, has increased the spatial resolution up to 30 cm and spectral resolution up to 16 bands. This advancement has significantly increased the potential for Individual Tree Species Detection (ITSD). In order to use the single source Worldview-3 images, our proposed method first segments the image to delineate trees, and then detects trees using a VGG-16 network. We developed a pipeline for feeding the deep CNN network using the information from all the 8 visible-near infrareds' bands and trained it. The result is compared with two state-of-the-art ensemble classifiers namely Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB). Results demonstrate that the VGG-16 outperforms all the other methods reaching an accuracy of about 92.13%.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The Health Sector Evolution Plan (HSEP) is the most recent reform in Iran's health care system that was launched in May 2014 in all university-affiliated hospitals to reduce health care expenditure for patients, while improving the efficiency and quality of hospital services. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the HSEP on the performance of 15 hospitals affiliated with Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences (KUMS), located in the western region of Iran.Design/methodology/approach The Pabon Lasso model was used to measure the performance of hospitals before and after the implementation of the HSEP in 2013-2014 and 2015-2016, respectively. Three indicators of average length of stay (ALoS), bed occupancy rate (BOR) and bed turnover rate (BTR) were analyzed by the Pabon Lasso model.Findings The results showed that the average ALoS, BTR and BOR before the introduction of the HSEP were 2.59 days, 92 times and 57 percent, respectively, and the corresponding figures for these indicators after the implementation of the HSEP were 2.61 days, 98.9 times and 59.9 percent. The results indicated that before the introduction of the HESP, 40 percent of hospitals were in zone 1 (poor performance: low BTR and BOR and high ALoS), 27 percent in zone 2, 20 percent in zone 3 (good performance: high BTR and BOR and low ALoS) and 13 percent in zone 4. After the HSEP, the proportion of hospitals in zones 1-4 was 33, 27, 20 and 20 percent, respectively.Originality/value This study is the first to use the Pabon Lasso model technique to evaluate the impact of the HSEP on hospitals affiliated with KUMS.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter introduces the allodial principle and provides educators with an overview of the reasons that this principle would enable a paradigmatic shift in the way that Australian specialist in environmental, Indigenous, and legal studies, teacher educators, and teachers think about land and water education. Land and water are so basic to human life and students need to grapple with matters of sustainability and Indigenous entitlement into their future. People now living on lands and waterways that have been colonized, such as Australia, are taught to regard land and water in ways that have been fundamentally shaped by English and older European legal understandings. This chapter introduces the idea of allodial pedagogy, a critical, title-based pedagogy that invites educators to examine their worldview such that there is a fundamental shift in their pedagogical content knowledge and curricula vision. In short, this pedagogical approach asks that they begin from a different place in conceptualizing what they teach about land and water. From this different starting point, decisions about how to teach the core knowledge of one's specialist areas will change and the ways of teaching it will also change.

AB  - This study aimed to interpreting the view of current media by artificial intelligence(AI) with the case of a TV show Person of Interest, which was broadcasted until 2016 in US. In this study, we first attempted to find how AI reflects the three laws of robotics, which often appear in Science Fictions. In addition, we paid attention to how the society looks according to the change of the manipulator of the AI, and as a result we derived the distinguishes of the show from other content dealing with robots or AI in terms of narrative. Through this study, we classified the messages in accordance of AI into three categories- importance of data sovereignty, potential of intelligence explosion, and blind faith in high technology. This study suggested that the show emphasizes the consciousness and attitude that should be possessed as a citizen who meets the era of AI prior to raising issue of ‘what artificial intelligence is should be developed for our convenience?’

AB  - Flood incidents that often occur in Karawang regency need to be mitigated. These expectations exist on technologies that can predict, anticipate and reduce disaster risks. Flood modeling techniques using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data can be applied in mitigation activities. High accuracy DEM data used in modeling, will result in better flooding flood models. The result of high accuracy DEM data processing will yield information about surface morphology which can be used to identify indication of flood hazard area. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe flood hazard areas by identifying wetland areas using DEM data and Landsat-8 images. TerraSAR-X high-resolution data is used to detect wetlands from landscapes, while land cover is identified by Landsat image data. The Topography Wetness Index (TWI) method is used to detect and identify wetland areas with basic DEM data, while for land cover analysis using Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) method. The result of TWI modeling yields information about potential land of flood. Overlay TWI map with land cover map that produces information that in Karawang regency the most vulnerable areas occur flooding in rice fields. The spatial accuracy of the flood hazard area in this study was 87%.

AB  - Rice yield in Java Island as national rice supplier in order to support food security. Java has a dense population, causing very high pressure on land use. The need for housing, roads and industrial infrastructure encourages the conversion of agricultural land for other land uses. This study aims to formulate strategies for the purpose of maintaining food security in flood-prone areas. Karawang Regency is a rice barn of West Java Province and is also a frequent area of flooding. Therefore, it is necessary to map the spread of flood-prone areas and to analyze land use linkages, rice productivity, population and food needs in the study area. Strategies for maintaining spatial food security are by mapping land cover multi years and mapping the flood hazard areas using high-resolution DEM data. Land cover mapping using RBI Map Scale 1: 25,000 the Year 2000 and Citra Landsat-8 and Spot-6 Year 2015. Wetland Area Year 2000 is 120,371 (62.83%), land area Year 2015 is 98,462 ha (51.40%). The average rice field area caused by flooding reaches 219.84 ha/year, if the productivity of 6.9 tons/ha annually loses rice production on average 1,517 tons. Food security in the research area is still maintained from various pressures of land use. There is unfulfilled support for national food security with the obligation to provide 1.5 million tons of paddy stock per year. The selection of strategies in maintaining food security in the research area is to tighten supervision in licensing in favor of the protection of paddy fields. The professionalism of agricultural extension resources will be able to increase rice productivity.

TI  - Sentinel plants as programmable procession units: insights from a multidisciplinary perspective about stress memory and plant signaling and their relevance at community level
T2  - PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Stress memory and an effective signaling among individuals in a given community are recognized to improve plant performance under recurrent stressful conditions. As living beings with memory and signaling abilities, plants can be considered as processing units and then be trained - or programmable from a computational viewpoint - and prepared for facing biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we propose that sentinel plants could improve the resilience of agricultural and natural communities by reducing the impact of biotic or abiotic stressors on their neighbors. Modeling plants as programmable (or trainable) processing units compels us to think about a multidisciplinary perspective for integrating stress memory, signaling, and resilience of biological systems into executable programs, fostering the creation of applications and technologies that would benefit from the spatiotemporal dynamics related to plant-plant and plant-environment interactions.

TI  - Assessment of Witch Flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (NAFO Divisions 4RST), February 2017.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - Witch Flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) are slow growing and late maturing. In the 1970s, the mean length of a 12-year-old female in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence was only 41 cm, and the age at 50% maturity of females was 10 years. Because of these life-history characteristics, this species is particularly vulnerable to overexploitation. A fishery for Witch Flounder developed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (NAFO Divisions 4RST) in the 1950s. Annual landings averaged over 3,500 t in the 1960s and 1970s, declining to an average of 1,800 t in the 1980s. Landings declined further in the early 1990s to a low of 320 t in 1995. Landings then increased to an average of 850 t annually in 1998-2008 but declined again in 2009-2010. While the total allowable catch remained at 1,000 t until 2011, landings in 2011 were 425 t. The total allowable catch was reduced to 500 t in 2012 and to 300 t in 2013 where it has remained since. Landings have closely matched the total allowable catch for the period 2013-2016. A research vessel (RV) survey index of commercial biomass (fish 30 cm or longer) was constructed for 4RST based on the August RV survey of the northern Gulf and the September RV survey of the southern Gulf. This index, available since 1987, declined sharply in the early 1990s, increased to an intermediate level in 1999 and 2000, but then declined again, fluctuating around 40% of the 1987-1990 for the period 2001-2010 and has shown an increasing trend since. A sentinel survey index of fish 30 cm or longer, based on the July sentinel survey of the northern Gulf and the August sentinel survey of the southern Gulf, is available since 2003. This index declined after 2006, was at its lowest level in 2011 and has shown an increasing trend since. A Bayesian surplus production model indicates a 90% decline in commercial biomass between 1961 and 2011 and an increasing trend since. The limit reference point (LRP) for this stock is estimated to be 10,480 t of commercial sized fish (30 cm and longer). The estimate of the biomass of fish 30 cm and longer in 2016 is 13,270 t. Based on the uncertainties in the estimates of both the 2016 biomass and the LRP, the probability that biomass is below the LRP in 2016 is 38%. Projections of the population model indicate that biomass is expected to increase, with probabilities of 74% that the biomass will be above the LRP in 2021 with annual catches of 300 t and 71% with annual catches of 500 t.

TI  - Melanoma and tattoos: a case report and review of the literature
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma cases arising in tattoos have been increasingly described, however, there is no clear relationship between this practice and the development of cutaneous malignancies. Objectives: We report a new case of melanoma in a dark-blue tattoo and we review all cases of melanoma reported in the medical literature from 1938 to date. Materials & methods: Pubmed and Google Scholar were searched using the terms "melanoma tattoo", "tattoo skin tumour" and "ink melanoma". Results: In most cases, the melanoma occurred on dark blue (10/30), black (8/30), or blue ink (3/30). The Breslow thickness at diagnosis was <= 1 mm in 13/30, 1-2 mm in 3/30, 2-4 mm in 2/30, >4 mm in 5/30, and Clark II in 2/30 (not available in 5/30). Conclusions: Both the incidence of melanoma and the number of tattoos have been increasing in recent years, but a possible carcinogenic effect of tattoos remains unproven. The spread of this decorative custom will make observation of melanoma in tattoos more frequent in dermatological practice, therefore these cases should be reported in national skin cancer registries.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the effect of neighborhood land use on land use change in Mato Grosso, Brazil, one of the world's most dynamic agricultural frontiers. Using an innovative combination of spatial statistics and remotely sensed data, this research shows that the likelihood of an area being converted to agriculture is closely tied to how land is used in a location's surroundings. The results also suggest that this spatial spillover effect cannot be tied exclusively to the distribution of natural suitability characteristics. Rather, the likelihood of an area being converted to agriculture appears to reflect the dynamic socio-economic conditions of a location's surroundings. The findings imply that (i) agricultural agencies or experts seeking to support developing agricultural regions should recognize the importance of returns to scale and local clustering and that (ii) land use modeling can be improved by accounting for suitability and land uses in nearby locations.

TI  - Downward causation and supervenience: the non-reductionist's extra argument for incompatibilism
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLORATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agent-causal theories of free will, which rely on a non-reductionist account of the agent, have traditionally been associated with libertarianism. However, some authors have recently argued in favor of compatibilist agent-causal accounts. In this essay, I will show that such accounts cannot avoid serious problems of implausibility or incoherence. A careful analysis of the implications of non-reductionist views of the agent (event-causal or agent-causal as they may be) reveals that such views necessarily imply either the denial of the principle of supervenience or the assumption of bottom-level indeterminism. I will contend that the former alternative comes at a high cost, while the latter is quite plausible. Therefore, providing that they accept the condition of the truth of indeterminism, non-reductionist accounts of the agent do not have to contradict our scientific worldview. Interestingly, while they should be taken seriously by anyone who is concerned with the passivity of the agent's role under a reductionist scenario, non-reductivist accounts end up contributing an extra incompatibilist argument to the free will debate.

TI  - Sea state in the Baltic Sea from space-borne high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, remote sensing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from X-band TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X (TS-X and TD-X) satellites have been used to adopt the algorithms for estimating sea state parameters in the specific condition of the Baltic Sea with archipelago islands and where short steep sea state dominates. Since the moving targets can be defocused and shifted in SAR images, sea state consisting of short windsea waves with strong local orbital velocities and wave breaking needs additional effort for accurate estimation of the total significant wave height that consists of swell and windsea parts. The XWAVE_C algorithm, developed for the North Sea, where the long swell waves coming from the Atlantic Ocean are present during storms, was further enhanced for the short steep windsea which dominates under ordinary storm conditions in the Baltics. For the empirical XWAVE_C model function, based on the spectral analysis of subscenes as well as on local wind information, an additional term was incorporated for assessment the minimal windsea significant wave height by applying JONSWAP wave spectra. A term to compensate spectral distortions triggered by windsea waves moving in SAR flight direction has also been introduced. In total, 95 TS-X/TD-X StripMap scenes between 2012 and 2017 were acquired in Eastern Baltic Sea, processed and analysed. The wave height results from SAR images were compared with collocated in situ data from 11 available buoys. The analysed data include both high and low windsea conditions. The comparison of SAR-derived wave heights with measured wave heights shows high agreement with a correlation coefficient r of 0.88. The wind speed, estimated from SAR images, was compared to measurements from 14 collocated in situ stations, yielding a high agreement with an r value of 0.90. This article is focused on the algorithm developments; however, it is also the first study of sea state retrieval in the Baltic Sea using high-resolution satellite-based techniques. The results show the local variability in the wave fields connected to atmospheric features. The observed local wave height can increase by 1-2m in kilometre-size cells that are accompanied by wind gusts. The developed algorithms are installed in the German Aerospace Center's (DLR) ground station Neustrelitz and can also be used in near-real-time.

T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the role of music in the context of A.F. Losev's philosophical prose of the 1930's and 1940's. Describing the key ideas of Losev's philosophy of music, the essay presents Losev as both the writer and the philosopher and analyzes the relationship between these two facets of his work. It pays particular attention to the way philosophical ideas are conveyed in the novel The Woman-Thinker where the opposition of rational thought and antinomical knowledge emerges in the form of a binary of the "musical" and the "non-musical," as two modes of attitude to the being. In the novel, the specificity of the musical worldview is embodied in the tragic fate of the pianist Radina whose character reveals a deep reflection on the meaning of life and the spiritual state of contemporaneity.

AB  - The 2010 floods in the Indus River system in Pakistan has been one of the devastating river flood disasters that affected more than 14 million people in Pakistan. Sindh, one of its provinces and being lower riparian, faced the worst that Flood 2010 had to offer. Absence of flood inundation maps and flood forecasting techniques made this disaster into catastrophe, especially in Sindh. In this study, a 2D hydrodynamic model was developed for lower Indus River reach-Kotri-Barrage to Arabian Sea-to delineate the flood inundation maps and identify the locations that are vulnerable to future flooding. The study mainly utilized HEC-RAS 2D along with Arc-GIS and HEC-GeoRAS tools, for data preprocessing. Recent and freely available ALOS World 3D-30m (AW3D30) Digital Surface Model (DSM), land cover derived Manning's roughness coefficients, observed cross-sections interpolated bathymetry and upstream flow hydrograph were also parameterized in the model. The model was calibrated with 2010 flood and validated with 2015 discharges. The results identified six vulnerable locations that pose a serious threat in the study area in case of future floods. The results from this study can be used for flood risk assessment, flood management, and evacuation planning.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of burned areas by ecoregions in Mexico and Central America
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire activity in Mexico and Central America, and its associated emissions, has impacts across multiple scales. On the local-to-regional scale, fire activity impacts land use, productivity, and biodiversity. On the regional-to-global scale, fire activity impacts hydrological, biogeochemical, and atmospheric processes. A consistent, reliable, large-scale characterization of the spatial and temporal distribution of fire burned area is required to assess its environmental impacts and to support natural resources' management. The spatial and temporal distributions of fire burned areas in ecoregions of Mexico and Central America are evaluated in this study for the period 2001-2014, using the satellite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD45 Burned Area data set. The methodology combines the 500 m burned area product with a MODIS land cover product and a map of North American land cover to calculate the spatiotemporal variability of fire activity as a function of land-use type.The total burned area over Mexico and Central America over the period 2001-2014 was found to be 614,243.5 km(2), but with significant interannual variability over the 14years included in the study. Indeed, the minimum burned area over the period was 9892.25 km(2) in 2014 and the maximum was 37,669.50 km(2) in 2011, a fourfold increase. Burned areas were found to be concentrated in northern Mexico and on the Pacific coast, mainly from October to June. Agricultural burned areas accounted for 37% and 43% of total detected burns in Mexico and Central America, respectively. The largest extent of burned surface occurs in May for most land-cover types. The maximum density of burned areas occurred in the tropical dry forests ecoregion during the dry season. Both in Mexico and Central America, burned area anomalies have significant anti-correlation with precipitation anomalies.

CL  - Chania, GREECE
AB  - The global and regional quantification of methane fluxes and identification of its sources and sinks has been highlighted as one of the goals of the NASA 2017 Earth Science Decadal Survey. Detecting methane from space and airborne platforms with an active (laser) remote sensing instrument presents several unique technology and measurement challenges. The instrument must have a single frequency, narrow-linewidth light source, and photon-sensitive detector at the right spectral region to make continuous measurements from orbit, day and night, all seasons and at all latitudes. It must have a high signal to noise ratio and must be relatively immune to biases from aerosol/cloud scattering, spectroscopic and meteorological data uncertainties, and instrument systematic errors.At Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), in collaboration with industry, we have developed an airborne instrument to measure methane. Our instrument is a nadir-viewing lidar that uses Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA), to measure methane near 1.65 mu m. We sample the absorption line using multiple wavelengths from a narrow linewidth laser source and a sensitive photodetector. This measurement approach provides maximum information content about the CH4 column, and minimizes biases in the XCH4 retrieval.In this paper, we will review our progress to date and discuss the technology challenges, options and tradeoffs to measure methane from space and airborne platforms.

AB  - One of the required information for sustainable fisheries management is about the habitat characteristics of a fish species. This information can be used to map the distribution of fish and map the potential fishing ground. This study aimed to analyze the habitat characteristics of small pelagic fishes (anchovy, squid, sardine and scads) which were mainly caught by lift net in Kepulauan Seribu waters. Research on habitat characteristics had been widely done, but the use of total suspended solid (TSS) parameters in this analysis is still lacking. TSS parameter which was extracted from Landsat 8 along with five other oceanographic parameters, CPUE data and location of fishing ground data from lift net fisheries in Kepulauan Seribu were included in this analysis. This analysis used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to evaluate the relationship between CPUE and oceanographic parameters. The results of the analysis showed that each fish species had different habitat characteristics. TSS and sea surface height had a great influence on the value of CPUE from each species. All the oceanographic parameters affected the CPUE of each species. This study demonstrated the effective use of GAMs to identify the essential habitat of a fish species.

AB  - Maninjau Lake is a tecto-volcanic lake that benefit its surrounding in various aspect, so it is necessary to preserve the quality of this lake. The objectives of this study were 1) Mapping out the concentration of chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and transparency of Maninjau Lake through analysis of Landsat-8 OLI image and field survey, 2) Identifiying trophic status of Maninjau Lake using Carlson method through Landsat-8 OLI and surveys; and 3) Mapping the trophic status of Maninjau Lake using Landsat-8 OLI image analysis. Identification of trophic status are conducted using the TSI Carlson. The parameters used to determine the Carlson TSI are chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, and Secchi Disk Transparency (SDT). The Carlson TSI parameter are modeled from Landsat 8 OLI image using stepwise regression. The variables that fulfill the prerequisite of stepwise regression is band 4 that strongly correlated with SDT data (R-2 = 0.82). Band 5 and 6 ratios are also strongly correlated with a- chlorophyll data (R-2 = 0.64). Band ratios of 3,4 and 5 are strongly correlated with total phosphorus data (R-2 = 0.46). The TSI Carlson mapping results show that Maninjau Lake is in a light eutrophic to hypereutrophic position with the largest distribution being heavy eutrophic. The estimated error standard (SE) SDT was 0.2 m with 74,06% maximum accuracy,SE total phosphorus maintained 0.14 mg/l with 76,69% maximum accuracy, and SE chlorophyll-a 0.02 mg/l with 42% maximum accuracy. Landsat-8 OLI is capable to estimate the conditions of trophic status parameter.

AB  - The problem of superposing the map of the terrain with the image of the terrain is considered. The image of the terrain may be represented in different frequency bands. Further analysis of the results of collation the digital map with the image of the appropriate terrain is described. Also the approach to detection of differences between information represented on the digital map and information of the image of the appropriate area is offered. The algorithm for calculating the values of brightness of the converted image area on the original picture is offered. The calculation is based on using information about the navigation parameters and information according to arranged bench marks. For solving the posed problem the experiments were performed. The results of the experiments are shown in this paper. The presented algorithms are applicable to the ground complex of remote sensing data to assess differences between resulting images and accurate geopositional data. They are also suitable for detecting new objects in the image, based on the analysis of the matching the digital map and the image of corresponding locality.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study proposes a new method for oil palm age estimation and counting from Worldview-3 satellite image and light detection and range (LiDAR) airborne imagery. A support vector machine algorithm (SVM) of object-based image analysis (OBIA) was implemented for oil palm counting. The sensitivity analysis was conducted on four SVM kernel types with associated segmentation parameters to obtain the optimal crown coverage delineation. Extracting tree's crown was integrated with height model and multiregression methods to accurately estimate the age of trees. The multiregression model with multikernel sizes was examined to achieve the most optimized model for age estimation. Applied models were trained and examined over five different oil palm plantations. The results of oil palm counting had an overall accuracy of 98.80%, while the overall accuracy of age estimation showed 84.91%, over all blocks. The relationship between tree's height and age was significant which supports the polynomial regression function (PRF) model with a 3 x 3 kernel size for under 10-12-year-old oil palm trees, while exponential regression function (ERF) is more fitted for older trees (i.e., 22 years old). Overall, recent remote sensing dataset and machine learning techniques are useful in monitoring and detecting oil palm plantation to maximize productivity.

AB  - There is an urgent need to increase the capacity of developing countries to take part in the study and monitoring of their environments through remote sensing and space based Earth observation technologies. The Open Data Cube (ODC) provides a mechanism for efficient storage and a powerful framework for processing and analyzing satellite data. While this is ideal for scientific research, the expansive feature space can also be daunting for end-users and decision-makers who simply require a solution which provides easy exploration, analysis, and visualization of Analysis Ready Data (ARD). Utilizing innovative web design and a modular architecture, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has created a web-based user interface (UI) which harnesses the power of the ODC yet provides a simple and familiar user experience: the CEOS Data Cube (CDC). This paper presents an overview of the CDC architecture and the salient features of the UI. In order to provide adaptability, flexibility, scalability, and robustness, we leverage widely-adopted and well-supported technologies such as the Django web framework and the AWS Cloud platform. The fully-customizable source code of the UI is available at our public repository. Interested parties can download the source and build their own UIs. The UI empowers users by providing features that assist with streamlining data preparation, data processing, data visualization, and sub-setting ARD products in order to achieve a wide variety of Earth imaging objectives through an easy to use web interface.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel approach to monitor the evolution of deforested areas in the Amazon rainforest, by combining Sentinel-1 and TanDEM-X SAR data. The idea is firstly to exploit the large coverage and short revisit time provided by the constellation of Sentinel-1 satellites in order to cover the entire arch of deforestation about ones per month. The goal is here to discriminate forest/non-forest by exploiting C-band backscatter signatures in dual polarization together with the behavior of the interferometric coherence in time, in order to identify the so-called deforestation hot-spots: local areas characterized by a significant amount of on-going deforestation activities. Secondly, high-resolution time series of bistatic TanDEM-X data can be acquired over these hot spots with a repeat-cycle of 11 days, and used to track fast changes at small scales, aiming at identifying specific on-going deforestation activities. In the final paper, we intent to present more consolidated results, supported by a large scale acquisition scenario.

TI  - Comparison of ATCOR Atmospheric and ELM Linear Empirical Correction Models Applied to WorldView-2 Images
T2  - TECCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing images for the characterization of the coastal marine ecosystems requires the prior removal of the atmospheric effects, which can be done in a semi-automated manner, by the use of algorithms based on alternative assumptions contained in the processing tools for different software packages. The main objective of this study was to statistically compare the spectral behavior of the coverages contained in a high-resolution WorldView-2 image atmospherically corrected according to the ATCOR and empirical linear models (ELM), using field spectroradiometry conducted in the insular areas of the archipelago of San Andres and Providence. The ATCOR correction model was applied through the PCI 2015 Geomatics software; regarding the ELM model, the ENVI 5.2 software was used. For the spectral comparison four (4) types of coverage were selected (vegetation, reef formations, beach sand and submerged sandbank), with twenty (20) replicas each, for a total of eighty (80) sampling points distributed in a stratified way in the image. The statistical results showed a linear correlation greater than 0.9 between the reflectance values for each of the bands (Blue, Green, Red and NIR-1) and indicate that both models of the atmospheric correction have a high capacity to eliminate the atmospheric effects present in this type of images. However, there are minor significant differences between the middle quadratic errors in the reflectance values for each band of the corrected images.

TI  - Conceptual Blending, the Second Naivete, and the Emergence of New Meanings
T2  - OPEN THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The field of cognitive linguistics has generated a powerful set of theoretical tools for analyzing the ways in which we understand, communicate, and create concepts. In the conceptual integration theory of Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner, the cognitive process known as double-scope blending provides a high-definition model for the phenomenological hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur. In particular, Ricoeur's notion of developing a second naivete through the blending of ancient and contemporary worlds of meanings can be viewed as the double-scope integration of concepts across disparate conceptual frames. This re-modeling of Ricoeur's hermeneutics gives it a new level of clarity and precision in cognitive scientific terms, which in turn may be utilized in service of theological and other forms of discourse. Conceptual integration theory also sheds light on other Ricoeur-inspired hermeneutical models and makes a case for the revelatory character of scripture through the meaning-making process of interpretation. The interpretation of the image of God concept in an evolutionary worldview serves as a heuristic example of second naivete as double-scope blending.

AB  - Utilizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors for crop inventory and condition monitoring offers many advantages, particularly the ability to collect data under cloudy conditions. The JECAM SAR Inter-Comparison Experiment is a multi-year, multi-partner project that aims to compare global methods for SAR crop monitoring and inventory, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass retrieval. Data sets of SAR imagery including RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 are being prepared for this experiment and it is important to develop best practices to ensure consistency across the data sets. This paper outlines the speckle filter testing results based upon changing filter types and window sizes in comparison with changing field size. In general, it was found that the adaptive Touzi filter resulted in the highest overall classification accuracies for all field sizes. It was also found that there may be importance to speckle filter window size in relation to agriculture field size for other filter types.

TI  - Interferon lambda (IFN-λ) efficiently blocks norovirus transmission in a mouse model
T2  - ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Human noroviruses are highly efficient in person to person transmission thus associated with explosive outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Outbreak control is limited to disinfection and isolation measures. Strategies to control the spread of noroviruses should be developed and models to study norovirus transmission will greatly facilitate this. Here, a mouse-to-mouse transmission model, in which mice develop acute murine norovirus (MNV)-induced diarrhea, was used to explore the role of interferon lambda (IFN-lambda) in the control of a norovirus infection.Sentinel AG129 mice [deficient in IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma receptors] that were co-housed with MNV-infected mice shedding high amounts of virus in their stool, developed a MNV-infection with associated diarrhea. Inoculation of such sentinel mice with an IFN-lambda expression plasmid resulted in the production of circulating IFN-lambda and upregulation of the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) of the gut. Injection of the IFN-lambda-expressing plasmid to sentinels prevents MNV-induced disease upon exposure to MNV-infected mice, as well as MNV replication in the small intestine, the associated signs of inflammation and the mounting of a specific IgG-based immune response. This demonstrates that IFN-lambda can alone mediate protection against transmission of norovirus. The development of a simple delivery method for IFN-lambda could be explored as a strategy to control norovirus outbreaks and protect vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised.

TI  - Pathetic wrestlers: perspectivism in "Fenix" by J. R. Ribeyro and "Jacob and the other" by J. C. Onetti
T2  - AMERICA SIN NOMBRE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers a comparative analysis of "Fenix" by Julio Ramon Ribeyro and "Jacob y el otro" by Juan Carlos Onetti. Both authors have literary projects that merge in terms of worldview, profiles of their characters, and certain narrative devices. The protagonists of these two short stories are pathetic fighters, in the sense that they both failed in their athletic careers, nobody keeps the faith on them, and their victory won't be praised. The analysis focuses on narrative perspectivism (the variety of narrative voices) and its function in each short story. Finally, I pay attention to the presence of skepticism in the ending of the both narratives. While in "Fenix" fight seems unproductive but provides human dignity, in "Jacob y el otro", fight, although everybody always fails, represents the liveliest emotion for human beings.

AB  - Grapevine water status is critical as it affects fruit quality and yield. We assessed the potential of field hyperspectral data in estimating leaf water content (C-w) (expressed as equivalent water thickness) in four commercial vineyards of Vitis vinifera L. reflecting four grape varieties (Mencia, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo). Two regression models were evaluated and compared: ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) and functional linear regression (FLR). OLSR was used to fit C-w and vegetation indices, whereas FLR considered reflectance in four spectral ranges centred at the 960, 1190, 1465 and 2035 nm wavelengths. The best parameters for the FLR model were determined using cross-validation. Both models were compared using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and percentage root mean squared error (%RMSE). FLR using continuous stretches of the spectrum as input produced more suitable C-w models than the vegetation indices, considering both the fit and degree of adjustment and the interpretation of the model. The best model was obtained using FLR in the range centred at 1465 nm (R-2 = 0.70 and % RMSE = 8.485). The results depended on grape variety but also suggested that leaf C-w, can be predicted on the basis of spectral signature. (C) 2017 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper outlines how an Aboriginal researcher approached international indigenous research based on indigenous research practices and principles, indigenous worldview and Country-based ontologies.(1) In particular, this paper discusses how relatedness functions as a methodology in collaborative indigenous work and how photostory, a modified version of the method termed 'photo yarn', was developed specifically for Kanaka Maoli young people attending boarding school with noho. To 'noho' means to 'commit to the establishment of the relationship and to maintain it with humility and respect' (Lopes 2016:32). Opening with the connections that bind Aboriginal, Maori, Kanaka Maoli and Native peoples of North America, this paper presents photostory as a method and outlines how cross-cultural research can function from an Aboriginal perspective.

TI  - Early Cervical Cancer: Predictive Relevance of Preoperative 3-Tesla Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. We assess the predictive significance of preoperative 3-Tesla multiparametric MRI findings. Methods. A total of 260 patients with FIGO IA2-IIA cervical cancer underwent primary surgical treatment between 2007 and 2016. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the incremental prognostic significance. Results. The clinical predictive factors associated with pT2b disease were MRI parametrial invasion (PMI) (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.77, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1.62-8.79; P=0.02) and MRI uterine corpus invasion (UCI) (AOR 9.99, 95% CI 4.11-24.32; P<0.0001). In multivariable analysis, for underdiagnoses, histologically squamous carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma (AOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.06-4.07; P=0.034) and MRI tumor size (AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92; P=0.005) were significant predictors; for overdiagnoses, these results were MRI tumor size (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.06-2.16; P=0.023), MRI PMI (AOR 71.73, 95% CI 8.89-611.38; P<0.0001) and MRI UCI (AOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01-1.01; P=0.051). Conclusion. PMI and UCI on T2-weighted images through preoperative 3T MRI are useful coefficients for accurate prediction of the pT2b stage; however, careful surveillance is required. Therefore, preoperative decision-making for early cervical cancer patients based on MRI diagnosis should be considered carefully, particularly in the presence of factors that are known to increase the likelihood of misdiagnosis.

AB  - On-Orbit Servicing capabilities are critical to our national interest. Such capabilities are: (a) necessary for maintaining world leadership in space for scientific, commercial, and strategic reasons, (b) required to manage, upgrade, service, inspect, and prolong the lifespans of costly, national orbiting assets, and (c) will enable the United States to expand the options for more resilient, efficient, and cost-effective operations in space. To address these issues, NASA is leading an ambitious, technology-rich Restore-L mission, an endeavor to launch a robotic spacecraft in 2020 to refuel a live satellite. The mission, the first of its kind in low-Earth orbit, will demonstrate that a suite of satellite-servicing technologies can perform in-space servicing of the client Landsat 7 satellite. To accomplish such an ambitious mission, an innovative autonomous relative navigation system is a key enabling technology. At Ball Aerospace, we have developed a cutting edge 3D Lidar, named the Vision Navigation Sensor (VNS) and algorithms that enable high precision point cloud output for the Restore-L mission. In this paper, we present an overview of the Restore-L servicing mission with an emphasis on Ball Aerospace's 3D Lidar Vision Navigation Sensor VNS design, predicted performance, and test results which are vital for precision autonomous relative navigation.

AB  - The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of a change detection algorithm for deforestation monitoring based on MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets. The algorithm is based on the statistical characterisation of the EVI and LST historical values for each pixel. The goal is to monitor abrupt decreases in those variables dynamics, which could be associated with deforestation events. This model was tested on real satellite time series available over a pilot area in Dry Chaco Forest, Argentina, where deforestation was common in the 2004-2016 period. As validation, a comparison with a benchmark product based on Landsat images is also presented, showing a 51.6% precision, 74.4% recall and an F-score of 0.60 for deforestation in 2013. These results show the advantages of using an automatic algorithm to monitor break points in the time series and the potential of combining LST and EVI to identify deforestation events.

TI  - Detecting geothermal anomalies and evaluating LST geothermal component by combining thermal remote sensing time series and land surface model data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores for the first time the possibilities to use two land surface temperature (LST) time series of different origins (geostationary Meteosat Second Generation satellite data and Noah land surface modelling, LSM), to detect geothermal anomalies and extract the geothermal component of LST, the LSTgt. We hypothesize that in geothermal areas the LSM time series will underestimate the LST as compared to the remote sensing data, since the former does not account for the geothermal component in its model.In order to extract LSTgt, two approaches of different nature (physical based and data mining) were developed and tested in an area of about 560 x 560 km(2) centered at the Kenyan Rift. Pre-dawn data in the study area during the first 45 days of 2012 were analyzed.The results show consistent spatial and temporal LSTgt patterns between the two approaches, and systematic differences of about 2 K. A geothermal area map from surface studies was used to assess LSTgt inside and outside the geothermal boundaries. Spatial means were found to be higher inside the geothermal limits, as well as the relative frequency of occurrence of high LSTgt. Results further show that areas with strong topography can result in anomalously high LSTgt values (false positives), which suggests the need for a slope and aspect correction in the inputs to achieve realistic results in those areas. The uncertainty analysis indicates that large uncertainties of the input parameters may limit detection of LSTgt anomalies. To validate the approaches, higher spatial resolution images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data over the Olkaria geothermal field were used. An established method to estimate radiant geothermal flux was applied providing values between 9 and 24 W/m(2) in the geothermal area, which coincides with the LSTgt flux rates obtained with the proposed approaches.The proposed approaches are a first step in estimating LSTgt at large spatial coverage from remote sensing and LSM data series, and provide an innovative framework for future improvements.

T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the article: the systematization of existing works, the comprehension of the cultural and historical dynamics of the phenomenon of mass holidays in the context of the issue of the integrity of the holiday as a cultural phenomenon, consideration of the essential content, structure and functional components of the holiday as a mass action. Methodology: general scientific principles of systematization and generalization of the problem under study. The work uses the works of foreign and Ukrainian researchers, which analyze the general theoretical and methodological issues of the essence of the mass holiday. An interdisciplinary approach, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the stated problem with the broad involvement of scientific works on cultural studies, history of culture, aesthetics, as well as the sociology of culture, plays a significant role in understanding the phenomenon of "holiday." The historical-cultural method made it possible to follow the tendencies of the development of the holiday as a mass action. The structural functional method is used to clarify the role and functions of the holiday in different historical epochs, including in modern culture. The sophisticated approach is determined by the research topic: of the need to systematize existing works on the phenomenon of the holiday. Scientific novelty of research is to understand the phenomenon of mass holidays from the modern theoretical positions. Conclusions. The holidays retain their heuristic influence in modern studies, especially as regards the understanding of the cultural, anthropological and social foundations of the holiday and its functional range as a phenomenon of cultural existence of man. The holiday is an ideal world, a model of outlook and worldview of both a particular individual and society in general, because the potential of the holiday in the cultural life of man is multidimensional: it is a source of renewal of physical forces, that is, it has a recreational function, helps to understand the essence of being and time, harmonize life, contributes to creating an atmosphere of friendly communication.

TI  - WORLDVIEW EDUCATION OF FUTURE FOREIGN LITERATURE TEACHERS: PROFESSIONAL OUTLOOK CHARACTERISTICS AND MATURITY
T2  - SCIENCE AND EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of theoretical-experimental research of the problem of worldview education of the graduates of philological specialties with the right to teach foreign literature. 978 Master-degree students majoring in Philology took part in the study aimed at examining their professional outlook level. The following criteria and indicators of professional outlook of a foreign literature teacher (in accordance with which the level of their manifestation can be estimated as follows: 1) optimal; 2) proper; 3) primary) have been distinguished: criteria: cognitive and methodological, evaluative, reflexive and critical, orientation and prognostic, integration and activity; indicators: scientific style of thinking, social maturity, pedagogical orientation, humanistic position, creativity. The research outcomes have shown that future foreign literature teachers' professional outlook formation at the stage of training at higher educational establishments of different types is usually carried out spontaneously and cannot be characterized as a purposeful, specially organized and systematically controlled pedagogical process. The analysis of the contemporary state of future foreign literature teachers training shows that subject competences and value orientations acquired by them in the course of university education do not meet the requirements of time, which is explained by the lack of proper theoretical-conceptual, didactic-methodical and diagnostic support of the process of their professional outlook formation. Further research work is planned to cover the development of a conceptual model of future foreign literature teachers' professional outlook formation.

AB  - This study focuses on testing the SAR coherence changes from Sentinel-1 data to detect burned areas and to compare the results with optical Sentinel-2 derived burned area product to be used as validation. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at 350 m resolution was used to identify active fires locations.We focussed on a sequence of wildfires that affected the Sila mountain area during the summer of the 2017. This area of the Calabria region (southern Italy) was interested by a range of fires for the second half of July and the whole month of August ([1], [2]) due also to an extremely dry and hot summer We used a pair of optical images acquired from Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 July 2017 (pre-events) and 23 August 2017 (post-events).Firstly, we computed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for both images and calculated the difference between these two (dNDVI) at 10m resolution; the results put in evidence several areas characterized by vegetation reduction, with dNDVI values up to 0.3-0.4. Concerning the SAR data, we evaluated the coherence changes by exploiting two pairs of Sentinel-1 SAR data over the same area. Both pairs were acquired along descending orbit, respectively before (on July, 19th and 31st ) and after (on September, 5th and 17th ) the fires occurred in the Sila mountain area. The coherence was computed separately for the first (gamma(pre)) and the second pair (gamma(post)) and the difference gamma(post )- gamma(pre) was calculated. In this way, we evaluated the difference in coherence between September, i.e. post-fires, and July, i.e. prefires expecting a higher coherence after burning, due to the vegetation reduction. In several areas, the coherence seems to be consistent with the fire events showing increments up to 0.20-0.25. However, the increasing of coherence difference could also be due to other reasons such as the soil moisture variations in the proximity of lakes/rivers or the seasonal cultivation changes.Further analysis integrating more information such as the SAR amplitude signal and the cross-polarized backscattering coefficient will be conducted in order to better evaluate and discriminate any contributions.

TI  - Emissivity peculiarities of the inland salt marshes in the south of Western Siberia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of water-dissoluble salts in soils leads to a wide variation in soil microwave radiation that makes precise determination of water-physical characteristics of soil using satellite data hardly possible. To assess the effect of soil salinization, the emissivity of salt-affected soils in the Kulunda plain located in the south of Western Siberia was studied. Steppe site and an inland salt marsh (ISM) formed at the bottom of depressions of dried-up salt lakes were the main objects of the research. Both sites are situated in the same natural-climatic conditions and have similar relief. The spatial distribution of the underlying surface brightness temperature was obtained from L1C product of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. The diurnal temperature variations of ISM were measured in the course of a daily ground-based experiment to determine the temperature gradients. During the laboratory experiment, we defined the dielectric properties of soil and calculated its emissivity. The comprehensive studies are evidence of great diurnal variation in ISM microwave radiation. The joint use of satellite and laboratory data allows us to specify the contribution of salt-affected soils into total microwave radiation of the underlying surface. The brightness temperature obtained from SMOS and the one calculated from the laboratory dependencies of ISM emissivity on temperature and moisture are in fairly well correlation.

AB  - This article explores the possibility of establishing cultural dialogue through the axiological codes of musical genres. Genre here is defined as a worldview and as a component of the world-picture that carries axiological codes. The methodology used here combines culturological, axiological, world-image, and comparative approaches. As a result, we have developed the samples of the typological and national models of the value world-picture based on genre axiological codes. The key conclusions are: it is possible to construct a musical genre world-picture, which reflects the hierarchy of values in the world pictures of different types, and to promote the genre-value world-picture facilitating cultural dialogue.

TI  - FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN THE REGIONAL MEDIA ROUTINE
T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - We can say that representatives of the media not only generate new ideas, but even construct a new worldview. They choose the direction for the general discussion, give certain meaning to events, set criteria for assessing them and conduct cultural wars. The importance of modern media cannot be overemphasized as the mass media can help to prevent not only a cultural war, but a real one as well. To investigate the situation with freedom of speech in Voronezh region from local media workers' point of view, the Institute of Public Opinion Qualitas repeated research in 2015 that was previously conducted in 2004 and 1994 and interviewed Voronezh representatives of various media in different positions from chief editors to rank and file journalists. The results of the research showed that there is no unambiguous assessment of the free speech what is enough for one can be insufficient for another. Moreover, there is a request among the population for restriction of freedom of speech as it sometimes borders on permissiveness. Although the local government according to journalists remains a dominant source of freedom of speech infringement cases, a set of motives of different kinds finally form the agenda. Some journalists have never faced the situation when their material for some reason was refused to be published. Self-censorship is also very important during the process of preparing the material for the publication. The decision to publish material takes into account aggregate of various interests, where commercial interests and human weaknesses often play the main role.

AB  - The retrieval of quantitative information on ocean waves from SAR images is a challenging problem because of the nonlinearities of the imaging mechanism, the presence of speckle noise, and the directional ambiguities associated with the interpretation of a SAR image as a single snapshot in time. We present a new methodology that overcomes some of these problems by utilizing spotlight-mode data from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed in combination with advanced subaperture processing. We are able to derive short time series of subaperture images, which show propagation directions and speeds of moving patterns. Then we can use Fourier analysis and a dispersion relation filter to separate actual ocean wave signatures from other contributions. This process is phase-preserving and lets us reconstruct short "videos" of the spatio-temporal evolution of the extracted wave signatures, which are easier to invert into surface slope and elevation fields than conventional SAR images.

TI  - RNA Interference Mechanisms and Applications in Plant Pathology
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY, VOL 56
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The origin of RNA interference (RNAi), the cell sentinel system widely shared among eukaryotes that recognizes RNAs and specifically degrades or prevents their translation in cells, is suggested to predate the last eukaryote common ancestor (138). Of particular relevance to plant pathology is that in plants, but also in some fungi, insects, and lower eukaryotes, RNAi is a primary and effective antiviral defense, and recent studies have revealed that small RNAs (sRNAs) involved in RNAi play important roles in other plant diseases, including those caused by cellular plant pathogens. Because of this, and because RNAi can be manipulated to interfere with the expression of endogenous genes in an intra-or interspecific manner, RNAi has been used as a tool in studies of gene function but also for plant protection. Here, we review the discovery of RNAi, canonical mechanisms, experimental and translational applications, and new RNA-based technologies of importance to plant pathology.

AB  - This paper aims to study how the horizons of time were envisioned by the Mariotes. To achieve this goal, we must ask if the concepts of beginning and end were somehow present in their worldview. We must also analyze the general idea of an eternity as expressed in the documentation from the Syro-Mesopotamian kingdom of Mari. Thus, we propose to focus on the analysis of some key expressions, such as daris, Fun siatim, or urram seram and the contexts in which they were used. We will then try to ascertain how the Mariotes thought of time in general and how they related it to their presence in the universe.

TI  - Findings from a Preliminary Investigation of the Effects of Aquatic Habitat (Water) Availability on Giant Gartersnake (Thamnophis gigas) Demography and Reproduction in the Sacramento Valley, California, 2014-17.
T2  - U S Geological Survey Open-File Report
M3  - Article
AB  - The giant gartersnake (Thamnophis gigas) is a semi-aquatic species of snake precinctive to the Central Valley of California. Because the Central Valley has experienced a substantial loss of wetland habitat, giant gartersnake populations are largely found in aquatic habitats associated with rice agriculture. In dry years, less water may be available for rice agriculture, resulting in less aquatic habitat, which could have cascading effects on giant gartersnake populations. We present 2 years of data intended to examine how the demography of giant gartersnakes is affected by the availability of aquatic habitat on the landscape (2016-17), along with 2 years of (sparse) preliminary data (2014-15) collected as part of an earlier radio-telemetry study on giant gartersnake movement behavior. We sampled agricultural canals near rice fields for giant gartersnakes at 8 sites distributed throughout the Sacramento Valley. Five sites were sampled from 2014-17, and 3 sites were sampled from 2015-17. In total, we made 2,995 captures of 1,011 snakes from 2014-17. We used these capture data to fit a multi-site Jolly-Seber model to estimate the abundance of giant gartersnakes as well as the daily and annual probability of capture at each site. We used remotely sensed Landsat data to characterize the extent of flooded rice fields surrounding each site in each year. In addition, we collected 175 females from 2014-17 and delivered them to the Sacramento Zoo for health assessments and reproductive exams. The abundance of giant gartersnakes varied among sites, and abundance estimates were more precise in 2016 and 2017 when sampling effort was greatest. The probability of a giant gartersnake being captured at least once in a year was higher in 2016 and 2017 than 2014 and 2015, and recaptures of snakes marked the previous year were highest in 2016 and 2017 as well. Mean annual apparent survival was estimated to be 0.40 but varied among sites from a low of 0.14 to a high of 0.63. Five sites had diverse size distributions that included abundant sub-adult and large adult female snakes. One site had a truncated size distribution with few large adult female snakes, and 2 sites had mostly large adult-sized snakes and few small individuals. Both the probability a female was gravid and a female's litter size were positively related to the female's snout-vent length. Somatic growth rates varied more among years than among sites, and females grew faster (in millimeters per day) than male snakes. The proportion of the landscape around each site under active rice cultivation fluctuated over time (generally between 60-90 percent of the landscape was active rice growing, although this proportion was lower for some sites in some years), and variation in rice growing was asynchronous among sites. This study demonstrates that intensive demographic sampling enables estimation of several key demographic variables at each study site. Continued sampling would allow for investigating potential relationships between the amount of rice growing at a site and demographic parameters such as growth, survival, and reproduction.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The author presents the idea of a "logical worldview"-an approach to understanding logic by examining philosophical positions in metaphysics, epistemology, and theories of cognition and perception, and exploring how philosophical and logical positions combine to form a complete logical system. Aristotle's logical worldview is examined in some detail, and the logical systems of Francis Bacon and George Boole are examined by exploring how a new logic results when certain Aristotelian philosophical positions are abandoned. The logical worldview approach is also shown to help explain certain puzzles with Aristotle's logic, such as existential import, the form of the syllogism, and Aristotle's "missing" moods and figures from the list of valid moods.

AB  - Introduction: Support for physical activity (PA) is central in diabetes care. The Sophia Step Study is a three-armed randomised controlled trial aiming to evaluate different levels of support for increased PA in prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. With the purpose to reveal the programme components and the mediating factors from the participants perspective this paper aims to report a qualitative exploration of adhering participants experiences after two years study participation. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 participants (men, n=11, women, n=7, prediabetes, n=5, Type 2 diabetes, n=13, median age 68.5 years) who completed a two-year multi-component (n=7), single-component (n=6) intervention or served as controls (n=5) at a primary care center in Stockholm, Sweden. The interviews were analysed using content analysis with an inductive approach. Sophia Step Study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier: NCT02374788. Results: The participants recalled the frequent study assessments as providing feedback of health outcomes; positive reinforcement; a sense of sentinel and a personalised approach. Group meetings, pedometers and health check-ups were valued as resources for increased awareness and motivation of PA; establishment of new routines and control over the own health. The long program duration allowed for maintenance of awareness and routines for PA Conclusion: Adhering participants in theory-based interventions, but also in the control group, identified key mediators to support for PA. Feedback of results, personalised encouragement, emotional support and self-monitoring should be regarded in self-management of PA to optimise patient motivation and outcomes. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Approximately 20% of melanoma patients harbor metastases in non-sentinel nodes (NSNs) after a positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB), and recent evidence questions the therapeutic benefit of completion lymph node dissection (CLND). We built a nomogram for prediction of NSN status in melanoma patients with positive SNB.Data on anthropometric and clinicopathological features of patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent CLND after a positive SNB were collected from nine Italian centers. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to identify predictors of NSN status in a training set, while model efficiency was validated in a validation set.Data were available for 1220 patients treated from 2000 through 2016. In the training set (n = 810), the risk of NSN involvement was higher when (1) the primary melanoma is thicker or (2) sited in the trunk/head and neck; (3) fewer nodes are excised and (4) more nodes are involved; and (5) the lymph node metastasis is larger or (6) is deeply located. The model showed high discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.79) and calibration (Brier score 0.16, 95% CI 0.15-0.17) performance in the validation set (n = 410). The nomogram including these six clinicopathological variables performed significantly better than five other previously published models in terms of both discrimination and calibration.Our nomogram could be useful for follow-up personalization in clinical practice, and for patient risk stratification while conducting clinical trials or analyzing their results.

AB  - Vegetation growth is highly dynamic over space and time. Especially mountainous vegetation is regionally affected by climatic variability and human impacts. Tracking optical reflectance provides a unique possibility to analyze vegetation across scales from a small plot up to an extensive area. This study compares the NDVI index of grasslands across four different spatial scales during the growing period in 2017. These scales are covered by measurements from (i) ground spectrometer; (ii) station-based reflectance sensors; (iii) fixed installed Phenocam and (iv) Remote Sensing Sentinel-2 MSI images. We compared the reflectance on single points within a grassland and among different grassland sites in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each sensor. Secondly, we analyzed the detectability of anthropogenic management activities using the NDVI index. First results show clear differences in the optical response among scales and in the detectability of management (e.g. fertilization, harvesting) activities.

AB  - With a coastline length of 114 km, the utilization of the coastline areas is potential for especially shrimp and milkfish cultivations, which have a higher economic value. However, appropriate development strategies are highly required. The purpose of this research is to examine the existing conditions and organize integrated information for fishery household as well as the areas utilized for shrimp and milkfish cultivations, especially in coastal areas. The methods used include an analysis from Landsat 8 imaginary, field survey, and interviews with various sources. This research conducted in June-November 2015. Data from remote sensing were digitized and utilized as mark point to survey area of cultivation. The results show that the distributions of RTP data cover Windu and Vaname shrimp polycultures by 1,727 RTP, milkfish by 1,551 RTP, Vaname shrimp by 2,953 RTP, and Windu Shrimp by 88 RTP. The area, which may be utilized as ponds, is 9,854.1 ha. The area for milkfish ponds is 12,065.08 ha, while the digitation result is 10,801.92 ha. It shows that Indramayu coastal areas still have numerous and various potentials, which may be utilized for shrimp and milkfish cultivations.

AB  - Satellite Sentinel-2 offers a global coverage of the Earth at the frequency of a few days with pixel size ranging from 10 to 20 meters. Such spatio-temporal resolution fosters an advanced research in agriculture. Accounting for BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) information is required both for target monitoring and surface albedo estimate. BRDF sampling being limited from HR (High Resolution) sensors, the added-value of the BRDF 300m from PROBA-V instrument is assessed. Results are shown for the seasonal cycles 2016 and 2017 using parameterized and detailed radiation transfer models. The validation is carried on for anchor ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) stations located on the French territory.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The founders of the general systems movement envisaged the development of a theory articulating and inter-relating the principles underlying the systemic behaviours of all kinds of concrete systems. We call this theory GST* ("g-s-t-star") to disambiguate it from other uses of the term "GST" prevalent in the literature. GST* is still radically underdeveloped, but its nature can be analysed. GST* is a formal theory, because the principles of GST* would apply across all kinds of systems, that is, GST* would predict behaviours and structures of systems qua systems, without regard for the kind of system under consideration, and hence it is neutral with respect to ontology.There is a long-standing controversy within the systems community about whether a GST* exists in principle, whether it would be of practical value if it did, and how its principles might be discovered. In this chapter we argue by analogy from the history of science that if a GST* could be developed it would be highly valuable, and show that its existence is predicated on the assumption of a philosophical framework called the General Systems Worldview (GSW). We present an argument that development of the General Systems Worldview can guide us to the discovery of general systems principles for a GST*, and that together GST* and the GSW can ground the development of a powerful General Systems Transdiscipline, now called " General Systemology".

TI  - Qualification of a new short-term cloud forecasting method for the optimization of Earth observation satellite programs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF CLOUDS AND THE ATMOSPHERE XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Cloud coverage is an important issue for Earth observation satellite programs as remote sensing images are useless if their cloud fraction is too high or if specific targets are not visible. These flawed acquisitions must be reintroduced in the waiting list, leading to significant delays. Agile satellites are able to choose between several targets according to various priority parameters, including cloud coverage forecasting. This paper assesses a short-term cloud forecasting method which uses time series acquired by a geosynchronous satellite and a cloud motion vector processing technique to predict the evolution of the cloud coverage up to six hours in the future. Using several SPOT/Pleiades acquisition dates from 2015 to 2017, and the corresponding Meteosat-8 datasets, cloud fraction forecasts have been produced for time horizons ranging from fifteen minutes to six hours, and compared to other forecast results obtained using two classical numerical weather prediction (NWP) models: GFS and ICON. Satellite based forecast showed several advantages compared to these methods. First, the algorithm is much faster - a few minutes, whereas NWP models need several hours to build a forecast - allowing to get a result quickly from fresh dataset. Moreover, forecasts obtained with satellite images have a better time resolution - 15 minutes instead of one hour - and outperform GFS and ICON results in terms of prediction accuracy for horizons less than 3.5 hours.

TI  - Death and end times: the effects of religious fundamentalism and mortality salience on apocalyptic beliefs
T2  - RELIGION BRAIN & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - According to terror management theory, the awareness of death motivates people to subscribe to cultural worldviews that offer some form of death transcendence. In support of this assertion, studies reveal that stimuli that heighten the awareness of death (mortality salience) increase investment in and defense of cultural worldviews (e.g., religion). Although past research has elucidated different forms of mortality salience-induced religious worldview defense, no study to date has considered how death-awareness contributes to apocalyptic beliefs derived from religious prophecy. The present research indicates that individual differences in religious fundamentalism interact with mortality salience to influence religious apocalyptic beliefs. For people higher in religious fundamentalism, mortality salience increased apocalyptic beliefs. For people lower in religious fundamentalism, mortality salience decreased apocalyptic beliefs.

AB  - Abstract Access to justice in the context of the advancement of e-process points directly to a fundamental and new principle, the so-called principle of connection, which will be the main object of this work. The worldview and methodology adopted is systemic, notably that elaborated by Maturana and Varela (1995). The approach will be deductive. The main objective of the work is to perform an analytical framework of the judicial process, interrelating the variables of the analog and digital processes and the systemic variables.

TI  - Preparing Future Career Ready Professionals: A Portfolio Process to Develop Critical Thinking Using Digital Learning and Teaching
T2  - TEACHING AND LEARNING IN A DIGITAL WORLD, VOL 1
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - It is uncommon to learn, work and grow up in a world without technology and so it is pertinent to explore exactly how digital learning assists in preparing our future workforce. Employers often note that new graduates (or the 'new' employees) lack critical thinking and problem solving skills and have poor communication, as their experience is often restricted to a worldview limited by a digital communication lens. This brief paper argues, therefore, that the need for developing critical thinking skills has never been more apparent as graduates/new workers transition to employment. The conference theme is Teaching and Learning in a Digital World and this paper investigates the what, how and why technology benefits learning. The Rowley and Munday (2014) Sense of Self model underpins the theoretical paradigm that encourages individuals to experience digital technologies to support critical thinking by exploring their own self-efficacy as a learner. Authentic learning is discussed via a simulated learner setting where individuals create evidence of their own professional or personal identity (or a hybrid of both) and discuss how utilising a reflexive process to create a portfolio (as both a learning and teaching tool) can support improvements in critical thinking. The paper concludes with strategies for exploring how we encourage students and/or new employees to reflect on the what, how, why and who of themselves through a critical thinking process associated with self-reflection and portfolio creation. Understanding the progressive ways portfolio process and products can be used to develop a professional identity through encouraging students to reflect and connect themselves to multi faceted professional identities benefits life long learning for future work readiness.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating roles of absenteeism and continuous assessments on the overall academic performance at undergraduate level using structural equation modelling (SEM).Design/methodology/approach - Pragmatic worldview with a mixed-method approach was used in this study. Data were collected using a variety of tools. Subsequent analyses used both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Interviews and documentary analyses were used to identify the dimensions of student disengagement while SEM was used to determine mediation among selected variables.Findings - The results of this study showed that absence rates mediated the relationship between performance on continuous assessments and grade point average (GPA). Absence rates also mediated the relationship between personal circumstances and GPA and finally, course selection impacted on GPA with performance on continuous assessments as the mediator. H3 were not supported and the implications are discussed.Research limitations/implications - The research was conducted in a single institution, was cross-sectional in nature and the variables used were contextualised. However, the tools used in this study can be adapted to identify the risk factors leading to poor student performance in other settings and to address them.Practical implications - The outcomes of the current study can be useful to policymakers and practitioners in in addressing student performance-related issues.Social implications - On a broader perspective, societal challenges associated with student dropouts resulting from poor academic performance can be minimised.Originality/value - This study shows academic performance in a different perspective where mediators reveal the complex nature of the determinants of academic performance.

AB  - Extreme precipitation events are responsible for major floods in any part of the world. In recent years, simulations and projection of weather conditions to future, with Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models like Weather Research and Forecast (WRF), has become an imperative component of research in the field of atmospheric science and hydrology. The validation of modelled forecast is thus have become matter of paramount importance in case of forecasting. This study delivers an all-inclusive assessment of 5 high spatial resolution gridded precipitation products including satellite data products and also climate reanalysis product as compared to WRF precipitation product. The study was performed in river basins of North Western Himalaya (NWH) in India. Performance of WRF model is evaluated by comparing with observational gridded (0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees) precipitation data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Other products include TRMM Multi Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42-v7 product (0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) product (0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees). Moreover, climate reanalysis rainfall product from ERA Interim is also used. Bias, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, False Alarm Ratio (FAR), Probability of False Detection (POFD), and Probability of Detection (POD) were calculated with particular rainfall thresholds. TRMM and GPM products were found to be sufficiently close to the observations. All products showed better performance in the low altitude areas i.e. in planes of Upper Ganga and Yamuna basin and Indus basin, and increase in error as topographical variation increases. This study can be used for identifying suitability of WRF forecast data and assessing performance of other rainfall datasets as well.

AB  - Google Earth Engine currently allows you to export images and assets as either GeoTiff files or TFrecords. The system splits the files if the estimated size is greater than 2GB which is the upper limit and needs the geometry to be parsed in the form of either a fusion table, a user drawn geometry or a table imported into the user's assets. While the javascript frontend is great owing to the queryable catalog whereby you can search and and export your personal and private assets, the limitation lies in batch exports. To resolve this the python API access allows you to call batch export functions but now it is limited to checking for itersects first and running without having a queryable catalog. With the same idea I created this tool which allows you to run a terminal environment where your personal and general catalog images are part of a autosuggest feature. This tool allows you to look for images based on names for example " you can search for Sentinel and it will show you full path of images which have the word sentinel in the title". It also creates a report for your image collections and images so apart from the public datasets this can also find your own datasets as well. You can then generate bandlist to make sure all bands you are exporting are of the same type and then export all images that intersect you aoi. The assumption here is Every image in the give image have the same band structure, choose the bandlist that you know to common to all images If the geomery is too complex use the operator feature to use a bounding box instead. For now all it filters is geometry and date, and it is does not filter based on metadata (however in the examples folder I have shown how to import and use additional filter before exporting an image collection) In the future I will try to integrate some other functionalities to this environment and you can indeed run the tool without the use of the autosuggest terminal as a simple CLI. Hence the terminal feature is optional.

AB  - This tool was built with a focus on the same issues and borrow parts from my other projects such as ppipe for handling Planet's datasets, gee2drive to handle download collections already available in Google Earth Engine (GEE), pygbdx which is a relatively new project to explore Digital Globe assets and I have now integrated tools to access and download Satellogic imagery. Core components from a lot of these tools have gone into building satadd based on the idea of adding satellite data as needed. These tools include authentications setups for every account, and access to datasets, metadata among other tools. This was not built however for heavy lifting though I have tested this on hundreds and thousands of assets delivery so it behaves robustly for now. The tool is built and rebuilt as companies change their authentication protocol and delivery mechanisms and allow for improving many aspects of data delivery and preprocessing in the next iterations.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF THE POPULATIONS STATUS AND HABITAT CONDITIONS OF ANSERIFORMES IN THE STATE NATURE RESERVE "GYDANSKY" (RUSSIA) USING ULTRALIGHT AVIATION
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gydan Peninsula is one of the least explored and inaccessible Arctic regions in both the Yamalo-Nenetsky Autonomous Okrug and Russia as a whole. In 2016-2017 we conducted a survey of the Gydansky State Nature Reserve and adjacent areas. counted and assessed the quality of habitats of Anseriformes and their threats. The results of the study and the data volume obtained have proved the effectiveness of using ultralight aviation to study a hard-to-reach and vast area. We elaborated the methodology of aerial surveys and counting, the technique of population abundance extrapolation based on modern statistical methods and the use of Landsat images. According to the data obtained, we created GIS databases on abundance, biotopic distribution, key conservation areas of Anseriformes and threats. On their basis, it will be possible to develop a scheme of long-term monitoring of Anseriformes, and specific recommendations on the protection regime. By preliminary assessing the habitat quality on the selected plots, we found that Anseriformes form main groupings on salt marshes, although their areas on the Gydansky Peninsula are not large. The preliminary study of the feeding spectrum of herbivory Anseriformes (Anser, Branta, Cygnus) showed that on three studied sites, a significant proportion of their diet is occupied by common plant species of salt marshes (Carex subspathacea + Puccinellia phtyganodes). Studies of the pastures quality on salt marshes on molting sites and on control sites demonstrated that Anser albifrons and Branta bernicla provoked a decrease in phytomass of dead grass by an average of 5.3 times. This increases the pasture quality and prevents witness. On the molting sites examined, the phytomass of the main feeding plants was on average 4.6 times less than on the control sites. However, we can not consider it as a negative influence, since the constant pasture grazing stimulates the vegetation growth Based on data obtained during the preliminary study, we established the impact of Anseriformes on invertebrates. We found that on control sites, the number of spider species was two times higher than on molting sites, and their number was four times higher than on molting sites. There were no significant differences in the Acarini number. The presence of mass concentrations of Aneriformes influences the structure of dominance in the microarthropod communities. We did not establish the influence of the Anserifonnes concentrations on the diversity and species composition of Coleoptera and Heteroptera. Although on sites of mass concentration of Anserifonnes, the number of Heteroptera predators greatly reduced (in 3-23 times). We showed that Ursus maritimus have became an important factor that influence the Anseriformes abundance, especially colonial species. We distinguished the nine sites which are the most important for Anderiformes.Within these areas, annual monitoring of Anseriformes using ultralight aviation is most relevant. On the distinguished key sites outside the Gydansky State Nature Reserve, it would be advisable to create regional-level complex sanctuaries with complete hunting ban. The presence of people and transport in protected areas will create an increase in the disturbance factor and poaching. It is necessary to strengthen the protection regime and conduct raids to combat poaching both in the Gydansky State Nature Reserve and on distinguished key sites. We propose the use of ultralight aviation as the most effective method for these targets. The results of obtained aerial surveys showed that the highest abundance of Polysticta stelleri, Somateria spectabilis and Clangula huemalis, the maximal concentrations of molting Cygnus bewickii,Anser albifrons, A. fabalis and Branta bernicla were recorded on Neupokoev Island and Vilkitsky Island. In this regard, we assert the necessity to revise the existing boundaries of the Gydansky State Nature Reserve by including into the Protected Area the following sites: Vilkitsky Island together with the Vostochnaya Spit and Shvede Bay. the Neupokoev Island together with the Neupokoeva Spit and water areas adjacent to these islands at a distance of 5 km from the coastline.

TI  - Seroprevalence of <i>Bartonella</i> spp., <i>Coxiella burnetii</i>, and <i>Hantavirus</i> among people who inject drugs in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: a retrospective assessment of a biobank
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing use of illicit drugs imposes a public health challenge worldwide. People who inject drugs (PWID) are more susceptible to health complications due to immunosuppression associated with drug use and non-hygienic self-administration of substances, contaminants, and liquids. PWID are subjected to increased risk of acquiring and transmitting different pathogens (frequently functioning as sentinel cases for (re) emerging pathogens), including those transmitted by arthropods and vertebrate reservoirs in unhealthy environments. A clear association between injection drug use and HIV, HBV, and HCV infections has been described; however, other infectious viral and bacterial agents have been seldomly assessed. In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence of Bartonella spp., Coxiella burnetii, and Hantavirus among 300 randomly selected PWIDs from Rio de Janeiro, as part of a multi-city cross-sectional study carried out in the 1990s. Point seroprevalences and respective 95% CIs are as follows: 9.3% for C. burnetii (95% CI: 6.0%-13.0%), 1.0% for Bartonella spp. (95% CI: 0.0%-3.0%), and 4.0% for Hantavirus (95% CI: 2.0%-7.0%). In addition to the blood-borne pathogens, the results of this study increase our knowledge on other transmissible infectious agents in PWID. The high seroprevalence of C. burnetii and Hantavirus found among PWID is intriguing and suggests the need to carry out prospective studies, including molecular analyses, to confirm these findings and allow a better understanding of the putative relevance of these zoonotic infectious agents among PWID.

TI  - Are We Really Going to Have an Eschatological Future?
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the interpretation of the future, in which the person either does not have a place or is expected by a sad fate. Other past religious interpretations of the future are also being considered. The problem arose only in the culture of the new time, when faith and reason were contrasted and understood as opposing realities, and the universe was interpreted in the spirit of natural sciences, that is, as a physical reality. There were various paradoxes. A vivid example of such paradoxes the author sees in the works of Vadim Kazyutinsky, who studied the concepts of the universe and galaxies. In particular, his research allows us to assert that cosmology by basic parameters should be attributed to a scientific discipline of the humanitarian type, which does not exclude the presence in it of various physical and other natural sciences disciplines. The position of the well-known Russian philosopher Alexey Losev, who points to the boundaries of explanation in the spirit of the natural sciences, is also analyzed. In the second half of the article, alternative scenarios (Vadim Kazyutinsky, Hannah Arendt and the author) are discussed to overcome the pessimistic understanding of the future. For the author it is humanitarian nature of philosophy. For Kazyutinsky, the worldview that the Stoics professed, as well as faith man and humanity. For Hannah Arendt - the clarification of the crisis of our thought and civilization. The conclusion is drawn that the considered vision of reality, characteristic of rationalism and natural sciences, is an alternative, and not one.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 27th International Conference on Nuclear Energy for New Europe (NENE)
CL  - Portoroz, SLOVENIA
AB  - During the normal operation of nuclear reactors, the fuel-cladding gap may close, as a result of the differential contribution of thermal expansion, creep and swelling of both the fuel and the cladding (pellet cladding interaction - PCI). In this equilibrium state, a significant increase of local power (i.e. a transient power ramp in the order of 100 kW/m-h), induces tensile circumferential stresses in the cladding. In presence of corrosive fission products (e.g., Iodine), and above a stress threshold value, characteristic of the material, cracks typical of stress corrosion appear and grow-up (stress corrosion cracking - SCC). The cracks may propagate from the cladding internal surface, causing the fuel failure.Recent trends in EU countries pursuit the objective to integrate nuclear and renewable energy markets by operating LWR as flexible as possible in terms of power. This operational mode has renewed the interest on the PCI issue. Development and validation of numerical tools that account for this phenomenon is thus of primary importance to reactor operation. In this context, OECD NEA has set up the "public domain database on nuclear fuel performance experiments - International Fuel Performance Experiments (IFPE) database", with the aim of providing a comprehensive and well-qualified database on MOX-UO2 fuel and Zircaloy cladding for model development and code validation. The present activity aims to assess the capabilities of the TRANSURANUS fuel performance code (version 2012) in predicting PCI/SCC and related mechanisms based on a selected database from the IFPE: the PWR Over-Ramp Project. The database include thirty nine (12 rods are here presented) UO2 fueled Zy-4 cladded rods of two different origins, forming nine different groups in terms of design and material parameters. They were base irradiated in a power reactor environment up to burn-ups in the range of 12 to 31 MWd/kg U and subsequently ramp-tested in the research reactor R2 at Studsvik, Sweden, to establish their failure limits.

TI  - Using a worldview lens to examine complex policy issues: a historical review of bushfire management in the South West of Australia
T2  - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The scale and intensity of bushfire activity in Australia is likely to increase as a result of climate change. Effective bushfire management policy measures are therefore essential to minimise the interrelated social, environmental and economic impacts of fire in the landscape. This paper presents a historical review of bushfire management in the South West of Australia (SW): a bushfire prone and biodiverse region. Using a worldview framework to analyse key policy documents and literature, the paper demonstrates that the evolution of complex policy sectors such as bushfire management, is influenced not only by scientific and technical developments but also as a result of changing worldviews. Adapting the Integrative Worldview Framework (IWF), seven worldview categories that dominated particular periods of history in Australia are presented. These worldview categories are then used to examine the evolution of bushfire management practice, policy and institutional arrangements relevant to the SW. The argument presented herein is that a better understanding of worldviews and how they influence complex and contentious policy fields such as bushfire management, is useful for policy analysis, reflexive practice and research. The paper suggests an integrative worldview approach, which enables opportunities for exchanges and constructive conflict between stakeholders and agencies with diverse worldviews, could contribute to creating more sustainable bushfire management. Finally, it is argued that opportunities for Indigenous and Western worldview exchanges in the bushfire management sector, through collaborative knowledge partnerships could assist the sector in both management practice and policy formulation.

TI  - Review of the role of the sentinel node biopsy in neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with breast cancer and negative or positive axillary node at diagnosis
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Review
AB  - The role of the selective sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is increasing in relevance in breast cancer women with indication of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The Radiosurgery Working Group of the SEMNIM is aware of the necessity of establishing the need for SNB before or after NAC, and also how to manage patients with axillary node-negative or node-positive. There is sufficient data to assess that the SNB with radioisotope techniques are feasible and safe in all these scenarios. An adequate axilla evaluation prior to surgery and the possibility of marking prior to NAC the nodes infiltrated must be the two main pillars to guarantee the success of the SNB. It has been shown that to incorporate the SNB in breast cancer women with indication of NAC increases the rate of a conservative treatment of the axilla that will be a clear benefit for these patients.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The ethos of holy war in the First Crusade depended in part on a rejection of Islam as a false religion inspired by Satan and connected to the eventual advent of Antichrist. For some European observers, eastern forms of Christianity were tainted by association with Islam. After the crusade, however, the survival of the nascent crusader states demanded frequent cultural and economic exchanges with Islam. King Baldwin I was especially instrumental in creating avenues of engagement with Muslims, Syrians, and Armenians. Western observers maintained the intolerant worldview of the First Crusaders. The growing cultural divide between the Franks of Europe and the Levant intensified Western indifference to the Levant on the eve of Hattin.

TI  - Fear of self-annihilation and existential uncertainty as predictors of worldview defense: Comparing terror management and uncertainty theories
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror management theory (TMT) proposes that thoughts of death trigger a concern about self-annihilation that motivates the defense of cultural worldviews. In contrast, uncertainty theorists propose that thoughts of death trigger feelings of uncertainty that motivate worldview defense. University students (N=414) completed measures of the chronic fear of self-annihilation and existential uncertainty as well as the need for closure. They then evaluated either a meaning threat stimulus or a control stimulus. Consistent with TMT, participants with a high fear of self-annihilation and a high need for closure showed the greatest dislike of the meaning threat stimulus, even after controlling for their existential uncertainty. Contrary to the uncertainty perspective, fear of existential uncertainty showed no significant effects.

TI  - Flood mapping in Grobnicko polje in November 2016 based on Sentinel-1 satellite images
T2  - HRVATSKE VODE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper gives an overview of flooded area mapping with images obtained by an active radar sensor installed in satellite Sentinel-1 of the European Space Agency (ESA). The radar possesses its own radiation source, thus facilitating surveys regardless of the time of day, and thanks to longer radiation wavelengths that pass through the clouds and haze undisturbed, it does not depend on weather conditions and the state of the atmosphere, which makes it very practical for flood mapping. The analysed images cover a greater area of Grobnicko polje in November 2016, when floods caused by record monthly precipitation quantities were recorded in this area. In November 2016, 486.6 mm of precipitation was recorded at the station Rijeka, and even 1311 mm at the station Platak in the hinterland. When the flood occurred, attention was mostly directed at remediating the problems caused by floods, such as flooded roads and a threat to the flooding of houses. Only the subsequent identification of the flooded areas offered a comprehensive insight into all flooded locations and the actual scope of the flood. In a series of satellite images, there is a visible change in the size of the flooded area during November and at the start of December 2016. On November 15, 0.07 km(2) was flooded; on November 21, the flooded area increased to 0.56 km(2); on November 26, the flooded area was estimated at 0.68 km(2), while on December 2, 2016, the flooded area decreased to 0.53 km(2).

TI  - Nomination of mental illnesses in languages of different types
T2  - SKASE JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A study of names for mental disorders in English, Chinese and Russian is the best way to reveal the national specifics of this fragment of the linguistic worldview. The naming methods of these concepts indicate the nature of this specificity. It has two causes. Firstly, these languages are typologically different: Russian is synthetic, English is analytical and Chinese is isolating one. Secondly, this specificity is explained by the mentality differences of Russian, English and Chinese speakers. However, except specifics, there are a number of common features in the nomination of mental diseases in languages of different types. These common features are in the use of native language resources for common names and borrowings for special ones; in the same metonymic transfers, in the closeness of semantic spheres of "mental illness" and 'stupidity'.

TI  - Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-band Backscatter to Monitor Phenology and Classify Deciduous and Coniferous Forests in Northern Switzerland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient methods to monitor forested areas help us to better understand their processes. To date, only a few studies have assessed the usability of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) datasets in this context. Here we present an analysis of an unprecedented set of C- band observations of mixed temperate forests. We demonstrate the potential of using multitemporal C- band VV and VH polarisation data for monitoring phenology and classifying forests in northern Switzerland. Each SAR acquisition was first radiometrically terrain corrected using digital elevation model- based image simulations of the local illuminated area. The flattened backscatter values and the local area values were input to a temporal compositing process integrating backscatter values from ascending and descending tracks. The process used local resolution weighting of each input, producing composite backscatter values that strongly mitigated terrain- induced distortions. Several descriptors were calculated to show the seasonal variation of European beech ( Fagus sylvatica), oak ( Quercus robur, Quercus petraea) and Norway spruce ( Picea abies) in C- band data. Using their distinct seasonal signatures, the timing of leaf emergence and leaf fall of the deciduous species were estimated and compared to available ground observations. Furthermore, classifications for the forest types ` deciduous' and ` coniferous' and the investigated species were implemented using random forest classifiers. The deciduous species backscatter was about 1 dB higher than spruce throughout the year in both polarisations. The forest types showed opposing seasonal backscatter behaviours. At VH, deciduous species showed higher backscatter in winter than in summer, whereas spruce showed higher backscatter in summer than in winter. In VV, this pattern was similar for spruce, while no distinct seasonal behaviour was apparent for the deciduous species. The time differences between the estimations and the ground observations of the phenological events were approximately within the error margin ( similar to 12 days) of the temporal resolution. The classification performances were promising, with higher accuracies achieved for the forest types ( OA of 86% and k = 0.73) than for individual species ( OA of 72% and k = 0.58). These results show that multitemporal C- band backscatter data have significant potential to supplement optical remote sensing data for ecological studies and mapping of mixed temperate forests.

AB  - Water quality parameters are derived applying several machine learning regression methods on the Case2eXtreme dataset (C2X). The used data are based on Hydrolight in-water radiative transfer simulations at Sentinel-3 OLCI wavebands, and the application is done exclusively for absorbing waters with high concentrations of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The regression approaches are: regularized linear, random forest, Kernel ridge, Gaussian process and support vector regressors. The validation is made with and an independent simulation dataset. A comparison with the OLCI Neural Network Swarm (ONSS) is made as well. The best approached is applied to a sample scene and compared with the standard OLCI product delivered by EUMETSAT/ESA.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer With Dual Cervical and Fundal Indocyanine Green Injection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was describe a novel sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracer injection procedure featuring dual cervical and fundal indocyanine green (ICG) injection for endometrial cancer and results of SLN biopsy.Methods Between June 26, 2014 and October 31, 2016, 111 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer at our institution. In all cases, we performed SLN biopsy with dual cervical and fundal ICG injection. All SLNs were processed with an ultrastaging technique. A total of 69 patients also underwent total pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy.Results The detection rates were as follows: 92.79% (103/111) overall for SLNs; 89.19% (99/111) overall for pelvic SLNs; 61.26% (68/111) for bilateral SLNs; 59.46% (66/111) for paraaortic SLNs, and 4% (4/111) for isolated paraaortic SLNs. We found macroscopic lymph node metastasis in 11 patients (9.9%) and microdisease in lymph nodes in another 10 patients, raising the overall rate of lymph node involvement to 18.92%. There was 1 false-negative (negative SLN biopsy but positive aortic lymphadenectomy) and another positive case in 1 undetected SLN. The sensitivity of detection was 94.44%, specificity 100%, negative predictive value 97.83%, and negative likelihood ratio 0.06 for intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer groups.Conclusions The SLN biopsy with both cervical and fundal ICG injection offers good overall detection rates and improved mapping of the aortic area. The SLN ultrastaging increases the number of nodes considered positive.

AB  - Dams require continuous security and monitoring programs, integrated with visual inspection and testing in dam surveillance programs. New approaches for dam monitoring focus on multi-sensor integration, taking into account emerging technologies such as GNSS, optic fiber, TES, InSAR techniques, GBInSAR, GPR, that can be used as complementary data in dam monitoring, eliciting causes of dam deformation that cannot be assessed with traditional techniques. This paper presents a Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) monitoring of La Viriuela darn (Malaga, Spain), a 96 in height earth-fill dam built from 1982 to 1989. The presented Mf-InSAR monitoring system comprises three C-band radar (-5,7 cm wavelength) datasets from the European satellites ERS-1/2 (1992-2000), Envisat (2003-2008), and Sentinel-1AM (2014-2018). ERS-1/2 and Envisat datasets were processed using StaMPS. In the case of Sentinel-1AM, two different algorithms were applied, SARPROZ and ISCE-SALSIT, allowing the comparison of the estimated LOS velocity pattern. The obtained results confirm that LaViiitiela dam is deforming since its construction, as an earth-fill dam. Maximum deformation rates were measured in the initial period (1992-2000), being around-7 mm/yr (LOS direction) on the coronation of the darn. In the period covered by the Envisat dataset (2003-2008), the average deforming pattern was lower, of the order of-4 mm/yr. Sentinel-1A/B monitoring confirms that the deformation is still active in the period 2014-2018 in the central-upper part of the darn, with maximums of velocity reaching-6 mm/yr. SARPROZ and ISCE-SALSIT algorithms provide similar results. It was concluded that MT-InSAR techniques can support the development of new and more effective means of monitoring and analyzing the health of dams complementing actual dam surveillance systems.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the subsidence behavior of a coastal area in the province of Malaga (Costa del Sol), southern Spain, in the period 1992-2018 using C-band SAR interferometry. The area comprises several zones of interest where continuous deformation has happened during the analyzed period. Using SAR data from ESA's ERS-1/2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1A/B satellites, and Multi-Temporal InSAR methods we detect and monitor subsidence in highly populated and industrial areas, airport, harbor, as well as local instabilities over a railway lure and a highway. In a previous work, we reported a subsidence due to intensive use of groundwater in some populated towns in the period 1992-2009 with maximum line-of-sight (LOS) rates of the order of 11 ram/yr. In this contribution, we confirm the subsidence trend. Furthermore, we detect an increase in the deformation rates for the most recent period (2014-2018), suggesting that the overexploitation of the aquifers has not ceased. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Over the past decades, the great technological advances made in airborne and space sensors have led to a significant improvement in remote sensing methods and techniques used for studying worldwide natural ecosystem disturbances. More commonly, optical sensors are chosen for detecting landscapes transformation, however, in addition to the problematics associated to this technology due the requirement of certain technical and environmental conditions (sunlight, no cloud-coverage), these systems may offer a significant lower performance when studying the post-disturbance evolution.In response to this challenge, this research aims to highlight the capabilities of Synthetic Aperture Radar -SAR satellite sensors for investigating the environmental evolution of forest areas affected by Mediterranean fire events. The use of a multitemporal analysis of ESA-Sentinel 1 SAR and Landsat 7 & Sentinel 2 optical satellite image series allowed us to explore the post-fire natural evolution of the areas affected by the Donana national park forest fire occurred in June-July 2017 in two different ways: 1. Monitoring radar image intensity changes to evaluate environmental disturbances within the affected areas; 2. Comparing the response of both optical and radar satellite systems to the extraction of long-term environmental information.The results obtained from both the backscatter signal analysis and the systems comparison illustrate the SAR technology's efficiency in detecting and studying temporal changes in the natural conditions of the areas affected by fire events.

TI  - IMAGE FUSION INFLUENCE ON FOREST AREA CHANGE USING UNSUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION
T2  - SUMARSKI LIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Demand for high quality free satellite data is increasing. Currently the most popular and known mission is Landsat satellite mission. This mission ensures ground resolution of 30 m x 30 m. For some application, this ground resolution is not sufficient. Landsat mission, starting from the Landsat 7 satellite, collects panchromatic band that is used to increase resolution of images.This paper analyzes the impact of multispectral and panchromatic image fusion on unsupervised classification. Based on original recordings NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) is calculated. This indexed image is used as reference image for the purpose of further comparison. The original images of first four bands (blue, green, red and near-infrared) are sharpened using eighth (panchromatic) band gathered with Landsat 7 satellite. From this bands, based on forth and third band, NDVI is calculated. With this calculation it is conducted pansharpening of reference NDVI image. Images for classification was chosen by comparing obtained images. Selected images was classified with K-means unsupervised classification algorithm, and it was determined that image calculated with bicubic interpolation and sharpened with fast intensity-hue-saturation (FIHS) algorithm on previously sharpened bands represents the best solution.

TI  - Long-term trends in the total columns of ozone and its precursor gases derived from satellite measurements during 2004-2015 over three different regions in South Asia: Indo-Gangetic Plain, Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term (2004-2015) satellite data over three adjacent yet contrasting regions: Indo-Gangetic Plain, Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau (TP) were used to study the spatiotemporal distribution of total ozone column (TOC) and its precursor gases (such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO)). The ozone precursor emission data and forest fire points were used to explore the findings. Trace gases showed increasing trend probably due to increasing emission from South Asia as supported by the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research emission data. Strong seasonal variation in trace gases was observed with the highest value during the pre-monsoon season, over three regions, possibly due to the biomass burning, pollution build-up and also long-range transport of pollution. TOC exhibited the similar seasonal variation as shown by the earlier ground-based studies over the region. The total column of precursor gases (except methane) exhibited strong seasonality with the highest column during the pre-monsoon season. Patterns in the variations of TOC and related precursors over the Himalayas were similar with that of the TP. Seasonal climatological trends also exhibited increasing pattern except for CO. This work provides an overview on the long-term TOC and its precursor gases which are necessary to understand the regional climate variability especially over the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau region.

AB  - Mangrove is unique vegetation that lives in tidal areas around the tropical and subtropical coasts. It has important physical, biological, and chemical roles for balancing the ecosystem, as well as serving as carbon pool. Therefore, monitoring the mangrove condition is very important step prior to any management and conservation actions in this area. This study aims to map and monitor the condition of restored mangroves in Perancak Estuary, Jembrana, Bali, Indonesia from 2001 to 2015. We used IKONOS-2, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 image data to map the extent and canopy cover density of mangroves using visual delineation and semi-empirical modelling through Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy. The results show that there was a significant increase in mangrove extent from 78.08 hectares in 2001 to 122.54 hectares in 2015. In term of mangrove canopy density, the percentage of high and very-high canopy density classes has increased from 32% in 2001 to 57% in 2015. On the other hand, there were slight changes in low and medium canopy density classes during the observation period. Overall, the result figures from both area extent and canopy density indicates the successful implementation of mangrove restoration effort in Perancak Estuary during the last 14 years.

CL  - Bandung, INDONESIA
AB  - Lake Toba in North Sumatera, Indonesia, is now designated to be a world-class tourism destination. Aside from its infrastructure development, this largest lake in the Southeast Asia needs to be restored, especially its water quality. While an oligotrophic status is required for tourism purposes, several studies showed that Toba is mesotrophic at its best and hyper-eutrophic at its worst. Numerous studies and reports blame floating net fishery (FNF) for water quality decline in Lake Toba and propose limitation for its production. While the central government allowed FNF to be positioned in certain areas according to its depth and distance from the lakeshore, increasing number of FNF means adding more nutrients to the lake and thus may inhibit the lake's restoration process. Hence, it is important to identify which areas are potential for FNF location to assist the authorities to regulate FNF. This study used SPOT-6, SPOT-7, and Pleiades satellite imagery to locate the position of existing FNF and to analyse the result to identify a potential location for FNF.

TI  - A linguistic and cultural image of the manor in Lithuania
T2  - ACTA BALTICO-SLAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to provide a description of the linguistic-cultural vision of the manor on the Baltic-Slavic border. The object of the analysis is autobiographical narratives of the oldest residents of Polish villages in the districts of Meikstai and Smalvos in north-eastern Lithuania, on the border with Belarus. The people living there have perfectly retained the memory of old manors and estates, local nobility, and the relations between the peasants and the manor. The article aims to present their memories about the manor, the impact of the manor on the formation of their personalities and attitudes towards the surrounding world, and to characterise the places important for the formation of a multi-ethnic, multicultural borderland and its unique character.The analysis of the conceptualisation of the manor and the landlord by the residents of Smalvos district is based on the general assumptions of oral history, especially those concerning the narrator's position, his/her worldview and his/her relation with the described reality. The reconstructed vision of the manor, based on the autobiographical narratives, is clearly positive. The described behaviour of the landlord to the peasants dispels the established stereotype of the landlord as a ruthless exploiter and the myth of relations with the peasants based on exploitation. Although cognitive definitions of the concepts under consideration describe the manor as a place distinct from the countryside, at the same time, however, it was a place where peasant children were welcome, taught prayers and the basics of reading and writing. The landlord is described as an educated, tolerant and understanding person who took care about his peasants and supported them.

AB  - The Mari people have created and tested by thousand-year practice a numerous and steady complex of folk omens. They are weather forecasts, household observations and superstitious predictions, which contain timescales for conducting all sorts of fatigue duties. They reflected the experience and knowledge acquired by the people in the process of practical perception and subordination of nature. Folk texts of such genre appear as omens-forecasts, omens-interpretations or omens-rules.The lexical means of expressions contribute to preserve and consolidate of pantheistic, social-behavioral, philosophical, instructive-everyday, ethno-pedagogical and other meanings in them. Antonyms, phraseological expressions and various tropes (metaphors, comparisons, metonymies, epithets) most often use in the texts of the Mari omens. We consider in this article the special features of their using, their role in the imaginative recreation of objective reality and in the artistic expression of the people's worldview.The internal semantic links between the parts of the omens often have oppositional character, therefore the antonymous relations are very clearly marked in the language of the people's omens, artistic expression of the national worldview. In such cases, as a rule, we are dealing with complex syntactic constructions: in one text, in fact, there are two signs, which are connected with each other on the principle of opposition.Phraseological established collocations give the omens a high degree of imagery, vivid bright picturesqueness.In the Mari omens from among the trope's ways of expressiveness different types of metaphors, including reification, are the most demanded. In some texts there are metaphorical monologues, that form elements of the mise-en-scene. In such cases metaphorical expressions give omens a humorous tone. Metonymy is mainly represented by synecdoche. The figurativeness of language of national omens is also achieved by use of different types of comparisons - direct, developed, etc. Epithets (figurative definitions) strengthen some one feature of a subject, which is the most significant in the omen, as it forms its meaning (forecasting, warning, hortative).

AB  - In this paper we present a new directional spectrum based on both oceanological and remote sensing data. The model is compared with popular ocean wave models used for remote sensing problems of T. Elfouhaily, P.A. Hwang and V. Kudryavtsev. It is shown that the modified wave spectrum is a good choice for L band RCS modeling for moderate incidence angles. It is also shown that the modeling results with the modified wave spectrum are in agreement with experimental data. In a region after spectral peak the model is presented in a form of power-law dependency of spectral density on frequency, where power is different for different wave ranges. It allows carrying out analytical transformations easily. An asymmetrical angular spreading function is used in a spectral model.

AB  - The religious choice as part of the process of conversion constitutes the border beyond which the change of individual worldview takes place. In the social perspective, the conversion leads to the change of religious identity and an affiliation to a certain religious institution. Proselytising activity and personal factors can act as incentives of conversion. The appeal to religion as part of the process of self-design of the individual is one of the steps that determine one's own religiousness. This act can be prolonged in time and can be made under the influence of a number of internal and external factors. At the same time, the fact of implementation of the religious choice acts as a point which allows one to record the change in one's worldview. In conditions of pluralism of beliefs in the former Soviet Union, the choice of religion implanted in tradition is caused by a set of objective and subjective factors. In order to achieve the goal of the research, methods of the qualitative sociology including the explanation of motives of actions and intentions through communicative interaction with the subject have been used. The analysis of a series of interviews became the basis for the determination of hierarchy of motives and incentives for making the religious choice possible. For Orthodoxy, these are the established way of life, existence of family traditions, fashion trends, stereotypes of everyday consciousness referring to traditional character of religious consciousness.

TI  - Examining some aspects of the worldview of students in Australian Catholic schools: some implications for religious education
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Religious education always takes place within a cultural context. In recent decades, this context has changed significantly and Catholic schools now engage with a world that is very different from the immediate post-Vatican 2 era. This changed cultural context shapes the views, beliefs and practices of students in Catholic schools. One way of exploring this contextualisation is to describe the worldviews of young people and to discuss some of the major features of these. This paper reports on an ongoing study of students in Catholic schools. It records how they see themselves, their involvement in Church and their religious expression. Results indicate nuanced responses that invite sophisticated analysis of young people and worldview. One clear trend to emerge is the changing perception of students as they progress through the school system. This finding is in accord with a view that describes religious engagement of young people reaching a plateau at a relatively early age. Some of the implications of this study for religious educators in Catholic schools will be drawn out and discussed with a number of recommendation made for practitioners.

TI  - TIME AND SPACE IN THE SAMOYEDIC TRADITION: THE CALENDAR AND THE SLEDGE
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to reconstruct the time and space conceptions generated in the depth of Samoyedic cultures from the position of the interpretative anthropology. The study methodology consists of the propositions concerning the specific character of the mythological mind: it is situated halfway between percepts (sense units) and concepts/notions (thinking units) in the process of the generalization of the information coming from without, and a mediator between an image and a notion is a symbol - a material object acting as an other item, phenomenon or event and serving for the information transmission. Relying on the thing language the authors realize the world-view reconstructions concentrating on the Selkup calendar and Nenets sledge. The objectified and subjectified culture forms are analysed in the process - language units, customs, rituals, traditional beliefs, folklore, prose of national writers.The process of the forming of the abstract notions and time conception was revealed on the consideration of the nominations typical for time units in the traditional Selkup calendar. Observations of concrete natural and cultural events are the basis of this process. The following conclusion is made: the Selkup traditional calendar is based on the principle of the cycling. First of all it indicated the recurrent succession of the natural and cultural events in the framework of time cycles and included periods of different protensions - day, month, season, microseason, year. The duration of these periods was not regulated and could vary within the cycles. The fullness with the concrete events actual for the people's life was important for the Selkup calendar rather than the exact time reckoning. Time was imagined as an alternate beginning and the event-trigger set was invariant. This event-trigger set of the nature and culture was a basis of the Selkup calendar.The specificity of nomadism of Nenets- reindeer breeders denotes the constant migrations by means of reindeers sledges. Therefore the sledge was involved into the regular movement rotation and served as indispensable attribute. The movement expands in the space and acts as a means of its learning and awareness. The following fundamental space conceptions were inserted inside the sledge image by the Nenets tradition: movement as its determinative attribute; pulsative character consisting in constant reduction and widening of the cultural area during the migration; irregularity expressed in the parallelism of worlds: on the one hand there are visible, local, humanized things, on the other hand there are invisible episodic things and beyond, independent of the man and belonging to spirits; stratification of the social space; connection with time, natural and social events.In general time and space were conceived and expressed in the culture of Samoyeds by means of objects, phenomena, events inserted into their life activity, so they were socialized. The developed nature and obscurity area were viewed as an integral part of life activity in this case.

AB  - In this study, a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulation around Wido Island was performed to analyze the wake effect behind an island. A 10 m/s wind speed and pressure boundary conditions were assigned for the inflow and outflow boundary conditions, respectively. Wido Island was modeled using GIS data. A prevailing wind from the north-northwest direction was determined based on QuikSCAT satellite data. A computational domain of 40 km × 20 km × 5 km covering Wido Island was applied for numerical analysis. Sixty points were specified to extract the wind speed data. A wind speed profile inside the atmospheric boundary layer was compared with a wind profile using a simple power law. It turns out that the wake effect decreases the mean wind speed by 5% more or less, which corresponds to a 14% decrease in wind energy. Thus, the installation of a meteorological mast or development of a wind farm behind Wido Island is not highly recommended.

TI  - MODIS-derived global land products of shortwave radiation and diffuse and total photosynthetically active radiation at 5 km resolution from 2000
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Incident shortwave radiation (SW), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and diffuse PAR (PAR(dif)) at the land surface drive a multitude of processes related to biosphere-atmosphere interactions and play a critical role in the Earth climate system. Previous global solar radiation products were spatially coarse (> 50-km resolution) or temporally short (a few years), which hindered scaling-up ground based observations of the land surface processes into regional, continental, and global scales across multiple time scales. Here, we report Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) SW, PAR, and PAR(dif) products over the global land surface at a 5 km resolution with 4 day intervals between 2000 and 2016. We combined an atmospheric radiative transfer model with an artificial neural network (ANN) to compute SW, PAR, and PAR(dif). A series of MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmosphere and land products were used as inputs to run the ANN. We test the performance of the products using data from 158 (SW), 77 (PAR), and 22 (PARdif) stations collected in the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and flux tower networks, which covered a range of climatic zones from polar to tropical zones. BESS had strong linear relationships with in-situ SW data (R-2 = 0.95, relative bias = -2.3%), PAR (R-2 = 0.94, relative bias = 1.7%), and PAR hf (R-2 = 0.84, relative bias = 0.2%). BESS captured the interannual variability of SW at both the site (a majority of long-term BSRN sites) and continental levels. Over the study period, global annual SW; PAR, and PAR(dif) values did not show any dimming or brightening trends, although these trends appeared at regional levels, e.g. dimming in India. Mean annual SW over the global land surface was 184.8 W m(-2) (875 ZJ yr(-1), zetta = 10(21)); 46% of SW was partitioned to PAR, which was further split into direct (59%) and diffuse (41%) components. The developed products will be useful in solar energy harvesting research and will improve water, carbon, and energy flux estimates of terrestrial ecosystems from local to the global scales.

AB  - Control and refinement of the geodetic linkage according to control points are one of the stages for processing of satellite image with high spatial resolution. The present paper has suggested a solution of two issues connected with high speed search of control points. Firstly, continuous supporting coating synthesized from separate images obtained from the spacecraft Landsat-8 has been created. Existing solutions for storage of the reference data have been studied and implementation of the tile storage being significantly exceeding than open solutions GeoServer, MapServer by speed has been suggested. Secondly, a possibility of effective parallel implementation of algorithms for search of control points using modern computer technology including multicore CPU and GPU has been researched. Method to search control points allowing forming a set of control points with the specified reliability and speed greatly increasing the correlation-based algorithm speed has been suggested.

TI  - Landsat archive holdings for Finland: opportunities for forest monitoring
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing interest in the use of Landsat data to enable forest monitoring over large areas. Free and open data access combined with high performance computing have enabled new approaches to Landsat data analysis that use the best observation for any given pixel to generate an annual, cloud-free, gap-free, surface reflectance image composite. Finland has a long history of incorporating Landsat data into its National Forest Inventory to produce forest information in the form of thematic maps and small area statistics on a variety of forest attributes. Herein we explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Landsat archive in the context of forest monitoring in Finland. The United States Geological Survey Landsat archive holds a total of 30 076 images (1972-2017) for 66 scenes (each 185 km by 185 km in size) representing the terrestrial area of Finland, of which 93.6% were acquired since 1984 with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Approximately 16.3% of the archived images have desired compositing characteristics (acquired within August 1 +/- 30 days, <70% cloud cover, 30 m spatial resolution). Data from the Landsat archive can augment forest monitoring efforts in Finland, provide new information for science and applications, and enable retrospective, systematic analyses to characterize the development of Finnish forests over the past three decades. The capacity to monitor trends based upon this multi-decadal record with the addition of new measurements is of benefit to multisource inventories and offers nationally comprehensive spatially-explicit datasets for a wide range of stakeholders and applications.

TI  - Albrecht Durer in the artistic paradigm of the german humanism
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article. By the works of the famous German artist and humanist Albrecht Durer, the authors suggest a modern view onto the formation of the humanistic worldview in the Northern Renaissance at the end of the XV-beginning of the XVI century. The article presents the characteristics of his artistic heritage in the context of the understanding of social, spiritual and aesthetic ideal. A methodology of the research is in the usage of applying of historical and cultural, systematic, biographical, cultural and theoretical and generalizing methods. Methods mentioned allow to disclose the dynamics of cultural and historical processes of the development of the Northern Renaissance, systematize separate phenomena of German culture at the end of the XV - beginning of the XVI centuries, to trace life and creative way by Albrecht Durer at the beginning of the reform movement in German, to comprehend the dynamics of general and cultural processes in Western Europe of the defined period and to make conclusions. Scientific novelty is determined by a full usage of the biographical method, relying on it the authors make the analysis of the artistic heritage by Albrecht Durer. His personal life, creative and epistolary legacy is an original realization of a humanistic ideal, the confirmation of the conception of a person's dignity. Durer became the first German artist, acknowledged outside his Motherland. Conclusions. The analysis of his life way and artistic works by Albrecht Durer gives reasons to consider him a supporter of the Renaissance humanism. Being one of the most famous in his time humanists, Durer in many of his works defined aesthetic ideals of modernity, namely the ideal proportions of a human's body. Primarily it is reflected in mythological scenes. As a theorist, Durer wrote a treatise in practical geometry and construction of fortifications. The late works by Albrecht Durer are marked by the influence of Luther theories as for the role of the church in the society. At the beginning of the XVI century, he concentrated on the usage of the light and tonal effects in the graphic arts. As a talented graphic artist, he created a lot of perfect graphic works. His works had a significant influence on the next generations of the artist in Europe. Albrecht Durer is one of the first artists and theorists of art in German, which was not only a famous master but a founder of a systemic approach in art. The authors consider Albrecht Durer not only a renowned artist but a brilliant representative of German humanism.

AB  - Large epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution, in particular fine particulate matter (PM2.5), is harmful to human health. However, air pollution monitors which measure air pollutant concentrations are sparsely located, excluding large portions of the population, in particular non-urban populations, from studies. One approach to resolving this issue is the development of models to predict local PM2.5, NO2, and ozone in unmonitored areas based on satellite, meteorological, and land use data. These prediction models are typically developed using large amounts of input data and are highly computationally intensive. We have developed a flexible R package that allows environmental health researchers to design and train spatio-temporal models capable of predicting multiple pollutants, including PM2.5. We utilize H2O, an open source big data R platform, to achieve both performance and scalability when used in conjunction with cloud or cluster computing systems.

M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT This study aimed to estimate the heritability of milk yield (MY), fat percent (F%), fat yield (FY), protein percent (P%), protein yield (PY), somatic cell score (SCS), and total bacterial count score (TBCS) as well as to estimate the genetic correlations among these traits, using a dataset from 5,918 lactations of Jersey cows in Brazil. The covariance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood using the PEST and VCE6 programs. The average values obtained for MY, F%, FY, P%, PY, SCS, and TBCS were 5017.5 kg, 4.3%, 192.3 kg, 3.3%, 173.0 kg, 5.9, and 2.9, respectively, while the heritability values were 0.16, 0.55, 0.18, 0.61, 0.25, 0.21, and 0.08, respectively. The genetic correlations ranged from low to high magnitude, with positive values from 0.06 (TBCS-PY) to 0.72 (FY-PY), and negative values from 0.04 (F%-TBCS) to 0.44 (P%-TBCS). The Jersey breed from Brazil shows genetic variability for all traits analyzed in the present study, and our results suggest that higher genetic gain will be achieved when F% and P% are used as selection criteria. In addition, it is important to use SCS as a selection criterion since the selection for MY and PY may lead to higher SCS or TBCS values, which are undesirable. This was the first study to estimate genetic parameters for milk quality (PY, P%, FY, F%) and udder health (SCS, TBCS) traits in Jersey cows from Brazil. This information is useful for breeding schemes and contributes to better characterize these parameters in tropical region, since few studies were developed with the Jersey cattle in this environment.

AB  - Groundwater over-pumping is a chief contributor to groundwater quality degradation and land subsidence. Expecting land subsidence is quite difficult, thus using satellite data to monitor such disaster is highly promising. This paper presents the use of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data along with Global Land Data Assimilation System data to monitor and investigate land subsidence resulting from the impact of groundwater depletion in different regions throughout the world. The trend rates of groundwater depletion were spatiotemporally estimated to map and detect the occurring and prone regions of land subsidence. The groundwater storage changes exhibit a declining linear trend during the testing period (20022015) with a rate of 3.4 km(3)/year at Missouri State in US. Based on the estimated linear tend of groundwater depletions, the method is validated at Missouri State by some exiting land subsidence such as sinkholes. Then, the approach is applied for the global and continental scales as example of US. The results also exhibit that the southern and some in the northern of US are the most prone regions for land subsidence. During the period 2009-2013, there was a great depletions and the results exhibit that mostly the abstractions from the North to the south of US and especially in the middle. Global estimates of groundwater storage changes also were conducted which can be used to estimate the groundwater depletion trends at any region throughout the world. These analyses could be helpful for monitoring and assessment of land subsidence in regions where subsidence impacts are great.

AB  - This paper investigates a method addressing remote sensing image classification based on the domain adaptation ( DA) and active learning ( AL). The key idea of our method is to retrain the classifier by using the available labeled samples from source domain, and adding minimum number of the most informative samples with active queries in the target domain. The active learning approaches provide pool of candidate samples based on different query functions with the assessment of uncertainty and diversity. The uncertainty criterion evaluates the algorithm' confidence in order to correctly classify the considered samples, while the diversity criterion decreasing the redundancy between the selected samples by choosing a set of unlabeled samples with more diversity. So, based on this model, we exploit both two criteria in order to choose the most informative samples are selected iteratively at the active learning procedure. In this work, we have proposed a novel uncertainty criteria based minimum expected error ( MEE), and also use angular based diversity ( ABD) as diversity criteria. The experimental outcomes prove the superiority of the proposed approach to counterpart methods.

AB  - Soil salinisation is a phenomenon considered to be a real threat to natural resources in semi-arid climates. The phenomenon is controlled by soil (texture, depth, slope etc.), anthropogenic factors (drainage system, irrigation, crops types, etc.), and climate factors. This study was conducted in the watershed of Oued El Abid in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, aimed at localising saline soil using remote sensing and a regression model. The spectral indices were extracted from Landsat imagery (30 m resolution). A linear correlation of electrical conductivity, which was calculated based on soil samples (ECs), and the values extracted based on spectral bands showed a high accuracy with an R-2 (Root square) of 0.80. This study proposes a new spectral salinity index using Landsat bands B1 and B4. This hydro-chemical and statistical study, based on a yearlong survey, showed a moderate amount of salinity, which threatens dam water quality. The results present an improved ability to use remote sensing and regression model integration to detect soil salinity with high accuracy and low cost, and permit intervention at an early stage of salinisation.

AB  - Cultural dimension in development has been widely accepted to propose an alternative approach in development, in which an emic approach in development provides people's view and bottom-up approach in development. Gintingan is an example of socio-economic and cultural institution, which has been implemented for decades by local people of Subang, West Java, Indonesia. The institution has been influenced by a Sundanese worldview of Tri Tangtu and implements the local wisdom of Silih Asah, Silih Asih and Silih Asuh. As the institution has been implemented in the region, local people's preferences varied based on their environmental location and affect its practices in terms of forms and purposes. This paper attempts to elaborate the practices of Gintingan and local people's preferences in the urban and rural area. The different practices of the institution between rural and urban area might affect to its sustainability and its role in sustainable community development.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shahr-e-Babak region located in the Kerman metallogenic belt is one of the high potential segments of Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc for porphyry copper and epithermal gold mineralization in the south of Iran. This high potential zone encompasses several porphyry copper deposits under exploitation, development and exploration stages. The aim of this study is to evaluate Landsat-8 data and comparison with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data-sets for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones related to Cenozoic magmatic intrusions in Shahr-e-Babak region. Previous studies have proven the robust application of ASTER in lithological mapping and mineral exploration; nonetheless, the Landsat-8 data have high capability to map and detect hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper and epithermal gold mineralization. In this investigation, several band combinations and multiplications, developed selective principal component analysis and image transformations were developed for discriminating hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper mineralization using Landsat-8 data.

AB  - Change Detection (CD) using multi-temporal satellite images is a fundamental application of remote sensing. To effectively capture change information from Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) optical images, spatial context needs to be modelled as VHR images are characterized by high spatial correlation among pixels. We propose a context-sensitive framework for CD in multitemporal VHR images using pre-trained Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN)-based feature extraction. Such a framework, while unsupervised, can effectively model the spatial relationship among neighbouring pixels in VHR images. A CNN, pre-trained for semantic segmentation, enables us to obtain multi-temporal deep features that are compared pixelwise to identify changed pixels. Changed pixels are further clustered for multiple change detection. Results obtained on multi-temporal datasets ofWorldview-2 and Pleiades images demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - Quick identification of post-earthquake destroyed buildings is critical for disaster management. It can be performed in unsupervised way by comparing pre-disaster and post-disaster Very-High-Resolution (VHR) SAR images. Spatial context needs to be modeled for effective change detection (CD) in VHR SAR images as they are complex and characterized by spatial correlation among pixels. We propose a unsupervised context-sensitive method for CD in multi-temporal VHR SAR images using pre-trained Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) based feature extraction. The sub-optimal CNN, pre-trained on an aerial optical image dataset and further optimized for using on SAR images by tuning the batch normalization layer of the CNN, enables us to obtain multi-temporal deep features that are pixelwise compared to identify the changed pixels. Detected changed pixels are further analyzed based on the double bounce property of the buildings in SAR images to detect the pixels corresponding to destroyed buildings. Experimental results on a dataset made up of a pair of multi-temporal VHR SAR images acquired by COSMO-SkyMed constellation on the city of L'Aquila (Italy) demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The study examined the spatio-temporal variability, validation and climatological trend of MODIS Terra and Aqua level-2 Dark Target retrieval algorithms 3-km AOD over India region during 2001-2017. Analysis reveal the MODIS AOD shows significant variability in spatial extent; Indo-Gangetic plane having high aerosol loading and Southern peninsula shows relatively low aerosol loading in all seasons. The climatological zonal averaged (throughout India) AOD(500) are 0.401 +/- 0.23 and 0.324 +/- 0.64 for Terra and Aqua respectively whereas the ground measured all stations averaged AOD(500) is 0.43 +/- 1.2 during study period. For validation we obtained daily AOD data from nine ground network stations across India. MODIS 3-km AOD shows good agreement with ground measurements. A total of 5646 and 4920 data points are utilized for validation of MODIS Terra and Aqua AODs respectively and the overall correlation coefficients and RMSE values are 0.94 & 0.08 and 0.72 & 0.17 for Terra and Aqua over the Indian region. However, during monsoon season, both the MODIS AODs are highly overestimated because of atmospheric noise and turbidity. Trend slopes and significances were calculated using Mann-Kendell test at nine selected stations and whole region. AOD shows a significant positive trend (99.9% confidence level) over India with an increasing rate of 2.35 yr(-1) and 2.03 yr(-1) for Terra and Aqua respectively. All stations annual AODs shows the increasing trend with different significance levels except Patiala. This study reveals the potential applications of the 3-km AOD product in aerosol climatology over Indian region.

AB  - Estimation of biophysical parameters based on regression models is of interest for the remote sensing community since it is one of the key elements for agricultural purposes. Numerically, this problem is solved separately for each biophysical parameter such as Leaf Area Index-LAI, soil moisture, crop height and etc. However, this approach ignores tight relationship among the biophysical parameters, which is essential for driving estimation performance with a limited number of in-situ measurements. As an alternative strategy, a multi-target regression, which also learns the relationship among biophysical parameters in regression model, is considered. In order to see how multi-target regression models capture plausible physical relationship between crop's biophysical parameters and polarimetric features, RadarSAT-2 images acquired over agriculture fields in the context of AgriSAR 2009 campaign were used.

AB  - This paper puts forward a practical application of emergent cloud computing technologies that addresses issues encountered in the earth observation and meteorological domain. Ever increasing satellite capture technologies result in larger and larger data that is being processed by more and more complex algorithms for the generation of weather reports, forecasts, etc. Companies and researchers that work on this kind of processing chains struggle with storage and computing issues that cloud computing technologies can overcome. This kind of architecture becomes all the more relevant as cloud providers propose accessible pay-per-use services that make such infrastructure economically viable. This article relates the complexity of satellite data processing with the solutions that cloud computing can offer. It details use cases that highlight the need for a centralized access to data between processing resources with localization constraints, for scalable storage and distributed computing capabilities, and for hardware optimization to minimize both costs and processing time.

AB  - Timely and reliable information on soils with respect to their nature, extent and spatial distribution is vital for optimal utilization of natural resources on a sustained basis. The technological advances in the field of remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) have augmented the efficiency of land resource inventory and mapping. The recent advances in remote sensing have immense potential to explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions of high-resolution satellites in soil resource mapping and characterization. In the present study, based on landforms, slope, land use/ land cover and ground truth, 37 physiography-land use units (PLU) were identified and described. Soil profiles were studied at representative sites on different PLUs for characterization of various sites and physical and chemical properties. PLU-soil relationship was developed by correlating soil-site characteristics and physical and chemical properties of soils. Six soil series were identified in major landforms, and soil map depicting phases of soil series was developed. The study revealed that the combined use of Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (10 m) and highresolution IRS-P6 LISS-IV data will be of immense help in identifying distinct soil patterns for large-scale soil resource inventory for village-level agricultural planning.

CP  - ISPRS TC V Mid-Term Symposium on Geospatial Technology - Pixel to People

AB  - Delineation of the glacier is an important task for understanding response of glaciers to climate. In Himalayan region, most of the glaciers are covered with debris. Supraglacial debris works as an obstacle for automatic mapping of glacier using remote sensing data. Different methods have been used to reduce this difficulty based on pixel-based and object-based approaches using optical data, thermal data and DEM. Pixel-based glacier mapping is a traditional method for delineation of the glacier but the object-based method has emerged as a new approach in cryosphere application leading to its successful application in different applications. All pixel-based methods require some degree of manual correction because these can't be delineated automatically, especially in shadow area and debris covered part of the glacier. In the majority of studies, the object-based method has provided higher accuracy to delineate the debris-covered glacier. Spatially high spatial resolution satellite data is best suited for object-based image classification. In future, a combination of pixel-based method and object-based method can be attempted for delineation of the debris-covered glacier along with its critical analysis for suitability. The present paper critically reviews pixel-based and object-based methods as well as provides a framework for combined pixel and object-based method for delineation of debris-covered glacier.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semi-arid regions of northern Jordan, soil surface colors show gradual variation from west to east. The dominant soil color in the northwest is a dark reddish brown. Toward the east, lighter brown colors dominate, and colors change further to light yellow in the east. These changes coincide with a climatic gradient (mean annual precipitation). Earlier studies showed a close and possibly causal correlation of soil colors (redness), soil weathering intensity, and mean annual precipitation. However, these conclusions were based on a limited number of soil samples. Our study, in contrast, shows the regional variability of soil colors in the context of geomorphological conditions and the climatic gradient. Two thematic maps of soils surface colors depending on verified supervised classification of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data were created. Results show a remarkable similarity of Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in the area, and confirm a strong correlation of red soil color distribution, mean annual precipitation, and geomorphological aspects (depressions leading to higher water availability and thus soil weathering intensity). Accordingly, this approach offers suitable tools for a quantitative investigation of soil color distribution under the consideration of climatic gradients and varying geomorphological conditions.

AB  - The world is undergoing the most significant wave of urban growth in history. It is expected that by 2030 the number of people living in the cities will increase to about 5 billion. The rapid urbanization has led to complex problems, including a reduction in vegetation cover, the formation of the urban heat island effect, environmental pollution, reduced open space, etc. This study intends to explore the spatial patterns of urbanization and its impact on the environment in and around Chandigarh-the first planned city of India. Chandigarh was originally planned for a population of 5 lakh, but the city has expanded rapidly over the last four decades and faces problems common to other growing cities in India, including the proliferation of slums and squatter settlements. The areas adjacent to the city boundary also face similar issues. The study presents the methods and results of an object-based classification and post-classification change detection on multi-temporal Landsat data (1978-2017). The processed data was used as an input for object-based classification using image segmentation algorithm of eCognition Developer software. The results show that maximum urbanization has taken place in the last decade in the southern and north-western directions outside the city as a result of the development of an international airport, new sectors and approach roads on the vegetated areas. As a result, maximum changes could be seen in the class vegetation as it has been rapidly changed to built-up areas. The results of this kind of study may hold immense value for planning the urban sprawl areas where up-to-date information is lacking because of the rapid pace of development.

AB  - Remote Sensing techniques, such as field spectroscopy provide information with a large level of detail about spectral characteristics of plants enabling the monitoring of crops. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of viewing angle in estimating the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) for the case of sugarcane. The study on the variation of the spectral reflectance profile can help the improvement of algorithms for correction of BRDF in remote sensing images. Therefore, spectral measurements acquired on nadir and different off-nadir view angle directions were considered in the experiments. Change both anisotropy factor and anisotropy index was determined in order to evaluate the BRDF variability in the spectral data of sugarcane. BRDF correction was applied using the Walthall model, thus reducing the BRDF effects. From the results obtained in the experiments, the spectral signatures showed a similar spectral pattern varying mainly in intensity. The anisotropy factor which showed a similar pattern in all wavelengths. The visual analysis of the spectral reflectance profile of sugarcane showed variation mainly in intensity at different angles. The use of Walthall model reduced the BRDF effects and brought the spectral reflectance profiles acquired on different viewing geometry close to nadir viewing. Therefore, BRDF effects on remote sensing data of vegetation cover can be minimized by applying this model. This conclusion contributes to developing suitable algorithms to produce radiometrically calibrated mosaics with remote sensing images taken by aerial platforms.

AB  - The state-of-the-art hardware merge sorter called MMS has the tie-record issue that the records having the same key can cause the problem. MMS solves this issue by inefficient scheme comparing both key and satellite data fields of records to determine whether two records are swapped or not. We propose a high-performance hardware merge sorter (VMS) which adopts an efficient solution to the issue comparing just key fields. We also present the detailed circuit of VMS that adopts some implementation optimizations.We implement and evaluate VMS on a Virtex-7 FPGA. The evaluation results show that our proposed merge sorter requires fewer hardware resources and achieves 1.44x better throughput than MMS when large records are used.

TI  - The Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAC) reduction program: using cranberry treatment to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections and avoid Medicare payment reduction penalties
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) established a total HAC scoring methodology to rank hospitals based upon their HAC performance. Hospitals that rank in the lowest quartile based on their HAC score are subject to a 1% reduction in their total Medicare reimbursements. In FY 2017, 769 hospitals incurred payment reductions totaling $430 million. This study analyzes how improvements in the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), based on the implementation of a cranberry-treatment regimen, impact hospitals' HAC scores and likelihood of avoiding the Medicare-reimbursement penalty.Methods: A simulation model is developed and implemented using public data from the CMS' Hospital Compare website to determine how hospitals' unilateral and simultaneous adoption of cranberry to improve CAUTI outcomes can affect HAC scores and the likelihood of a hospital incurring the Medicare payment reduction, given results on cranberry effectiveness in preventing CAUTI based on scientific trials. The simulation framework can be adapted to consider other initiatives to improve hospitals' HAC scores.Results: Nearly all simulated hospitals improved their overall HAC score by adopting cranberry as a CAUTI preventative, assuming mean effectiveness from scientific trials. Many hospitals with HAC scores in the lowest quartile of the HAC-score distribution and subject to Medicare reimbursement reductions can improve their scores sufficiently through adopting a cranberry-treatment regimen to avoid payment reduction.Limitations: The study was unable to replicate exactly the data used by CMS to establish HAC scores for FY 2018. The study assumes that hospitals subject to the Medicare payment reduction were not using cranberry as a prophylactic treatment for their catheterized patients, but is unable to confirm that this is true in all cases. The study also assumes that hospitalized catheter patients would be able to consume cranberry in either juice or capsule form, but this may not be true in 100% of cases.Conclusion: Most hospitals can improve their HAC scores and many can avoid Medicare reimbursement reductions if they are able to attain a percentage reduction in CAUTI comparable to that documented for cranberry-treatment regimes in the existing literature.

TI  - Monitoring Spring Floods on the Lena River Using Multiple Satellite Sensors
T2  - GLOBAL WARMING AND HUMAN - NATURE DIMENSION IN NORTHERN EURASIA
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Riparian regions in Siberia have experienced extreme floods in the last decade because winter precipitation has increased. However, detailed statistical information about spring floods is lacking. Remote sensing is an ideal tool for collecting data over large areas. The objective is to evaluate the relative usefulness and limitations of multiple satellite sensors for monitoring spring flooding across the entire Lena River. Spring floods progress at a speed of similar to 100 km day(-1) during the snowmelt period, expanding the width of the floodplain from several kilometers upstream to several tens of kilometers downstream. The 30-m-resolution Landsat and 500-m-resolution MODIS were sufficient to monitor the spatial extent of the flood. However, the upstream floodplain was too narrow to detect using 25-km-resolution AMSR-E. The AMSR-E was barely able to detect the presence or absence of floods at midstream. However, the AMSR-E microwave sensor could monitor day-to-day variation of spring floods. Images from optical sensors such as Landsat and MODIS were considerably limited by cloud cover. The 10-m-resolution PALSAR was unable to monitor spring floods during the 5-year operational period, because the temporal resolution of 46 days was insufficient to monitor floods. It was sometimes possible to obtain meaningful results from a single remote sensor, but it was impossible to fully understand spring flood behavior over the entire Lena River. An assemblage of sensors with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions would be helpful for flood risk management.

T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusion of spectral, spatial, and temporal information is an effective method used in many satellite remote sensing applications. On the other hand, one drawback of this fusion is an increase in complexity. In this paper, we focus on developing a fast and well-performed classification method for agricultural crops using time-series SAR data. In order to achieve this, a novel two-stage approach is proposed. In the first stage, a high-dimensional feature space is obtained using time-series dual-pol SAR data and morphological operators. Spectral, spatial, and temporal information is combined into a single high-dimensional feature space. In the second stage, a dimension reduction technique is applied to the feature vector in order to decrease time complexity and increase classification accuracy by considering the global and local pattern information in the high-dimensional feature space. The contribution of the morphological profiles to the classification performance is significant; however the time complexity is increased drastically. The proposed method overcomes the time complexity stemming from high-dimensional feature space; it also improves the classification performance. The superiority of the proposed method to the comparative methods in agricultural crop classification is experimentally shown with the improvements in both classification and time performance using time-series TerraSAR-X images.

TI  - THE VERTICAL TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP IN THE LEXICAL AND SEMANTIC FIELD "FAMILY" IN THE RUSSIAN, ENGLISH AND KUMYK LANGUAGES
T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldview of any ethnic group includes the concept of "family" as one of the key cultural constants. Lexical means of its expression possess both universal value and cultural specifics, which account for the importance of the study undertaken in this paper. The research deals with phraseological units belonging to the thematic field "kinship relations" in languages of different origin: Russian, English and Kumyk. The difference in their properties is explained by the fact that Russian is one of the inflectional synthetic East Slavic languages; English is an analytical language belonging to the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family; and Kumyk is an agglutinative language, which belongs to the Kipchak group of Turkic languages. The multifaceted comparative study of lexico-semantic components expressing the vertical type of kinship, their structure and means of expression is aimed at the discovery of cultural specifics in the perception and understanding of the concept "family" in Russian, English and Kumyk. The paper contains a structured analysis of lexical characteristics of the lexeme "family" ("line", "clan", "tribe", "nation") arranged on the linguistic, conceptual and mental levels. The research is done from the perspective of cultural studies, cognitive linguistics and semantics. It employs the methods of descriptive, analytical and semantic analyses (with elements of componental and definitional analyses). The study contributes to a broader discussion of the correlation of language and mind and is significant for revealing the culture-specific linguistic and cognitive features of Russian, English and Kumyk cultures. The comparative study of phraseological units belonging to the thematic field "kinship relations" is instrumental in revealing communalities and differences in the worldviews of the three cultures.

TI  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS FOR PREDICTING SOME STAND ATTRIBUTES USING LANDSAT 8 OLI SATELLITE DATA: A CASE STUDY FROM TURKEY
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest resources inventory is one of the essential parts of the sustainable forest management. Remote sensing applications have broad usage areas for this aim, since field measurements are costly, time consuming and laborious. Monitoring forest resources with various satellite images has found wide usage areas in forestry. In this study, the relationships between some stand attributes (mean diameter, basal area, stand volume and number of trees) and texture values obtained from Landsat 8 OLI satellite image were investigated for Crimean pine (Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold subsp. pallasiana (Lamb.) Holmboe) stands in Kastamonu region of Turkey. The multiple linear regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) were utilized to fit stand parameters using texture values. To form the ANN architectures, various transfer functions in hidden and output layers and number of nodes ranged from 1 to 20 in hidden layer were used, and a total of 180 architectures were designed for each stand attribute. The results indicated that the regression models had low R-2 values (0.399 for mean diameter, 0.337 for basal area, 0.332 for stand volume, and 0.183 for number of trees), and the most of the ANN models were better than the regression models for predicting stand attributes. The model containing hyperbolic tangent transfer functions in both hidden and output layers for mean diameter (R-2 = 0.593), logistic transfer function in hidden layer and hyperbolic tangent function in output layer for basal area and stand volume (R-2 = 0.632 and 0.650, respectively), and hyperbolic tangent function in hidden layer and linear function in output layer for number of trees (R-2 = 0.610) were the best ANN models. This study concluded that the ANN models developed with Landsat 8 OLI were useful to predict stand parameters better than the regression models in Crimean pine stands located in Kastamonu, Turkey.

AB  - Interferometric processing of SENTINEL 1A radar data, using the SqueeSAR(TM) technique, over the seismic active area of Patras Gulf (W. Greece) was performed, covering the period October 2014 to February 2015 for both ascending and descending orbital geometries. The interferometric products were jointly interpreted with non-EO data (geological, tectonic, seismological and geodetic) at an effort towards the identification and verification of known and "hidden" active faulting zones that consecutively facilitated the better assessment of the Seismic Hazard characterization for this area.The Line of Sight (LOS) velocity, together with the acceleration field and the East-West and Vertical decomposition components, showed differential ground motions along known faulting features of an almost linear type, but also highlighted motions along zones that had not been mapped before. The higher deformation velocity amplitudes and rates were observed along the known main tectonic zones of the area, as well as in areas associated with anthropogenic activity.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Open and Coastal Ocean and Inland Waters

AB  - The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is one of the key ocean current in considering global climate change because ITF transports substantial heat content from the Western Pacific tropical zone to the Eastern Indian Ocean tropical zone. However, the field observation system at the site is very few, and the detail of ITF is not clear. Meanwhile, Japanese geo-stationary weather satellite, "Himawari-8", which has been in full operation since July 2015, has the ability to observe the hemisphere including the ITF area from visible to infrared radiation at 10 minute intervals. In this research, techniques to estimate the flow distribution of ITF were discussed taking advantage of the features of such high frequency observation. Specifically, surface velocity was estimated by MCC (Maximum Cross Correlation) method using multiple SST (2 km spatial resolution, 1 hour average interval, Level 3) data of P-tree System provided by JAXA. As a result, the flow velocity of 0.5 m/s or more was estimated using the data of August 2017 in the Major Straits of the ITF such as the Lombok Strait. The estimate is consistent with the field observation value measured by ADCP. By using such high-frequency latest satellite data, the possibility of quantifying short-term coastal environment change was shown.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) provide new opportunities in remote sensing application. In contrast to satellite and conventional (manned) aerial tasks, UAS flights can be operated in a very short period of time. UAS can also be more specifically focused toward a given task such as crop reconnaissance or electric line tower inspection. For some applications, the delivery time of the remote sensing results is crucial. The current three-phase procedure of data acquisition, data downloading and data processing, performed sequentially in time, represents a drawback that reduces the benefits of using unmanned aerial systems. In this paper, we present a parallel processing strategy, based on queuing theory, in which the data processing phase is performed on board in parallel with data acquisition. The unmanned aerial system payload has been enlarged with low-cost, lightweight, multi-core boards to facilitate remote sensing data processing during flight. The storage of the raw sensing data is also done for possible further analysis; however, the ultimate decision support information can be seamless delivered to the customer upon landing. Furthermore, text alarms and limited imagery can also be provided during flight.

TI  - On the possibility of using CORONA and Landsat data for evaluating and mapping long-term LULC: Case study of Iraqi Kurdistan
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern land development is regarded as having begun in the 1960s and since then the pattern of land cover has changed considerably in many parts of the world. The majority of change detection studies have used Landsat MSS, TM, ETM +, and Landsat LDCM imagery and other satellite imagery to quantify and map land use changes for many parts of the globe from the early 1970s. In most applications however, (e.g., Balcik, Sanli, Goksel, Ulugtekin, & Dogru, 2009) land use changes dating back to the 60s are desirable. Given that most images start from the 70s, one possibility of overcoming this is to extend the timeline of change detection analysis beyond the first Landsat satellite imagery by cross-referencing with CORONA imagery to include the 1960s. The main objective of this study is to employ CORONA and Landsat images to perform change detection analysis using the Kurdistan region as a case study. Kurdistan region covers an area of 44957.1 km(2) and the study period ranges from 1969 to 2014. The results of the maximum likelihood classification process for CORONA images show that these images may be classified successfully and accurately, showcasing the fact that the timeline of change detection analysis may be extended by using CORONA's unique historical images to include the period prior to the start of Landsat missions in 1972. For Kurdistan region, CORONA played a pivot role as baseline map as many of the changes occurred after 1974, when the Kurdish revolution ended. Its land use and land cover changes have been significant and may be divided into three stages: the first stage involves the destruction and demolition of the landscape between 1974 and 1991. The second stage is the stage of Kurdish freedom and peace involving minor changes in the landscape of the Kurdistan region that began in 1992 and lasted until 2002. Finally, the last stage is between late 2003 and the present date, period which, economic growth and population increase were the main factors influencing urban growth in the Kurdistan region. A positive non-linear relationship (R-2 = 0.89) was found between population increase and urban growth using regression analysis for the study area during period 1969 to 2014. This case study therefore highlights the possibility of combining both CORONA and Landsat to study LULC change of any region prior to 1970s.

Landslide activity is one of the important parameters for landslide inventory and it can be strongly related to vegetation anomalies. Previous studies have shown that remotely sensed data can be used to obtain detailed vegetation characteristics at various scales and condition. However, only few studies of utilizing vegetation characteristics anomalies as a bio-indicator for landslide activity in tropical area. This study introduces a method that utilizes vegetation anomalies extracted using remote sensing data as a bio-indicator for landslide activity analysis and mapping. A high-density airborne LiDAR, aerial photo and satellite imagery were captured over the landslide prone area along Mesilau River in Kundasang, Sabah. Remote sensing data used in characterizing vegetation into several classes of height, density, types and structure in a tectonically active region along with vegetation indices. About 13 vegetation anomalies were derived from remotely sensed data. There were about 14 scenarios were modeled by focusing in 2 landslide depth, 3 main landslide types with 3 landslide activities by using statistical approach. All scenarios show that more than 65% of the landslides are captured within 70% of the probability model indicating high model efficiency. The predictive model rate curve also shows that more than 45% of the independent landslides can be predicted within 30% of the probability model. This study provides a better understanding of remote sensing data in extracting and characterizing vegetation anomalies induced by hillslope geomorphology processes in a tectonically active region in Malaysia.

AB  - The goal of the study is to support analysis Enhancement of Resolution and study effect on classification methods on bands spectral information of specific and quantitative approaches. In this study introduce a method to enhancement resolution Landsat 8 of combining the bands spectral of 30 meters resolution with panchromatic band 8 of 15 meters resolution, because of importance multispectral imagery to extracting land - cover. Classification methods used in this study to classify several lands - covers recorded from OLI-8 imagery. Two methods of Data mining can be classified as either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised methods, there is a particular predefined target, that means the algorithm learn which values of the target are associated with which values of the predictor sample. K-nearest neighbors and maximum likelihood algorithms examine in this work as supervised methods. In other hand, no sample identified as target in unsupervised methods, the algorithm of data extraction searches for structure and patterns between all the variables, represented by Fuzzy C-mean clustering method as one of the unsupervised methods, NDVI vegetation index used to compare the results of classification method, the percent of dense vegetation in maximum likelihood method give a best results.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Abstract The theory of landscape ecology applied to the methods of spatial analysis helps to understand changes in the structure of forest remnants. In view of this theory, the objective of the present study was to analyze the structure of a fragmented area between the years 1979 and 2015 through calculation of landscape metrics for arboreal, shrubby and herbaceous vegetation classes. Vegetation classes were classified with visits to the field, interpretation of aerial photographs from 1979 and supervised classification of Landsat 8 from 2015. The metrics calculated for each class were area and total number of fragments, total edge and average connectivity among the fragments. The analysis of structure found that it changed negatively due to an increase in the number of small fragments, which increased the intensity of edge effects and reduced connectivity between fragments for all classes.

T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An important component of vaccine development is the identification of safe and effective adjuvants. We sought to identify transcriptomal signatures of innate immune stimulating molecules using nextgeneration RNA sequencing with the goal of being able to utilize such signatures in identifying novel immunostimulatory compounds with adjuvant activity. The CC family of chemokines, particularly CC chemokines 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 17, 18, 20, and 23, were broadly upregulated by most Toll-like receptor (TLR) and nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLR) stimuli. Extracellular receptors such as TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 induced the transcription of CXC chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL6 and CXCL8, whereas intracellular receptors such as TLR7 and TLR8 upregulated CXC chemokines 11 and 12. Both TLR1/2 and TLR2/6 agonists induced strong chemokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Human skeletal muscle cells and fibroblasts respond with chemokine production only to TLR2/6 agonists, but not TLR1/2 agonists, consistent with strong expression of TLR2 and TLR6, but not of TLR1, in fibroblasts. TLR2/6 stimulated fibroblasts demonstrated functional chemotactic responses to human T cell and natural killer cells subsets. The activation of non-hematopoietic, adventitial cells such as fibroblasts and myocytes may contribute.

TI  - Evaluation of optical remote sensing-based shallow water bathymetry for recursive mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Water depth estimation using optical remote sensing offers a reliable and efficient means of mapping coastal zones. Here, we aim to find a suitable model for fast and practical bathymetry of an estuary using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS-3) images. The study examines three different models; (1) least square regression model, (2) spectral band-ratio method and (3) multi-tidal bathymetry model. The findings are supported with in situ observed depth values and statistical estimates. Although the least square regression model has provided best results with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.4m, it requires a large number of observed data points for absolute depth estimation. Spectral band-ratio and multi-tidal model provides results with RMSEs 2.1 and 0.9m, respectively. The present investigation demonstrates that multi-date imagery exploitation at disparate tide levels is the best estimation technique for recursive shallow water bathymetry where in situ observation is not possible.

AB  - The Rheticus (R) cloud-based platform provides continuous monitoring services of the Earth's surface. One of the services provided by Rheticus (R) is the Displacement Geo-information Service, which offers monthly monitoring of millimetric displacements of the ground surface, landslide areas, the stability of infrastructures, and subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal/entry or from the excavation of mines and tunnels. To provide this information, the Rheticus (R) platform processes a large amount of Geospatial Big Data. In particular, Rheticus (R) is capable to process Synthetic Aperture Radar images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed constellation, as well as satellite Open Data provided by Copernicus Sentinels, and it is capable to integrate local INSPIRE data sources. In this paper, we summarize the main features of the Rheticus (R) services and we provide examples of the detection and monitoring of geohazard and infrastructure instabilities through Multi-temporal InSAR techniques. Furthermore, we outline the porting activity and the efficient implementation of the most time-consuming algorithmic kernels in the GPGPU environment.

AB  - This study discusses fractal analysis for characterization both geothermal and non-geothermal surface temperature. The data were obtained from Landsat-8 satellite imagery and analyzed by using Fractal method to produce complexity parameters (Dimension, Intercept, and Lacunarity). The result shows that the fractal method can be applied successfully to characterize and distinguish the pattern both these surface temperatures. The plots of all parameters exhibit that the geothermal surface has a convergence pattern, while the non-geothermal area has a divergence pattern.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A 22-y-old Quarter Horse gelding was presented to the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation of increased heart rate and mild colic signs. Rectal examination revealed a large left perirenal mass. Abdominal ultrasonography further confirmed this finding. Thoracic ultrasonography indicated multifocal irregularities on the pleural surface suggestive of consolidation and possibly masses in the lungs. The animal was euthanized. Autopsy findings included a large, firm, expansile, gelatinous retroperitoneal mass that surrounded both kidneys, as well as nodules with similar morphology in the lungs, liver, intestinal mesentery, cecum, and caudal mesenteric artery. Histologically, the masses were composed of neoplastic stellate-to-spindloid cells in abundant mucinous stroma. Neoplastic cells exhibited strong immunoreactivity for vimentin and were negative for pancytokeratin (A1/A3), CD3, CD20, melan A, and synaptophysin. Mucinous stroma was strongly positive with alcian blue and weakly positive with periodic acid-Schiff histochemical staining. These findings are consistent with metastatic myxosarcoma. Myxosarcoma is a rare neoplasm in horses, and metastasis to tissues other than sentinel lymph nodes has not been described previously to our knowledge.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Geostatistics Applied to Post-stratification of Eucalyptus Stands
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has many rural properties with unmanaged eucalyptus stands. These plantations are heterogeneous, presenting different tree sizes, advanced ages, and large wood volumes that can be quantified using forest inventories. The prediction error of dendrometric variables, mainly in highly heterogeneous areas, can be associated with inadequate forest inventory procedures, i.e. low intensity of sampling plots. However, a larger number of plots increases the cost of inventorying. Therefore, a promising alternative is forest stratification into homogeneous sub areas. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to analyze the reduction of volume estimate errors by post-stratification procedures. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 and Spot 6 images and geostatistical techniques, such as kriging the volume (V) and diameter at breast height (DBH). The most precise method to estimate the total volume was the stratified random sampling (STS), based on geostatistical interpolation, using the DBH (error lower than 10%).

AB  - New space missions like Sentinel-1 (European Commission and European Space Agency Copernicus Programme partnership) are able to obtain SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images with high frequency, resolution, range and, above all, availability, which allows the use of techniques like differential interferometry in new fields.Interferometry technique is based in the accurate measurement of the go and back travel of electromagnetic radiation between a SAR Radar and the earth surface, registering intensity and phase of returning radiation into SAR images. Comparing two images of the same earth surface area it is possible to make an interferogram, in which the information of phase difference is highly related to terrain topography, and its deformations can be graphically represented through maps.The aim of this study is to evaluate the possibilities of using differential interferometry technique for localized monitoring of runoff erosion studies, evaluating calc parameters, use limits and results meanings. For the achievement of these goals we have used a monitored basin near Madrid City.

AB  - Due to the lack of a unitary and concise private contractual practice related to satellite data and imagery, some academics favour a remote sensing convention as the lack of regulation and system controls creates ambiguities and adaptation problems. In this article, the author suggests to the scientific community the creation of a legal base and a contractual paradigm, leading to the establishment of a new set of satellite and individual trade-related terms. Such terms would be applied uniformly to the satellite data and imagery of online transactions. A practical, fast and effective method would allow parties to close online transactions in a more legally secure manner, at least theoretically.

We used AWS data of Yongdam-Dam, Hoengseong-Dam in Korea area, the meteorological station of Nakhon Rachasima, Pak chong for test-bed to evaluate the validation and the opportunity for un-gaged basins. In addition, we calculated EDI (Effective doought index) using the stations and co-located PERSIANN-CDR, TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission) TMPA (The TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis), GPM IMERG (the integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) rainfall data and compared the EDI-based station data with satellite data for applications of drought monitoring. The results showed that the correlation coefficient and the determination coefficient were 0.830 and 0.914 in Yongdam-dam, and 0.689 and 0.835 in Hoengseng-Dam respectively. Also, the correlation coefficient were 0.830, 0.914 from TRMM TMPA datasets and compasion with 0.660, 0.660 based on PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM data in nakhon and pakchong station. Our results were confirmed possibility of near real-time drought monitoring using EDI with daily satellite rainfall for un-gaged basins.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rotavirus vaccines protect against the leading cause of severe childhood diarrhoea, and have been introduced in many low-income African countries. The Gambia introducedRotateq (RV5) into their national immunization program in 2013. We revieweddata from an active rotavirus sentinel surveillancesitefor early evidence of vaccine impact.METHODS: We compared rotavirus prevalence in diarrhoeal stool in children< 5 years of age admittedat the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital sentinel surveillance site before (2013) andafterRV5 introduction (2015-2016) in the Gambia. The rotavirus-percent positive was separately compared for all diarrhoealhospitalizations and for hospitalizations with severe symptoms. Rotavirus prevalence was compared annually for the pre-vaccine year of 2013 with post-vaccine years of 2015 and 2016 using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests and the p-value to establish significant relationship was set at p < 0.05. All analyses were completed in SAS 9.3 (SAS Analytics, North Carolina).RESULTS: Rotavirus prevalence among all diarrhoeahospitalizations decreased from 22% in 2013 to 11% in 2015 (p = 0.04), while remaining unchanged in 2016 (18%, p = 0.56). For hospitalizations that were clinically severe and/or treated with intravenous fluids (mean of 46 per year), the rotavirus prevalence decreased from 33% in 2013 to 8% in 2015 (p = 0.04), and to 15% in 2016 (p = 0.08). The children with age <1 year accounted for 45% the population infected with rotavirus in both pre and post rotavirus vaccination periods.CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus vaccine introduction in the Gambia could be among factors resulting in decreased diarrhea hospitalizations among children at the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital, particularly those with severe disease. These results support the continuation of rotavirus vaccine and additional monitoring of rotavirus hospitalization trends in the country.

AB  - ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Frozen section is recommended in several situations to: establish the nature of a lesion; establish the presence of a lesion; confirm the presence of a benign lesion; confirm that sufficient tissue is present for diagnosis; establish the grade of the lesion; determine the organ of origin and determine the adequacy of margins. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of frozen section biopsy in multiple organs and analyze possible factors in discrepancy. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out during a five-year period at a teaching hospital of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. The diagnoses of frozen section were compared with results obtained in the permanent section and classified as concordant or discordant. The discordant cases were reviewed by a pathologist and subdivided into false positives and false negatives. Possible reasons for discrepancy were indicated. RESULTS: A total of 1.226 specimens were analyzed, of which 1.181 (96.33%) were concordant and 45 (3.67%) were discordant. After the review of the discordant cases, 39 remained, six (15.4%) were false positives and 33 (84.6%) were false negatives. The tissue that had most false-positive results was mammary sentinel lymph node (3/1.2%), whereas ovarian showed most false negative outcomes with 17 specimens (51.51% of all false negatives). The possible reasons for discrepancy were sampling error, misunderstanding and complexity of the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The frozen section accuracy of 96.3% found in our study is similar to specialized literature and does not seem to depend on the tissue analyzed. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

The backscattering sensitivity to SMC measured by in- situ stations is investigated considering the available sensor frequencies and polarizations. In addition, for exploiting the potential of fully polarimetric acquisitions of RS2, simulated Compact Polarimetric (CP) data are computed by using a Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) data simulator, and their sensitivity to the target SMC is examined. Based on the experimental findings, two machine learning (ML) approaches to the SMC retrieval, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are implemented and tested on the two areas. Looking at the preliminary results, the integration of X- and C- band images does provide valuable information for the retrieval of SMC, while the simulated CP parameters exhibit a certain sensitivity to SMC. On the South Tyrol test area, both SVR and ANN tested with different combinations of RS2 and CSK data were able to retrieve SMC with a RMSE between 2% and 4% of SMC and correlation coefficient R between 0.85 and 0.97, depending on the combination of inputs. The application of the ML algorithms to the other available images on the Mazia test area and the implementation of the ML retrieval algorithm using CP data are still under investigation.

AB  - The relationship between rainfall regime and the volumes of water available in rivers has always aroused great interest. The hydrologic regime of rivers is affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Climate Change and has a direct impact on freshwater ecosystems and human water consumption. The remote sensing applied to estimation of Water Discharge (WD) has a great potential to supplement ground observations when some observation stations have been discontinued or interrupted. Such knowledge about WD has a great repercussion on management of watersheds and implementation of projects. In this study, we propose a method to estimate monthly discharge in a hydrographic basin using remote sensing. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, the products of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor (MODIS) of TERRA/AQUA satellites and Oceanic Nino Index are used for estimate the WD in Santa River Basin. The methodology is based on filters in frequency domain and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) applied to climatological anomalies. Our results have a high correlation around 0.97 in the adjustment of the model (2001-2011) and 16.26 RMSE in the estimation of the discharge of water showing that this method can be employed effectively.

AB  - Global climate change is one of the main problems that humanity faces in this century [1]. The amount of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the air is increasing which increases humidity, average rainfall and temperature and directly affect the speed of melting glaciers. In the present work, a method of calculating surface temperatures from satellite images of Landsat TM and Landsat OLI (band 6 and band 10 respectively) for the Huaytapallana Mountain at the Mantaro valley is validated. Initially, the radiance of the upper part of the atmosphere (TOA) is extracted from the digital number (DN) values. The TOA radiance is then converted into surface radiance applying the Reference Channel Emissivity (RCE) method considering that the emissivity of the study area is constant (0.97, the glacial ice emissivity). The surface temperature is extracted after the surface radiance. Based on this data, the correlation was made from data from Google Earth Engine (EEFlux), showing a high correlation between 0.97 to 0.98.

AB  - Invasive species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. In the past decade, the development of environmental spectroscopy, both field spectrometers and airborne imaging spectrometers, has allowed progress in identifying individual species from remote sensing data. However, use of environmental spectroscopy for species identification needs understanding at a more fundamental level, especially the development of generalized methodologies and rules for detection and mapping, which is an area of active research today. These issues will be explored using examples from a wide range of habitats and site conditions, towards the development of a robust methodology to identify native and non-native species.

AB  - SCRAMJET is an online tool that allows business travellers to connect and plan to meet in any of the airports included in their trip. To successfully deliver, SCRAMJET needs accurate and up-to-date worldwide airport mapping information. This paper describes an assessment of the use of Earth Observation (EO) products, in particular the Sentinel program, for improving airport mapping and monitoring its changes. The first step is to verify the data availability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 at a global scale, and then evaluate its adequacy for airport mapping. For monitoring airport changes, the analysis tested multispectral change detection methods and interferometry processing techniques. The main conclusion was that the acquisition frequency of both Sentinels is a great benefit to assure up-to-date information at a global scale. The recommended approach for a target of 200 airports is to do the airport mapping, assisted by Sentinels data for validation and improvements, and monitoring changes by integrating a Sentinel-2 change detection chain (using NIR/SWIR bands), in parallel with OpenstreetMap change detection processing.

AB  - In the context of the dynamic and accelerated global changes of the 21st century, knowledge about land use and land cover are important tools for urbanistic and environmental monitoring and planning. This paper presented the comparative evolutionary historic diagnostic of land use and land cover in the municipality of Sao Francisco do Sul/SC and in its areas with environmental restrictions. In preparing the study, orbital images obtained by the Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellites were used. ArcGis 10.2.2 was used for the classification of the images and eight classes of land use and occupation were identified: water, mangrove, urban area, early stage vegetation, exposed soil, medium/advanced stage vegetation, grass and forestry. The study of the evolution of land use showed a considerable increase in urban areas in the municipality and a high rate of regeneration of degraded areas within the Permanent Preservation Areas and in the Acarai State Park. Finally, it was identified that throughout the studied period there was an increase of vegetated areas in the county, even with the advance of the urbanized areas.

AB  - The success of oil palm plantations as an important indicator of national economic development is well recognized. Conversely, land cover changes due to the expansions of oil palm plantations have been accused of being a cause of reduced species biodiversity, such as of butterfly. Therefore, a study was conducted in August 2017 in PT BLP, Central Kalimantan, to verify such allegations. Data were collected on various land cover types simultaneously, using a combination time search and transect method. Landsat imagery was used to established and analyze the historical data of land covers prior to the establishment of the plantations. Impacts of the oil palm plantations on butterfly diversity were determined by comparing the current butterflies found on each plantation site, with those found on the adjacent land cover types that resembled the previous land cover types (baseline area). Results of the study showed that 49.9% of the plantation sites were previously dominated by secondary forests, 44.2% were dominated by bare land and 3.5% were dominated by shrubs. The total number of species and richness index in the oil palm plantation (S = 27; Dmg = 5.29) were higher than the baseline area (S = 5; Dmg = 1.92). It can be concluded from this study that oil palm plantations have a positive impact on increasing butterfly diversity, which resulted in gaining 22 species and not losing any butterfly species.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of leafless and full-canopy trees in fall is essential in understanding the phenological and morphological characteristics of forests and those are critical baseline information for several scientific questions and management scenarios. The rapid progress of very high-resolution satellite-borne sensors provides a feasible solution to fast and accurately map tree coverage during the growing season. However, less attention has been paid to the leaf-off seasons. One biggest challenge with classification on fall imagery is the potential confusion among different land features, as evidenced by the no significant difference between bare land and leafless trees from t-test and transformed divergence (TD) analysis results. We proposed an integrative approach to classifying leafless and full-canopy trees on fall imagery of 0.46-m WorldView-2 (WV-2). We adopted a two-step classification approach by first removing the non-forest area from the WV-2 imagery with the mask layer generated from the publicly available summer imagery of 1-m National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery via object-based image analysis. Two classification methods, namely decision tree (DT) and nearest neighborhood (NN), were employed to classify full canopy and leafless trees in the masked WV-2 imagery. DT performed slightly better than NN regarding higher overall accuracy and fewer feature requirements.

AB  - One of the world's most spectacular ecosystems in this world is the coral reef. In Indonesia, Bangka Belitung is one province which has beautiful coral reefs and has become one of the tourist attractions. However, there might be a loss of the coral reefs area that can be caused by natural factors and human activities. This study aims to analyze the distribution and the changing of coral reefs that occurred in the islands of tourist destination in Belitung Regency from 2005 to 2018 and to analyze its factors. Landsat satellite imageries used in this study are Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The distribution of coral reefs will be determined by image data processing. Then, overlay methods are used to analyze the changes and its factors. Based on the analysis, in the year of 2005-2018, there are 3.93 km(2) areas of coral reefs that have decreased. On the top of that, there are 1.34 km(2) or about 34.04% of coral reefs areas have decreased that caused by non-natural factors. It can be concluded that the decreased of the coral reefs occurred in Belitung tourism destination islands, are still dominated by natural factors rather than a non natural factor.

TI  - Ecological preferences of large carnivores in remote, high-altitude protected areas: insights from Buxa Tiger Reserve, India
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Difficult terrain and inclement weather limit our knowledge of large predators, such as the tiger Panthera tigris, in the Himalayas. A lack of empirical data on large carnivores can lead to mismanagement of protected areas and population declines. We used non-invasive genetic and remote sensing data to inform the management of such high-altitude protected areas. We used the tiger as a focal species to investigate prey preference and habitat suitability in India's Buxa Tiger Reserve, which encompasses several eco-geographical regions in the Himalayan and subtropical zones. During 2010-2013, 909 faecal samples were collected, of which 372 were confirmed, using genetic analysis, to be of tiger origin. Fourteen prey species/groups were identified in 240 tiger faecal samples, largely dominated by goats Capra spp. (26.59%), rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta (22.22%) and cattle Bos spp. (20.63%). Considering only the wild prey species for which survey data are available, however, and frequency of occurrence of prey in faecal samples, hog deer Axis porcinus, sambar deer Rusa unicolor and spotted deer Axis axis were the most preferred prey species. Using faecal sample locations to examine the relationship between tiger presence and environmental features indicated that the niche for tigers is narrower than the available protected area: c. 62% of core protected area is suitable, of which only 17 % is highly suitable for tigers. Tigers prefer dense vegetation, open forests, riverine vegetation and areas close to water sources. Faecal sample-based studies have the potential to generate data that can help us understand the ecology of elusive carnivore species inhabiting high-altitude landscapes.

TI  - Phenology and carbon fixing: a satellite-based study over Continental USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has led to concerns about its impact on our biosphere and vegetation. Any impact of climate on vegetation can manifest in terms of changes in plant growth characteristics, its health and timing of different vegetative phenomena, such as germination, bud burst, maturity, etc. The duration and changes in the timing of plant growth stages can in turn impact the global carbon cycle. Similarly any change in plant productivity, because of changing climate will alter the carbon flux pattern by changing the overall biological flux being added or taken away from the atmosphere. We have used satellite data to study spatiotemporal changes in the plant phenology and plant productivity over the Continental USA (CONUS) to get an overall understanding of the evolution of these metrics over the past decade. Our study reveals that the prairies situated in the heartland of CONUS have become an increasingly important player in determining any changes in vegetation induced carbon source/sink patterns. The northern Great Plains has shown increased fixation of carbon in recent years, while the southern Plains has become a carbon source. This has been largely driven by changes in recent weather patterns where the northern plains have seen an increasingly cooler and wetter growing season whereas the southern plains have at the same time seen increased aridity, especially since 2011. This is also reflected in increasing growing season greenness values over the northern Plains and the opposite over the southern Plains. The gradual changing pattern of land biological fluxes over CONUS, as documented in this paper will likely be of interest to climate modellers as they seek to better understand the interaction between global carbon balance and climate change.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Harvey was one of the worst hurricanes that hit the Gulf coast in recent history, causing severe loss of lives and property through excessive precipitation and flooding. In the present study we have carried out analysis of satellite data and high-resolution models to understand the physical processes that led to the development and intensification of hurricane Harvey as it made landfall and progressed inwards. We have studied horizontal and vertical changes in meteorological parameters, along the track of the hurricane Harvey to understand the intensification and spatial distribution of high precipitation. Maximum intensity of the storm was observed on 26 August; however the most intense precipitation occurred on 27 August that was caused by the slowing down of Harvey. Our detailed analysis shows contrasting storm intensity between the two sides of the storm, one along the direction of storm motion and the other along the trailing side, which has been shown to be the primary driver for the distribution of precipitation and its variation in intensity.

TI  - Assessing seasonal trends and variability of vegetation growth from NDVI3g, MODIS NDVI and EVI over South Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of vegetation dynamics over South Asia (SA) has been primarily conducted using satellite time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, various vegetation indices may show diverse trend patterns over the same area. This study analysed the consistency of the vegetation spatiotemporal trends from AVHRR version 3 NDVI (NDVI3g) with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) over SA during various seasons, assuming that MODIS products are of higher quality. Results showed that the spatiotemporal vegetation trends derived from the NDVI3g were analogous to both MODIS NDVI and EVI indicating greening over semi-arid regions where croplands dominate and browning over tropical/subtropical forest areas. Correlations among them were better during winter monsoon. Discrepancies occurred in tropical/subtropical densely vegetated (humid) and complex topographic areas specifically during summer monsoon (SM). This study improved the understanding of the heterogeneous vegetation trends over the vast complicated terrain of SA. It was revealed that NDVI3g is reliable to quantify vegetation trends over SA, however, calibration errors still could introduce biases during SM season.

AB  - In this paper, an algorithm using Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to identify changes of tillage over agricultural fields at approximately similar to 100m resolution is presented. The methodology implements a multiscale temporal change detection on S-1 VH backscatter in order to single out VH changes due to agricultural practices only. The algorithm can be applied over bare or scarcely vegetated agricultural fields, which are identified from S-2 NDVI measurements. An initial assessment at farm scale using in situ and S-1 and SPOT5-Take5 data, acquired over the Apulian Tavoliere in southern Italy in 2015, is illustrated. A full validation of the approach is in progress over three European agricultural areas located in Italy, Spain and France. Results will be further reported in the paper.

AB  - Rapid change of Adama wereda during the last three decades has posed a serious threat to the existence of ecological systems, specifically water bodies which play a crucial part in supporting life. Role of Satellite images in Remote Sensing could be more important in investigation, monitoring dynamically and planning of natural surface water resources. Landsat-5(TM) & Landsat 8 (OLI) has high spatial, temporal and multispectral resolution and therefore provides consistent and perfect data to detect changes in surface changes of water bodies. In this paper, a study was conducted to detect the changes in water body extent during the period of 1984,2000 & 2017 using various water indices such as namely Water Ratio Index (WRI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), supervised classification and wetness component of K-T transformation and the results are Presented. NDWI has been adopted for this study as compared with other indices through ground survey. The results showed an intense decreasing trend in the lakes of chelekleka, kiroftu, lake 1 and lake 3 of surface area in the period 1984-2017, especially between 2000 and 2017 when the lake lost about 1.309 km(2) (one third) of its surface area compared to the year 2000, which is equivalent to 76%, 18%,0.03% and 96%. Interestingly koka lake has shown very erratic changes in its area coverage by losing almost 3.5 sq. km between 1984 and 2000 and then climbing back up by 14.8 sq. km in 2017. Percentage of increment was observed that 10.6 % as compared with previous year.

AB  - The first time satellite space based measurement of atmospheric black carbon (BC) aerosols scattering coefficient at 550nm (BC SC at 550nm), dust aerosols scattering and dust aerosols extinction coefficient (DSC at 550nm and DEC at 550nm) parameters have been used to understand their long term trend of natural and anthropogenic aerosols behavior with its close association with ground based measured precipitation parameters such as Total Rain Fall (TRF), and Total Number of Rainy Days (TNRD) for the same period over western Indian regions concerned to the primary aerosols sources of natural activities. The basic objective of this study is an attempt to investigate the inter-correlation between dust and black carbon aerosols loading characteristics with a variation of rainfall pattern parameters as indirect aerosols induced effect i.e., aerosols-cloud interaction. The black carbon aerosols generated by diverse anthropogenic or human made activities are studied by choosing of measured atmospheric BC SC at 550nm parameter, whereas desert dust mineral aerosols primarily produced by varieties of natural activities pre-dominated of dust mineral desert aerosols mainly over Thar desert influenced area of hot climate and rural tropical site are investigated by selecting DSC at 550nm and DEC at 550nm of first semi-urban site i.e., Udaipur (UDP, 24.6 degrees N, 73.35 degrees E, 580m above surface level (asl)) situated in southern Rajasthan part as well as over other two Great Indian Thar desert locations i.e., Jaisalmer (JSM, 26.90 degrees N, 69.90 degrees E, 220m asl)) and Bikaner (BKN, 28.03 degrees N, 73.30 degrees E, 224m asl) located in the vicinity of the Thar desert region situated in Rajasthan state of the western Indian region. The source of the present study would be collection of longer period of monthly values of the above parameters of spanning 35 years i.e., 1980 to 2015. Such types of atmospheric aerosols-cloud monsoon interaction investigation is helpful in view of understanding their direct and indirect aerosols active role of optical absorption and scattering of solar light radiation at useful wavelength 550nm as well as heating of clouds over least explored region, i.e., the Thar desert region and also away from less dust dominated influenced provinces for longer period. The analysis of the above the result would also give a clear scientific evidence of alteration in enhancement in DSC at 550nm and DEC at 550nm and BC SC at 550nm variables with simultaneous corresponding reduction in the five yearly mean precipitation activity parameters such as TRF and TNRD. It is quite evident that anthropogenic BC aerosols activity are showing the significant increasing trend at all three locations, but it is more prominent over central Thar Desert influenced regime, i.e., JSM and BKN relative to semi-urban region i.e., UDP. The systematic increasing pattern of average monthly mean value of DSC at 550nm and DEC at 550nm or increasing aerosol loading have been revealed from acquiring their lowest value in January month and the highest values in July and retained with the broad peak values in pre-monsoon months. Subsequently, their respective values reduce sharply downward from August to December onwards. The mountain value of dust aerosols parameters, i.e., DSC at 550nm and DEC at 550nm are systematically enhanced toward from UDP to BKN and then maximized at JSM. It is clearly obvious fact that the following ascending order of desert aerosols loading influenced activity in different areas has been recorded, i.e., JSM> BKN>UDP.Several other interesting features of the earth-climate change implication in reference to the altering nature of reduction of precipitation parameter pattern with simultaneous observed elevated dust aerosol and BC aerosol loading have been also noticed in the course of present investigation. Overall reduction in rainfall pattern effect with increasing of dust aerosols loading or vice versa are seen more pronounced over JSM and lees prevalence over UDP. The more detailed investigations about other interesting results of Aerosols-Indian monsoon over western Indian locations are also discussed thoroughly in this paper.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers the results of complex glaciological and hydro meteorological observations in the basin of Chon Kyzyl Suu river for the period of 2013-2017; the analysis of flow formation from the Kara Batkak glacier was carried out. The main and minor factors of ice and snow ablation of Kara Batkak glacier are shown. The analysis of the main climatic parameters (air temperature and precipitation), which are changing in concordance with global warming, has been carried out. In the last 70 years the area of the Kara Batkak glacier has decreased by 21.8%, showing a pronounced trend of diminishing the area of this glacier, which is a consequence of global warming. It is established that the trend of increasing ablation over the entire observation period on the Kara Batkak glacier is associated with an increase in air temperatures over the last few decades.There is a good synchronization of annual trends of rise in air temperature at the three meteo stations for the period from 1961 to 2015 with a maximum of 7.0 degrees C at Kara-Batkak. This suggests that the same trend happens in all the regions of Teskey Ala Too, which in recent years, increase the trend of daily melting of ice. The mass balance in these basins over 60 years is negative due to rise in temperature and add to river runoff due to degradation and the reduction in the area of its glaciation confirmed the water-ice balance of mountain-glacial basins of the "continental" type glaciers. The close connection between the changes in climatic parameters, state of glaciations and glacial runoff in these river basin were established in this study.

AB  - The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) was launched on January 24, 2006, by a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) H-IIA launcher. It carries three remote sensing sensors: the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2), the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM), and the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR).Within the framework of ALOS Data European Node (ADEN), as part of the European Space Agency (ESA), has collected 5 years of data observed in Arctic, in Europe and in Africa through the ground stations of Tromsoe (Norway) and Matera (Italy).Some data has been repatriated directly from JAXA from the on-board recorder (in particular over Africa, outside the visibility of the stations). The data were available to the scientific users via on-request ordering from the stations through the ESA ordering system. In ordering to provide a better and easier access to the data in the framework of the ESA Third Party Missions, in 2015 ESA started a project aimed to repatriate the data from the stations, consolidate them, harmonise the format to the ESA standards.For the PALSAR data, view the different processing levels available to the users, ESA decided to setup a dissemination system, able to process automatically at the user demand the data to the requested level (on-the-fly processing). For the optical data, instead, the decision was to systematically process the PRISM and AVNIR-2 as orthorectified products (so to a higher level in respect of what available before) with a systematic quality control.This paper presents the functionalities of the new Level 1 orthorectified products and details the block adjustment algorithms used for refinement of geometric accuracy. A specific quality control strategy has been laid down in order to re analyse the entire archive. Also, validation methods are explained and the final product accuracy specification are given.http://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/remote-sensing

AB  - This study investigated the influences of urban growth changes and extreme climate events on land surface temperature in relationship with several biophysical variables in Bucharest metropolitan area of Romania through satellite and in-situ monitoring data. Remote sensing data from Landsat TM/ETM/OLI and time series MODIS Terra/Aqua and NOAA AVHRR sensors have been used to assess urban land cover-temperature interactions over 2000 - 2017 period. Time series Thermal InfraRed (TIR) satellite remote sensing data in synergy with meteorological data (air temperature-Ta, precipitations, wind, solar radiation, etc.) have been applied mainly for analyzing land surface temperature (LST) patterns and its relationship with surface landscape characteristics, assessing urban heat island (UHI), and relating urban land cover temperatures (LSTs). Based on these parameters, the urban size dynamics, urban heat island effect (UHI) and the relationships of LST to other biophysical and meteorological parameters (surface albedo, precipitations, wind intensity and direction, air temperature) have been analyzed. Results show that in the metropolitan area ratio of impervious surface in Bucharest increased significantly during investigated period, the intensity of urban heat island and heat wave events being most significant. The correlation analyses revealed that, at the pixel-scale, LST and Ta possessed a strong positive correlation with percent impervious surfaces and negative correlation with vegetation abundances at metropolitan scale respectively. The NDVI was significantly correlated with precipitation. The spatial average air temperatures in urban test areas rise with the expansion of the urban size.

AB  - Drivers of global climate change and the increased frequency of extreme climate events may affect urban and periurban forest ecosystems more rapidly than natural forest ecosystems. Multi stressors of urban forest ecosystems include alterations in forest soils and to the diversity and composition of forest ecosystem, as well as higher temperatures during heat waves periods and increasing carbon dioxide content due to high traffic issue. Global conservation targets and management practices of urban forest ecosystems in Romania requires adequate novel monitoring methodology for monitoring the dynamics changing status. Ground-based measurements are valuable tools with limited spatial footprints. Multispectral and multitemporal satellite remote sensing data allow detailed information on forest structure and can deliver ecologically relevant, long-term datasets suitable of vegetation phenology for analyzing changes in periurban and urban forest ecosystem areas, structure and function at temporal and spatial scales relevant to forest dynamics monitoring. The aim of this paper was to evaluate and characterize forest changes for selected test area Cernica -Branesti in Ilfov county located in the Eastern part of Bucharest metropolitan region, Romania, where the climate and anthropogenic stressors endanger natural and economical values of forest environment. Based on time-series Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, 8 OLI/TIRS, MODIS Terra/Aqua and Sentinel 2A satellite data have been investigated urban forest land cover and forest biophysical parameters (LST, NDVI/EVI and LAI) changes over 2000-2016 period of time. Accuracy of image processing results (spectral classification) was confirmed through in-situ spectroradiometrical analysis of reflectance spectra with portable GER 2600 spectroradiometer.

AB  - The article is about one of the insufficiently explored aspects of russian-armenian cultural and literary connections - the armenological work of the russian writer S.N. Glinka.S.N. Glinka was one of the prominent representatives of the conservative-nationalist trend. The admiration for republican ideals, the hatred of slavery, despotism with the idea of the inviolability of the existing world order, and sincere devotion to the autocracy were peacefully coexisting in his ideology. These features of S.N. Glinka's worldview appeared in his works on armenian history.In S.N. Glinka's works on armenian subjects a great attention was paid to the armenian nation's contribution to the world history and culture, the fight for freedom and independence of their homeland. Armenian history was first considered from the inception of the armenian statehood to becoming an Armenian region a part of Russia in Glinka's works. They detail the history of russian-armenian links, issue of the emerging of the russian orientation of the armenian liberation movement. He was one of the first in the russian prerevolutionary historiography to give a high assessment and stress the historical significance of the entry of Eastern Armenia into Russia.Essentially he discovered Armenia, its history and culture for the russian reading public of that period, contributed the formation of the scientific foundations of the russian school of armenology and was the first representative of this school.The article attempts to historiographical analysis of the problem "S.N. Glinka-historian of the armenian people" on the basis of a wide range of publications of pre-revolutionary, soviet and modern periods. According to a number of authors, including S.G. Areshyan, E. A. Hakobyan, works on the history of the Armenian people. Glinka were the best of all his works of historical subjects.

AB  - Agricultural statistics are considered one of the most important topics in the developed countries now. In addition to the irrigation systems used, they relate to the quality and quantity of production and the consequent export and import of agricultural crops in order to achieve food security for the country. Therefore, the present traditional methods used in the collection of statistical data are not sufficient to cover the vast areas of cultivated strategic crops and to determine the effects therein. This is due to many factors, the most important of which is climatic changes. Hence the importance of the application of remote sensing techniques for image and data in the survey, agricultural statistics and monitoring of the quality and quantity of production using the latest satellite images available free from the owner of artificial satellite Sentinel2 which has spatial resolution of 10m instead of 30m available in artificial satellite Landsat8. Research results showed that the temperature can be controlled using modern techniques used in irrigation, which improves the atmosphere and thus contribute to providing a suitable environment for the wheat crop, which helps to increase the amount of production these have been clearly monitored using applicable indicators derived from satellite imageries data.

AB  - In this paper, the full focused processing in the frequency domain for high Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) radar altimeter science data is proposed. Considering a radar altimeter as a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument operating in near nadir-looking geometry, a SAR frequency-domain focusing algorithm, namely Range-Doppler algorithm, is analyzed. Then a properly modified processor for radar altimeters is described and implemented. Simulation set-up using parameters from two missions (CryoSat and Sentinel-6) and a preliminary result from in-orbit CryoSat data con firm the effectiveness of the full focused processing in the frequency domain. The proposed approach, compared to the one formerly proposed in literature [1], is less complex and morecomputationally efficient.

TI  - Accelerated Christian Education: a case study of the use of race in voucher-funded private Christian schools
T2  - JOURNAL OF CURRICULUM STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - President Donald Trump has promised an expansion of voucher programs for private schools in the United States. Private Christian schools are likely beneficiaries of such an expansion, but little research has been conducted about the curricula they use or their suitability for public funds. This article describes and critiques the depiction of race in Accelerated Christian Education, a curriculum used in some voucher-funded schools in the United States, as well as in private schools in 140 countries. It employs content analysis and qualitative documentary analysis of the curriculum workbooks, and builds on Christian Smith and Michael Emerson's theoretical framework of white evangelicals' cultural toolkit' to explain the ideas about race in the curriculum. The paper finds that in addition to some overt racism, the system promulgates a worldview which does not have the capacity to recognize or oppose systemic injustice. It is argued that such a curriculum is not a suitable recipient of federal funding.

TI  - An initial validation of Landsat 5 and 7 derived surface water temperature for US lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Control Act of 2014 identified the need for forecasting and monitoring harmful algal blooms (HAB) in lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries across the nation. Temperature is a driver in HAB forecasting models that affects both HAB growth rates and toxin production. Therefore, temperature data derived from the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus thermal band products were validated across 35 lakes and reservoirs, and 24 estuaries. In situ data from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) were used for validation. The WQP serves data collected by state, federal, and tribal groups. Discrete in situ temperature data included measurements at 11,910 U.S. lakes and reservoirs from 1980 through 2015. Landsat temperature measurements could include 170,240 lakes and reservoirs once an operational product is achieved. The Landsat-derived temperature mean absolute error was 1.34 degrees C in lake pixels > 180 m from land, 4.89 degrees C at the land-water boundary, and 1.11 degrees C in estuaries based on comparison against discrete surface in situ measurements. This is the first study to quantify Landsat resolvable U.S. lakes and reservoirs, and large-scale validation of an operational satellite provisional temperature climate data record algorithm. Due to the high performance of open water pixels, Landsat satellite data may supplement traditional in situ sampling by providing data for most U.S. lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries over consistent seasonal intervals (even with cloud cover) for an extended period of record of more than 35 years.

TI  - Burden of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other respiratory viruses and the completeness of respiratory viral identification among respiratory inpatients, Canada, 2003-2014
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundA regression-based study design has commonly been used to estimate the influenza burden; however, these estimates are not timely and many countries lack sufficient virological data. Alternative approaches that would permit a timelier assessment of the burden, including a sentinel surveillance approach recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), have been proposed. We aimed to estimate the hospitalization burden attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other respiratory viruses (ORV) and to assess both the completeness of viral identification among respiratory inpatients in Canada and the implications of adopting other approaches.MethodsRespiratory inpatient records were extracted from the Canadian Discharge Abstract Database from 2003 to 2014. A regression model was used to estimate excess respiratory hospitalizations attributable to influenza, RSV, and ORV by age group and diagnostic category and compare these estimates with the number with a respiratory viral identification.ResultsAn estimated 33 (95% CI: 29, 38), 27 (95% CI: 22, 33), and 27 (95% CI: 18, 36) hospitalizations per 100000 population per year were attributed to influenza, RSV, and ORV, respectively. An influenza virus was identified in an estimated 78% (95% CI: 75, 81) and 17% (95% CI: 15, 21) of respiratory hospitalizations attributed to influenza for children and adults, respectively, and 75% of influenza-attributed hospitalizations had an ARI diagnosis.ConclusionsHospitalization rates with respiratory viral identification still underestimate the burden. Approaches based on acute respiratory case definitions will likely underestimate the burden as well, although each proposed method should be compared with regression-based estimates of influenza-attributed burden as a way of assessing their validity.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF SEASONAL SEA ICE TYPE AND ROUGHNESS REGIME DISCRIMINATION USING A UNIQUE C- AND L-BAND SAR DATABASE

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - To date some studies have outlined the benefits of low-frequency L-band synthetic aperture radar, compared to Cband and higher frequencies, for discriminating Arctic sea ice types during melting conditions. This is due to the higher penetration depth of L-band energy through wet snow and ice, yielding radar backscatter information more closely related to internal ice structure variations. In this study we utilize a database of seasonally varying C-and L-band SAR radar backscatter coefficients and polarimetric parameters from RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and field measured variables including airborne measured ice thickness and roughness, to detail first-year and multiyear sea ice type discrimination capabilities during sub-stages within the seasonal melting period. Included in the evaluation is sea ice information for twenty C-band compact polarimetry (CP) parameters, in anticipation of the launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). CP parameters were simulated from the fully polarimetric data collected from RADARSAT-2.

TI  - Modelling and correcting azimuthal anisotropy in Sentinel-1 backscatter data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 backscatter data - acquired in dual-polarized (VV/VH) Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode - show an azimuth angle dependency. The orientation of the tangential plane of the surface observed can alter the backscatter differently depending on the azimuth angle of the viewing geometry. In this study, two years of Sentinel-1 backscatter data over Western Europe have been investigated to show that the azimuthal anisotropy of backscatter is mainly caused by the orientation of the topography's slope. The SRTM-3 digital elevation model (DEM) is used to describe the azimuthal anisotropy in the Tyrolean Alps and in addition, an algorithm is presented to take into account the azimuthal dependency by calculating correction parameters for each relative orbit of Sentinel-1.

T2  - Studies in British and American Language and Literature
T2  - 영미어문학
M3  - research-article
AB  - A critical examination of literature from an Anglo-Saxon tradition reveals common themes, whereby protagonists who resist a dominant pressure, whether it be physical or social, receive death or destruction. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of this Anglocentric worldview on slave literature of 18th century England. Research reveals that this literature depicts a need for hegemonic social institutions to recognize the humanity of slaves, promoting benevolence and charity according to the teachings of Christ. While slave narratives reveal an additional, yet subtle, protest against the evils of slavery, these works ultimately reflect a bias designed to target English readers. Although the use of music and dance by slaves is not often used within literature of the period, it has become embedded within later African-American compositions, revealing an individualistic means to escape hardship, share feelings of injustice, and promote a sense of freedom.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study evaluated the adequacy of the One-Source Energy Balance (OSEB) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) models to estimate evapotranspiration in grain growing areas with humid subtropical climate in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The dataset was obtained from a micrometeorological station (Eddy Covariance) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products during 84 observation days between 2009 and 2011. The OSEB and SEBAL models were used to estimate the partition of net radiation (Rn) into the components latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), and ground heat flux (G) estimated from the MODIS images while the experimental data measured in situ were used to compare the results. Analyses indicated that the Energy Balance (EB) components were estimated from the MODIS images satisfactorily despite the spatial resolution limitations. Furthermore, the SEBAL model estimated the EB components satisfactorily only for summer crops. There are uncertainties associated with determining the hot and cold pixels due to the region humid subtropical climate and the spatial resolution of the sensor used in the other periods. The OSEB model has the lowest errors and the most adequate partitioning of the EB components throughout the year, and therefore, it is the most suitable for the climatic conditions of Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - Monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics is important for flood management and the characterisation of hydrological connectivity. SAR-based inundation extent monitoring in wetlands is often challenging due to different factors, such as waves, vegetation cover and wet snow. The presented study targets the mapping of inundation dynamics in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North Dakota, USA. A 3-year water extent time series was derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data by first delineating permanent water bodies using a clustering approach. In a second step, water body dynamics were mapped using region growing and automatic thresholding. Results suggest that there is considerable potential for mapping surface water dynamics in late spring, summer and autumn, whereas confusion with wet snow may take place in early spring.

The objective of this work is to map the main surface covers within ice-free areas of King George Island, the largest island of the South Shetlands archipelago, using fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR data.Surface covers such as rock outcrops and glacial till, stone fields, patterned ground, and sand and gravel deposits form the most representative classes and account for 84 km 2 of the ice-free areas on the island. A distribution of complex geomorphological features and landforms was obtained, being some of them considered indicators of periglacial processes and presence of permafrost.

The use of visible near infrared reflectance is an ideal tool for characterizing and monitoring surface covers and substrates. The objective of this work was to use reflectance spectroscopy to identify spectral characteristics of surface covers related to different volcanic deposits in ice-free areas of Deception Island, South-Shetland Islands. A site specific spectral library containing 220 reference spectra was compiled. Image-derived spectra from multispectral satellite data were easily labeled using the reference spectra. A preliminary distribution has distinguished five different deposit types over the entire area of Deception Island.

T2  - FRONTIERS OF LITERARY STUDIES IN CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the biography, thought, and works of Li Ruqian (1852-1909). He was appointed Consul in Kobe 1882-84, during which period he studied the political institutions and culture of Meiji Japan and the West, eventually translating Washington Irving's biography of George Washington into Classical Chinese, a book which exercised a great influence on late Qing reformers. Li's literary theory strongly emphasized the importance of originality. He also cultivated a style that was simpler and closer to spoken Chinese than many of his contemporaries. He eventually espoused a thoroughgoing reform of Chinese government and society. He abandoned the idea of the centrality of Chinese culture for a worldview of cultural relativity in which all cultures of the world are viewed as equally valid. After his return to China Li became even more involved in reform activities, but soon he became almost totally alienated from Chinese society and even began expressing strong doubts about the whole tradition of classical writing. In his poems and prose works, he warned Chinese intellectuals to abandon their smug conservatism and adapt to the new world or perish, making fun of his own society in biting satirical pieces that remind one of the writings of Lu Xun's May Fourth era. Li Ruqian may, indeed, be the first Chinese author to develop the idea of Chinese inadequacy and guilt which is so common in the literature of the next century.

AB  - While deep learning techniques have an increasing impact on many technical fields, gathering sufficient amounts of training data is a challenging problem in remote sensing. In particular, this holds for applications involving data from multiple sensors with heterogeneous characteristics. One example for that is the fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and optical imagery. With this paper, we publish the SEN1-2 dataset to foster deep learning research in SAR-optical data fusion. SEN1-2 comprises 282;384 pairs of corresponding image patches, collected from across the globe and throughout all meteorological seasons. Besides a detailed description of the dataset, we show exemplary results for several possible applications, such as SAR image colorization, SAR-optical image matching, and creation of artificial optical images from SAR input data. Since SEN1-2 is the first large open dataset of this kind, we believe it will support further developments in the field of deep learning for remote sensing as well as multi-sensor data fusion.

TI  - Beyond Dimension-Reduction: Exploratory Factor Analysis for First Indications of Temporal Attitude Shifts
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH METHODOLOGY FOR BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES (ECRM 2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies (ECRM)
CL  - Univ Roma TRE, Rome, ITALY
AB  - Greatly increased user-friendliness of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) suggests we re-visit the value of exploratory factor analyses (EFA), as EFA used to be far easier than CFA and was thus oft-used even for 'instrumentation with dimensionality well-published.' This paper focuses on the pedagogical value of illustrating EFA's usefulness, even where replications of prominently-published measurement studies are concerned - - e.g., applying EFA to questionnaire responses where mind-sets are likely to be changing across time. Such cultural-temporal changes, for example, partially-motivated the development of the Modern (vs. Traditional) Racism Scale (MRS, see McConahay, 1983; Morrison & Kiss, 2017). But the pedagogical value of engaging with EFA in contexts of cultural time-shifts or temporal-perturbations may, with greater contemporary prevalence, be demonstrated in methods classrooms, by consideration of temporal effects on the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale, a measure of eco-orientation (Dunlap, Van hiere, Mertig and Jones, 2000). It can be represented as measuring five "facets of an ecological worldview: the reality of limits to growth, anti-anthropocentrism, the fragility of nature's balance, rejection of exemptionalism, and the possibility of an ecocrisis" (Dunlap, 2000, p. 432). They had a reasonably large sample (N1 = 667) and some analyses derived from a reasonable degree of unidimensionality around a pro-nature stance. But our own sample, also moderately large (N2 = 408) sees a decade-plus shift in its dimensionality, specifically one far less likely to have emerged via a CFA using this instrument's proposed five facets or its potential unidimensionality. Our sample's Scree, Bartlett (p<.001) and KMO (.883) indicated suitability for EFA, and yielded clear indications that Dunlap's scale is multidimensional (....despite our unidimensional item-to-total relations, alongside Dunlap's, producing column vectors correlated at .706, k = 15 questions, between the N1 = 667 and N2 = 408 samples). Via our EFA, seen here is a potentially dangerous 'technology-salvation' or eco-delusional factor (e.g., Dunlap's item: "Human ingenuity will insure that we do NOT make Earth un-livable."). Argued here is that methods classrooms can benefit from seeing how EFA can highlight potential temporal shifts (e.g., developed nations sensing future dominance of zero-emission vehicles, coal alternatives, cloud-whitening, etc.).

AB  - Image co-registration is an early step in SAR image processing. The quality of the image resampling affects the rest of the processing chain. Various interpolation methods exist, among them the kriging approach that requires the estimation of the spatial variation of the image called variogram. We propose to enhance the estimation of the variogram, especially at small shift values, by introducing the multi-temporal variogram which exploits the temporal series and we apply it to Sentinel-1 acquisitions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the recent report of the Commission on Religious Education on "Religion and Worldviews". While it praises the report for its honest critical evaluation of the current situation of Religious Education in England as well as for the effort of improving this situation by suggesting far-reaching amendments at a systemic level, the article also raises a number of critical questions. These questions refer to the relationship between state and religion, to problems arising from the ill-defined term 'world-view', to unresolved problems concerning teacher education in the area of worldviews as well as to the lack of attention to research on Religious Education in the report. Altogether it does not appear necessary to give up the subject of Religious Education in order to improve the situation and not enough good reasons have been presented for switching to a new subject which, in other countries, has in fact created many new problems.

T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING X
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring X
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - Direct numerically simulated data can serve as a proxy for understanding many issues concerning multidimensional remotely sensed data. As a step towards performing operational Bayesian belief network modeling for rivers, which is of practical utility to naval intelligence, direct numerically simulated sediment-laden oscillatory flow is used to estimate statistical surface layer spatial eddy scales. This is done using spatial realizations of the sediment concentration, vertical velocity, and pressure fields along with feature extraction algorithms which utilize self-organizing mapping, independent component analysis, and two-dimensional omnidirectional Morlet wavelet analysis. Stress versus scale distributions exhibit distinct phase modulation over the three ambient forcing phases of maximum negative velocity, zero velocity, and maximum positive velocity. The stress versus sediment concentration scale distribution, which is of great pertinence to riverine remote sensing, exhibits a significant amount of large eddy scales suggesting coherent large-scale sediment structure formation possibly due to particle interstitial forces. The estimated statistical results can serve as feature parameters for naive Bayesian belief network prediction of bottom boundary layer stress from surface eddy scale observations.

TI  - Iliac Lymphadenectomy following Intrauterine Mapping in a Female Dog with Breast Neoplasm
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The lymphatic system plays an important role in the local control of neoplasms as well as in the transportation of tumor cells, which represents the most common pathway of metastasis. From the tumorigenesis, there is a remarkable enlargement of the tumor drainage network towards the regional and target lymph nodes. Since the mammary lymphatic system of animals with neoplasms as well as the demarcation of the pelvic and abdominal caudal chain are poorly studied, the aim of the present study is to report a case of iliac lymphadenectomy after intrauterine lymphatic dyeing in a dog with breast neoplasm, which allowed the identification of metastasis in the medial iliac lymph node.Case: A 7-year-old, 13.4 kg, non neutered, mixed breed, female dog was diagnosed with ulcerative neoplasm in the left caudal abdominal breast, which presented evolution of approximately 90 days, presenting ulceration for 10 days, according to the tutor. After a clinical evaluation, thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography were requested, which did not present metastasis suggestive images. Therefore, left unilateral total mastectomy was indicated. Retro-umbilical celiotomy was performed for the administration of 0.5 mL of 1% intrauterine methylene blue (body of the uterus), which allowed lymphatic mapping and medial iliac lymphadenectomy. Subsequently, ovariohysterectomy was performed and after celiorrhaphy, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed, followed by left unilateral mastectomy and concomitant removal of the superficial inguinal lymph node. The patient had a prompt recovery and was discharged from hospital in six hours postoperatively. The excised material was referred for histopathological examination, which revealed the presence of metastasis of simple tubulopapillary carcinoma of the mammary gland in the left medial and superficial inguinal lymph nodes, while the axillary lymph node had no metastases. At the end of 10 days, the patient was clinically stable, with good healing of the surgical wound. After a 120-day postoperative period, the patient had a good clinical status, with no respiratory alterations, and there was no evidence of metastasis on the chest X-ray as well as abdominal ultrasound.Discussion: Considering the great occurrence of breast neoplasms, it is important to develop studies on new approaches in the therapeutic management of this condition and sharing of reports as described. The objective of the lymphadenectomy was to evaluate the possible involvement of regional lymph nodes, since, according to the condition of the lymph nodes in the histopathological examination, it appears as an important prognostic factor, seeing that the survival time is less than two years for 85.7% in dogs with regional lymph node metastases. In animals, there are no studies based on the therapeutic alternative of lymphadenectomy, which is believed to be palliative in the reported patient, due to the fact that it is a tubulopapillary carcinoma with different foci of lymph node metastases. Otherwise, lymphadenectomy enabled a better definition of the prognosis and proved to be an important tool for staging. The use of methylene blue was chosen because it was reportedly used in dogs, with excellent results in sentinel lymph nodes mapping, and due to its ease of obtaining and low cost of application. It is concluded that in canines with breast neoplasms, it is important to perform lymphatic mapping to identify possible metastases in cellular tissues and to delimit regional lymph vessels and lymph nodes, thus facilitating the surgical removal of these structures with safety margins. In addition, it is important to perform lymphadenectomy even to lymph nodes that are not infarcted or present macroscopic changes, given that in this case, it already existed metastasis, even in a lymph node of 4 mm.

TI  - DEM orientation based on local feature correspondence with global DEMs
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs), which are provided by vendors to end users, digital elevation models (DEMs) can be simply derived from satellite stereo images. However, DEMs are influenced by systematic errors in the rational function model (RFM), known as RPC biases. Global DEMs (GDEMs), such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which is the most inexpensive solution, can be applied to improve the accuracy of the relative RFM-derived DEMs. In this article, an automatic and robust local feature-based DEM matching and orientation approach is proposed in order to improve the accuracy of the relative RFM-derived DEMs without the use of ground control points (GCPs). The proposed approach consists of four main steps: (1) combined local feature extraction; (2) computation of the distinctive order-based self-similarity (DOBSS) descriptor; (3) a feature correspondence and local consistency checking process; and (4) a relative RFM-derived DEM orientation process using three-dimensional (3D) transformation models, including 3D rigid, 3D similarity and 3D affine transformations. This technique can avoid the sensitivity of conventional 3D DEM matching methods to initial values, monotonous areas and local distortions. Experimental results on two CARTOSAT-1 derived DEMs demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DEM matching method over state-of-the-art methods, including SIFT, DAISY, LIOP, LBP, and BRISK descriptors, in terms of the number of correct matches (NCM) and DEM orientation accuracy. The results also show that the proposed method is able to significantly improve the geometric accuracy of the relative RFM-derived DEMs.

TI  - Role of perioperative dynamic sentinel node biopsy for cN0 penile cancer management: experience from an Italian tertiary referral center
T2  - TUMORI JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Inguinal lymphadenectomy (iLAD) reduces mortality in patients with cN0 penile cancer but yields high complication rates. Thus, its prophylactic role has been questioned and dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) was introduced to select men who should undergo the procedure. Our aim was to investigate the accuracy of a contemporary DSNB cohort.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of >= T1 or >= G2 cN0 penile cancer undergoing perioperative DSNB from June 2009 to June 2015 at a tertiary referral center. We excluded men with <18 months follow-up or with local recurrence after primary curative treatment. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.Results: Thirty-five men underwent DSNB; 85.71% had <= T2 penile cancer with <= G2a histology. Per groin detection rate was 80% (scintigraphy being positive bilaterally in 60% and unilaterally in 20.0%). In no cases did DSNB prolong the postoperative course compared to primary surgery. Nine men (n = 15/109 nodes removed) had positive results, 8 of whom underwent iLAD. Among negative DSNB patients, 2 developed nodal penile cancer recurrence; none of them had node biopsy due to inconclusive scintigraphy. At a median follow-up of 42 months (interquartile range 3078 months), if considering only men with scintigraphy detected inguinal nodes, per-patient sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 80% whereas positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 25% and 92.3%, respectively.Conclusions: Perioperative DSNB is a safe procedure, yielding promising results when performed at a tertiary referral center. Future prospective large studies are needed to investigate how to optimize detection rate and reduce false-negative rates.

AB  - The aim of the project was to evaluate the possibility of using spectral indices in the monitoring of the green in part of the Pardubice region, namely municipality with extended powers Pardubice. Five Landsat datasets were selected in the time period from 1987 to 2013. The processed data comes from Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites. Next three scenes were taken from the Terra satellite MODIS scanner. Images were selected in such a way that the acquisition dates were approximately the same. Four vegetation indices were compared: ratio index NDVI, SAVI and MSAVI distance indexes, and orthogonal index GVI. A temporal analysis was carried out for these indices between 1987 and 2013. An unsupervised classification was performed to better interpret the images. Data were classified by ISODATA algorithm into fifteen classes, which were then aggregated into three classes. A majority filter was used for smoothening the classified results. NDVI and SAVI values show almost identical results in the area of interest and there were no significant differences after the classification. MSAVI versus NDVI and SAVI index is less sensitive to capture of concrete surfaces. The water areas were classified correctly. The GVI vegetation index differs considerably from NDVI, SAVI and MSAVI indices. After classification, GVI ranked green areas similarly to other indices. However, agricultural land was largely included in the class of water areas. Therefore, GVI is inappropriate to analyse the green of areas of interest. The best results are provided by the classified MSAVI. The minimum of concrete surfaces were assigned into the class of water bodies. At the end of the work, the detection of green changes was calculated. Changes between 1987 and 2013 were most evident in the southern part of the area. The highest changes in vegetation identified GVI index.

TI  - Novel fusion approach on automatic object extraction from spatial data: case study Worldview-2 and TOPO5000
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic extraction of information content from remotely sensed data is always challenging. We suggest a novel fusion approach to improve the extraction of this information from mono-satellite images. A Worldview-2 (WV-2) pan-sharpened image and a 1/5000-scaled topographic vector map (TOPO5000) were used as the sample data. Firstly, the buildings and roads were manually extracted from WV-2 to point out the maximum extractable information content. Subsequently, object-based automatic extractions were performed. After achieving two-dimensional results, a normalized digital surface model (nDSM) was generated from the underlying digital aerial photos of TOPO5000, and the automatic extraction was repeated by fusion with the nDSM to include individual object heights as an additional band for classification. The contribution was tested by precision, completeness and overall quality. Novel fusion technique increased the success of automatic extraction by 7% for the number of buildings and by 23% for the length of roads.

TI  - Calculating the End: Inner-Danielic Chronological Developments
T2  - VETUS TESTAMENTUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of the end of the period of persecution is a pervasive topic throughout Daniel 7-12. The references to these events are spread out throughout the four apocalypses found in the second half of Daniel (7:25; 8:13-14; 9:27; 12:7,11-12), and their presence in all of these contexts emphasizes the importance of chronological aspects within the apocalyptic worldview of the authors of Daniel. The current study offers an original interpretation of the earliest of these sources (7:25), reflecting its apocalyptic context, and consequently a new assessment of the interrelationships of the various dates in the Danielic apocalypses. Furthermore, it will be suggested that a combination of interpretive, calendrical and historical insights regarding these chronological elements perhaps offers a key towards tracing the process of literary development of the apocalyptic section of Daniel as a whole.

TI  - The Modern State, the Question of Genocide, and Holocaust Scholarship
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This review article asks: what defines mass violence in the twentieth century as particularly modern and how does the Holocaust figure in this history? The article compares the work of two path-breaking historians-Mark Levene and Timothy Snyder-while also discussing recent research by other scholars. It argues that the emergence of nation-states, together with technology and scientific knowledge to alter the environment, created the conditions for distinctly modern violence aiming to destroy diversity in societies and the environment. The article examines the relation between genocide, including the Holocaust, and the rise of twentieth-century nation-states. It follows the persistent idea that the Holocaust is unique in a way that establishes a hierarchy of Holocaust/genocide/other mass violence. As Levene argues, the contextualization of the complex set of events and processes called the Holocaust within the violent history of ethno-national and ethno-religious "homogenization" of nation-states challenges this framework. The article then turns to Snyder's argument that, since Hitler's worldview of racial struggle over land and food rejected agricultural science, genetic engineering in agriculture is one way to heed the Holocaust's warning. A discussion of the devastating impact of genetic engineering in agriculture-in the frame of the violent implications of modern "development"- underscores how the destruction of societies perceived as "backward," particularly indigenous groups in the Global South, follows the destruction of their biodiverse habitats and agriculture to make way for monoculture genetically engineered crops. A focus on case studies of such mass violence and the responses by indigenous groups facilitates, finally, a discussion of the recent turn to microhistories in Holocaust scholarship. These offer another contextualized view: of the societies that faced the assault of nationstates. The article concludes that the complexities on the social level, each rooted in specific circumstances and histories, challenge the analytical value of the general term "Holocaust."

AB  - The relationship between language and identity, language and thought, is so apparent that it makes written or oral discourse a hermetically sealed entity, at least on a theoretical level. Idiomatic and proverbial expressions are full of cultural elements that make communication essentially monolingual. It would seem that idioms shape our worldview and summarize a distinct and particular experience of a linguistic community. They are cultural and structural metaphors in constant mobility from one language to another, but do not necessarily keep the same references and connotations. Therefore, to what extent do two or more linguistic communities share the same vision of the world through fixed, idiomatic, and proverbial expressions? What are the measures adopted for translation so that these expressions may be correctly transmitted from one language to another and from one culture to the other? Our approach is to study a number of idiomatic expressions through an exploration of their origins and their infiltration into different cultures over time.

TI  - Rotavirus strain diversity in Eastern and Southern African countries before and after vaccine introduction.
T2  - Vaccine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The African Rotavirus Surveillance Network has been detecting and documenting rotavirus genotypes in the African sub-continent since 1998 in anticipation of the rollout of rotavirus vaccination in routine Expanded Programme on Immunisation. This paper reports distribution of the rotavirus strains circulating in 15 Eastern and Southern African (ESA) countries from 2010-2015 as part of active World Health Organization (WHO) rotavirus surveillance, and investigates possibility of emergence of non-vaccine or unusual strains in six selected countries post-vaccine introduction.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children <5 years of age presenting with acute gastroenteritis at sentinel hospitals pre- and post-rotavirus vaccine introduction. Samples were tested for group A rotavirus using an enzyme immunoassay by the national and sentinel laboratories. At the WHO Rotavirus Regional Reference Laboratory in South Africa, molecular characterisation was determined by PAGE (n = 4186), G and P genotyping (n = 6447) and DNA sequencing for both G and P types (n = 400).RESULTS: The six-year surveillance period demonstrated that 23.8% of the strains were G1P[8], followed by G2P[4] (11.8%), G9P[8] (10.4%), G12P[8] (4.9%), G2P[6] (4.2%) and G3P[6] (3.7%) in 15 ESA countries. There was no difference in circulating strains pre- and post-rotavirus vaccine introduction with yearly fluctuation of strains observed over time. Atypical rotavirus G and P combinations (such as G1P[4], G2P[8], G9P[4] and G12P[4]) that might have arisen through inter-genogroup or inter-genotypes reassortment were detected at low frequency (2%). Close genetic relationship of African strains were reflected on the phylogenetic analysis, strains segregated together to form an African cluster in the same lineages/sub-lineage or monophyletic branch.CONCLUSION: There has been considerable concern about strain replacement post-vaccine introduction, it was not clear at this early stage whether observed cyclical changes of rotavirus strains were due to vaccine pressure or this was just part of natural annual fluctuations in the six ESA countries, long-term surveillance is required.

AB  - Spatial phenomena like the expansion of artificial land and the decrease of agricultural land lead to significant change rates over time for the main land cover types. For European policies, comparable information on land cover change in all European countries is required. The Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) uses the nomenclature of the Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) as a basis for compiling areal statistics across the entire EUs territory. As there is presently no dataset in Germany which can be used as a stand-alone source to fulfill Eurostat's requirements, the project Cop4Stat_2015plus was initiated. The aim is to assess the feasibility of providing the needed land cover information by using remote sensing techniques and satellite data from the Copernicus program and contributing missions.In this study, a method for classification of high-resolution RapidEye time series images for the year 2015 in a study area in Germany is presented. Machine-learning algorithms in combination with topographic reference data as training and validation datasets are used for an object-based classification of artificial land, cropland, woodland, shrubland, grassland and water bodies. For a better separation between shrubland and woodland a normalized digital surface model is used. Classification results show an overall accuracy of above 95 %. The accuracies for the classes range between 76 % for shrubland and 98 % for water bodies. The information of the near infrared band, the red edge band and the height show the highest relevance for good classification results. At the edge of forests, shrublands are partly mis-classified instead of forest or cropland because the height of trees and the height of the neighboring objects are averaged and the outcome then corresponds to the height of shrubland.The results will subsequently be compared with official areal statistics and will be tested to support the provision of areal statistics for national and European purposes

AB  - This paper aims to examine the relationship of urbanization and the consequences of environmental impacts, especially the availability of forests. The analysis used remote sensing data ie Landsat 7 ETM (1990), Landsat 7 ETM (2000), and Landsat 8 OLI (2015). Analysis of forest availability used green vegetation cover parameters with NDVI techniques, while urbanization was measured by looking at the built-up area growth with NDBI techniques. The detection result in 1990 area of urban area was 74.85 km(2), in 2000 was 130.83 km(2), and in 2015 was 292.74 km(2). Given the overall size of the metropolitan area of Semarang (932.14 km(2)), the proportion of the built up area in 2015 was 31% with an average of 6% per year change in 1990-2000 and 8.2% per year in 2000-2015. Urbanization in this region is characterized by forest conversion into residential and industrial buildings. With increasing area and built-up density, NDBI is found to be proportionately increasing, while NDVI decrease is significant. The results show that NDBI-NDVI correlation is negative (-0.99). It is very important for policy makers to formulate land use control policies in Metropolitan Semarang particularly in responding to the issue of forest conversion.

AB  - Water is a key variable for the sustainability of the world. Surface water resources are of prime importance for all living creatures. Thus these resources should be monitored for proper water planning. In this study, we aimed to identify which spectral water index will represent water body better when the data of new imaging satellite, namely Sentinel-2, are used. Since these indices were originated from old Landsat missions, it is important to investigate the performances of these indices with other data resources. Catalan and Yedigoze dam reservoirs were considered as the study area. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were utilized as spectral indices. The obtained results showed that NDWI presented water body better than MNDWI when using Sentinel-2 data. As a statistical metric, the kappa values of NDWI and MNDW were obtained as 0.88 and 0.83 respectively. The results have revealed that remote sensing technology and remotely sensed images are important resources for surface water monitoring and management.

M3  - Article
AB  - In microwave or synthetic aperture radar or radar image formation, a speckle noise is generally added. This noise is available in coherent imaging systems like radar image capturing, medical image capturing, etc. De-speckling methods are used to de-speckle the available speckle noise from these speckled systems. In optical image formation, other noises are added. An un-decimated block matching 3D (BM3D) method is a state of art technique in de-speckling area. In this paper, an analysis has been done on optical or satellite images with un-decimated BM3D method. Different quality parameters are evaluated and compared for different speckle noise variances by considering the Sentinel-2 satellite sub band images as radar image.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed an atmospheric gas absorption table for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) based on the correlated k-distribution (CKD) method with an optimization method, which was used to detennine quadrature weights and abscissas. We incorporated the table and band information of the ARE into a multi-purpose atmospheric radiative transfer package, RSTAR. We updated the package so that users could easily specify the satellite and band number. Use of this update made it possible to carry out calculations rapidly and accurately using the optimized CKD method. RSTAR is easy for beginners to use and facilitates comparison of results. Cloud retrieval tests using different numbers of quadrature points showed that cloud retrievals could be significantly affected by the CKD model's accuracy.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Failure of bridges due to scour is of great concern to bridge asset owners, and is currently very difficult to predict and monitor regularly using conventional assessment methods. This paper presents evidence of how InSAR techniques can be used to monitor bridges at risk of scour, using Tadcaster Bridge, England, as a case study. Tadcaster Bridge suffered a partial collapse due to river scour on the evening of December 29th, 2015 following a period of severe rainfall and flooding. SAR scenes over the bridge from the two-year period prior to the collapse are analysed using SBAS interferometry methods, highlighting a distinct movement in the region of the bridge where the collapse occurred prior to the actual event. This precursor to failure observed in the data suggests the possible use of InSAR in structural health monitoring of bridges at risk of scour, as a means of an early warning system.

T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of analysis of colour vocabulary in the story by Boris Akunin "Sigumo" are presented. The relevance of the study is due to the importance of the category of "colour" for the human worldview and individual author's picture of the world. The paper provides a brief overview of linguistic literature devoted to the study of colour vocabulary. The author proceeds from the fact that the vocabulary with the meaning of colour in an art work reflects the originality of the colour picture of the artist's world and, therefore, is an important feature of the holistic artistic picture of the world. The novelty of the research lies in the choice of the product for analysis. The facts of using colour vocabulary in the text of the story by Boris Akunin "Sigumo" are the material for the study. Colour vocabulary is classified by lexical-grammatical feature and by the nomination object. Special attention is paid to colour lexis within the lexical-semantic group of "white" and "black colour" as the most important and most frequent in the colour pattern of the studied art work. It is argued that colour contrast is one of the dominant principles of constructing the analyzed literary text. The author concludes that B. Akunin shows that clear boundaries between black and white does not exist in the same way as there is no clear boundary between good and evil, ugliness and beauty, the Western and Eastern worlds.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present article is the extension of scientific research aimed at studying the causes of suicidal behavior in native peoples of Siberia - the Altaians, the Buryats, the Tyvins, the Yakuts, the Evens and the Evenks. We have studied religious and world outlook aspects of attitude towards life and death. We have defined the characteristics of traditional worldviews and animism, the indigenous religion of native ethnos. We have studied the funeral rites as the example of the attitude to death in traditional cultures and revealed the reasons of negative attitude to suicides. We have marked that the transition from traditional social economic society to the modern one was followed by the loss of traditional spirituality and life benchmarks. Uncertainty of religious and world views, being observed nowadays in native peoples of Siberia leads to the lower position of the main worldview orientation - the value of human life.

AB  - Peatland is important for global climate as it stores enormous amount of carbon and if degraded could yield devastating effect to atmosphere as it worsen the Earth's green house level. Given that fact, it is inevitable to start conserving peatland area. The conservation plan requires reliable and clear delineation map to differ between peatland and non peatland. Remote sensing technology is effective tool to solve this task. Its recent products such as Landsat, MODIS and ASTER GDEM are potentially capable of identifying and characterizing peatland. Employing spectral analysis make it possible to identify peatland unique features and discriminate between peat area and non - peat area. Machine Learning (ML) method was used to produce peatland map as it was able to identify class signature data with high dimensionality feature. From early assessment, ML was able to perform classification with accuracy more than 80% using solely testing and training dataset from South Sumatera province. By only using the knowledge from training data in South Sumatera, ML classified Riau, Jambi and South Sumatera itself. The result was quite promising as accuracy attained by Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were 79.95% and 78.60% for 500 meter spacing grid training data, and 73.95% and 78.10% for 750 meter spacing grid training data. The use of machine learning in remote sensing for classification despite not providing perfect result can still be a useful tool to give an insight to solve highly complex classification task.

AB  - There is an attempt to analyze the cultural codes of the city and country space within the framework of the linguistic picture of the world of the Russian people in this research. The interaction of the modern resident of the capital with the surrounding urban environment and the structure of this interaction seems to be an actual, but almost undeveloped topic, in connection with which the novel "Text", published in 2017 and describing the events of the second decade of the 21st century, was selected for analysis. Description of urban landscapes, elements of space in their relationship with the heroes of the novel reflect and interpret the realities of modern culture, creating a certain code system. Deciphering cultural codes and restoring the associated cultural contexts seems to be the most urgent task of linguoculturology. Using the method of continuous sampling, language units containing cultural codes were identified from the text, their semantics and functions were identified in the context of the novel, and their linguocultural significance in the formation of the reader's worldview and attitude to the linguistic picture of the world as a whole.

TI  - Building beyond land: An overview of coastal land reclamation in 16 global megacities
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in global population has been accompanied by rising consumption of natural resources such as clean air, water and land. Demand for land has increased significantly over the past 30 years or so, both inland and at the coast. In coastal regions, reclaiming land from the sea has often been the preferred solution towards meeting the need for more land for urban development. Seaward land reclamation entails the formation of artificial land surfaces which are constructed in such a way as to extend outwards over the sea using advanced geo-engineering techniques. The process is driven by numerous underlying factors and has manifold impacts. Although this pattern of urban development is not new, the nature, scale and magnitude of land extension has changed dramatically for a range of underlying reasons involving both 'natural' geophysical, and anthropogenic factors. The overall aim of this paper is to evaluate the changing spatial extent of seaward land expansion in 16 selected coastal megacities. Remote sensing data, spanning the time period mid-1980's to present, were obtained and used to determine the extent of spatial change due to new land construction in each of the cities. Landsat TM satellite imagery was used to calculate the percentage increase and area reclaimed since the mid-1980s. In addition, a systematic classification is proposed, based on the different geomorphic patterns that have been observed to characterize the process. Among 16 cities analyzed in this study, major land reclamation projects have been especially marked in China, most prominently in Shanghai, which has expanded its coastal area by more than 580 km(2) in the recent past.

AB  - This paper gives an implemented explanation of incorporating composite kernel methods with fuzzy based image classifiers. The work demonstrates how non linearity among the different classes of remote sensing data with uncertainty are handled with Noise classifier with entropy(fuzzy classifier) using composite kernel technique for land use/land cover maps generation. This study has incorporated the composition of two prominent kernels Spectral and Sigmoid Kernel. The performance of the classifier is evaluated in supervised mode and, the assessment of accuracy has been carried out using FERM (Fuzzy Error Matrix), SCM (Sub-pixel Confusion Uncertainty Matrix). The basic objective is to optimize the resolution parameter 'delta', regularizing parameter 'nu' and weight factor lambda for Composite Kernel based Noise clustering with entropy classifier (Composite-KNCWE) and analysis of the classified fraction images.

AB  - Identifying and reducing uncertainties in future land use projections are becoming critical in integrated assessments of the climate and social change scenarios. Here, we quantified correspondence between remotely sensed land cover and a model-derived projection of European land use to build a calibration and evaluation framework for land use projection models. For an eight-year period (2006-2013), we compared simulated land uses from a model (CRAFTY-EU), defined as agent functional types, against remotely sensed MODIS land cover. Information between two datasets and spatial complexity are calculated, which allowed the evaluation of the CRAFTY model and calibration of the model parameters. The computational cost was high. Thus more efficient searching algorithms are called for. The evaluation framework holds promise for better calibration of land use decision models to increase model usability and improve the value of future land cover projections.

AB  - Science and technology, knowledge information, and globalization forms dangerous society challenging Christian values. For the Christian educational discussion of the risk factors that threaten the Christian faith, this paper focuses on ‘relationship' in the anti-Christian trend brought about by contemporary society. On the basis of the understanding of the Trinity God, Christianity is ultimately relational religion, and relationship crisis that is prevalent in modern society is an important issue to be carefully discussed in Christian education.Contemporary ideology expands the anti-Christian worldview and gradually forms a difficult society to educate Christianity. Faith and life have been cut off, relationships in various aspects including family relations have been broken, and superficial relationships are widespread. The lack of a true relationship results in the rearrangement of the thinking frame of the Christian faith. As a task to be undertaken by Christian education in the face of today's social change, this paper emphasizes the necessity of the formation of Christian insight for social change, restoration of Christian value for relationship, and spirituality of education that can deal with the inside of contemporary people.

AB  - This study suggests a novel approach of estimating stream flow discharge using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images taken from 2015 to 2017 by European Space Agency Sentinel-1 satellite. Fifteen small to medium sized rivers in the Han River basin were selected as study area, and the SAR satellite images and flow data from water level and flow observation system operated by the Korea Institute of Hydrological Survey were used for model construction. First, we apply the histogram matching technique to 12 SAR images that have undergone various preprocessing processes for error correction to make the brightness distribution of the images the same. Then, the flow estimation model was constructed by deriving the relationship between the area of ​​the stream water body extracted using the threshold classification method and the in-situ flow data. As a result, we could construct a power function type flow estimation model at the fourteen study areas except for one station. The minimum, the mean, and the maximum coefficient of determination (R2) of the models of at fourteen study areas were 0.30, 0.80, and 0.99, respectively.

TI  - FEMINISM AS AN ETHICAL DISCOURSE OF INCLUSIVENESS
T2  - ANALELE UNIVERSITATII BUCURESTI-FILOSOFIE-ANNALS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BUCHAREST-PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article approaches the feminist discourse as an ethical discourse. The feminist discourse is interpreted as a symptom of the relationship among speech, symbolic power and worldview. Discourse situates people, while emphasizing, if not sustaining, reinforcing, or challenging power structures. The awareness of the connection between speech and action as well as the awareness concerning the power of language to emphasize inequality and marginalization should be manifest in intellectual and in more popular contexts of life, although it is not. Feminist discursive considerations continue to be disregarded as unimportant constituting an intriguing parallel to the general approach of feminist matters, interests and ideals and to women's affairs in certain carefully adorned social and more personal contexts (for instance, related to harassment, violence and rape). The feminist discourse represents the discourse of autonomy, public presence and dignity of women. However, feminism is not just a discourse, and it is not just one unitary discourse, since it prescribes a paradigm of a specific and very complex worldview (a Gestalt) and the category of women is assumed as being heterogeneous. As an ethical discourse, the feminist discourse aims to transform society. It articulates the emancipation from prescribed social roles, human rights as rights for all humans and as rights to dignity. The study is based on the theoretical perspectives opened by feminist classics such as Simone de Beauvoir and Luce Irigaray, as well as on arguments engaged by more recent authors, such as Chantal Mouffe and Mihaela Miroiu. We ground our investigation also on the findings of Pierre Bourdieu in what concerns the relation between language and power. In our (holistic) view, a relevant discussion of feminism cannot approach separately the feminist discourse, the feminist theoretical and political tenants, the feminist worldviews and potential reformation of power structures. In this way, feminism is very close to the postliberalism of Richard Rorty, although it presents specific differences from other postliberal views and liberalism. Feminism, as inclusive ethical discourse, places the accent on a more emphatic worldview where solidarity is based on care (Carol Gilligan) and not on the gratitude of being born a man. As a consequence, this worldview endorses security rights for women in society and at home, the reproduction rights for women and on the equality of opportunity for women and men.

TI  - TEC behavior over the Mexican region
T2  - ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of the Navigation Satellites the Total Electron Content (TEC) has become one of the main parameters of the ionosphere. This is the result of a continuous TEC monitoring and rather dense network of GPS receivers. For Mexican region having no ionosondes the use of TEC for ionospheric conditions studies and monitoring has a special value. To study the behaviour of TEC and for its applied aspects two types of source-files are used worldwide: IONEX (global maps) and RINEX (local data) depending on the task solved. Magnetometer and satellite data from CHAMP and DMSP were involved in the analysis. First, benefits and limitations of TEC derived from both types of files are discussed in regard to the estimation of the ionosphere state in the Mexican region. Second, using both methods the specific features of diurnal, seasonal and annual patterns in TEC behaviour over Mexico were revealed, among which are the shift of the diurnal maximum to 14 LT, dependence on solar activity, high probability of night-time enhancements, presence of annual and winter anomalies. Third, it was revealed that the positive short-lived TEC enhancements are characteristic for Mexican region. They may occur even under quiet conditions. The answer is given what part of the ionosphere is responsible for TEC change during these positive disturbances. The results for Mexico were compared to the neighboring regions and South-East zone.

AB  - The article considers the significance and role of the Orthodox Church and religion in the historical heritage of Dostoevsky in Russia in the XIX century. Particular attention is paid to understanding the specifics of the Orthodox faith in the writer's work. The indentified scientific problem reveals the writer's connection with the spiritual nature of man, with his inner moral world, which changed in different historical epochs.The article gives a detailed analysis of the interpretation of Dostoevsky's Orthodox faith, reveals the individualism of the writer, manifested in the context of the key content of the Russian religious tradition. Understanding these features of Orthodoxy in Dostoevsky's worldview will help to supplement and generalize the notion of the Orthodox Church in Russia as an important spiritual institution in the system of modern historical knowledge.The article first disclosed that one of the obvious achievements of the present period in understanding the originality of Dostoevsky's "creativity" was the interconnection of the spiritual, moral and poetic level of the writer's work, which led to the emergence of Dostoevsky's special artistic methods.The article describes a monastic tradition in the Russian Church, which is connected with the evangelical virtue reflected in Dostoevsky's work. In addition, after studying the life of the Russian clergy shown in Dostoevsky's works, one can make personal observations of practical importance for historical science.

AB  - Modern methodology in analysing the spatial distribution and functional characteristics of plankton combines methods classical for the planktology and methods used in investigation of pelagic zone by the parameters of biophysical (bioluminescent, fluorescent, etc.) fields they produce. The use of real-time information systems is one of the advantages of biophysical methods. It allows evaluation of the correlations between plankton structural features and structure of hydrophysical fields, and ultimately leads to the development of predictive pelagic ecosystem models.Data collected within five marine research cruises were used to analyze seasonal variability of the bioluminescence field of the active layer of the Black Sea. Chlorophyll a concentration variability in the surface waters was analyzed based on the remote sensing data. Correlation coefficients between bioluminescence field parameters and chlorophyll a concentration had opposite signs in different seasons owing to the seasonal changes in the taxonomic structure of the phytoplankton communities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The domestic cat (Felis catus) was used as a sentinel of exposure to polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in indoor urban environments y. Sera from 120 cats were pooled to form 30 different groups selected by age (<2 years; > 2 <= 8 years; > 8 years), sex, municipality (Bologna and Turin) and environment (indoor vs. outdoor). Test portions of 1 mL were analyzed by means of gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) for six selected indicators non-dioxin-like PCBs (Sigma 6 PCBs: congeners #28, #52, #101, #132, #153 and #180) and the results were computed in the upper-bound mode. The internal dose of PCBs attributable to the cats' alimentary lipid intake ranged from 32.4 to 1,446 ng/g (P50 165; mean 258). The Wilcoxon test revealed significantly lower PCB burden in outdoor groups than in indoor groups. Age correlated well with the heptachlorinated and most bio-accumulative congener, PCB #180, and slightly with hexachlorinated PCBs #138 and #153. Contamination attributable to house dust collected in 15 living-rooms ranged from 10.0 to 279 ng/g dry weight (P50 97.4; mean 94.4). Exposure estimates indicated a 0.6-16 ng/kg bw range of daily Sigma 6 PCB intake from a default value of 200 mg/cat of dust ingestion. The intake of PCBs due to dust ingestion fell within the same order of magnitude as that computed from a 60g daily intake of commercial dry pet foods, while inhalation accounted for 0.21-8.2ng/kg bw/day, on setting the nominal Sigma 6 PCB contamination in outdoor and indoor air at 0.37 and 15 ng/m(3), respectively. Italian indoor cats could be exposed to higher levels of Sigma 6 PCBs than the Reference Dose (RfD) of 10 ng/kg/bw/day; this supports the World Health Organization's statement that the quality of the indoor environment is a major determinant of health.

T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Statin treatment is often associated with poor adherence, which may be due to the onset of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We investigated on potential risk factors related to preventable cases of statin-induced ADRs and to the discontinuation of statin therapy.Methods: We performed a study using the database of Italian spontaneous reporting. The target population for the preventability assessment was all patients with suspected statin-induced ADRs deriving from Campania Region (a territory of Southern Italy) between 2012 and 2017. Additionally, a local sentinel surveillance site involving General Practitioners was selected to countercheck in routine clinical practice the role of ADRs for statin discontinuation.Results: In total, 34 of 655 (5.19%) regional cases were preventable and among detected risk factors 90.0% was related to healthcare professionals' practices and 10.0% to patient behaviour. In 81.4% (533/655) of cases, statin therapy was discontinued due to ADRs, mainly classified as not serious and associated with a positive prognosis. These results were also confirmed in the active sentinel site.Conclusions: Our findings suggest an inappropriate use of statins among the identified preventable cases and a potential inappropriate statin discontinuation due to ADRs. These factors may be useful for targeting interventions to improve statin adherence.

AB  - An attempt has been made to map the potential avalanche zones of Alaknanda valley of central Himalaya by employing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) using remote sensing data in GIS environment. The AHP has been found to be an effective method for mapping of the avalanche prone areas of highly undulating mountains. Further, a numerical simulation of one of the potential avalanching site has been carried out using Rapid Mass Movement Simulation (RAMMS) model was used to determine the flow dynamics of the avalanche sites. The mapping of potential avalanche zones in combination with numerical simulation can provide promising results for prediction of natural hazards occurring in glacial and peri glacial areas.

AB  - Oil spill is one of major environmental problem. The event often followed by deterioration of environmental quality, serious pollution problem and destruction of wildlife habitat in the surrounding of the coastal area. A reliable method to map and monitor the oil spill event become a crucial measure to determine the effective contingency plan. In this work, we examine the spreading and movement of the oil spill in Balikpapan Bay that was occurred on April 2018, using multi-sensor Sentinel data which are provided openly by the European Space Agency. Combination of data from Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 are used to classify the oil slick occurrence on the ocean's surface. Using both 1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique for the data from Sentinel 1B and 2) modified moisture index for optical sensor data from Sentinel 2A-2B, we confirm consistent detection of the oil slick at the observed area.

Tree height is a vegetation variable used to characterize vertical structure, including mixed vegetation structure in agroforestry. Estimation of tree heights with multispectral imagery is a relatively new application and is dependent on integrating synoptic coverage optical data with samples of height data, often from LiDAR-derived reference data. In this study, multispectral Landsat 8 data, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR height data and a log-linear regression model were used to estimate tree height for agroforestry land use in western part of Java Island, Indonesia. We generated a Canopy Height Model (CHM) directly from height-normalized LiDAR points and used as reference data in modeling the key height variable in the multispectral bands of Landsat 8. The analysis showed that red band was the best band to estimate tree height in agroforestry land use, followed by swir band. The log-linear regression algorithm of red band accurately reproduced the LiDAR-derived height training data using Landsat 8 data with overestimate 1.46 m in estimating tree height < 5 m and underestimate 7.79 m for tree height > 20 m.

AB  - Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a main criterion of soil quality and pollutant sequestration capacity. This research was carried out to evaluate cokriging prediction map of soil CEC spatial variability with the principal components derived from soil physical and chemical properties. Two hundred and forty-seven soil samples were collected that 75% of them were used for training soil CEC and 25% for testing of prediction. The first principal component (PC1) was highly correlated with soil CEC (r = 0.81, P < 0.01), whiles there was no significant correlation between CEC and PC2 (r = -0.19). Then, the PC1 was used as an auxiliary variable for the prediction of soil CEC in cokriging method. The determination coefficient (R-2) of cross-validation for the test dataset was 0.47 for kriging and 0.71 for cokriging. Therefore, according to the results, principal components that have the highest positive and significant correlation with the dependent variable have the most potential for cokriging prediction.

AB  - Water is an indispensable natural resource for life. Despite the fact that 72% of the Earth's surface is covered with water, only 3% of these water reserves are in the form of fresh water, 96% of which constitutes ice-poles. As a result, countries such as Canada with nearly 9% of the world's renewable water resources may be considered a freshwater-rich country, hence the importance of water bodies mapping as an essential tool for water resources inventory and monitoring. This research aims at developing an efficient method for river extraction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images Our proposed approach adapted for SAR images is mainly based on multi-criteria image filtering using attribute filters in order to identify water bodies and distinguish rivers from other structures present in the input image. First a texture measurement is applied to the input image in order to extract homogeneous areas, then a hierarchical image representation based on the Max-Tree structure is used to filter objects according to their shape and size. Our technique has been tested on different study sites acquired using RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites Images used in the experimentation represent urban and rural areas characterized by rivers of variable dimensions.

AB  - The spacing of Gansu Province from the eastern to western regions is very large and adjacent to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. On the one hand, Agriculture in western area is irrigated rather than non-irrigated agriculture in eastern area. On the other hand, elevation where adjacent to the Tibetan Plateau is much higher than other places. In this study, remote sensing drought indices, such as temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), perpendicular drought index (PDI), and modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI), were calculated using historical MODIS data. The applicability of these remote sensing indices was preliminarily studied by comparing the Relative Soil Moisture (RSM) of the sites. Results showed that: 1) In whole area, irrigated areas and high-altitude areas, the remote sensing indices have different degree of indication for the spatial distribution of RSM in the superficial layer in spring, summer, and autumn. Among them, TVDI has the best indication, followed by VCI and TCI, and PDI and MPDI have very limited indication. But TVDI has no indication in May in irrigated areas at all. 2) None of them can indicate the temporal variation characteristics of the RSM in the irrigated areas, and TVDI and TCI based on the surface temperature can indicate the temporal variation of the 10 and 20 cm-deep RSM in the high-altitude areas. In general, TVDI is a good indicator for RSM in the superficial layer in Gansu Province during spring, summer, and autumn.

TI  - THERMAL ANOMALIES PRIOR TO THE 2015 GORKHA (NEPAL) EARTHQUAKE FROM MODIS LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND OUTGOING LONGWAVE RADIATIONS
T2  - GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes can generate thermal anomalies in the atmosphere at low altitudes. Pending well-focused detailed studies, such phenomenon may be referred to as a precursor for earthquake prediction. However, today the pre-earthquake thermal anomalies are not clear enough. In this paper, the thermal anomalies prior to the April 25, 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake are investigated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST), air temperature and Outgoing Longwave Radiations (OLR) data. The 2D and 3D wavelet transformation techniques are used to interpret the real time enhancement of the daily MODIS and OLR data before the impending earthquake. Using the wavelet density spectrum, pre-earthquake anomalies in MODIS and OLR are found in connection to the impending earthquake. The spatial images of MODIS and OLR show the evolutionary pattern of the emanation of ions from the epicenter and the surrounding area. The most important feature revealed by the spatial analysis is the eastward migration of temperature clouds due to a strong electric field. The satellite based LST data showed deviation, which crosses the upper bound by 5 degrees C. All the observations in our case study strongly support the notion of pre-earthquake thermal anomalies. Based on the analysis of the results, it can be concluded that the overabundance of ions from the seismogenic zone is responsible for prompting large temperature perturbations in atmospheric layers.

AB  - The world has been alarmed with the global warming effects. Global warming has been a distress towards the environment, thus shorten the Earth's lifespan. It is a challenging task to reduce the global warming effects in a short period, knowing that the human population is increasing along with the electricity and energy demand. In order to reduce the effects, renewable energy is presented as an alternative method to produce energy in a way that will not harm the environment. Oil palm is one of the agricultural crops that produces huge amount of biomass which can be processed and used as a renewable energy source. In 2016, Malaysia has reported over 5 million hectares of land were covered by oil palm plantations. Placing Malaysia as the second largest country of oil palm producer in the world has given it an advantage to produce renewable energy source. However, there is a need to monitor the sustainability of oil palm plantations in Malaysia via effective mapping approaches. This study utilised two different platforms (open source and commercial) using a machine learning algorithm namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform oil palm mapping. An open source Python programming-based technique utilising Scikit-learn module was performed to map the oil palm distribution and the result produced had an overall accuracy of 91.39%. To support and validate the efficiency of the Python programming-based image classification, a commercial remote sensing software (ENVI) was used and compared by implementing the same SVM algorithm and the result showed an overall accuracy of 98.21%.

AB  - This preliminary study investigated the: (i) level of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) among members of Kulliyyah of Allied Health Sciences (KAHS), International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) regarding Islamisation of knowledge (IOK); (ii) correlation of KAP and IOK with the duration of service and level of exposure to IOK-related activities; (iii) comparison of KAP between departments in KAHS towards the understanding of IOK, and (iv) level of KAP in IOK between KAHS academics and non-academic staff. Since studies on the integration of religious worldview in health sciences faculties are scarce, this study will be investigating the effectiveness of IOK programmes at the faculty level. A total of 74 staff participated in the study. The response rate was 65.5% out of 113 distributed questionnaires. All respondents have average knowledge (50 +/- 28%) in IOK and showed positive attitude (78 +/- 32.5%) towards IOK. The knowledge of Islamisation in KAHS correlates positively with the duration of service (p<0.05) and the level of exposure to IOK-related activities (p<0.05). However, answers given to some questions indicated that the staff perceptions and knowledge of IOK are ambiguous and may suggest a misunderstanding of the Islamisation term. Furthermore, an average score was found among the academic respondents with regards to their integration of IOK into practice. These shortcomings may affect the integration and implementation of IOK either in classrooms, clinics or offices and lead to a poor integration of the Islamisation agenda to the students as well as the patients. Hence, there is a need to design workshops and programmes more towards practical approaches of IOK into health-based sciences as well as the implementation of IOK agenda at the workplace, rather than the theoretical aspects per se. In conclusion, most of the respondents have positive attitude towards the IOK movement in KAHS despite the high level of knowledge among some members, in particular the academic staff, is not yet translated into practice.

AB  - Modern spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, such as TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X and COSMO-SkyMed, can deliver very high resolution (VHR) data beyond the inherent spatial scales (on the order of 1m) of buildings, constituting invaluable data source for large-scale urban mapping. Processing this VHR data with advanced interferometric techniques, such as SAR tomography (TomoSAR), enables the generation of 3-D (or even 4-D) TomoSAR point clouds from space. In this paper, we present a novel and generic workflow that exploits these TomoSAR point clouds in a way that is capable to automatically produce benchmark annotated (buildings/nonbuildings) SAR datasets. These annotated datasets (building masks) have been utilized to construct and train the state-of-the- art deep Fully Convolution Neural Networks with an additional Conditional Random Field represented as a Recurrent Neural Network to detect building regions in a single VHR SAR image. The results of building detection are illustrated and validated over TerraSAR-X VHR spotlight SAR image covering approximately 39 km(2). almost the whole city of Berlin. with mean pixel accuracies of around 93.84%.

This paper shows that faith does not frustrate that purpose. Science should be universal and its established knowledge through evidence should benefit all mankind and should be developed by people from diverse backgrounds. On the other hand, no religious text is a pure science book and no religion claims as such. Nonetheless, understanding and explaining the deeper meaning of life is beyond the domain of science. Science cannot be an arbiter in philosophical, moral, social and political matters.Originality/value - This paper clarifies the epistemological boundaries of science and religion on existential questions. It makes a case for mutual co-existence of both empirical knowledge and values in the future of society, as co-existence of both empirical knowledge and values is necessary in a healthy, progressive and spiritual society.

AB  - Change estimation from the satellite image is an important area of investigation these days. Today weather monitoring and forecasting, soil moisture estimation, covert data transmissions all are estimated with the assistance of the satellite data. In this research paper, we have investigated the case of Lake Poopo disappearance which is considered as the lifeline of Bolivia.The post-classification change detection is performed through the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) based technique. The satellite data is acquired from Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) sensor. Texture classification through grey level co-occurrence matrix is performed for the pre and post image of Lake Poopo, and on the basis of this change in the texture visual parameters contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity are estimated.Finally, a pattern is also identified for the change in the texture feature from `water' to `no water' condition. This pattern can be considered as a novel pattern for detecting a change in the texture of the landcover for drought or lake dryness conditions.

AB  - The mixed forest of larch (Xingan Larix gmelinii) and white birch (Betula platyphylla) is the main forest type in Northeastern China and plays a key role in regional ecological environment. Remote sensing has become an important approach to identify and classify vegetation types. By using hyperspectral data, we could obtain more detailed vegetation information, such as tree species. This study mainly focuses on the identification algorithm of white birch based on hyperspectral remote sensing data. The results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the white birch with larch as the background vegetation. Using this method, we can quickly realize the survey of tree species in large area, which is of great significance for the study of forest landscape ecology

TI  - Determining the Start of the Growing Season from MODIS Data in the Indian Monsoon Region: Identifying Available Data in the Rainy Season and Modeling the Varied Vegetation Growth Trajectories
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Indian monsoon region, frequent cloud cover in the rainy season results in less valid satellite observations during the vegetation growth period, making it difficult to extract land surface phenology (LSP). Even worse, many valid but humid observations were misidentified as clouds in the MODIS cloud mask, causing severe gaps in the LSP product. Using a refined cloud detection approach to separate clear-sky and cloudy observations, this study found that potentially valid observations during the vegetation growth period could be identified. Furthermore, the varied vegetation growth trajectories cannot be well-fitted by a global curve-fitting approach, but can be modelled by using the locally adjusted cubic-spline capping approach, which performed well for any seasonal patterns. Applying this approach, the start of growing season (SOS) was determined with 9.18% of vegetation growth amplitude between the maximum and minimum NDVI to generate the SOS product (2000-2016). The valid percentage of this regional product largely increased from 29.30% to 69.76% compared with the MCD12Q2 product, and its reliability was approximate to that of deciduous broadleaf forest in North America and Europe. This product could serve as a basis for understanding the response of terrestrial ecosystems to the changing Indian monsoon.

I first examine art and art education as components of the original, Edenic cultural mandate, and then under the renewed cultural commission signified in the resurrection. I argue that in the post-fall context, the cultural mandate for art and art education must incorporate consciousness of what some have called a cultural ‘antithesis’. That is, the practice and teaching of art are properly undertakings of the body of Christ and must be always mindful of sin.

AB  - Technogenic, dynamic and mobile civilization has been in a state of systemic ecological and economic crisis for several decades. Numerous studies of its origins and causes show that the culture of a technocratic society associated with a quantitative increase in consumption has exhausted its capabilities and proved incapable of alleviating the sustainable future of humankind. Comprehension of this problem gives grounds to believe that its solvation is largely predetermined by the formation of a new culture, the core of which is the noospheric ecological imperative: only the thing that does not violate the natural balance is allowed. Life in the conditions of imposed restrictions is connected with the change of worldview attitudes of society, understanding the ideas of noospheregenesis and eco-centrism, the need for strict regulation, economy and conscious restriction of consumption.

AB  - Kunming is located in the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, covering the Quaternary sediments. With the development of the city, Kunming has had a large area of land subsidence in recent years. In this paper, time-series analysis of the land subsidence in Kunming was assessed by using permanent scatterers interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) based on 28 single look complex Sentinel-lA images from 2014 to 2016. The result showed that the four subsidence areas were Xiaobanqiao-Guangwei village, Dongjuxin village-Yulong village, Dianchi Convention and Exhibition Center, and Palm Tree Camp. The most serious area of land subsidence was Xiaobanqiao-Guangwei Village, and its subsidence rate is 30mm/a. The largest settlement area is Dianchi Convention and Exhibition Center. Compared with other research results, the Xiaobaoqiao-Guangwei village and Dongju New Village-Yulong Village continue to subside and two new subsidence areas hve formed in Palm Tree Camp and Dianchi Convention and Exhibition Center. In Kunming, regional tectonic movement and its' special geological conditions, long-term groundwater exploitation, urban construction have led to land subsidence.

AB  - Shin Seok-Jeong was one of the most important figures in the modern literary circles of South Korea. He is known as a poet who has been influenced by the Taoism. Previous studies on his poetry have been done to explain his early poetry from the perspective of the Taoism. However, studies on his later poetry, especially studies on his manuscripts anthology“The Songs I Want to Sing”are rather scarce, because the anthology was published only by 2007. Therefore, there is little research on how natural images appear in the late poetry and whether the consciousness on the nature of Shin Seok-Jeong has changed or not. Considering these facts, this study attempts to examine the recognition of the nature of Shin Seok-Jeong in his later poems.In the later poems of Shin Seok-Jeong, two poetry anthologies are included. In the previous researches on tn the collection of“The Sound of Bamboo Wind”,which is the last anthology published before Shin Seok-Jeong died. The attention to the nature-friendly tendency revealed in the poetry has been mainly explained as the return to the early nature poetry. In fact, taoist thought is well presented in his later poems. According to the results of this study, the poetic natural thought of“Wuwei-Ziran”appeared in Shin Seokjeong's later poems is meaningful in the following two aspects. First, it is a roundabout resistance to the rigid censorship system. Second, it is an alternative way of solving various problems of modern society and restoring the relation between human and nature. Shin Seok-Jeong advocated getting rid of the thoughts of self-centrism and anthropocentricism, and through the transformation of worldview to“Wuwei-Ziran”could help view the problems of human society at a higher level. In this respect, the late poems of Shin Seok-Jeong have profound ecological implications.

AB  - In our work, three empirical algorithms for significant wave height (SWH) retrieval have been tuned for horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization Sentinel-1 SAR. We extracted more than ten thousand sub-scenes from available 200 images, which were treated as a dataset with collocated SWH from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis wave data at a 0.125 degrees grid. Two algorithms are based on the relation between SWH and azimuthal cutoff wavelength named CSAR_WAVEs and the other is called XWAVE which was originally explored for SWH retrieval from X-band SAR data. The three empirical algorithms have been tuned for HH-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR through the dataset. Additional 83 HH-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR images were carried out to retrieve SWH by using the four algorithms. Although the three algorithms allow estimating SWH from HH-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR, the algorithm herein called CSAR_WAVE_S is recommended for use due to less comparative error of a 0.57m STD of SWH.

CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The AQUA, SNPP, and NOAA 18-20 PM sun-synchronous satellites were designed with similar local time, local solar zenith angles, and overlapping temporal coverage. Although the satellites are expected to have fixed local equator crossing time, during the satellite lifetime, the equator-crossing times of these satellites drift. For NOAA 18-19, the drift in equator-crossing time is significant (few hours) and no correction has been done over the lifetime. For SNPP and AQUA, correction in the orbital inclination angle was periodically performed to maintain the equator-crossing time around the designed value. The impact of systematic drift of the local observation time during the satellite life cycle can be significant and should be accounted for when using multi-year time series of satellite products in long-term environmental studies. In this paper, the equator-crossing time drift of AQUA, SNPP, and NOAA 18-20, the correction of SNPP and AQUA equator-crossing time via orbital inclination angle change, and the consequent local solar zenith angle variation are evaluated. The impact of such drift on low-latitude mean brightness temperature trend derived from the similar similar to 11 gm thermal emissive channel of AQUA MODIS CH31, SNPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) CH15 and NOAA 18-19 HIRS CH08 are analyzed. The drift in the mean brightness temperature measured by these sensors is combined as a function of local time and analyzed using diurnal cycle analysis. The mean brightness temperature drift for SNPP VIIRS is reconciled within the context of much larger temperature drift of NOAA 18-19.

AB  - With the advancement in computer technologies, many algorithms have been developed that mimic the human behavior of accurately identifying the objects based on patterns, colors, textures, sizes, shapes. Based on the previous research, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach has come out to be an emerging technology that can easily extract the objects like roads, buildings, rivers, lakes etc. from the remotely sensed image. In this paper, mapping of glacier ice/snow and the glacial lake has been performed. As a case study, Siachen glacier situated in the eastern Karakoram Range in the Himalayas has been mapped from Landsat 5 using OBIA approach. The rule base classification has been implemented by using eCognition Developer software.

AB  - Diurnal variations of land surface temperature (LST) have a significant role in a wide range of applications. This study used a fifteen-year series (January 2003 to December 2017) daily observation of LST from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) instrument on board the Aqua and Terra satellites. A spline interpolation method was applied to each year's data to estimate the LST every 30 minutes. The diurnal cycle of LST is computed from the spatially and temporally consistent data at a global scale. The diurnal temperature range and time of occurrence of maximum hour is also calculated for each pixel. The trend of these parameters is compared to a 10-class land cover vegetation and fairly acceptable correlation is found. Analysis of fifteen years diurnal LST record shows a variant global decrease in DTR, but with a few point having increase in amplitude especially in Southern Africa and South America.

AB  - The choice of a solar radiation data source is expected to have a significant impact on the predicted performance of a concentrating solar power (CSP) system and consequently on its technical and financial feasibility. In the present study, an attempt has been made to analyse the effect of choice of various solar radiation data sources on the predicted performance of a CSP system at 13 different locations in 5 different climatic zones of India. It was observed that there is significant variation in the amount of annual electricity output obtained for various locations using different solar radiation data sources resulting in variations in levelised cost of electricity. For a 50-MW parabolic trough-based CSP plant located in Jaisalmer, the estimated value of annual electricity output varies from 63 to 124 GWh. For a CSP plant based on the central tower receiver technology, the corresponding range is from 106 to 145 GWh.

AB  - Estimation of snow cover area from satellite images is an important task for hydrologists and climatologists. Landsat 8 satellite data of four years 2013 to 2016 for October month is used in this study to check changes in snow cover area in Yamuna river catchment at Yamunotri, India. Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) is used to find snow cover area. Monthly average temperature of Yamunotri catchment for October month for year 2013 to 2016 is obtained from high resolution gridded dataset provided by climate research unit (CRU). It is found that snow area is in inverse relationship with temperature, i.e., it decreases with increase in temperature and vice-versa. Average temperature in October month in the study area is increased by 0.9 degrees C and snow cover decreased by 64% in last four years.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy density (FCD) is a major factor in the evaluation of forest status and is an important indicator of possible management interventions. The study uses the FCD model with Landsat TM and Landsat 8 OLI images to assess canopy density in India's Manipur valley and surrounding hills. Normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) was used to extract built-up areas and population density was retrieved from LandScan data, while elevation and slope were obtained from ASTER DEMs (30 m). Four types of canopy density were delineated with crown cover above 71%, 41-70%, 11-40%, below 10% and areas with no canopy cover, that is 0%. A sharp decline in forest area occurred during 1989-2016 at a rate of loss of 2.9 % year-1 with an average rate of deforestation of 3051 ha year-1. Dense forests exhibited remarkable degradation, especially towards the central valley. The variation in the topographical (elevation and slope) gradient resulted in significant differences in the canopy density over the study area barring some hill slopes. Population pressure and various developmental activities in recent decades led to forest degradation in this fragile yet rich Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot.

T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The non-local means filters are popular and effective in speckle filtering as well as preservation of subtle details but have certain limitations. The limitation of NLM filter is its biased estimation in case of excessive speckle noise. Also, the similarity measure which preserves polarimetric or scattering property of data is the matter of interest in recent works. In this paper, a speckle filtering technique is presented which apart from reducing speckle noise, preserves polarimetric property, fine structures of the polarimetric SAR data and leads to an unbiased estimation in excessive noise. The filtering method adjusts weights iteratively, such that norm of distances is minimized. The proposed method is validated over two real PolSAR datasets (captured over San Fransisco Bay, USA & Mumbai coastal area, India by RADARSAT-2) and a synthesized SAR image. The qualitative and quantitative performance analysis is presented for the proposed method in terms of visual appearance of span, RGB PolSAR images, ENL and B-index. The proposed method is also evaluated for PSNR and SSIM on synthesized SAR image. It is found that the proposed method performs better than NLM filter and can be considered as a good alternative to NLM filters.

AB  - The speckle filtering is an essential preprocessing step of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data processing. The PolSAR speckle filters perform generally better on multilook datasets. The multilooking is performed to reduce speckle and improve parameter estimation but it also degrades resolution of the datasets. The speckle filtering after multilooking further degrades the resolution. The analysis on suitability of speckle filtering algorithms for single-look data is absent in the literature. In this paper, state-of-the-art PolSAR speckle filters are analyzed for the single-look PolSAR data. The single-look Monte Carlo simulated and real RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data are used for performance analysis.

So we prefer the hard classification. But satellite data does not find in single class. The pixel of satellite data belongs more than one class. So in that case we prefer the soft classification. The classification is only one parameter and other parameter is assessment of accuracy and we know without assessment of accuracy classification of classifiers is incomplete. There are several method to find out the the accuracy of classifiers like MLC, FERM, RMSE, and Entropy.Accuracy results are generated for soft classified data set from AWiFS, LISS-III and LISS-IV sensor.

AB  - This study has been conducted on mining areas of Gua and Banduhurang in Jharkhand State, India, Barbil in Orissa State, India and Mines d'Arlit, Niger. Data from the corresponding sensors of EO-I, LANDSAT and IRS (i.e., Hyperion, ETM+ and LISS III respectively) were used to discriminate satellite signals of Hematite and Uranium ores from these locations. For the data of Hyperion being hyper-spectral, correction mechanism were performed through relevant algorithms: Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercube (FLAASH) to remove atmospheric aerosol effects, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) to remove noise, Pixel Purity Index (PPI) to get spectrally the most pure pixel and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) in order to match the spectral similarity between an image pixel spectrum and a referenced spectrum. The data achieved from ETM+ had line-stripping, and thus were restored. On the LISS III data, vegetation had to be, virtually, removed from the images of the Indian sites, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to equate them with that from the Niger site. The processed data was put to a common platform statistically. Segregation of Uranium, a radioactive ore, from Hematite, a non-radioactive iron ore, could be achieved up to 82.35% using TOPSIS and 90% using pair-wise Student's t-Test. The technique of Band Ratio was also carried out and an index was generated to isolate these mines from their surroundings.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approach to describe the effective utilization of geospatial techniques for disaster risk reduction at village level in Kopili River Basin (KRB) of Assam State, India is presented. The KRB is chronically flood affected due to seasonal monsoon and rise in water levels of Kopili River. Based on the MCA approach using flood hazard layer derived from the spatio-multi-temporal historic satellite data-sets (comprising of sensors from RISAT-1 SAR, Radarsat SAR and IRS AWiFS), socio-economic data (based on five census variables), infrastructure (road network) and land use vulnerabilities (cropped and uncropped areas), flood risk zones are derived. Our study elucidates that 24,837ha of crop area spread across 95 villages in the KRB falls in high risk zone, about 39,209 ha distributed in 150 villages falls under moderate-high risk zones and remaining area spread over 162 villages is more or less unaffected. The proposed approach can be applied elsewhere in other river basins to estimate the flood risk so as to mitigate the disaster risk posed by the floods.

M3  - Article
AB  - A preliminary study was performed to investigate the quality of total column ozone (TCO), water vapour (WV) and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) available from satellite and reanalysis from atmospheric models along with in situ observations over Ahmedabad (23.03 degrees N, 72.5 degrees E, 55 m above mean sea level), India. Ground-based measurements from a MICROTOPS II ozonometer as well as space-based satellite retrieved products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and an ozone monitoring instrument were analysed during December 2014 to March 2015. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA-Interim) created TCO and WV were also used to assess the skill of global model reanalysis over the western part of India. An increasing trend was found in the TCO and WV parameters from the winter to summer period. Investigations showed that MODIS satellite retrieved and ERA-Interim reanalysis WV are able to capture the trends compared with ground-based hand-held MICROTOPS II observations. Higher TCO was found in the MODIS data, whereas the ERA-Interim and ozone monitoring instrument TCO matched well with ground-based observations. Larger differences were found with the MODIS AOT in comparison to MICROTOPS II AOT observations. Further, analysis showed that ERA-Interim has sufficient potential to be used for various meteorological applications over the western Indian region. Furthermore, the variations of TCO, WV and AOT were studied over the orographic region of Mount Abu (approximate to 110 km aerial distance from Ahmedabad), located in the Aravali range of mountains. Ground-based measurements at different altitudes (0.3, 1.1 and 1.67 km above mean sea level) revealed significant variations in WV and AOT. The WV varies 17.1% (30.3%) and the AOT varies 53.8% (57.5%) in 1.1 km (1.67 km), whereas no noteworthy variations are observed in the TCO in this field campaign.

AB  - Random variations of local weather represent the main limiting factor for practical applications of persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) at the sub-regional level. 190 Sentinel-1 IW SAR scenes taken over European airfields of Vienna, Bratislava, Graz and Longyearbyen, and timely data recorded at airport meteorological stations were used for the joint interferometric analysis of weather-related impacts on the PSI technique. It was revealed that the most prevalent causes of the weather-related errors were heavy precipitation (50%), strong winds (32%) and thermal effects (8%). Typical range errors due to weather impacts varied between 0.1 and 0.5 pixel. An original correction technique of better half was designed and successfully tested in four lowland test sites. The proposed correction lowered the mean influence of local weather on PSI results from approx. 8 mm/a to 2 mm/a. Also the variation of residual errors around zero value was essentially reduced.

AB  - Water is the prime requirement for agriculture, domestic uses and industrial production. In India the per capita available of water is decreasing at a higher rate due to impact of climate change and ever-increasing population. Rainwater harvesting is the technique which is being used in effective storing of surface runoff. There are various types of water harvesting structures namely check dam, farm pond, percolation tank, etc. However, identification of potential site for the construction of the particular water harvesting structure is bit difficult as it depends upon numerous parameters such as soil type, slope, water availability, land use and land cover of the site and the surrounding, etc. The guidelines such as Food and Agriculture Organization; Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development are available for selecting suitable site for water harvesting structures. As the site suitability analysis involves multiple parameters for decision making, in the present study, the selection of suitable site for check dam is made through analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in geospatial domain for Hatni watershed, Madhya Pradesh, India. As location for check dam construction is influenced by soil texture, slope of the terrain, land use land cover, stream order and water availability; these parameters were derived from remote sensing data and analysed. The slope and stream network layers were generated from the digital elevation model (DEM). Further, the influence of soil and water availability in identifying the suitable sites was studied through soil texture and curve number. Different parameters influence the site suitability analysis, therefore, in the present study, IMSD guidelines were used to assign weights to each parameter under consideration. The layers were assigned weights by AHP technique based on pairwise comparison. The layers were reclassified according to the weights, then overlay analysis has been done to get the final site suitability map. As remote sensing provides the synoptic coverage of the earth, it has been further utilised to study the impact of water harvesting structure on its surrounding. The land use land cover map of before and after the construction of water harvesting structure was analysed for change in vegetation condition. It was observed that the vegetative cover has increased after implementation of the water conservation measures. It may be concluded that the geospatial technology has immense potential in site suitability studies for water harvesting structures.

It discusses a range of empirical research related to bullshit, including belief in the worldviews of Individualist vs. Communitarian and Hierarchical vs. Egalitarian with regard to accepting and rejecting ideas. Calling bullshit fits well with using the heuristics of like/not like and cognitive mechanisms of debunking misinformation.

AB  - There are a lot of various satellite air quality products with coarse resolution at the moment. They are successfully used in numerous environmental applications, but still not sensitive enough to capture all the variability of air conditions that is necessary for Air Quality (AQ) monitoring in the city. A few months ago Sentinel-5 satellite has been launched able to provide higher resolution air quality products. Air quality is one of the priority areas within ERA-PLANET project of EU Horizon-2020 program. The overarching goal of ERA-PLANET is to strengthen the European Research Area in the domain of Earth Observation in coherence with the European participation to Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and the Copernicus. Within ERA-PLANET project of Horizon-2020 program it is planned to develop air quality monitoring service for urban areas based on remote sensing data and network of air quality sensors that can be used for real time AQ monitoring with high spatial and temporal resolution. Kyiv is selected as one of pilot cities for Smart City concept implementation. This study provides an analysis of existing satellite products and ground based observations in Kyiv and describes the concept of air quality monitoring in Kyiv Smart City project.

AB  - The percentage of cloud cover is one of the key indices for satellite data products. To date, cloud cover assessment is performed manually in most groundstations. To facilitate the process, this paper proposes a deep learning approach for cloud cover assessment in quicklook satellite images. The quicklook images from Centre for Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing (CRISP) are used for demonstration. Same as the manual operation, given a quicklook image, the algorithm returns 8 labels ranging from A to E and *, indicating the cloud percentages in different areas of the image. This is achieved by constructing 8 improved VGG-16 models, where parameters such as the loss function, learning rate and dropout are tailored for better performance. Results indicate that approach is promising, as around 85% of sub-scenes are correctly labelled, and the accuracy is even higher if one ordinal error is accepted. This paper demonstrates a new application in remote sensing using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

M3  - Data study
AB  - The influence of seasonal, monsoonal winds on the temporal and spatial variability of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Beibu Gulf is studied based on long-term satellite data of sea surface winds, chl-a concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) and in-situ observations for the years from 2002 to 2014. The analysis results indicated that under northeasterly monsoonal winds, chl-a concentrations were substantially elevated in most area of the Beibu Gulf, with a high chl-a concentration (2 mg m-3) patch extending southwestward from the coastal water of the northeastern Gulf, consistent with the winter wind pattern. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of high chl-a concentration is correlated with low SST in the northeastern Gulf. In the southern Gulf, there was generally low chl-a, except in the coastal waters southwest of Hainan Island. Here, the upwelling cold water prevails outside the mouth of the Beibu Gulf, driven by the southwesterly monsoonal winds and the runoff from the Changhua River, as implied by low observed SST. Correlation analysis indicated the chl-a concentration was strongly modulated by wind speed (r = 0.63, p0.7, pa in winter. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - A comparison of multiple classifier combinations using different voting-weights for remote sensing image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image classification is a common application of remote sensing images. In order to improve the performance of Remote sensing image classification, multiple classifier combinations are used to classify the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (Landsat-8 OLI) images. Some techniques and classifier combination algorithms are investigated. The classifier ensemble consisting of five member classifiers is constructed. The results of every member classifier are evaluated. The voting strategy is experimented to combine the classification results of the member classifier. The results show that all the classifiers have different performances and the multiple classifier combination provides better performance than a single classifier, and achieves higher overall accuracy of classification. The experiment shows that the multiple classifier combination using producer's accuracy as voting-weight (MCCmod2 and MCCmod3) present higher classification accuracy than the algorithm using overall accuracy as voting-weight (MCCmod1).And the multiple classifier combinations using different voting-weights affected the classification result in different land-cover types. The multiple classifier combination algorithm presented in this article using voting-weight based on the accuracy of multiple classifier may have stability problems, which need to be addressed in future studies.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Waves Propagating in the Marginal Ice Zone by SAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave-ice interactions are important in high sea state conditions, when waves propagate from the open ocean into the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and the pack ice. In situ observations of waves and wave-ice interactions can be obtained at a small number of MIZ locations in costly and challenging experiments, whereas remote sensing using satellite RADARSAT-2 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images can observe waves throughout the MIZ, in all weather conditions. We present a methodology to retrieve MIZ wave parameters from polarimetric SAR data. As an application, we describe the characteristics of waves propagating from open water into the MIZ, as generated by a strong low pressure system that developed to the east of Greenland. As waves penetrate the MIZ, SAR remote sensing observations suggest increased dominant wavelengths, attenuated wave energy and shifted mean wave directions. The SAR observations and estimates for retrieved wave attenuation in the MIZ are shown to be consistent with wave attenuation theory and in situ field observations. Thus, valuable estimates of MIZ waves over large spatial scales at high-resolution are provided by the SAR measurements.

AB  - The objective of this study is to validate the Aqua-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target (DT) operational aerosol products at 3 km (DT3K) and 10 km (DT10K) spatial resolutions over the South China Sea. For validation of the DT3K and DT10K AOD retrievals, the ground-based Microtops II Sun photometer AOD measurements, obtained from the Marine Aerosol Network (MAN) which were collected from 10 different cruises over the South China Sea, were used. Results showed that 38% of the DT3K and 68% of the DT10K AOD retrievals were within the expected error (EE = +(0.04+0.10 x AOD(MAN)), -(0.02+0.10 x AOD(MAN))} with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.128 and 0.141 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.084 and 0.094, respectively. Underestimation in the DT AOD retrievals were found at both the resolutions, and a negative relationship was also found between DT AOD and normalized water reflectance. These results indicated that regional meteorology errors of the surface reflectance may have a significant effect on the underestimation of the MODIS AOD retrievals.

AB  - The estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for carbon accounting and monitoring, especially in the subtropical forests which account for approximately a quarter of the area of China. In this study, the airborne LiDAR, CCD and hyperspectral data acquired simultaneously from the LiCHy (LiDAR, CCD and Hyperspectral) Airborne Observation System were assessed separately or in combination to estimate ABG within a northern subtropical study site. Overall, the results demonstrated that most of the LiDAR, CCD and hyperspectral metrics refined by the PCA analysis have relatively low correlation coefficient with each other (r < 0.7). The model coupling LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics (R-2=0.87, rRMSE=11.67%) had a relatively higher performance than the models fitted by LiDAR only (R-2=0.85, rRMSE=12.31%). The combo model which integrated LiDAR, hyperspectral and texture metrics had the highest accuracy for AGB estimation (R-2=0.88, rRMSE=11.47%). In addition, the point cloud metrics of 95th percentile height (h(95)), 25th percentile height (h(25)), hyperspectral metric of Simple ratio (SR), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and texture metrics of entropy (EN), second moment (SM) have the relative importance for AGB estimations.

AB  - Motivated by the increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, we developed deep learning models able to efficiently and accurately classify the atmospheric conditions and dominant classes of land cover/land use in commercial PlanetScope imagery acquired over the Amazon rainforest. In specific, we trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform multi-label scene classification of high-resolution (<10 m) satellite imagery. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in training deep CNN models for multi-label scene classification. Finally, we investigate the transferability of our PlanetScope-trained models to freely available Sentinel-2 imagery acquired over the wet tropics of Australia. Our best performing model achieved an F-beta of 0.91, which was only 2% short of the top performing model in the Understanding the Amazon from Space Kaggle competition [1]. We also find that our models are suitable for classifying similar resolution satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2.

AB  - Puerto Rico suffered severe damage from the category 5 hurricane (Maria) in September 2017. Total monetary damages are estimated to be similar to 92 billion USD, the third most costly tropical cyclone in US history. The response to this damage has been tempered and slow moving, with recent estimates placing 45% of the population without power three months after the storm. Consequently, we developed a unique data-fusion mapping approach called the Urban Development Index (UDI) and new open source tool, Comet Time Series (CometTS), to analyze the recovery of electricity and infrastructure in Puerto Rico. Our approach incorporates a combination of time series visualizations and change detection mapping to create depictions of power or infrastructure loss. It also provides a unique independent assessment of areas that are still struggling to recover. For this workflow, our time series approach combines nighttime imagery from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP VIIRS), multispectral imagery from two Landsat satellites, US Census data, and crowd-sourced building footprint labels. Based upon our approach we can identify and evaluate: 1) the recovery of electrical power compared to pre-storm levels, 2) the location of potentially damaged infrastructure that has yet to recover from the storm, and 3) the number of persons without power over time. As of May 31, 2018, declined levels of observed brightness across the island indicate that 13.9% +/-similar to 5.6% of persons still lack power and/or that 13.2% +/-similar to 5.3% of infrastructure has been lost. In comparison, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority states that less than 1% of their customers still are without power.

AB  - High spatial resolution images are processed in the object domain as the traditional pixel-based method processes individual pixels (layer by layer) and classifies them, thus ignoring the neighborhood or contextual features. Analysis in object domain includes three steps: segmenting the image into homogeneous regions/objects, extracting features and assigning class labels to each of these regions based on the extracted features. Object-based analysis of an image faced challenges such as identifying the appropriate scale for segmentation and incapability to capture complex features that a high resolution image entails. This paper aims to solve this challenge by using a deep learning technique called Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN). Faster R-CNN was used here for the extraction of buildings in satellite images. The dataset used for training and testing was WorldView-2 with spatial resolution of 0.46 m. The results obtained using faster R-CNN had classification accuracy of 99% with 2000 epochs whereas building extraction using support vector machine showed 88.3%. The results obtained clearly indicate that convolutional neural networks are better at extracting features and detecting objects in high resolution images.

TI  - Traditions of the memoir prose in the autobiographical story by E. Chetvergov "Thinking about the spent life"
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: in the era of change of social identity there is a craving for existential self-determination, self-identification, which leads to the activation of the author's consciousness, the search for new forms of literary existence. Among these forms autobiography occupies a special place as a way of expressing of individual worldview and identifying of various manifestations of national life. At the same time the "literature of the human document" (L.Ya. Ginzburg), representing the author's psychological consciousness, subjective perception of life, drawn to the solution of philosophical timeless problems and issues of universal human content. In this regard, there is a need for scrupulous multifarious study of autobiographical literature as a way of representing of folk wisdom, ethics, philosophy, humanism and dialectics of national culture in the context of universal values, ontological laws.Objective: the article is devoted to the research of reception of traditions of memoir prose in the autobiographical story of the Erzya writer E. Chetvergov "Thinking about the spent life"; comprehension of the individual and author's model of the relationship between the subject and the society; interpretation of cultural, historical, ethno-national, existential questions of being explicated in artistic discourse of the work.Research materials: the empirical material of the research is the story by E. Chetvergov "Thinking about the spent life", which is characterized by the originality of the representation of the triad "individual - national - universal". The methodology of the work is based on the system approach, a set of traditional methods of literary analysis - comparative-typological, problem-thematic, structural-poetic.Results and novelty of the research: for the first time in the scientific circulation the story by E. Chetvergov "Thinking about the spent life", interpreted in the aspect of traditions of memoir prose, is introduced. In the course of discourse the authors come to conclusion that the prose writer transforms the subjective autobiography into a diverse narrative of sociopolitical and national and cultural content; he constructs an original model of the internal and external biography of the author's self.

TI  - Dendrimer-Entrapped Gold Nanoparticles as Potential CT Contrast Agents for Localizing Sentinel Lymph Node via Indirect CT Lymphography on Rabbit Model
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To investigate the potential use of indirect computed tomography lymphography (CT-LG) with dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs) in the localization and enhanced imaging of cervical sentinel lymph node (SLN) on rabbit model. Methods. Twelve rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: the positive control group and the experimental group. In the control group, indirect CT-LG was performed with the injection of 0.5 ml activated carbon nanoparticles (ACNP) and Omnipaque mixture suspension in the right tongue submucosa. CT images were acquired before the injection and 1, 5,10, and 15 min after the injection, respectively. In the experimental group, indirect CT-LG injection with 0.5 ml Au DENPs suspension was performed in the right tongue submucosa. CT images were obtained before the injection and 1, 5,10, and 15 min and 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after the injection, respectively. Then, SLN identification and enhancement characteristics were evaluated. Results. Indirect CT-LG revealed the enhancement of one right deep cervical lymph nodes in all animals, which was SLN. SLN location was marked with black color (ACNP dye) or purple-black color (Au DENPs dye). At each detection time point, the enhanced SLN attenuation values of control rabbits were statistically significantly higher than that of the plain scan, respectively (P < 0.05). Also the values of experimental rabbits were statistically significantly higher than that of the control at the same time point after injection (P < 0.05). The detection rate of SLN was 100%. Conclusions. Indirect CT-LG with injection of Au DENPs as CT contrast agents can locate the SLN for a long period of time and enrich the SLN black dye. It is helpful for SLNs identification during the operation.

TI  - Feature Selection for Object-Based Classification of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on the Combination of a Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In object-based image analysis of high-resolution images, the number of features can reach hundreds, so it is necessary to perform feature reduction prior to classification. In this paper, a feature selection method based on the combination of a genetic algorithm (GA) and tabu search (TS) is presented. The proposed GATS method aims to reduce the premature convergence of the GA by the use of TS. A prematurity index is first defined to judge the convergence situation during the search. When premature convergence does take place, an improved mutation operator is executed, in which TS is performed on individuals with higher fitness values. As for the other individuals with lower fitness values, mutation with a higher probability is carried out. Experiments using the proposed GATS feature selection method and three other methods, a standard GA, the multistart TS method, and ReliefF, were conducted on WorldView-2 and QuickBird images. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms the other methods in terms of the final classification accuracy.

AB  - Satellite imagery has played an important role in monitoring water quality of lakes or coastal waters presently, but scarcely been applied in inland rivers. This paper presents an attempt of feasibility to apply regression model to quantify and map the concentrations of total suspended matter (CTSM) in inland rivers which have a large scale of spatial and a high CTSM dynamic range by using high resolution satellite remote sensing data, WorldView-2. An empirical approach to quantify CTSM by integrated use of high resolution WorldView-2 multispectral data and 21 in situ CTSM measurements. Radiometric correction, geometric and atmospheric correction involved in image processing procedure is carried out for deriving the surface reflectance to correlate the CTSM and satellite data by using single-variable and multi-variable regression technique. Results of regression model show that the single near-infrared (NIR) band 8 of WorldView-2 have a relative strong relationship (R2= 0.93) with CTSM. Different prediction models were developed on various combinations of WorldView-2 bands, the Akaike Information Criteria approach was used to choose the best model. The model involving band 1, 3, 5, and 8 of WorldView-2 had a best performance, whose R2 reach to 0.92, with SEE of 53.30 g/m3. The spatial distribution maps were produced by using the best multiple regression model. The results of this paper indicated that it is feasible to apply the empirical model by using high resolution satellite imagery to retrieve CTSM of inland rivers in routine monitoring of water quality.

AB  - Sea ice concentration (SIC) is an important sea ice parameter of the atmosphere-ice-ocean system in the polar region. Daily 6.25 km AMSR-E/AMSR2 SIC from Bremen University (UB) is one of the widely used SIC products. In this paper, MODIS data and aerial image are used to validate this product. The results show that the daily mean AMSR-E ASI products underestimate SICs about 17.9% based on the aerial image, and underestimate SICs about8.5% based on MODIS image. The sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) which are derived from SIC by ASI algorithm, Dynamic Tie-point ASI algorithm (DT-ASI) as well as NT algorithm are compared.

AB  - Three dimensional displacements are more convenient for people understanding ground processes. However, only azimuth or line of sight (LOS) measurements can be directly extracted from SAR images which restrict further applications, especially for people who are not expertise in radar remote sensing. Aiming at this problem, we proposed an approach of retrieving time series three-dimensional displacements from multi-angular SAR datasets. Firstly, time series displacements in the azimuth and LOS direction can be estimated using traditional methods of SAR interferometry (InSAR) and SAR pixel offset tracking. Then, a fitting and interpolation procedure was applied to parameterize the displacement history and interpolate the displacements from different datasets with identical dates. Thus, three dimensional displacements can be obtained by making use of the different observation geometry of different SAR datasets. Our method was applied to retrieve three dimensional displacements history of the Shuping landslide, Three Gorges area, China.

AB  - Pansharpening is a fusion technique that merges panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images in order to enhance the spatial resolution of MS. Over the last two decades, a variety of approaches have been proposed either based on component substitution or multiresolution analysis. This paper proposes a new pansharpening algorithm using the morphological lifting transform (MLT) with region-based injection. The lifting structure with morphological operators provides a flexible tool to construct new morphological wavelet transforms. The morphological operators compared to the linear operators can extract the spatial details more effectively. In addition, an adaptive injection gain based on minimum mean squared error (MMSE) with k-means clustering is adopted. The proposed algorithm is validated in two datasets: Pleiades and Landsat 7. Experimental results show that the proposed method has advantages on enhancing the spatial details while retaining the spectral information. And it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Tomography is an advanced remote sensing method that is able to reconstruct the 3D distribution of scatterers. One promising solution is to use sophisticated reconstruction algorithms, like the compressive sensing based algorithm. However, it suffers from the high demand of number of images and the computational expenses. Therefore, it is hard to apply for large scale practice. In this work, a complete work-flow for Non-Local Compressive Sensing based SAR Tomography method is presented. Moreover, the applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated by exploiting TerraSAR-X high resolution spotlight images over a test site in Munich, Germany.

TI  - Estimation of gross primary production in Moso bamboo forest based on light-use efficiency derived from MODIS reflectance data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the contribution of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) forest to forest ecosystem carbon storage requires accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP). Based on measurements of light-use efficiency (LUE), defined as the ratio of measured GPP to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), from the eddy covariance flux tower, the linear regression model and partial least squares regression model were used for estimation of LUE using the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data. GPP estimates were then calculated by the product of LUE estimates and PAR (named the LUE-PAR model), which was compared with GPP from the GPP algorithm designed for the MODIS sensor aboard the Aqua and Terra platforms (MOD17A2 model) and the EC-LUE model. The results revealed the PLS model performed better than the linear regression model in LUE estimation but had lager uncertainties in high and low LUE values. GPP estimates driven by a MODIS-based radiation product with high spatial resolution was more accurate than those driven by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) radiation product from the NASA's Global Modelling and Assimilation Office data set. The LUE-PAR model had the highest accuracy than the other two LUE models. The GPP values derived from the EC-LUE model driven by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from MERRA and maximum LUE from the EC data were overestimated due to the overestimation in MERRA radiation product. The GPP values derived from the MOD17A2 model driven by PAR from the MERRA and maximum LUE from the biome properties look-up table were underestimated due to underestimation in the maximum LUE of Moso bamboo forest. This study implied that the LUE-PAR model driven by LUE estimates from the PLS model and PAR from MERRA is a superior approach in improving GPP simulations, and PAR products with high spatial resolution and accurate species-specific maximum LUE are necessary for the LUE models in estimating GPP at regional scale.

AB  - In order to evaluate the implementation effect of the Grain for Green Project (conversion of degraded farmland into forest or grass Land) and the eco-environment variation of Yulin, MODIS NDVI data was used to examine the spatial and temporal change of vegetation cover by applying maximum value composite (MVC) method based on the GIS. NDVI was higher in hilly loess region than that in blown sand region from 2000 to 2014. In general, the vegetation had improved during the past 15 years. In whole Yulin, the area of the improved vegetation accounted for 90.7%, the area of degradation constituted only 1.0%, and the area of no variation was 8.3%. In hilly loess region, the area of improved vegetation accounted for 94.2%, mainly with moderate improvement. The area of vegetation improvement on slopes accounted for more than 80%. The obvious improvement at 7 degrees-35 degrees slopes constituted more than 51%. Therefore, the effect of the Grain for Green Project was obvious.

TI  - A satellite-derived climatology of unreported tornadoes in forested regions of northeast Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel method of tornado track identification in forested regions in Europe based on remote sensing data. The method enables an objective estimate (i.e. independent of population density and observational networks) of tornado climatology in forested regions. The method is based on the identification of narrow and elongated areas as forest disturbances obtained using Landsat satellite images and Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) data. These areas were subsequently verified with high-resolution satellite images for verification of a tomadic cause of forest damage. Landsat and MODIS satellite images, weather station observations and reanalysis data were additionally involved in order to determine tornado dates. A minimum F scale tornado intensity was estimated by a Weibull distribution model using information on tornado path lengths and widths. The method is applied to the forested regions of northeast Europe, where 110 tornado tracks were identified between the 2000 and 2014 years, 105 of which were previously unreported and discovered for the first time. For some regions, tornado density estimates using the new method is 2-3 times higher than other previously published estimates. The largest number of tornadoes occurred in 2009, and June is the most favourable month for tornado formation (including strong tornadoes and tornado outbreaks). Most identified tornadoes have path length < 10 km with maximum and mean widths of approximately 200-300 m and 100-200 m, respectively. A few tornadoes with long and wide paths were found; four of them likely had F3 minimal intensity.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the observation of a large amount of sulphur dioxide (SO2) over the Republic of South Africa (RSA) during April 2015, the present study was formulated to explain the origin and contributing factors to such an increase. The Calbuco volcanic eruption in Chile occurred on 22 and 23 April 2015 and this study investigates the possible transport of SO2 and volcanic aerosols from the eruption site to RSA with the aid of model and satellite data. Time-averaged maps of SO2 and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), showed SO2 and AOD leaving Calbuco and reaching RSA on 28 April 2015. The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model forward trajectories showed that air masses, in the altitude range from 15 to 20km, left the eruption site and travelled towards RSA. The zonal extinction coefficient profiles and total backscatter height-time-colour map from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) also confirmed the presence of volcanic aerosols from 28 April 2015 to 16 May 2015. The stratospheric feature observed by CALISO vertical feature mask (VFM) confirmed that these were indeed volcanic aerosols.

AB  - In this study, the researcher(s) designed a fly-away terminal transmitter/receiver communicating with geostationary orbit satellite by applying the Turbo Product Code (TPC). This newly developed satellite terminal observe the standards of ITU-R, MIL-STD-199-164A, and ETSI EN 302 307. The fly-away terminal transmitter/receiver consists of the RF transmitter/receiver part and the radio modem part. The RF transmitter/receiver part was designed to transduce the modem signals into Ka-band up/down converting frequency so that it can result in high power transmission while lowering the noise level. The modem part was developed utilizing the forward error correction (FEC), root-raised-cosine (RRC) filter, cascaded integrator-comb (CIC) filter, numerically controlled oscillator (NCO), and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The use of FEC codes efficiently provide building blocks of encoding symbols and error correction functions follow low density parity check (LDPC) observing the TPC. This study presents a fly-away terminal transmitter/receiver that can modulate and demodulate the signals using TPC at the maximum speed of 2Mbps and transmit/receive them to an antenna by transmitting the up/down converting frequency.

TI  - Assessments of preprocessing methods for Landsat time series images of mountainous forests in the tropics
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest changes based on numerous satellite images has been recently conducted in the tropics. Preparation of a time series of satellite images, sometimes referred to as preprocessing, is essential for conducting robust detection of forest change. To create consistent and stable conditions in satellite images, the best methods have to be used in each step to correct various sources of noise. This study assessed three atmospheric correction methods, six topographic correction methods, and eight gap-filling methods to produce the best possible time series of Landsat images of tropical seasonal forests. The results showed that the best methods for atmospheric and topographic correction were relative corrections using a Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS), which is based on a 6S radiative transfer model, and the C-correction, respectively. Weighted linear regression and multiple linear regression models were selected as the best models for the filling of data gaps associated with Scan Line Corrector-off and clouds, respectively. This study provided the best possible image preprocessing for trajectory-based change detection using annual Landsat images. Although the best possible preprocessing methods might vary depending on the change detection methods used in different study areas, the results highlight the preferable preprocessing methods, even for different types of time series analysis.

AB  - Current measuring methods for air quality are based on ground measurement networks and satellite data. New methods of collecting evidence with advanced sensors are needed because current methods have limitations in collecting evidence for the illegal emission of air pollutants at narrow areas or specific sites. This study analyzed the possibility of using an ultraviolet hyperspectral sensor to measure the concentration of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Two types of spectra were used: simulated spectra for gases with various concentrations using a radiative transfer model and observed spectra for each gas for a concentration. To understand the possibility of using a hyperspectral sensor, the differences between the simulated spectra and the observed spectra were analyzed, and the variation of simulated spectra were then analyzed according to the concentration. The results showed good agreement between observed spectra and simulated spectra. In addition, the absorption depth at specific wavelengths in the simulated spectra had a very strong correlation with the gas concentration. The gas concentration could be estimated using the hyperspectral sensor. In the future, validation would be needed to estimate the gas concentration through observations of various concentrations of gases using a hyperspectral sensor.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In this essay, I ask the theoretical question about whether the subject of women in Im Kwon Taek films, which are widely accepted as ‘national’, has the modernity as the theoretical potential. The methodology of the argument has a dialectical form of criticism of Orientalism and its meta - criticism.Corresponding textual analyses confirm the logic that the female film-subjects mainly in the 1980's are historically 'otherized' as the protagonist in the film diegesis. But do the female subjects and the image reproduced, as the post-colonial feminists put it, remain pre-modernly fetishized? A skepticism, through stringent immanent criticism of the phenomenons, is still possible, even though such an argument for the orientalism has its own logic. Im Kwon Taek's female subjects, often criticized as premodern because of the Confucian worldview they represent, are the owners of self-subjectivity that we can acknowledge as modern. Their decision to make a moral issue with the society is the rational choices they spontaneously make. Perhaps the modernity of Im Kwon Taek's films is the crystallization of Im Kwon Taek's rationality as an auteur, which can criticize this traditional Confucianism from its inner modern version itself.

AB  - At the heart of this study is the category of pedagogical optimism as an immanent component of pedagogical professionalism - its nature, scope, dimension and relevance in today's educational realities. The main objective is to diagnose the dimensions of this professionally significant quality. This study is based on a theoretical analysis as were used empirical research methods (poll, mathematical and statistical methods for data processing). The occupied contingent encompasses pedagogues who have different positions (teacher at pre-school age, primary teacher, resource teacher, social pedagogue, social worker, public educator, psychologist, etc.) with a different internship in their speciality. In conclusion, it can be summarized that pedagogical optimism is a synthesis of the overall professional-pedagogical preparation, the worldview, the value orientation and the experience of the personality and it is a measure of the degree of its professionalization.

AB  - The success of a large number of real-world applications depends on the efficiency with which land use land cover classes are extracted from Remotely Sensed (RS) imagery. This study aims at analysing the performance of Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) over multispectral remote sensor data characterized by the overlapping of spectral classes and presence of mixed pixels, investigating the impact of prior class probabilities on the overall classification performance, the impact of the number of land cover classes on classification accuracy, and identifying the decision parameters for assigning a pixel to a land cover class. A quantitative analysis of decision parameters of MLC for pixel assignment is presented for five randomly selected pixels in the study area. Landsat 8 multispectral data of North Canara District was collected from USGS website and is considered for the research. Seven land use land cover classes were identified over the study area. Results obtained indicate that use of prior probability estimates improves the classification accuracy. The study also presents the variation in classification accuracy for four different cases of total number of land cover classes. The conducted research is useful in understanding the performance of MLC under multiple scenarios. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

M3  - Article
AB  - One of the directions in the "palette" of new religious movements - Russian paganism - should be recognized as a religious phenomenon of modern Russia. Distinctive features of domestic ethno-oriented "rodnoveriye" (native faith), "mladoyazychestvo" (neopaganism), etc. are worldview imaginary oxymoron, eclecticism of rituals and symbols. At the same time, since its emergence (the second half of the 70s of the 20th century) the Russian version of the movement retains a set of constants, including the organizational plan. The article examines the directions and organizations of the Russian pagans at the present stage, features of a social portrait of the average representative of the movement as well as motivation, which prompted the neophyte to "immerse in the tradition". Special attention is paid to the issue of leadership, which is undoubtedly up to be one of the most important not only in the areas of historical discourse - the role of the individual in history, but also within the paradigm of modern religious studies. It is the charismatic leaders (in the interpretation of A. Barker) that form structured organizations of the new religious movements and affect the so-called cult environment.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the peculiarities of rendering the meaning of compound terms in the translation process with the help of word combinations without shift of meaning in the semantic structure. The research is based on the examples from English and Russian legal terminology. Taking into account the fact that legal terms form a part of literary language the classification is based on principles accepted and used in Phraseology. The examples analyzed in this paper reveal the difference between English and Russian compound terms in the lexical and grammatical structure. The author arrives at a conclusion that the semantic shift in legal terminology has an anthropocentric orientation. The dependence of the nature of the semantic shift on certain features of national cultures is shown. The results of the investigation provide for the material for the study of the features of the corresponding segment of linguistic worldview.

AB  - Sound phenomenon is an object studied in different fields of scientific knowledge: from the formation of Universal structures to a person's inner world. Command of sound's culture (in different epochs, peoples, musical directions, styles and schools) presents different images of the world in its correlation to a human. That is why mastering the culture of sound in performance and composing practices Achieving this aim can only be possible under one condition: the sound phenomenon and worldview are treated in the framework of paradigm approach. That is when models of sound and the outlook reflect common stance in posing problems by the society and understanding the ways of their treatment. This poses the problem of researching sound phenomenon paradigm shift and outlook as a complex process before musical education theory (Glazyrina, 2001).It is impossible to consider the sound phenomenon in theory of musical training out of context of understandings and attitudes of this or that artistic epoch (direction, style)-artistic and aesthetical concepts, theories of musical training, values and ideals, sound images and so on. However, it should be taken into account that in musical training, culture and art the shift of "sound" paradigms is much more complex than in science. That is why theory of musical training while studying the repertoire of concepts, technologies and teaching methods in the offgoing sequence of sound phenomenon paradigms should focus on their philosophical content.

TI  - Generic rule-sets for automated detection of urban tree species from very high-resolution satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management and monitoring of urban forests is an important activity in the urbanized world, and operational approaches require information about the status of urban trees to determine the best strategy. One limitation in urban forest studies is the detection and discrimination of tree species using limited training data. Thus, this study focuses on developing generic rule sets from high-resolution WorldView-2 imagery in conjunction with spectral, spatial, colour and textural information for automated urban tree species detection. The object-based image analysis and its combination with statistical analysis of object features is utilized for this purpose. Results of attribute selection indicated that from 55 attributes, only 26 were useful to discriminate urban tree species, namely Messua ferrea L., Samanea saman and Casuarina sumatrana. Finally, the high overall accuracy, approximately 86.87% with kappa of 0.75 confirmed the transferability of the generic model.

AB  - The detection of thermal-fronts using data derived from satellites imagery data tends to be unsuccessful when the data being analyzed are largely covered by cloud. Segmentation or clustering-based detection method requires clear data and large size of dimension to achieve success on segmentation or clustering process. Otherwise, it needs a complex pre-process stage to process the cloudy data before the detection process. We proposed a simple thermal-fronts detection to process the Aqua MODIS Level 3 data that have a lot of clouds cover. By using the mathematical approach, we developed a model based on the pixels detection by analyze the values of the pixels and its relationships to neighbor pixels. We applied the segmentation approach using two window masks, i.e., searching window and neighboring window. Each pixel in the searching window will be evaluated based on the difference value (DV) between the center pixel and its' neighbor pixel, meanwhile each neighbor pixels will be created a neighboring window and evaluated using the edge thresholding value (ETV). The results from DV and ETV are used to determine whether or not the pixels in the searching window can be set as the thermal-fronts pixels. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a good performance to detect thermal-fronts using cloudy data.

TI  - STS/SCA/AmSECT Clinical Practice Guidelines: Anticoagulation during Cardiopulmonary Bypass.
T2  - The journal of extra-corporeal technology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Practice Guideline
AB  - Despite more than a half century of "safe" cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the evidence base surrounding the conduct of anticoagulation for CPB has not been organized into a succinct guideline. For this and other reasons, there is enormous practice variability relating to the use and dosing of heparin, monitoring heparin anticoagulation, reversal of anticoagulation, and the use of alternative anticoagulants. To address this and other gaps, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA), and the American Society of Extracorporeal Technology (AmSECT) developed an Evidence Based Workgroup. This was a group of interdisciplinary professionals gathered together to summarize the evidence and create practice recommendations for various aspects of CPB. To date, anticoagulation practices in CPB have not been standardized in accordance with the evidence base. This clinical practice guideline was written with the intent to fill the evidence gap and to establish best practices in anticoagulation for CPB using the available evidence. To identify relevant evidence a systematic review was outlined and literature searches were conducted in PubMed using standardized MeSH terms from the National Library of Medicine list of search terms. Search dates were inclusive of January 2000 to December 2015. The search yielded 833 abstracts which were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Once accepted into the full manuscript review stage, two members of the writing group evaluated each of 286 full papers for inclusion eligibility into the guideline document. Ninety-six manuscripts were included in the final review. In addition, 17 manuscripts published prior to 2000 were included to provide method, context, or additional supporting evidence for the recommendations as these papers were considered sentinel publications. Members of the writing group wrote and developed recommendations based on review of the articles obtained and achieved more than two thirds agreement on each recommendation. The quality of information for a given recommendation allowed assessment of the level of evidence as recommended by the AHA/ACCF Task Force on Practice Guidelines. Recommendations were written in the three following areas 1) Heparin dosing and monitoring for initiation and maintenance of CPB, 2) Heparin contraindications and heparin alternatives, 3) Reversal of anticoagulation during cardiac operations. It is hoped that this guideline will serve as a resource and will stimulate investigators to conduct more research and expand upon the evidence base on the topic of anticoagulation for CPB.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Land Surface and Cryosphere Remote Sensing IV
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - In this paper, we present a novel framework to characterize the complex spatial structure of the intra-urban heat island. Cities are known to be warmer than its surrounding areas because of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. However, due to the diverse and complex spatial geometries of cities themselves, the temperatures within vary widely. We take advantage of the well-established notion of fractal properties of cities, to characterize the complex structure of these hotspots. As a demonstrative case study, Land Surface Temperatures (LST) for Atlanta, GA, derived from Landsat 8 is used. From clustering analysis at multiple thermal thresholds, we show that the hotspots can be described as a case of percolating clusters. By comparing the area-perimeter fractal dimension at these thresholds, we find these clusters to be statistically self-similar. Furthermore, at the percolation threshold, the cluster size distribution is found to follow a power-law size distribution; and at a higher threshold, deviation from the power law is observed in the form of exponential tempering. We argue that the spatial distribution of the hotspots itself plays a significant role in the overall UHI and fractal analysis techniques lend themselves aptly to the characterization of the same. This has several further applications, such as targeted heat mitigation, assessment of health impacts, and energy load estimation.

AB  - Over the years, data from different satellites has provided invaluable information about Earth's atmosphere, land and oceans. The thermal emissive bands (TEB) on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are comprised of 16 spectral bands with wavelengths ranging from 3.7 to 14.4 mu m. MODIS TEB are calibrated on orbit on a scan-by-scan basis using an on-board blackbody (BB). Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), launched on 16 February 2016, has 11 spectral bands with wavelengths from 0.55 to 12 mu m. In this study, we compare the observed brightness temperature from MODIS bands 31 and 32 and SLSTR bands S8 and S9 over Dome C using a 20 x 20 km region of interest (ROI) centered at (75.102 degrees S,123.395 degrees E). A total of 2989 scenes for Terra, 2963 for Aqua and 1961 for SLSTR from November, 2016 to January 2018 are analyzed. The relative bias between MODIS and SLSTR is evaluated using the near-surface temperature measurements from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS).

AB  - Over the years, data from Terra and Aqua MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) has provided invaluable information about Earth's atmosphere, land and oceans. Both MODIS sensors have exceeded their designed lifetime of 6 years and are still in operation. Therefore, it is important to understand the on orbit performance of both sensors. The thermal emissive bands (TEB) on MODIS are comprised of 16 spectral bands with wavelengths from 3.7 to 14.4 mu m. The TEB are calibrated on orbit on a scan-by-scan basis using a blackbody calibration source. Since the mission beginning, a steady increase in electronic crosstalk has been observed in Terra MODIS bands 27-30. The MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) at NASA/GSFC has recently derived a set of correction factors that correct these bands for the entire mission. These corrections are being applied in Terra Collection 6.1. In this study, the effectiveness of this crosstalk correction is assessed. First, the observed brightness temperatures over Dome C for Terra with and without the crosstalk correction are compared. Then, the calibration consistency and stability between the TEB of Terra, with the crosstalk correction, and Aqua MODIS are also assessed. Finally, the relative bias between the two MODIS instruments is evaluated using the near-surface temperature measurements from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS).

AB  - The design and analysis of potable water distribution pipe network is one of the major task while planning any new city. Even finding the effectiveness and detecting any anomaly in the existing pipe line network is a very important to cut down losses and make a network all time efficient. This study makes an attempt to evaluate the existing water distribution network of Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) and new pipe network to be developed under the master plan 2022. The new development induces an extra demand of 67634 litres per day (lpd). The Digital Globe image from Google Earth Pro is used for creating base layer and campus layout. ALOS PALSAR digital elevation model (DEM) is used to get elevation of nodes and tanks, which helps in alignment of pipes. Field survey was done for finding all the data necessary to make the database for input for EPANET 2.0. EPANET 2.0 pipe hydraulic model was used to test and design the existing and proposed potable water distribution pipe network. The results of evaluation of current operations show that the system can be made capable to fulfil the demand by increasing pumping time. But the future network operation requires an increase in pumping capability of 71 litre per minute (lpm) for filling Overhead tank. This study proves that geospatial technology is an efficient, time and cost saving alternative to the traditional methods of design and evaluation of potable water distribution networks.

TI  - VERBALIZATION OF IDEAS OF TIME IN YU. BONDAREV'S LANGUAGE
T2  - IIOAB JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is dedicated to the analysis of the contextual use of temporary lexemes in the language of lyrical and philosophical short stories by Yu. Bondarev. The topicality of the work is due to the fact that the study of the category of time represented in Yu. Bondarev's works creates a pronounced anthropocentric orientation of the work and makes it possible to determine the features of the author's individual worldview that influences the creation of literary reality. It determines the specificity of functioning and representation of temporal units in the writer's works with account of the originality of their semantic volume. It also identifies basic models of time perception embodied in the texts of Yu. Bondarev. Time, being one of the worldview, existential categories, represents the objective reality through the system of language means and reflects the author's perception of reality. The lexical designations of time used by Yu. Bondarev in literary texts, in addition to the main nominative meaning, also realize individualized meanings, defined by the specificity of the writer's world view ('something moving, likened to liquids or a mechanism linked in a mysterious way to human life', 'capable of perceiving a person's will ',' being a value that can be lost, destroyed, or exchanged for something valuable (love, youth, success)', ' likened to large space, which a person covers'). Preserving their objective basis, the temporal units in Yu. Bondarev's works reflect the features of time perception by individual human mind and identify qualitatively different types of the time "lived". Descriptive analysis, lexicographic, contextual analysis of literary text, literary interpretation were used.

TI  - Measuring compactness of the urban landscape within a city territory for environmental capabilities: The case of 50 cities in Eastern China
T2  - 24TH ISUF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE: CITY AND TERRITORY IN THE GLOBALIZATION AGE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th International Seminar on Urban Form
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - When a compact city is pursued as the strategy for urban sustainability the understanding of compactness is varied from the developed countries to the developing countries. In China the historical cities are characterized with high density and mixed land use. After a short time of motorization they still show compact forms in the central city. A large amount of newly developed areas are distributed in clusters near or far from the center. The crop land and natural habitat are encroached to different degrees. This paper developed an approach to measure the structural compactness of urban landscape patches within a city territory. It included six spatial metrics to measure the shape and density of the central agglomeration, the area configuration and distant relationship between the central agglomeration and the other clusters, and the distribution of all urban patches. By this approach the 50 cities in eastern China were categorized into five classes of forms: mono-center, multi-nucleus, centralized group, cluster group and scatter. Then the vegetation biomass loss with urban expansion was calculated based on remote sensing data, and used to assess the environmental capability of the five types of urban form. The suggestions of urban form optimization could be put forward for the five categories of cities.

TI  - Performance analysis of different predictive models for crop classification across an aridic to ustic area of Indian states
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to present comparative performance analysis of different machine learning algorithms for large area crop classification. Ten Indian districts with significant rabi crops viz. wheat, mustard, gram, red lentils (masoor) have been selected for the study. Most popular classical ensemble models - bagging/ARCing, random forest (RF), gradient boosting and Importance Sampled Learning Ensemble (ISLE) with traditional single model (decision tree) have been selected for comparative analysis. To incorporate dependency of large area crop in different variables viz. parent material and soil, phenology, texture, topography, soil moisture, vegetation, climate etc., 35 digital layers are prepared using different satellite data (ALOS DEM, Landsat-8, MODIS NDVI, RISAT-1, Sentinental-1A) and climatic data (precipitation, temperature). In rabi season, field survey about crop type is carried out to prepare training data. Performance is evaluated on the basis of marginal rates, F-measure and Jaccard's coefficient of community, Classification Success Index and Agreement Coefficients. Score is calculated to rank the algorithm. RF is best performer followed by gradient boosting for crop classification. Other ensemble methods ARCing, bagging and ISLE are in decreasing order of performance. Traditional non-ensemble method decision tree scored higher than ISLE.

TI  - An effective implementation and assessment of a random forest classifier as a soil spatial predictive model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of soil classes is important for informing soil use and management decisions. This study aimed to effectively implement Random Forest (RF) model and to evaluate the behaviour and performance of the model for soil classification of Indian districts. Soil-forming factors, known as scorpan,' are selected as environmental covariates to tune RF model to classify 11 different soil categories. Thirty-five digital layers are prepared using different satellite data [ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) digital elevation model, Landsat-8, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index product, RISAT-1 (Radar Imaging Satellite-1), Sentinel-1A] and climatic data (precipitation and temperature) to represent scorpan environmental covariates in the study area. The RF parameters corresponding to highest Cohen's kappa coefficient () value and lowest number of random split variables are considered optimum values for RF model. Model behaviour evaluation is based on mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size, and noise. Two other machine-learning methods, CART (Classification and Regression Tree) decision tree (CDT) and CART ensemble bagger (CEB), are used to provide the comparative study. To access behaviour of models to the false data set, noise in training set is produced by assigning a false class to the training set in 5% increment. Comparative performance of RF model is based on quality assessment measures. To evaluate the performance of models, marginal rates, F-measure, and Jaccard's coefficient of the community, classification success index and agreement coefficients are selected under quality assessment measures. The score is calculated to rank the algorithm. RF model shows high stability against data set reduction in comparison to other methods. The results show that the abrupt change in accuracy is only observed after 60% training data reduction in RF model; however, significant decrease in accuracy can be noted after 45% and 25% data reduction in CEB and CDT, respectively. The RF model shows comparatively the greater resistance to noise. Overall, RF model has performed better than CDT and CEB to classify soil categories in the study area. The results of this research provide new insights into the performance of RF in the context of soil class mapping.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics
CL  - Tomsk, RUSSIA
AB  - This paper provides a synergetic approach between numerical modeling and remote sensing of bio-optical water properties. The work demonstrates that appropriate data-assimilation schemes make numerical modeling a suitable and reliable tool for filling the gaps arising due to satellite imagery unavailability and/or cloud covering. In this research we apply the Princeton Ocean Model to the Sea of Azov, assimilating bio-optical indexes (index34 and bbp(555)) from MODIS L2 products. These data identify the presence of suspended matter (mineral suspended matter from river discharges or resuspending as a result of a strong wind), and suspended matter of biological origin. The ad hoc assimilation/correction scheme allows for prediction (and reanalysis) of transport and diffusion of the bio-optical tracers. Results focus on the ability of the method to provide spatial maps that overcome the general issues related to Ocean Color imagery (e. g., cloud cover) and on the comparison between the assimilating and the non-assimilating runs. Methods of joined information analysis are discussed and the quality of model forecasts is estimated depending on the intervals of the satellite data assimilation. Hydrodynamic modeling of the Sea of Azov was carried out for the period of 2013-2014 applying meteorological data of the regional weather forecasting system SKIRON/Eta. The analysis of data coherence helps to detect negative changes to the sea waters, predict them and forecast typical areas and territories subject to anthropogenic impact. The successive data-assimilation algorithm is proved to improve the forecast of suspended matter transfer.

TI  - Modelling terror management theory: computer simulations of the impact of mortality salience on religiosity
T2  - RELIGION BRAIN & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - This article outlines the development - and reports on the experimental findings - of two computational models designed to simulate the dynamic systems and behavioural patterns identified and clarified by research on terror management theory. The causal architectures of these models are informed by empirical research on the effects of mortality salience on "religiosity" (and vice versa). They are also informed by research on the way in which perception of personal and environmental hazards activate evolved cognitive and coalitional precautionary systems that can intensify anxiety-alleviating behaviours such as imaginative engagement with supernatural agents postulated within a religious coalition. The capacity of the models to produce emergent patterns and behaviours that are similar to the results of other empirical studies supports the plausibility of their causal architectures. After tracing some of the literature that supports the causal dynamics of our models, we present the two models, describe the experiments, and report the results. We conclude by discussing the importance of the findings, the limitations of the models, and directions for future research.

AB  - In this paper we propose method for land degradation indicators identification within the ERA-PLANET project. We also consider data sources that can be used for these purposes and consider the possibility of using high spatial resolution satellite-based classification maps. Project GEOEssential within the framework of the ERA-PLANET Project, using heterogeneous satellite data has the potential to make positive changes in land use. In this paper the ways of forming essential variables are described with specific attention to domain where and how it is possible to improve the state of productivity of land and to identify the non-proper use of land, which leads to desertification, forest degradation and the general degradation of land resources.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of modern requirements for the engineering profession. The topic of the humanitarian component of engineering education is relevant for modern investigation, because the object of modern engineering activity is a complex object, work with which requires the inclusion of social aspects, which seemed previously secondary. The purpose of the article is to study the problem area of the humanitarian component in engineering education. This article reveals the main humanitarian factors in engineering education, which play a significant role in the formation of the ethical responsibility of the engineer. The worldview level of the engineer and the ways of its formation becomes a topic for research, as modern engineering activity includes social and technical design, where the social and psychological aspects of the professional activity of an engineer are of great importance. The socio-technical design is a design without prototypes; modern engineers do not have ready-made intellectual solutions for solving complex scientific and technical problems. The modern engineer becomes a methodologist in the design of individual industrial products and systems design. A significant part of humanitarian problems of an engineering activity is the implementation of practical engineering activities in the context of its comprehension through the prism of an interdisciplinary and moral assessment of using engineering products and consequences of their use.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Different satellite-based radiation (Makkink) and temperature (Hargreaves-Samani, Penman-Monteith temperature, PMT) reference evapotranspiration (ETo) models were compared with the FAO56-PM method over the Cauvery basin, India. Maximum air temperature (T-max) required in the ETo models was estimated using the temperature-vegetation index (TVX) and an advanced statistical approach (ASA), and evaluated with observed T-max obtained from automatic weather stations. Minimum air temperature (T-min) was estimated using ASA. Land surface temperature was employed in the ETo models in place of air temperature (T-a) to check the potency of its applicability. The results suggest that the PMT model with T-a as input performed better than the other ETo models, with correlation coefficient (r), averaged root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 0.77, 0.80 mm d(-1) and -0.69 for all land cover classes. The ASA yielded better T-max and T-min values (r and RMSE of 0.87 and 2.17 degrees C, and 0.87 and 2.27 degrees C, respectively).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially distributed vegetation coefficients (Kv) data with high temporal resolution are in demand for actual evapotranspiration estimation, crop condition assessment, irrigation scheduling, etc. Traditional remotely sensed based Kv data application gets hindered because of two main reasons i.e 1) spectral reflectance based Kv accounts only for transpiration factor, but fails to account for total evapotranspitration. 2) required optical spectral reflectances are available only during clear sky conditions, which creates gaps in the Kv data. Hence there is a necessity of a model which accounts for both transpiration and evpaoration factors and also for a gap filling method, which can produce accurate continuous quantification of Kv values. Therefore, in this study, different combinations of enhanced vegetation index (EVI), global vegetation moisture index (GVMI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) have been employed in linear and non linear regression techniques to obtain the best model. To fill the gaps in the data, initially, temporal fitting of Kv values have been examined using Savitsky-Goley (SG) filter for 3 years of data (2012-2014), but this fails when sufficient high quality Kv values are unavailable. In this regard, three gap filling techniques namely regression, artificial neural networks (ANN) and interpolation techniques have been employed over Cauvery basin. Microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) has been employed in ANN technique to estimate Kv values under cloudy sky conditions. The results revealed that the combination of GVMI and TVDI using linear regression technique performed better than other combinations with correlation coefficient (r) and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.824 and 0.204 respectively. Furthermore, the results indicated that SG filter can be used for temporal fitting and for gap filling regression technique performed better than other techniques with the r and RMSE values of 0.68 and 0.25 for Berambadi station.

TI  - In Pursuit of the Functional Definition of a Mind: the Pivotalrole of a Discourse
T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to describing resultsof conceptualization of the idea of mind at the stage of maturity. Delineated the acquisition by theenergy system (mind) of stable morphological characteristics, which associated with such a pivotal formation as the discourse. A qualitative structural and ontological sign of the system transition to this stage is the transformation of the verbal morphology of the mind into a discursive one. The analysis of the poststructuralist understanding of discourse in the context of the dispersion of meanings (Foucault) made it possible to formulate a notion of it as a meaning that is constituted by the relation between the discursive practice and the worldview, regarded as a meta-discourse or a global discursive formation. In consequence of this relationship, a discrete and simultaneous scattering of meanings arises, the procedural side of which is a concrete discourse, and its productive aspect is linked with the creation of a local discursive formation. Based on this view it is proposed a logical formula of discourse, which takes into account the entropy of the language and the entropy of the worldview, as a particular manifestation of the mind entropy. Using this formula and considering the reactive nature of discourse, it was developed a classification, which included such types of discourses as reactive, suggestive, synthetic and creative. In turn, the proposed types of discourses are correlated with the specific characteristics of certain activities, as a psychological category. Also, it was considered the translation of the structure of discourse dissipation from the cognitive plan into the affective sphere because of which it is formed a hierarchy of significances, which performs the sense-forming function. It was analyzed the inverse influence of the hierarchy of significances on the structure of meanings dispersion and for respective account it was introduced a conditional coefficient of the value deviation of the significance of the meanings. This parameter reflects the sense correction of the meaning that occurs in the process of the emergence of discourse from discursive practice. Thus, the discourse is presented as a complex dynamic formation of the mind arising at the maturity stage of the system as a result of the combined effect of entropic dispersion of meanings and the value deviation of their significances.

AB  - In the article the presentation of estimation methods of potential soil loss in the conditions of Siberia with application of geographical information systems is resulted. For the reference area of the Marha river basin, which is a part of the Lena river catchment, there was created a specialized geographic information database of potential soil erosion, with scale of 1: 1,000,000. Digital elevation model "GMTED2010" and the hydroset layer corresponding to the scale of 1: 1,000,000 are taken to calculate the soil loss values. The formation of the geobase data is considered in detail being constructed on the basis of the multiplicative structure which reflects the main parameters of the relief (slope steepness, exposition, slope length, erosion potential of the relief), soil, climatic characteristics and modern types of land cover. At the quantitative level with sufficiently high degree of spatial detail results were obtained for calculating the potential erosion of soils. The average value of potential soil loss in the basin without taking into account the factor of land cover types, was 12.6 t/ha/yr. The calculations carried out, taking into account the types of land cover obtained from remote sensing data from outer space resulted in an appreciable reduction of the soil loss values (0.04 t/ha/yr.).

T2  - RUKOPYSNA TA KNYZHKOVA SPADSHCHYNA UKRAINY-MANUSCRIPT AND BOOK HERITAGE OF UKRAINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The actuality of studying the ideology of late Slavophilism is dictated by the need for a historiosophic understanding of interethnic relations in the Slavic world at the beginning of the 20th century, since the current confrontation between the two Slavic countries - Russia and Ukraine - in the territory of Donbas confirms the concept of a spiral development of history that tends to repeat in a modified form. Thematically, Slavophil ism has been studied quite fully, but in modern historiography there is no comprehensive analysis of the attitude of the Slavophiles to the "Polish question". The early 20th century, in accordance with the new socio-economic and political situation in the Russian Empire, compared with the previous period, marked the organizational design of Neo-Slavism - the direction of public thought of a bourgeois-democratic orientation. At the same time, a partial modernization of the Slavophile ideology takes place, taking into account new realities, including international ones. Neo-Slays and Neo-Slavophiles had a common desire to develop the principles of a new Slavic worldview, based on ethno-cultural reciprocity, but different forms of its manifestation. One of the outstanding representatives of neo-Slavophilism is the scientist economist, public figure, publicist S. Sharapov. He prepared materials for the All-Slavic Congress in Russia. His draft resolution of the Polish question contained a considerable amount of rational grain. Remaining a convinced adherent of the autocracy, S. Sharapov acted as a Polonophile, offering a sincere and honest reconciliation with Poland. His epistolary heritage, considered in this article, deserves attention as a concentrated reflection of the Slavic problem and ways of solving it, taking into account, first of all, the interests of Russia.

Firstly, this study provides an overview of the condition of rice fields using the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) derived from time-series 8-day 500-m MODIS imageries during the periods of dry planting season 2015 and wet planting season 2016. Secondly, the study explores the factors that influence the resilience using the structured questionnaire. Finally, this study investigates characteristics that distinguish between the potential and actual resilience. Copyright: info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess DANS License

AB  - Cropping schedules in irrigated rice fields are often affected by the flooding. All rice growing stages, fallow, transplanting, harvesting, may occur in irrigated rice fields with complex cropping patterns. This research aims to distinguish between rice fields with agronomic inundation and rice fields with flooding in irrigated rice fields in northern districts of West Java using time-series MODIS imageries. The former is rice fields with normal cropping practices, while the latter is rice fields suffering disruptions from the adverse event. It is assumed that flooding delays the planting dates, leading to other adverse events in irrigated rice fields. The paper argues that the direct use of a particular vegetation index (e.g., EVI ≤ 0.1) may not sufficient to detect hazardous flooding in irrigated rice fields with complex cropping patterns. The paper proposed the incorporation of duration of land preparation and transplanting activities to EVI ≤ 0.1 distinguish between hazardous flooding and non-hazardous agronomic inundation in irrigated rice fields.

TI  - The Usefulness of SPECT/CT in Sentinel Node Mapping of Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients Showing Negative or Equivocal Findings on Planar Scintigraphy.
T2  - Asia Oceania journal of nuclear medicine & biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the diagnostic yield of SPECT/CT in localizing axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in early breast cancer patients where planar scintigraphy (PS) was equivocal or negative.METHODS: Prospective analysis of early stage breast cancer patients with non-palpable axillary nodes undergoing SLN localization prior to nodal sampling for axillary staging. PS findings were categorized as: Category A: non-visualization of SLN; Category B: unusual uptake location; Category C: equivocal uptake / difficult interpretation. The K-coefficient of Cohen was used to evaluate the correlation between PS and SPECT/CT results. PS and SPECT/CT images were interpreted separately, and SLN identification on each of the modalities was correlated to BMI (Body mass index) and peroperative radio guided results.RESULTS: Between April 2015 and January 2017, 1028 early breast cancer cases underwent sentinel lymphoscintigraphy. Of total, 134 (13%) patients underwent SPECT/CT in addition to PS. All were females with mean age of 48.15 years (range: 26-82 years). Right sided in 68, left in 64 and 2 with bilateral carcinoma. By TNM classification: 49 (37%) T1, 78 (58%) T2 and 7 (5%) had DCIS/Paget's disease.Overall SLNs were detected on both PS and SPECT/CT in 60% cases. Of category A (n=54); 35/54 (64%) SLN localized on SPECT/CT; 32 were level-I; 2 Level-II; 1 Level-III nodes. In 19, SLN was not localized. Of category B (n=18), 5 had prior lumpectomy, SPECT/CT localized tracer uptake to 17 level-I sentinel nodes, 3 level-II and level III / IMC in 9. Of category C (n=62), 29 had prior lumpectomy. SPECT/CT confirmed SLN in all the cases. Radio-guided surgery confirmed SPECT/CT results. The correlation between the two techniques was low (K=0.34). Where PS was negative; SPECT/CT localized nodes in statistically significant number of cases (=0.01). PS identified SLN uptakes in 80/134 (60%) cases with a mean BMI of 21.6±4.8 kg/m2 while SPECT/CT detected ''hot'' nodes in 115/134 (86%) cases with a mean BMI of 29.6±5.6 kg/m2. For overweight/obese patients (n=59) (BMI>25 kg/m2), PS failed to identify SLNs in 49 and SPECT/CT failed to do so in 18 (<0.001).CONCLUSION: SPECT/CT has diagnostic yield and helps in precise SLN localization where planar imaging is negative or shows unusual site of uptake.

AB  - Differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography allows separation of multiple coherent scatterers interfering in the same range-azimuth resolution cell as well as the estimation of the deformation parameters of each scatterer. In this way, the spatio-temporal tomographic inversion serves as a means to resolve the layover and simultaneously improve deformation sampling. Compared to metropolitan regions with several man-made structures, the prevalence of coherent scatterers in the villages of alpine regions is generally low, while at the same time layovers are widespread due to the ruggedness of the terrain. Moreover, the drastic height variations in the imaged scene necessitate height-dependent compensation of the atmospheric phase delay variations within the tomographic inversion. This paper addresses these concerns while performing experiments on an interferometric stack comprising 33 Cosmo-SkyMed strimap images acquired in the summers between 2008-13 over Matter Valley in the Swiss Alps. The results show improved deformation sampling along the layover-affected mountainside.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the web-based remote sensing platform, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and evaluates the platform's utility for performing raster and vector manipulations on Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and GlobCover (2009) imagery. We assess its capacity to conduct space-time analysis over two subregions of Singapore, namely, Tuas and the Central Catchment Reserve (CCR), for Urban and Wetlands land classes. In its current state, GEE has proven to be a powerful tool by providing access to a wide variety of imagery in one consolidated system. Furthermore, it possesses the ability to perform spatial aggregations over global-scale data at a high computational speed though; supporting both spatial and temporal analysis is not an obvious task for the platform. We examine the challenges that GEE faces, also common to most parallel-processing, big-data architectures. The ongoing refinement of this system makes it promising for big-data analysts from diverse user groups. As a use case for exploring GEE, we analyze Singapore's land use and cover. We observe the change in Singapore's landmass through land reclamation. Also, within the region of the CCR, a large protected area, we find forest cover is not affected by anthropogenic factors, but instead is driven by the monsoon cycles affecting Southeast Asia.

AB  - To reduce environmental tension the development of Kuzbass ecological culture is of great importance. Its most significant component is environmental education, in general, and the training of mining engineers with high level of ecological education, in particular. The presence of environmental education in the field of nature management cannot yet become a guarantor of environmental problems solution. It should be embodied in the behavior of a person, in the image of his life, in the system of values, in his ecological worldview. Educational reforms have become a response to the challenges posed by the social-and-economic development to the personality of a specialist, including the personality of a mining engineer in Russia and its regions. To identify the features of environmental education in the transition to the sustainable development it is important to set the main links in the system of continuous education and their peculiarities, which radically change the quality of training of mining engineers and the demand for specialists in the labor market.

M3  - Article
AB  - A quantification of the spatio-temporal dynamics of urbanization is crucial to apprehend urban morphology and its ecological effects, in order to support sustainable urban planning. This study aimed at understanding the spatial urban growth of Lubumbashi city based on the analysis of six SPOT satellites images. With the exception of the 1996-2002 period, Lubumbashi city underwent a high average annual growth rate exceeding that observed for other cities in sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1989 and 2014, the built-up percentage increased from 6% to 20%. Our results suggest that the urbanization of Lubumbashi city followed a complex diffusion-coalescence model. The main reason of this perturbation is the combination of the rapid demographic growth with an inappropriate urban growth management.

TI  - ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS OF URBAN GREEN SPACES IN THE SETTLEMENT OF ZADAR IN CROATIA
T2  - SUMARSKI LIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Accessibility of urban green spaces (UGS) is an integral element of satisfying quality of life. Due to rapid urbanization, the studies about UGS are becoming one of the key elements of urban planning. Functional network transport system and optimal spatial distribution of UGS are preconditions for maintaining the environmental balance of the urban landscape. Accessibility analysis of UGS in the settlement of Zadar was conducted as a part of the Urban Green Belts Project (UGB). Development of spatial database was the first step in generating UGS accessibility indicator. Data were collected using the supervised classification method of multispectral LANDSAT images and manual vectorization of high-resolution digital orthophoto (DOP). An analysis of UGS accessibility according to Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard (ANGst) was conducted. Accessibility indicator was generated based on seven objective measures which include the UGS per capita and accessibility of six UGS functional levels. The UGS accessibility indicator was compared with subjective measures that have been obtained by field survey of 718 respondents within 41 statistical units. The collected data reflected an individual assessment and subjective evaluation of UGS accessibility. This study illustrated the importance of using objective and subjective measures in the process of understanding UGS accessibility. It may be concluded that while evaluating accessibility, the residents emphasize the immediate residential environment, neglecting the UGS of higher functional levels. Furthermore, that large amounts of UGS within a city (114 m(2) per capita) do not necessarily generate a similar satisfaction with their accessibility. The output results may serve as guidelines for the further development of the functional UGS city network.

AB  - SAR polarimetry (PolSAR) can play an important role in monitoring agricultural fields both in terms of improving detection of specific plants conditions and providing physical information regarding the change. Such information can be used to help retrieving the phenological stage and eventually identifying stress conditions.In this work, a new change detection based on PolSAR data is first tested over time series of images acquired over agricultural fields. The methodology is based on the use of the normalised difference between covariance matrices acquired at two different instants. A diagonalisation of such matrix allows identifying the scattering mechanisms that suffer the largest change. The methodology is tested exploiting C-band quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data over rice fields in Sevilla, South-West of Spain.

AB  - Algal blooms of the water are an important variable for the analysis of freshwater ecosystems, which are relevant not only for human populations but also for plant and animal diversity. Monitoring algal blooms from space allows for a continuous and automatic control without the necessity of water sampling and human intervention. However, it is a very challenging task, which becomes particularly difficult when dealing with cyanobacteria blooms. Water limnology, satellite imagery and neural networks can be used as an ensemble of remote sensing and machine learning technologies in order to estimate the concentration of algal blooms from space. This paper describes empirical algorithms to this end, which incorporate information from the multi-spectral instrument of Sentinel-2 satellite. This approach is applied to the Cefni Reservoir (Anglesey, U.K.), by using spatial and temporal scales. Algae estimation is accomplished using different types of neural and fuzzy neural networks and the experimental results are very accurate, therefore proving the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach for monitoring water reservoirs by using remote sensing and neural networks tools.

AB  - Wavelet artificial neural networks and remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate water quality variables such as Chlorophyll-a, turbidity and suspended solids. This paper describes empirical algorithms for the estimation of these variables incorporating information from the Operational Land Imager Sensor on board the Landsat-8 satellite. Neural networks are seasonally trained using data from the Cefni reservoir (Anglesey, U.K.), covering a variety of physical trophic status. Chlorophyll-a levels and the suspended solids are estimated from the reflectance in band-2 and band-4, while the turbidity values from reflectance in band-4. Experimental results show the potential of Landsat-8 as a substitute of Landsat-7 in water bodies quality monitoring. Moreover, predicted values obtained by using wavelet artificial neural networks fit well measured data and hence, such models provide accurate results therefore improving the efficiency in monitoring water quality parameters and contributing to possible decision making processes in the environmental management.

AB  - In this work, the attitude determination and the gyros drift estimation will be described for nonlinear systems using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Extended H-infinity. Filter (EH infinity F), Second-Order Extended H-infinity Filter (SOEH infinity F), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Regularized Particle Filter (RPF). An analysis of these estimation methods will be done, verifying which of them present better precision in such study. The attitude model is described by quatemions and the attitude sensors available are two DSS (Digital Sun Sensors), two IRES (Infrared Earth Sensor), and one triad of mechanical gyros. The application uses the simulated measurement data for orbit and attitude of the CBERS-2 (China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) which has polar sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 778km, making about 14 revolutions per day. In this orbit, the satellite crosses the equator line always at the same local time, around 10:30 am. This dynamics allows the same conditions of solar illumination to be obtained during the acquisition of images. The simulated measurements of the CBERS-2 were provided by the inhouse package PROPAT, a Satellite Attitude and Orbit Toolbox for Matlab. The results in this work show that one can reach accuracies in attitude determination within the prescribed requirements, besides providing estimates of the gyro drifts which can be further used to enhance the gyro error model.

AB  - We developed minority education program that recognize various minorities living in our culture and live with them. Citizen we expect in an age of Globalization and Diversification will be a citizen who accepts various cultures with ‘A broad Worldview’, and also a human being who has humanity sensibility to think not only of individual rights but also others. I believe that this kind of human beings should be cultivated from their early age and that they will be more effective when dealt with from the elementary school curriculum.The research procedure for the achievement of research purpose are as follows.First, based on the theoretical content of the preceding study, the analysis criteria of minority education were divided into diversity education, semi-discrimination education, recognition education, and total education of minority rights, and social justice. Second, social textbooks related to the content of minority education in 2015 and social textbooks in 2009 were analyzed based on the analysis criteria. Through this, we try to understand the actual situation of minority education that has been done in the social studies curriculum and to provide an alternative. Third, based on the analysis results, a new minority education program was developed for elementary school students.The aims of the minority education program are as follows.First, it gives students the opportunity to look back on their own perceptions and values of minorities in multicultural life with diverse lifestyles. Second, recognize minorities and guide us in a direction of life where diversity coexist and sympathize with the fact that discrimination and prejudice are unjust as human beings. Third, our students should have a mind and attitude that can coexist with the minority in society as well as with the socially vulnerable in our school.I hope this study will change the school education so that students' perceptions will grow steadily, and consideration and sympathy for others will settle into their daily lives.

TI  - Effect of watershed land use on water quality: a case study in Corrego da Olaria Basin, Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Abstract The water quality is related to the hydrologic and limnologic properties of ground and surface water, and significant efforts have been made to monitor water sources to understand the effects of land use changes in agricultural areas, with significant socioeconomic activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the qualitative aspects of surface water in subbasins related to land use. Samples were analyzed in terms of physical and chemical parameters on monthly discrete water quality sampling in four representative sites at first order subbasin streams, located at the Polo Regional Centro Norte, Pindorama County, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The land use classification was made by visual detection technique in a multispectral satellite data obtained from LandSat8- spectral bands of the OLI sensor. The watershed was classified into major land cover/use classes and overlay maps generated in ArcGIS 10 indicated a significant shift from natural vegetation to agriculture activities. Water quality monitoring was according to the brazilian protocol and the results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The values obtained differ significantly at each sampling point - subbasins, reflecting the effects of land use on water quality. Soil conservation management is important to optimize soil use in order to contribute to the control of water pollution and the formulation of a public policy is necessary for the conservation of water and soil resources.

AB  - The main objective of this article is to analyze the Earth remote sensing data sets and identify shortcomings limiting the efficient processing and use of these datasets in the agricultural sector and related industries. The Copernicus remote sensing data is distributed internationally via the Copernicus Open Access Hub. The data is in the form of packages covering a defined area and, if available, also in the form of single images, which is the basic unit. Color syntheses and selected spectral bands provide a view of the state of vegetation in other spectral bands than the human eye permits. E.g. The Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) records data in three wavelengths of visible light and also in the infrared band, which is particularly useful in agriculture in monitoring vegetation, soil, food safety, but also for monitoring of the environment in general. Properly chosen color synthesis can point to plant stress or soil erosion with a different color shade than is common for healthy and prosperous growth. Usable spectral indices in plant production include NDVI, EVI, RENDVI (or NDRE) GNDVI, MSI (or NDWI) and LAI.

TI  - The planform mobility of river channel confluences: Insights from analysis of remotely sensed imagery
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - River channel confluences are widely acknowledged as important geomorphological nodes that control the downstream routing of water and sediment, and which are locations for the preservation of thick fluvial deposits overlying a basal scour. Despite their importance, there has been little study of the stratigraphic characteristics of river junctions, or the role of confluence morphodynamics in influencing stratigraphic character and preservation potential. As a result, although it is known that confluences can migrate through time, models of confluence geomorphology and sedimentology are usually presented from the perspective that the confluence remains at a fixed location. This is problematic for a number of reasons, not least of which is the continuing debate over whether it is possible to discriminate between scour that has been generated by autocyclic processes (such as confluence scour) and that driven by allocyclic controls (such as sea-level change). This paper investigates the spatial mobility of river confluences by using the 40-year record of Landsat Imagery to elucidate the styles, rates of change and areal extent over which large river confluence scours may migrate. On the basis of these observations, a new classification of the types of confluence scour is proposed and applied to the Amazon and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basins. This analysis demonstrates that the drivers of confluence mobility are broadly the same as those that drive channel change more generally. Thus in the GBM basin, a high sediment supply, large variability in monsoonal driven discharge and easily erodible bank materials result in a catchment where over 80% of large confluences are mobile over this 40-year window; conversely this figure is < 40% for the Amazon basin. These results highlight that: i) the potential areal extent of confluence scours is much greater than previously assumed, with the location of some confluences on the Jamuna (Brahmaputra) River migrating over a distance of 20 times the tributary channel width; ii) extensive migration in the confluence location is more common than currently assumed, and iii) confluence mobility is often tied to the lithological and hydrological characteristics of the drainage basins that determine sediment yield.

AB  - There is a growing number of easily accessible Big Data repositories hosted on cloud infrastructures that offer additional sets of cloud-based products such as compute, storage, database, or analytics services. The Sentinel-2 earth observation satellite data available via Amazon S3 is a good example of a petabyte-sized data repository in a rich cloud environment. The combination of hosted data and co-located cloud services is a key enabler for efficient Big Data processing. When the transport of large amounts of data is not feasible or cost efficient, processes need to be shipped and executed as closely as possible to the actual data. This paper describes standardization efforts to build an architecture featuring high levels of interoperability for provisioning, registration, deployment, and execution of arbitrary applications in cloud environments. Based on virtualization mechanisms and containerization technology, the standardized approach allows to pack any type of application or multi-application based workflow into a container that can be dynamically deployed on any type of cloud environment. Consumers can discover these containers, provide the necessary parameterization and execute them online even easier than on their local machines, because no software installation, data download, or complex configuration is necessary.

AB  - The importance of big geospatial data hosted on cloud environments is constantly growing. Main reasons are the rapid increase in volume of remote sensing data, the trend to persistently store and share more in-situ data at higher sampling rates, and the reduced management overhead of data hosted on commercial cloud platforms compared to inhouse solutions. At the same time, cloud computing has the advantage of high scalability (and often reliability) and the capability to match the increasing computational requirements entailed by Big Data processing. This paper discusses interoperability and portability issues of cloud computing architectures and introduces a standards-based architecture to facilitate geospatial big data processing in hybrid cloud environments by leveraging and extending standards released by the Open Geospatial Consortium, OGC.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the modern world there is a steady increase of scientific interest for the problems of state borders and border areas. This is due to trends of inter-civilizational and cross-cultural interaction, economic globalization, dramatic changes on the political map of the world, the democratization of information processes, and development of regional cooperation. Area studies emerged as a branch of science that studies, i.a., the spatial organization of the economy. The emerging new direction of cross-border regional studies is also focused on the economic issues of cross-border cooperation, which is new for the Russian regions. In the 1990s, the practice of these relations has evolved at a rapid pace leaving theoretical foundation and design within the framework of the scientific terminology behind. The border area, as part of the country, absorb the general tendencies of economic processes, and especially due to the peculiarity of geographical position. The same applies to socio-psychological processes. But if the economic potential, economics of frontier regions is reflected in the scientific literature, human potential, spiritual sphere, the state of the mass consciousness of various groups of the population are less studied, though, these factors are basic for social development. The article is devoted to the comparative analysis of the worldview, beliefs and attitudes of student youth of the Western and Eastern border regions of Russia.

TI  - Spectral separability and mapping potential of cassava leaf damage symptoms caused by whiteflies (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i>)
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDThis study examines whether leaf spectra can be used to measure damage to cassava plants from whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), and the potential to translate measurements from leaf to landscape scale in eastern Africa. Symptoms of the cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) and cassava mosaic disease (CMD) viruses, and sooty mould (SM) blackening of lower leaves from whiteflies feeding on the upper leaves, were measured at the leaf scale with a high-resolution spectroradiometer and a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) meter, which retrieves relative chlorophyll concentration. Spectral measurements were compared to the five-level visual scores used to assess the severity of each of the three damaging agents in the field, and also to leaf chemistry data.RESULTSLeaves exhibiting severe CBSD and CMD were spectrally indistinguishable from leaves without any symptoms. Severe SM was spectrally distinctive but is likely to be difficult to map because of its occurrence in the lower crown. SPAD measurements were highly correlated with most foliar chemistry measurements and field scores of disease severity. Regression models between simulated Sentinel 2 bands, field scores and SPAD measurements were strongest using wavelengths with high importance weightings in random forest models.CONCLUSIONSPAD measurements are highly correlated to many foliar chemistry parameters, and should be considered for use in mapping disease severity over larger areas. Remaining challenges for mapping relate to the subtle expression of symptoms, the spatial distribution of disease severity within fields, and the small size and complex structure of the cassava fields themselves.

TI  - Humanity in Schillebeeckx's Hermeneutic Phenomenology. Towards a Methodology
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIETY FOR PHENOMENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper offers an analysis of Edward Schillebeeckx's insights on different perceptions of revelation as related to concepts like salvation, God, church, human experience and creation in the work Jesus in Our Western Culture. The incentive of Schillebeeckx's hermeneutical method in nowadays Western phenomenology, upon which God breathed his breath of life, triggered our interest in meanings which Schillebeeckx ascribes to human history as the realm of God's work for the benefit of men and women. This meaning is suggested in the very beginning of the book by its original Dutch title If Politics is not Everything. As stated in this work's introduction, Schillebeeckx's main theme is the origin of salvation in the humanum, from the Abba experience to nowadays revelatory events. Our attempt is to see how Schillebeeckx's humanum, which is the embodiment of human experience of consciousness, becomes relevant for the Christian doctrines and why Schillebeeckx reckons that bringing them together would impact both his worldview and Western culture.

TI  - H.C. Andersen's Fairy Tales in the Novel "The House Where..." by M. Petrosyan
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the reception of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales "The Little Mermaid", "The Snow Queen" and "The Red Shoes" in the novel "The House Where..." by M. Petrosyan. In the text of the novel references to H.C. Andersen's fairy tales are represented in the form of titles and quotes, as well as some fairy tales' motives. M. Petrosyan's address to the tradition is provoked by the problem of growing up, which is most important both in the novel and in the fairy tales: the heroines of all three tales reject sexuality and passion and choose mental purity of childhood. Each of Andersen's tales involves one or two characters of the novel, and there is a possibility to preserve the axiological system of the source text or to reconsider it. Preservation is related to the characters who either contemplate the problem of growing up and consciously choose to give up the opportunities of adult life (Tabaqui), or do not reflect at all, but their actions and worldview coincide with the fairy tale heroine (Lord, Mermaid). The reinterpretation of Andersen's system of values occurs in the case of the Smoker: the choice of the traditional moral values, in opposite to the fairy tale, is erroneous in the artistic world of the novel. The axiological inversion comes due to the mystical nature of the House, where the ideas of good and evil become relative. As the protagonist cannot accept this, he loses the benefits of the child, but does not acquire the capabilities of an adult. The analysis allows us to clarify the understanding of the House as a space of initiation that exists the scientific tradition. The House is a space of childhood, and the transition to adulthood occurs at the moment of leaving the House.

TI  - Solar Radiation Forecast Using Cloud Velocity for Photovoltaic Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, solar energy is used in a many different ways. One of the most popular technological developments for this purpose is photovoltaic conversion to electricity. However, power fluctuations due to the variability of solar energy are one of the challenges faced by the implementation of photovoltaic systems. To overcome this problem, forecasting solar radiation data several minutes in advance is needed. In this research, a methodology to forecast solar radiation using cloud velocity and cloud moving angle is proposed. Generally, a red-to-blue ratio (RBR) color model and correlation analysis are used for obtaining the cloud velocity and moving angle. Artificial neural network (ANN) forecast models with different input combinations are established. This methodology requires lower computational time since it only uses part of the pixels in the sky image. Based on R-squared analysis, it can be concluded that the ANN model with inputs of cloud velocity and moving angle and average solar radiation showed the highest accuracy among other combinations of inputs. The R-squared value was 0.59 with only a relatively small sample size of 42. The proposed model showed a highest improvement of 75.79% when compared to the ANN model based on historical solar radiation data only.

TI  - Assessment of knowledge and attitudes towards safety events reporting among residents in a community health system
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HOSPITAL INTERNAL MEDICINE PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Resident physicians are known to be infrequent reporters of patient safety events (PSE). Previous studies assessing barriers to resident PSE reporting have not considered possible cultural barriers faced by international medical graduates (IMG). This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of residents regarding PSE and possible barriers contributing to poor resident reporting.Methods: A cross sectional survey of all house staff undergoing post-graduate residency training at two independent community hospital based academic medical centers was conducted through an online questionnaire. Sample case vignettes were created to assess the residents' ability to identify safety events and classify them as near miss, adverse events or sentinel events and decide whether they were reportable.Results: The Reporting of PSE increased significantly by year of residency training (p < 0.005), with time taken to file a PSE being the strongest perceived barrier. There was no difference in PSE reporting between IMG's and non-IMG's. We identified major knowledge gaps with only 73.9%, 79.6% and 94.3% of respondents correctly identifying sentinel events, adverse events, and near misses, respectively. 58.1% of respondents did not think near misses were reportable.Conclusions: A lack of knowledge is the most important barrier towards PSE reporting. A different cultural background and lack of previous exposure to patient safety report by IMGs is not a significant barrier towards safety event reporting. In the short-term, it appears that focusing limited institutional resources on education rather than acculturation issues would have the greatest benefit.

AB  - Present study is based on the change in surface area of the glaciers in downstream area of Dhauliganga basin, Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand. For this study, Survey of India toposheets (surveyed in 1963) have been used for preparation of initial boundary of glaciers. Total 11 glaciers have been selected for the study in downstream valley. RGI (Randolph Glacier Inventory) data version 60. (15_RGI 60. SouthAsiaEast) from GLIMS, released July 28 2017, used for measuring temporal change in surface area. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image of 06 November 2016 has used to measure present area of glaciers. ASTER GDEM was used for automatic extraction of basin boundary by hydro-processing methods. Glacier boundaries were manually digitised from the Landsat image for better accuracy. The total glacier area was 69.35 km(2) (1963), 48.10 km(2) (2001) and 34.35 (2016) as determined from SOI toposheet, GLIMS and the Landsat image of 2016 respectively. Total vacated area by the retreat and melting of glaciers from 1963 to 2016 is 35 km(2), which accounts to a total loss of 50 % from the total glaciated area. Google Earth imagery was also considered for marking the actual position of glacier outlines. Ice walls in topographic maps are also considered as the part of glacier but in present satellite image they are free from ice.

AB  - Real-time monitoring of agricultural crops is an important exercise because of the huge economic impact. Identification of crop during early stage of the crop cycle can help formulate better agriculture policies and management strategies. In this context, the objective of this article is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery in crop identification for an Indian region. A multi-class classification algorithm based on random forest is applied to the features extracted from the above mentioned satellite data sets. Initial experimental suggest that the Sentinel-1 SAR data is promising in achieving high classification accuracy (85%).

AB  - Cloud cover is a serious impediment in land surface analysis from Remote Sensing images either causing complete obstruction (thick clouds) with loss of information or blurry effects when being semi-transparent (thin clouds). While thick clouds require complete pixel replacement, thin cloud removal is fairly challenging as the atmospheric and land-cover information is inter-twined. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a Cloud-GAN to learn the mapping between cloudy images and cloud-free images. The adversarial loss in the proposed method constrains the distribution of generated images to be close enough to the underlying distribution of the non-cloudy images. An additional cycle consistency loss is used to further restrain the generator to predict cloud-free images only of the same scene as reflected in the cloudy images. Our method not only rejects the necessity of any paired (cloud/cloud-free) training dataset but also avoids the need of any additional (expensive) spectral source of information such as Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery which is cloud penetrable. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique by training on an openly available and fairly new Sentinel-2 Imagery dataset consisting of real clouds. We also show significant improvement in PSNR values after removing clouds on synthetic images thus validating the competency of our methodology.

TI  - Long-term Monitoring of Surging Glaciers in Upper Shyok Valley, Karakoram Range, India: A Case Study of Rimo and Kumdan Groups of Glaciers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Himalaya are generally showing a recessional pattern since the little ice age. In contrast to this, some glaciers in the Karakoram are either advancing or stagnant. Such behaviours of glaciers in the region have been termed as "Karakoram Anomaly" (Hewitt Kenneth, 2005; Raina, 2008; Kumar et al., 2015). In the present study, an attempt has been made to analyze the surging phenomena of four selected glaciers viz. Chong Kumdan, Kichik Kumdan, Aqtash and Rimo group of glaciers in the Shyok valley of Karakoram Himalaya; and also to analyze the inter-annual variations in their behaviour by using high temporal resolution remote sensing satellite images acquired from 1975 to 2013. These glaciers responded for surging phenomena differently in different time periods. The present study also fills the gaps of the earlier study of Bhambri et al. (2013) on the Rimo glacier, and demonstrates a different and unique pattern of snout movement. Findings of the present investigation depicts that the short-term variations in surging phenomena of the glaciers can be easily monitored using satellite images acquired from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Satellite and Landsat Satellite Sensor. Further, as it is well established that the surging phenomenon is a rapid process, we suggest that annual to biennial data should be used to monitor the movements and understanding the dynamics of surging process.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the debris flow occurred in July 2017 at the terminal moraine of the Meru glacier, Bhagirathi basin, Garhwal Himalaya. This event has changed the geomorphology of the Gangotri glacier's snout and downstream of the Bhagirathi river due to massive debris displacement. The causes of the debris flow were analyzed using Sentinel-2A and Google Earth (GE) images, gridded precipitation data of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). The chronological analysis of Sentinel-2A satellite and Google Earth (GE) images show the expansion in the size of the moraine-dammed lake at the terminus of Meru glacier, which later breached and triggered the debris flow. The analysis of rainfall data shows that the area received heavy rainfall during the event, triggering a massive debris flow.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS& LUP), Nagpur, India, has taken major initiative to conduct land resource inventory (LRI) on 1:10000 scale at country level to provide vital inputs for site-specific soil and land resource management and agricultural land use planning. In LRI, different kinds of remote sensing data, such as digital terrain model (DTM), IRS-P6 LISS-IV data of 5.8 metre resolution, etc., were used. The present chapter discusses the conceptual approach of LRI and expected outputs. It involves systematic surveys of soils (cultivable land) on 1: 10,000 scale and collection of other collateral data needed for scientific land use planning. ICAR-NBSS& LUP executed the programme in consortia mode by involving State Governments/State Departments of Agriculture, State Agricultural Universities, ISRO-National Remote Sensing Centre, State Remote Sensing Applications Centres and Soil and Land Use Survey of India. The said programme uses the latest time-efficient and cost-effective geospatial technologies and thereby ensures accuracy of the methodology. The nationwide survey helps to categorize the agricultural and non-agricultural areas in terms of their strengths, limitations and opportunities for appropriate use and threats from misuse/abuse. This also helps in developing perspective land use plans and monitoring their impact at macro (district/state) and micro level (village level). Special agricultural zones (present and potential) were delineated for giving focused support and services for major agricultural and horticultural production systems across the country. The importance of such land use planning could be further enhanced, if it is communicated/disseminated through well-designed geo-portal.

AB  - In this study, we discuss the use of InSAR-SBAS deformation time-series analysis as part of an early warning technique to monitor the safety of oil pipelines on different terrains. We focus on an oil spill in a wetland area and identify potential risks along a new pipeline route. We analyzed 153 RADARSAT 2 InSAR images for both sites. Our results show that the InSAR deformation monitoring can be used to investigate sites along pipeline routes. Integrating InSAR deformation measurements with existing geotechnical, thermal and climatic information will provide an early warning technique to prevent potential pipeline rupture in geologically risky areas. The 4-day InSAR rapid revisit from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) will increase the acquisition for monitoring surface deformation along these high-risk pipeline routes.

AB  - Mapping of the built-up area is a task of exigency as the area supports varieties of anthropogenic activities and is important for several ecosystem services. The task becomes more complicated owing to similarities in spectral characteristics with the bare soil. A new radar-based approach is proposed using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) HH/HV dual polarized L-band ALOS PALSAR data. Sigma nought (sigma degrees) values are extracted from the HH and HV polarized data. HH and HV sigma nought images are ratioed and normalized and then equated together in a unique combination to generate an index that is developed, cross-checked and validated over multiple regions, with simultaneous inputs from Ground truth (GT) data. Maps developed using the index is classified into built-up and non built-up areas, where the results show that the proposed method is very effective for built-up area detection. The approach adopted in this study is acceptable due to its high accuracy, simplicity and reliability; and hence easy to replicate.

AB  - Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.), an important sub-tropical crop of Eastern India, is a source of income to the growers and employment generation. Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Assam account for about 64.2% of the total litchi production in India. However, the crop undergoes severe fluctuations both in production and consumption, thus facing an unreliable price in the market. Availability of reliable statistics in context to area of a particular crop grown, information for site suitability, market planning and export strategy is need of the hour. The main aim of this research paper is to provide information for litchi growing area using Remote Sensing-geographic information system (RS-GIS) based techniques in which satellite image of Indian remote sensing-linear imaging self-scanning (IRS-LISS-III) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used under GIS domain for the analysis of suitable area and soils. The results showed that higher concentration of litchi orchards were found in low land of river basin in association with light textured soils of Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, India. From this study, it can be said that spectral responses of plants provide a clue for the signature capture of litchi orchards and also helps to map them.

AB  - The uncontrollable weather conditions can cause a serious problem to remote sensing imaginary. One of the weather conditions is a resulting from cloud contamination. As a result, this paper proposed the use of the convolutional autoencoder neural networks to remove clouds from cloud-contaminated images by training on a multi-temporal remote sensing dataset. Here, the observations from different spectral bands are assumed to be independent since their spectral responses are usually non-overlapped. From this assumption, each convolutional autoencoder neural networks are trained with the observation from only one spectral band. In our method, we have three convolutional autoencoder neural networks for red, green and blue spectral bands. The experiments were conducted on both synthesis and real dataset derived from the actual LANDSAT 8 images from the central part of Thailand where our algorithm has shown to have a superb performance.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXIV
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - A high spectral resolution of remote sensing images is crucial for the precise environmental research purpose. Therefore, it is essential to preserve the high spectral resolution of satellite imagery in the pan-sharpening process. Unfortunately, the use of original panchromatic (PAN) images as high-spatial data in the pan-sharpening process is ambiguous with maintaining the spectral information about photographed objects as high as possible. Therefore, there is a reasonable need to simulate the high-spatial band. The research has involved the integration of two satellite multispectral (MS) images: Landsat-8 imagery (30 m) used as high-spectral data and Sentinel-2 imagery (10 m) used as high-spatial data. The new panchromatic bands based on Sentinel-2 data was performed. The channel combinations used in spectral indices such as: Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Simple Ratio (SR), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) were utilized for the simulation purpose. Either the spectral quality of sharpened images and their suitability to a classification process were verified. In the assessment stage, a visual analysis, spectral quality indices, a comparison of spectral reflectance characteristics of natural land cover, and a supervised classification were applied. The research indicates the necessity to simulate the high-spatial channel to pan-sharpening process depending on the spectral resolution of the high-spectral imagery as well as depending on the type of object of interest (OOI). The application of appropriate modifications of the original high-spatial images makes it possible to keep the spectral information about photographed objects at a higher level than using original data. Thus, it is essential for the object identification process, change detection, and land management.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations and trends in water quality parameters (total suspended matter and coloured dissolved organic matter) were examined in five harbours in the eastern Baltic Sea using satellite imagery collected from 2002 to 2011 by the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) at full spatial resolution (300 x 300 m). In the eastern Gulf of Finland harbours (Sillamae, Kunda) the TSM monthly variations were related to monthly mean wind speed. In Tallinn harbour, which operates > 6000 vessels annually, evidence of anthropogenic impacts was identified through inter-annual TSM variations. The vessel traffic footprint was ascertained from the significant correlation (R = 0.66; p = 0.035) between the number of annual vessel visits and mean annual TSM concentration. In the harbour of Parnu, located close to the river mouth, inter-annual water quality variations in terms of the CDOM concentrations were affected by the mean annual river discharge levels of the Parnu River.

AB  - The availability of satellite imagery with a variety of spatial resolution, both free access and commercial become as an option in utilizing the remote sensing technology. Variability of the water column is one of the factors affecting the interpretation results when mapping marine shallow waters. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of water column correction (depth-invariant index) on the accuracy of shallow water habitat classification results using OBIA. This study was conducted in North of Kepulauan Seribu, precisely in Harapan Island and its surrounding areas. Habitat class schemes were based on field observations, which were then used to build habitat classes on satellite imagery. The water column correction was applied to the three pairs of SPOT-7 multispectral bands, which were subsequently used in object-based classification. Satellite image classification was performed with four different approaches, namely (i) using DII transformed bands with single pair band input (B1B2), (ii) multi pairs bands (B1B2, B1B3, and B2B3), (iii) combination of multi pairs band and initial bands, and (iv) only using initial bands. The accuracy test results of the four inputs show the values of Overall Accuracy and Kappa Statistics, respectively 55.84 and 0.48; 68.53 and 0.64; 78.68 and 0.76; 77.66 and 0.74. It shows that the best results when using DII and initial band combination for shallow water benthic classification in this study site.

AB  - Multiple spot beams based dual satellite system with full frequency reuse across all spot beams is considered in this work. Both satellites transmit on same frequency to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. Cooperative Zero Forcing (ZF) and cooperative regularized ZF precoding algorithms are investigated. If the users served by both satellites are closely placed, then it is shown that the proposed cooperative precoding fails due to the ill conditioned channels. Otherwise, the proposed DSS is shown to achieve better sum-rate than orthogonal transmission scheme, where both full frequency reuse based multiple spot beam satellites transmit on different frequency bands.

AB  - Full frequency reuse based heterogeneous satellite networks, where the satellite and terrestrial networks transmit on the same sub channel, is proposed. The inter spot beam interference and inter system interference (interference from the terrestrial base station) are the major performance-limiting factors at the satellite user. In this work, a novel approach, where only the dominant interfering signal is mitigated while ignoring the other interfering signals, is proposed. Interference-aware detector is proposed to mitigate the dominant interfering signal. In particular, successive interference canceler and joint decoder based interference mitigation strategies are investigated. The robustness of the joint decoder compared to that of the interference ignorant detector and successive interference canceler is proved through Monte-Carlo simulations.

AB  - Haze dispersion from peatland fire that influence human health can be recognized by analyzing haze trajectory pattern. Previous studies have successfully analyzed haze dispersion as the result of the simulation using HYSPLIT. However the haze dispersion have not verified and compared with the real situation. This study aims to verify haze dispersion from peatland fires in Riau Province using Landsat 8. The Landsat 8 was classified using the C5.0 decision tree algorithm. There were eight classes used in the classification which are cloud, smoke/haze, water body, shadow, built up area, burning area, burned area, and vegetation. The best classification model has the accuracy of 97.58% and kappa coefficient of 0.97. This study has successfully verified 58 haze locations in the study area. As many 98.28% of those locations were found on smoke/haze and cloud. In addition, about 41.38% of 58 haze points are located at height and pressure that are harmful for human health.

AB  - Predicting the class labels for each pixel in a remote sensing image is a very challenging task. Due to the high spatial resolution of the remote sensing data, each pixel in a remote sensing image has a meaningful information. Therefore, identifying the homogeneous regions and annotating them with significant land cover information remains an open challenge. To handle this challenge supervised machine learning methods are adopted and they play a key role in dealing with these high dimensional data and understanding the landcover information of the geographical surfaces in a remote sensing image. The main aim of this study is to analyse the performance of different supervised learning algorithms for labelling each pixel for the images obtained from International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Vaihingen. From the comparative analysis it is concluded that the fine Gaussian support vector machine outperforms the other state of the art techniques with an overall classification Accuracy of about 75.1448%.

AB  - In this investigation, the removal of anionic dyes Indigo carmine (IC) and Fast yellow (FY) has been studied by using nanoporous magnesium aluminophosphate material as adsorbent. The synthesised magnesium aluminophosphate material was characterised by FT-IR, XRD and Nitrogen sorption analysis. To find the maximum adsorption of anionic dyes on adsorbent, the experiment was carried out at various adsorption conditions like contact time, dye concentration, temperature and adsorbent dosage. Adsorption equilibrium was achieved at 20 minutes and the adsorption was followed pseudo second order kinetics. The negative. Delta G value showed that adsorption was spontaneous. The enthalpy (Delta H for IC = 40.28kJ/mol, FY = 40.73 kJ/mol) indicated that the adsorption was endothermic and chemisorption. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Translating photoacoustic imaging (PAI) into clinical setup is a challenge. Handheld clinical real-time PAI systems are not common. In this work, we report an integrated photoacoustic (PA) and clinical ultrasound imaging system by combining light delivery with the ultrasound probe for sentinel lymph node imaging and needle guidance in small animal. The open access clinical ultrasound platform allows seamless integration of PAI resulting in the development of handheld real-time PAI probe. Both methylene blue and indocyanine green were used for mapping the sentinel lymph node using 675 and 690 nm wavelength illuminations, respectively. Additionally, needle guidance with combined ultrasound and PAI was demonstrated using this imaging system. Up to 1.5 cm imaging depth was observed with a 10 Hz laser at an imaging frame rate of 5 frames per second, which is sufficient for future translation into human sentinel lymph node imaging and needle guidance for fine needle aspiration biopsy.

AB  - With availability of images acquired by NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and European Copernicus Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, it becomes possible to provide a global coverage of Earth's surface every 3-5 days. Such high temporal resolution is a prerequisite for developing next generation products at moderate spatial resolution (10-30 m). This is especially important for applications, involving agricultural monitoring. This paper explores a combined use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data to winter wheat yield assessment at regional scale. We take advantage of the NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) product, which provides a seamless unified product from different sensors aboard both satellites. Multiple features are evaluated through correlation with winter wheat yield values with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) serving as a benchmark. We show that, when using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data together, the error of winter wheat yield estimates can be reduced up to 1.8 times, compared to using a single satellite.

TI  - Transitioning from MODIS to VIIRS: an analysis of inter-consistency of NDVI data sets for agricultural monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite was launched in 2011, in part to provide continuity with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Terra and Aqua remote-sensing satellites. The VIIRS will eventually replace Aqua MODIS for both land science and applications and add to the coarse-resolution, long-term data record. It is, therefore, important to provide the user community with an assessment of the consistency of equivalent products from the two sensors. For this study, we do this in the context of example agricultural monitoring applications. Surface reflectance that is routinely delivered within the M{O,Y}D09 and VNP09 series of products provides critical input for generating downstream products. Given the range of applications utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) generated from the M{O,Y}D09 and VNP09 products and the inherent differences between MODIS and VIIRS sensors in calibration, spatial sampling, and spectral bands, the main objective of this study is to quantify uncertainties associated with transitioning from using MODIS to VIIRS-based NDVIs. In particular, we compare NDVIs derived from two sets of Level 3 MYD09 and VNP09 products with various spatial-temporal characteristics, namely 8-day composites at 500m spatial resolution and daily climate modelling grid images at 0.05 degrees spatial resolution. Spectral adjustment of VIIRS I1 (red) and I2 (near infra-red - NIR) bands to match MODIS/Aqua b1 (red) and b2 (NIR) bands is performed to remove a bias between MODIS and VIIRS-based red, NIR, and NDVI estimates. Overall, red reflectance, NIR reflectance, and NDVI uncertainties were 0.014, 0.029, and 0.056, respectively, for the 500m product and 0.013, 0.016, and 0.032 for the 0.05 degrees product. The study shows that MODIS and VIIRS NDVI data can be used interchangeably for applications with an uncertainty of less than 0.02-0.05, depending on the scale of spatial aggregation, which is typically the uncertainty of the individual data sets.

TI  - Predicting the visual impact of onshore wind farms via landscape indices: A method for objectivizing planning and decision processes
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Visual impact is one of the main factors influencing the acceptance of wind farms by the public and by the authorities. It therefore often sets the environmental and social limits of energy policy and energy use. However, the assessment of visual impacts is subjective, as is often pointed out by critics of the evaluation process. The study presented here for the first time uses accurately and objectively measurable landscape indices to directly predict the visual impact of onshore wind turbines. The method also for the first time evaluates map-based landscape indices in a panoramic simulation, and this provides a better match of visual preferences with landscape indices than the cartographic projection used until now. 400 respondents from four Central European countries (Austria, Germany, Poland and Czechia) provided an evaluation of their scenic perception of 32 different landscapes, in each case with and without wind turbines. At the same time, we analysed 12 indices characterizing the principal landscape components (relief, land cover and landscape pattern) on the basis of the 32 landscape photographs. These were further tested as predictors of visual impact. The most prominent predictors of visual impact were the Percentage of Industrial Area (including Commercial, Logistic and Mining Areas), Percentage of Forest Cover, Density of Technical Infrastructure, Number of Elevation Landmarks, and Elevation Variation. None of the three landscape pattern indices was statistically significant. On the basis of a regression model that is able to predict the potential visual impact in large areas of four Central European countries (over 830,000 km(2)), we present the general principles of an objectivized method for predicting the visual impact of onshore wind farms. The method makes an automatic assessment of the visual impact in large areas of entire regions or countries via a GIS analysis of Sentinel data and DEM data. This forms a good basis for both preventive evaluation and causal evaluation, and provides significant support for objectivizing the planning and decision process in order to mitigate negative environmental and social impacts of the use of wind energy.

AB  - Landsat 8 (L8) satellite was launched on February 11, 2013 with two thermal bands located in the atmospheric window between 10-12 mu m. Continuous monitoring of the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard of L8 was performed over two Spanish test sites - Barrax and Donana - in order to contribute to the quality of TIRS data. In this work, a Vicarious Calibration (VC) of the TIRS bands was performed between years 2013-2016 in order to assess the new Stray Light (SL) data correction. The results of VC show us that band 10 and 11 provide accurate results (bias near to zero, and precision around 0.8 K) which is an improvement - especially for band 11 - in comparison to preprocessed SL data. This little better performance has direct influence on Split Window (SW) algorithm, lowering its standard deviation into 0.3 K, as is shown in this work.

T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Neoadjuvant endocrine treatment (NET) is a low-toxicity approach to achieve operability in locally advanced breast cancer, and to facilitate breast conservation in early breast cancer, particular in patients with highly estrogen receptor (ER) positive and HER2-negative disease. Here, we report the results obtained by neoadjuvant letrozole in patients with early breast cancer in a phase-II design.Material and methods: A total of 119 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative operable breast cancer were assigned to four months of neoadjuvant letrozole before definitive surgery. Sentinel node or diagnostic fine needle aspiration cytology procedure was performed prior to treatment and the women were assessed prior, at two months, and before surgery with clinical examination, mammography and ultrasonography. Surgical specimens were examined for pathological response. Primary outcome was pathological and clinical response.Results: The per protocol population consisted of 112 patients. Clinical response was evaluated in 109 patients and pathological response in 108. Overall a mean decrease in tumor size was 15% (p <= .0001). One patient had complete pathological response and 55% of patients had partial pathological response. ER at 100%, ductal subtype, tumor size below 2 cm and lymph node-negative status was significantly associated with a better response to NET and malignancy grade 3 with a poorer response to NET. One patient progressed during treatment and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Eight patients received adjuvant chemotherapy due to lack of response.Conclusion: Neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy is an acceptable strategy in selected postmenopausal patients with ER-rich and HER2-negative early breast cancer with ductal histology and should be considered when chemotherapy either isn't indicated or feasible.

TI  - INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGES IN THE PERCEPTION OF RUSSIAN STUDENTS
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - How are the security issues perceived and evaluated not only by the global world leaders, experts, and scientists, but also by representatives of different social groups? Can their opinions and ideas change anything and reduce the level of international tension, or nothing depends on them? Answers to these questions are the methodological key to understanding the complexity of what is happening in the contemporary world considering the challenges of its global and local security. There must be something encouraging and reducing misunderstandings and mistrust in the field of peace-keeping and harmonization of international relations, even though we recognize the high level of influence of propaganda on the attitudes of people in different countries to the issues of security and other relevant questions in both Russia and throughout the world. The article presents the results of the analysis of the data of a number of surveys conducted among Russian students to find out their attitudes to the issues of global, regional, information and personal security. Based on the sociological research the authors describe how the younger generations (students) in Russia today react to the news on international security issues, how they interpret basic concepts of security and their meanings, what are their expectations, feelings and intentions, goals and fears. The results of the analysis of the students' ideas and representations of the international security issues prove a more positive perception of the future directions of international cooperation and provide more grounds to hope for the joint efforts of the leading countries of the world to counter security threats than one can expect relying on the mass media information, politicians' forecasts and expert community's estimates. Perhaps, this part of the younger generations worldview can be considered irrational and even naive. However, one should take into account that the current social status of this group will inevitably change in the near future, which promises that the Russian participation in the public and political international activities will help to decrease the level of international tension and confrontation. Thus, there are hopes for the development of dialogue forms of relations and paths to trust and joint efforts to counter threats and challenges of global security.

TI  - The synonymy as a source of stylistic invention by Jouve?
T2  - FRANCAIS MODERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the interwar period, literary prose is torn apart between tradition and innovation. The new definition of French literature, since the XIXth century, was built on rejection of rhetoric. However, if we analyse the phenomenon of synonymy in a "new prose" corpus from the twenties, we can emphasize that rhetoric influence is not over yet, especially when the sentences tend toward profusion and complexity. Moreover, the completely innovative style of Pierre-Jean Jouve, a french writer, includes this old instrument in various modern ways. Repetitions and synonyms appear through adjectives and descriptive linguistic tools. They create multiple points of view for the same reality. Every shades of it are therefore suggested. This specific work on language may remind a reader of the tradition of thesaurus. In short, synonymy seems to fit in innovation in prose during the twenties. It contributes to a slight distortion of syntax, in order to express a worldview or for prosodic purposes.

T2  - ACTA MISSIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses a contribution from the relationship between theology and social work. It proposes several values and positions from the field of theology that are now demonstrably relevant also to the work of social workers/helping professionals regardless of their religious affiliation or worldview. Furthermore, it points out the significance of these values and positions for the study programs in the field of social work in which theology is absent. It also discusses the crucial issues (risks) implied by the relationship between theology and social work that have been demonstrated as being significant by both professional experience and empirical research, and which need to be addressed. Subsequently, the paper seeks to propose possible solutions that follow from the deepened social work methods by way of the new approaches that have been enhanced by values and positions from the field of theology. The aim of these approaches is to explore the possibilities of mutual long-term enrichment and relevance for the two fields of study, while possibly contributing towards the simultaneous elimination of their mutual separation.

AB  - Identifying incident (first or new) episodes of illness is critical in sentinel networks to inform about the seasonal onset of diseases and to give early warning of epidemics, as well as differentiating change in health service utilization from change in pattern of disease. The most reliable way of differentiating incident from prevalent cases is through the clinician assigning episode type to the patient's computerized medical record (CMR). However, episode type assignment is often made inconsistently. The objective of this collaborative study between the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RCGP RSC), University of Surrey and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is to develop a methodology to reconstruct missing or miscoded episode types. The data, gathered from the RCGP RSC network of over 230 practices, are analyzed and poor episode typing reconstructed by disease type. The methodology is tested in practices with good episode type data quality. This method could be used to improve prediction of epidemics, and to improve the quality of historical rates retrospectively.

TI  - The Roman Gods outside Rome: Native or Foreign Ones?
T2  - DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of Roman perception of their own gods outside Rome studied through analysis of auspicia militiae. These auspicia assumed a special character due to the rituals performed by a general before he set out for war (the so called "auspicia of exit"). The templum minus (auguraculum) established by a general at the military camp should also be regarded as a part of ager Romanus, where he "communicated" with the gods. Thus, a connection between him and the native gods was created, while they acted exclusively as the gods of Roman territory. Such approach to the matter reflects communal stage in the development of the Roman worldview. At the same time, it contained the origin of universal concept of the future Mediterranean empire.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation coverage seasons are affected by climatic elements and changes in climatic elements influence the vegetation growth period. The purpose of this research is to identify the vegetation coverage seasons of Iran, with the help of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). In this research, 16-day data of Iran's Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was downloaded from MODIS Aqua website from July 14, 2002 to March 14, 2015. Then, on the basis of nearly 10 billion cells, the long-term mean of the 16-day EVI was calculated, and a time-location array was obtained at a dimension of 23*7541502. The results of cluster analysis on the Euclidean distances of this array were investigated by Ward method. This study shows that according to the local pattern of EVI in Iran, there are three different seasons, including a massive/dense season (from the April 14th to the June 1st) that the highest density is in the north and west of Iran, a transition season (from the June 17th to the October 7th) that the highest compression on the Caspian Sea coast, and less severity along the Alborz heights, and the season of thinning (from the October 23rd to the March 29th), the highest density of which is along the coast of the Caspian Sea, on the Khuzestan plain, and also in the southern half of the country.

The author argues that the adherence to this logic has deprived Soviet history of philosophy of the criteria of truth, led to internal contradictions and therefore turned it into a pseudoscience. In the final analysis, Soviet history of philosophy had, in fact, axiological foundations and served generally the purpose of developing the Marxist worldview.

AB  - For older people who transition from hospital to home, home care is an increasingly important and effective way of managing chronic illness with skilled nursing care in the home. Communication between clinicians across care settings is fundamental for continuity of care. Poor communication of patient information is acknowledged to be a root cause of sentinel events. In Scandinavia and the United States, researchers study the communication of patient information from hospital to home care. The health care systems of these two countries differ. Differences are reflected in the characteristics of patients transferred from hospital to home care, as well as the characteristics of health information systems (ICT). These differences help to elucidate key issues related to the transfer of patient information from hospital to home care.

TI  - Detecting Peatland Combustion using Shortwave and Thermal Infrared Landsat-8 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Peatland fires occur every year in Indonesia. These fires usually occur in the dry season due to agricultural and plantation expansion practices, which include slash and burn activities. Peatland combustion fires can be classified into smouldering and flaming. Smouldering is described by lower temperatures, spread rates and combustion power compared with flaming. Most of the standard fire products from remote sensing satellites use an apparent fire temperature at 4 mu m in the Middle Infrared (MIR) and background temperature at 11 mu m in Thermal Infrared (TIR). These products only report combustion in a single term as an "active fire" or "fire hotspot", and do not discriminate between smouldering and flaming states. In this research, the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) and TIR bands of day-time Landsat-8 were explored to discriminate smouldering and flaming states of peatland combustion. Initial identification of possible combustion areas was from visual observation of false colour composite images (bands 764 to RGB) of Landsat-8, which presented smoke plumes in pale bluish tones emanating from a defined ground location. The potential combustion areas were further investigated using an implementation of the Hyperspectral Fire Detection Index based on SWIR of Landsat-8 and named here as the Shortwave Infrared Combustion Index (SICI). Potential combustion areas were also analysed using radiances of the SWIR (band 7) and TIR (band 10), which exhibited values close to their saturation. From these radiances, a radiative transfer model using MODTRAN4 and Planck's law, the fire temperatures were estimated. Preliminary results showed that the flaming states, with higher temperatures than smouldering states, are coincident with SWIR radiances near saturation (24 - 29 Wm(-2)sr(-1)mu m(-1) for band 7) and TIR (band 10) > 12 Wm(-2)sr(-1)mu m(-1), while smouldering states, with lower temperatures, occur near flaming areas with lower SWIR radiance and TIR radiance above 11 Wm(-2)sr(-1)mu m(-1). Based on Landsat-8 imagery on 3rd and 19th August 2015, fire temperatures of flaming areas were estimated at 700 - 758 K, mixtures of flaming and smouldering at 500 - 665 K, and smouldering at 320 - 499 K. This result aligned with prior research that sampled in situ smouldering, smouldering close to flaming, and flaming temperatures taken from Indonesian peatland. The algorithm developed in the research reported here was able to map some combustion areas that could not be mapped using lower spatial resolution imagery from MODIS. However, the results will undergo further investigation for atmospheric influence such as haze and thin cloud. Results also will be validated with other data such as field measurements. The algorithm developed in this research has potential to be used on a routine basis due to the availability of day-time Landsat-8 data which, at best, has a temporal resolution of 16 days. It can also be implemented for forest fire detection at a detailed scale to complement other fire information, but again temporal resolution is an issue. This research is part of a larger project which is utilising automated smoke detection and soil moisture measurement in the mapping of peatland combustion from space imagery.

CL  - Guimaraes, PORTUGAL
AB  - In this work we developed an algorithm for multi-constellation GNSS receivers that selects a limited subset of satellites out of the tracked ones with an optimized location accuracy. As the receivers often have very limited computational resources, the complexity of the algorithm needed to be kept low.The work began with an exploratory analysis of GNSS data. This analysis gave insight into the differences of the various satellite navigation systems as well as into the nature of the pseudorange residuals. These observations helped in shaping the algorithm that we proposed for the problem of satellite selection. The algorithm itself was developed using data science techniques to filter out bad pseudorange measurements and borrowed some earlier ideas to optimize the geometric dilution of precision of the solution set as well.The approach we chose was shown to work very well when applied to real data measured from road tests in varying surroundings. Even with practically non-existent parameter tuning the algorithm was able to spot almost 90% of the bad pseudorange measurements, keeping the specificity, i.e., ability to hold on to the good measurements at over 90% level.The ability to filter out bad pseudorange measurements translated to improved location accuracy as well. All in all, the results achieved in this work proved encouraging enough to begin implementing the algorithm in actual receiver software to study the performance of the data-driven approach in action.

AB  - Atmospheric correction of high resolution satellite scenery is a necessary preprocessing step for applications where bottom of atmosphere (BOA) reflectances are needed. The selection of the best atmospheric correction method to use on images acquired from new platforms, such as Sentinel-2, is essential to provide accurate BOA reflectances. In this work the performance of three atmospheric correction methods (6S, MAJA and SEN2COR) applied to Sentinel-2 scenes are compared by evaluating the resultant spectral signatures of six crop types on two specific dates, and their NDVI time series along a complete year. Although SEN2COR introduced greater corrections, especially in the infrared bands, the results suggest a varying performance of the methods depending on the land cover and the atmospheric conditions. Further research, particularly incorporating ground truth data, is recommended to rigorously validate the different atmospheric methods.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments III
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a multi-scaled phenomenon, i.e., it may occur within a city in different sizes, shapes, intensity and time. As a climatic event, UHI acquires characteristic variations at different temporal scales. In this study, the temporal and spatial variability of the Surface UHI (SUHI) over Delhi was examined for different temporal scales, based on remotely sensed data and thermal data collected during a time frame of 1-year, i.e., from June 2017 to June 2018. During the last few decades, Delhi has experienced unparalleled horizontal and vertical growth, leading to major modifications of land use/cover. Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets of Delhi were generated from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery. LST data, thus, obtained was compared with rural reference data and analysed with respect to the thermal field data. Using these LST maps, average SUHI intensity over Delhi was calculated to be 3.86 degrees C for the whole year. The calculated SUHII showed high values in summer during the day than in winter. The relationship between LST and NDVI for each month was also assessed, which showed strong negative correlation with an average r value of -0.45. Furthermore, the Central Delhi Region and commercial areas displayed heat island conditions almost throughout the year. The results of this study suggest that the monthly variations of SUHI of Delhi are related with the climatic background, local meteorological conditions, and surface characteristics.

AB  - India is facing crucial problem as the other world, by the impact of Global warming which is resulting from climate change. Global warming is an increase in Earth's average surface temperature, land surface temperature (LST) plays a critical role in Global climate change and is used in a range of hydrological, meteorological, and climatological applications. As needed for most modelling and climate analysis applications. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) have found wide application areas in climate change analyses also this can be used for LST calculation. There are various sensor whose data is useful in generating LST such as: advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat-8, and many more. LST can be estimated by using many algorithms i.e. split-window (SW), dual-angle (DA), single-channel (SC). In this paper we have used SW algorithm to estimate LST for Bhopal region using LANDSAT-8 Thermal Infrared bands. SW algorithm uses spectral radiance and emissivity of TIR bands as input for deriving LST. The spectral radiance was estimated using TIR bands and emissivity was calculated using NDVI threshold technique. Finally Land surface temperature for Bhopal region have been estimated and statistics are presented.

AB  - Satellite Image Time Series (SITS), such as the ones acquired by the new Sentinel-2 (S2), combine a large amount of information compared to previous satellite generations since a better trade-off in terms of spatial/spectral/temporal resolutions is guaranteed. The specific characteristic of acquiring images under overlapped orbits, offered by S2, results in: i) availability of irregularly sampled acquisitions and ii) increase of the probability to acquire cloud free images over time. This characteristic becomes relevant in the agricultural analysis, where availability of dense SITS is required to map and analyze fast working crop behaviors. In the literature, several methods exist that extract phenological parameters for agricultural analysis, but none of them is able to deal with irregularly sampled data. Thus, this paper presents an approach for derivation of cropland phenological parameters from irregularly sampled S2-SITS. Experimental results obtained on S2-SITS acquired over Barrax, Spain, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of active movements that could threat the infrastructures and the population is one of the main priorities of the risk management chain. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques represent one of the most useful answers to this task; however, it is difficult to manage the huge amount of information derived from the interferometric analysis. In this work, we present a procedure for deriving impact assessment maps, over a regional test site, using as starting point Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images and a catalogue of elements at risk that acts as a second input of the methodology. We applied the proposed approach, named as Vulnerable Elements Activity Maps (VEAM), to the islands of Gran Canaria, La Gomera and Tenerife (Spain), where we analysed SAR images covering the time interval November 2014-September 2016. The methodology, meant to be a powerful tool for reducing the time needed for a complete analysis of a full stack of InSAR data, is ideally suited for Civil Protection Authorities. The application of the methodology allowed to detect 108 areas affected by active deformation that are threatening one or more elements at risk in 25 municipalities of the three islands.

AB  - Remote sensing applied to the study of air quality has provided new tools for assessing the spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric pollutants. One of the main satellite parameters used is the optical density of aerosols (AOD), which allows quantifying the attenuation of solar radiation in the presence of aerosols within an atmospheric column. This study was evaluated the correlation between the average monthly ODA levels recorded by the MODIS sensor on the Terra and Aqua platforms (products MYD04_3k and MOD04_3k), and the average monthly concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 measured at 5 continuous monitoring stations in the city of Valencia, Spain, over an 8-year period. Correlation was analyzed in each station, excluding those where the correlation was not significant. Thus a ratio of 0.31 (p<0.01, n=87) was obtained for PM10 and 0.49 (p<0.001, n=74) for PM2.5. Based on this, the generated linear models were analyzed and maps of particulate matter were made. These results were similar to those reported in the literature, showing that it is feasible to use these products to assess the spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants.

AB  - The estimation of exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 requires the knowledge of surface concentration at high temporal and spatial resolutions. In this paper, the relation between PM10 and PM.52 ground data and MODIS AOD satellite data has been evaluated to determine the concentration of particulate matter in Valencia, Spain. This was done using data from the Valencian Network of Surveillance and Control of Air Pollution and the scientific data set "Optical Depth Land and Ocean" from MODIS Terra and Aqua with 3km of spatial resolution. The linear regression model for PM10 provided a regression slope of 25.99 mu g.m(-3) and an interception of 12.07 mu g.m(-3) (RMSE = 8.61 mu g.m(-3)), while for PM2.5 the slope and interception were 26.87 mu g.m(-3) and 5.98 mu g.m(-3) (RMSE = 5.5 mu g.m(-3)).

AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SIN) micrometstasis detection improves outcome :for breast cancer follow up procedure. The aim of the present study was to identify gene profiles that accurately predicted the outcome of breast cancer patients. Fifty tumor sample from breast cancer patients were analyzed for the expression of 3 genes using quantitative-PCR. Also clinical verification for recurrence to distant organs was performed. Three gene signature were confirmed based on tumor's stage, grade, ER status, using conditional logistic regression. Based on this findings, the negative reported lymph nodes for metastasis, had micro metastasis in significant values. There Was a significant difference between normal and cancer samples in 3 gene expression marker and also there was meaningful relationship between three gene expression with tumor's grade, stage according to progression of tumor. A novel gene expression signature predictive of micro metastatic patients was evaluated. In this assessment, relationship between this gene with tumor's features that finding clear role for these genes with tumor's outcome, needs to be established.

M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of dendrochronological, lichenometric and historical data with the use of Earth remote sensing materials, the evolution of the Donguz-Orun Glacier has been reconstructed over the past centuries. In this work we used aerial photographs of 1957, 1965, 1981, 1987, satellite image of 2009, as well as descriptions, photographs, maps and plans of the glacier of the 19th and 20th centuries, data of instrumental measurements of the glacier end position in the second half of the 20th - early 21st centuries, dendrochronological dating of pine on the front part of the valley, and juniper to date coastal moraines, and the results of lichenometry studies. It has been established that the Donguz-Orun Glacier in the past had several clearly marked advances about 100, 200 and more than 350 years ago, which are expressed in relief in the form of uneven-aged coastal moraines. Despite the fact that the Donguz-Orun Glacier differs from many mountain -valley glaciers of the Caucasus primarily by its predominantly avalanche feeding and a moraine cover, almost entirely covering its surface, the main periods of its advances are consistent with the known large fluctuations of mountain glaciers during the Little Ice Age in the early 20th, early 19th, and, probably, in the middle of the 17th century. However, unlike most other Caucasian glaciers, the Donguz-Orun Glacier advanced in the 1970s-2000s. The scale of its degradation from the end of the 19th to the beginning of the 21st century is also uncharacteristic for the Caucasus: the reduction in the length for longer than a century period is only about 100 m.

AB  - Smart devices are very popular and are becoming ubiquitous in the modern society, with Android OS as the most widespread operating system on current smartphones/tablets. However, malicious applications is one of the major concerns and fast growing security menaces facing the use of Internet in the Android platform, today. So, we need techniques and methods to address the massive malware attacks. One of the most relevant techniques to disclose sensitive behavior of Android applications during their runtime execution is Dynamic Analysis. Here we proposed a malware detection tool, termed as Network Sentinel, that it can be used for Dynamic DNS request Monitoring of Apps via networking. The main motivation for this work, it is extensively abuse of the DNS by malevolent communities in order to provide Internet connection within malicious networks and botnets. Finally, the experimental results obtained are promising by allowing us to capture the DNS queries requested by the smartphones to remote servers from the collected network traces at very low battery usage.

TI  - Ecological Structure of a Tropical Urban Forest in the Bang Kachao Peninsula, Bangkok
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has changed the structure and function of natural ecosystems, especially floodplain ecosystems in SE Asia. The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area: rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks. We suggest that the application of NDVI for assessments can be useful for future planning, monitoring and management of the BKP and hence may contribute for increasing biodiversity and complexity of these urban forests.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Image Enhancement aims at processing an image in such a manner that the resultant is more appropriate than original image for any specific application. This article focuses on image enhancement, with particular reference to different image fusion and spatial filtering techniques. Statistical analysis of image quality measures was used for evaluating the quality of enhanced images. During the work, image enhancement was carried out in two steps. Firstly, to enhance the spatial resolution, the effectiveness of eight diverse image fusion techniques (brovey, wavelet, IHS, HPF, ehlers, PCT, subtractive, and Hyperspherical Colour Space (HCS)) was examined. These fused images were evaluated using different objective image quality measures like CC, entropy, NLSE, AG, MAD, ERGAS, SD, RASE, PSNR and MAPE. These measures helped in determining the preservation of spectral and spatial integrity in the fused images. Secondly, the enhanced fused image of the best quality was subjected to six different filtering techniques (high pass filter, low pass filter, adaptive, edge enhance, sharpen, and focal analysis). Based on the statistical results of the image quality measures, the image using HCS fusion method followed by low pass filtering or focal analysis is selected as a recommendation for enhancement of an original Landsat image for any specific application.

TI  - An Efficient Marine Oil Spillage Identification Scheme Based on an Improved Active Contour Model Using Fully Polarimetric SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spillage pollution results in damages to marine and coastal environments and ecosystems at all levels. Due to the distinct advantages of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR), it has been widely employed to improve oil spillage event observations. In this paper, with the aim of enhancing ocean oil spillage identification, an improved scheme was proposed, which was mainly based on an active contour model (ACM), with a special emphases on choosing an optimal initial box boundary for the ACM model, and a noise suppressing process. In this proposed scheme, the ACM initial box boundary was chosen to be the median level contour of the imagined mountain if regarding image grey values as elevations. Meanwhile, following Lee filter operator, a Gaussian smooth operator was hired to further weaken the speckle noise, thereby making the evolution of ACM more stable. Three sets of RADARSAT-2 fully Pol-SAR data were used to test of the proposed method. In addition, the current study achieved the first complete comparison of the identification abilities of the ten most common recently used fully Pol-SAR features for oil spills. The experimental results show: 1) The features of H; v; span; P; M-33; and rho possessed good distinguishable abilities for oil spillage detection in sea water. Specially, features span and v outperformed other Pol-SAR features with regard to the elaborate distinguishing identifications of small patches of oil spill objects from other small objects, such as oil platforms or ships; 2) An appropriate setting of the initial box boundary of the ACM was able to accelerate the global search, and eventually led to improvements in the accuracy of the oil spill identification, while simultaneously reducing the computational time; 3) The effective noise suppression was confirmed to be very necessary, guaranteeing stability of the ACM evolution. When compared with other traditional methods, the proposed improved scheme was found to be more effective in the overall identification accuracy (99.8%).

TI  - Multi-Scale Feature Based Land Cover Change Detection in Mountainous Terrain Using Multi-Temporal and Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is frequent in mountainous terrain of southern China. Although remote sensing technology has become an important tool for gathering and monitoring LULC dynamics, image pairs can occur scale changes, noises, geometrical distortions, and illuminated variations if these are acquired from different types of sensors (e.g., satellites). Meanwhile, how to design an efficient land cover change detection algorithm that ensures a high detection rate remains a critical and challenging step. To address these problems, we propose a robust multi-temporal change detection framework for land cover change in mountainous terrain which contains the following contributions. i) To transform multi-temporal remote sensing image pairs acquired by different type of sensors into the same coordinate system by image registration, a multi-scale feature description is generated using layers formed via a pretrained VGG network. ii) A gradually increasing selection of inliers is defined for improving the robustness of feature points registration, and L-2-minimizing estimate (L2E)-based energy optimization is formulated to calculate a reasonable position in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. iii) Fuzzy C-Means classifier is adopted to generate a similarity matrix between image pair of geometric correction, and a robust and contractive change map is built through feature similarity analysis. Extensive experiments on multi-temporal image pairs taken by different type of satellites (e.g., Chinese GF and Landsat) or small unmanned aerial vehicles are conducted. Experimental results show that our method provides better performances in most cases after comparing with the five state-of-the-art image registration methods and the four state-of-the-art change detection methods.

TI  - Assessing satellite-derived net surface radiative flux in the Arctic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived surface radiative fluxes have been recently improved and extended. However, the accuracy of recent satellite-derived surface radiative fluxes in the Arctic is not well characterized. Here, the authors assess the accuracy of the net surface radiative flux (NETSRF) in the Arctic, focusing on the ice-covered ocean, for three satellite products against four in situ measurements collected from different areas in the Arctic. The three satellite products are the Surface Radiation Budget project (SRB), the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), and the Extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder version-2 (APP-x). Our comparisons suggest that: (1) in terms of the overall bias, root-mean-square error, and correlation, the NETSRF of ISCCP is closer to in situ observations than that of SRB and APP-x; (2) in terms of the diurnal variation of the biases, it is not very clear which satellite product is superior to the others; and (3) in terms of the interannual variability of the bias, the NETSRF of ISCCP is more accurate than that of SRB and APP-x. This comparison may provide useful guidance to the community as to which data-set may provide the smallest bias in NETSRF.

TI  - Using satellite remote sensing and numerical modelling for the monitoring of suspended particulate matter concentration during reclamation construction at Dalian offshore airport in China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, remote sensing and numerical modelling were used to monitor the distribution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations induced by a reclamation construction of an offshore artificial island airport in China's Bohai Sea. A hydrodynamic model and a water quality model were used to simulate the SPM diffusion under the actions of tides and currents. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was then developed based on HJ-1A/1B satellite and measured SPM concentrations. The obtained main results are as follows: (1) The dispersion area of SPM with a concentration higher than 10 mg/I obtained by the numerical model was approximately 105.15 km (2); (2) The developed ANN model provided an excellent relationship between the measured and retrieved SPM concentrations, with R- 2 = 0.97 and mean relative error (MRE) of 30%, at the model validation phase; (3) The SPM distribution obtained by the numerical model showed a qualitatively similar pattern with that obtained by the ANN model, indicating the modelled SPM distribution was credible. Thus, when the distribution of SPM concentrations cannot be derived from the satellite images due to weather conditions, the numerical model can be used to simulate the SPM distribution in the sea area around the construction.

TI  - Improving Selection of Spectral Variables for Vegetation Classification of East Dongting Lake, China, Using a Gaofen-1 Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a large amount of remote sensing data available for land use and land cover (LULC) classification and thus optimizing selection of remote sensing variables is a great challenge. Although many methods such as Jeffreys-Matusita (JM) distance and random forests (RF) have been developed for this purpose, the existing methods ignore correlation and information duplication among remote sensing variables. In this study, a novel approach was proposed to improve the measures of potential class separability for the selection of remote sensing variables by taking into account correlations among the variables. The proposed method was examined with a total of thirteen spectral variables from a Gaofen-1 image, three class separability measures including JM distance, transformed divergence and B-distance and three classifiers including Bayesian discriminant (BD), Mahalanobis distance (MD) and RF for classification of six LULC types at the East Dongting Lake of Hunan, China. The results showed that (1) The proposed approach selected the first three spectral variables and resulted in statistically stable classification accuracies for three improved class separability measures. That is, the classification accuracies using three or more spectral variables statistically did not significantly differ from each other at a significant level of 0.05; (2) The statistically stable classification accuracies obtained by integrating MD and BD classifiers with the improved class separability measures were also statistically not significantly different from those by RF; (3) The numbers of the selected spectral variables using the improved class separability measures to create the statistically stable classification accuracies by MD and BD classifiers were much smaller than those from the original class separability measures and RF; and (4) Three original class separability measures and RF led to similar ranks of importance of the spectral variables, while the ranks achieved by the improved class separability measures were different due to the consideration of correlations among the variables. This indicated that the proposed method more effectively and quickly selected the spectral variables to produce the statistically stable classification accuracies compared with the original class separability measures and RF and thus improved the selection of the spectral variables for the classification.

AB  - Sea ice type classification is critically important for sea ice monitoring, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become the main data source for sea ice classification. With a large number of SAR images produced every day, a more intelligent sea ice classification process is urgently needed. In this paper, we constructed a four-type sea ice classification dataset using Sentinel-1 SAR images with the reference of Canadian Ice Service's ice charts and designed a residual convolution network for sea ice classification: Sea Ice Residual Convolutional Network (SI-Resnet). We further designed a multi-model average scoring strategy with the idea of ensemble learning to improve the classification accuracy between closely-associated ice types. Based on the experiments, our proposed method outperformed MLP, AlexNet, and traditional SVM methods, reaching the overall accuracy of 94% and Kappa coefficient of 91.9. For the evaluation on regional ice concentration, the values computed from the SI-Resnet's classification results are more consistent with ice chart's regional concentration data than those of MLP, AlexNet and SVM. Compared with the manually generated ice chart of CIS, our method can work automatically and provide more detailed ice distribution to a useful reference for ship route planning and sea ice changes monitoring.

AB  - Urban parks are important bird habitat in cities. Various studies have evaluated the habitat function of urban parks focused on field surveys. In this study, we performed applicability of NDVI obtained from Landsat 8 OLI image as a factor for spatial planning considered bird diversity. This study was classified with green boundary into three groups using NDVI’s value. Environmental variables were calculated by the green area ratio of the surrounding area from 100m to 500m at each groups. The 20 environmental variables such as park area, park shape index, canopy of tree, etc. were derived, the regression analysis was performed as a dependent variable for the bird diversity of urban parks. As a result, the park area and the green area ratio of Group 3, classified high NDVI, within the 100m buffer were adopted as the variables in the regression model. In other words, it was confirmed that as the park becomes larger, the distribution of key green areas within a radius of 100m of the parks becomes higher, the diversity of bird species has increased. It was appropriate to use satellite image, NDVI to analyze species diversity in urban area.

TI  - Global Estimates of Ecosystem Service Value and Change: Taking Into Account Uncertainties in Satellite-based Land Cover Data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global estimates of ecosystem service value (ESV) and change are often produced using satellite-based land cover maps. However, uncertainties in global land cover data and their impacts on ESV estimation have not been fully recognized. Considerably inflated estimates of land cover change and ESV change could be derived using a direct map comparison approach when classification uncertainties are not explicitly taken into account. This study collected all available global land cover datasets and applied an ensemble approach to derive the range and central tendency of terrestrial ESV estimates. Different input data caused ESV estimate varying between 35.0 and 56.5 trillion Ind/year. Wetland classes, albeit having the highest per unit value, were the most uncertain classes mapped using satellite data. To reduce uncertainty, a spatial data harmonization procedure was developed, which resulted in an improved ESV estimate at 49.4 trillion Ind/year. The study further illustrated the quantification of changes in forest ESV using a high-resolution global forest cover change dataset. An ESV loss of 716.0 billion Ind/year was estimated between 2000 and 2012 a result representing one fifth of previous estimates. These findings highlighted the importance of improving the characterization and monitoring of land cover for global ESV and change estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Examining human heat stress with remote sensing technology
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat stress as an environmental hazard which can seriously affect productivity, health, or even survival of individuals has long been studied. Despite the endeavors that have been made to address the issue quantitatively with various heat stress indices, they are often measured at scatter sites. This research devotes to revealing human heat stress within continuous space with remote sensing technology. The study began with the retrieval of dry-bulb temperature from land surface temperature (LST) with empirical models. As wet-bulb temperature was calculated from dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, discomfort index (DI) as an indicator of heat stress was revealed for the study area at 1 km spatial resolution for three summer days. Results indicated that DI can be derived within continuous space with remotely sensed data, and its spatial distribution can be dramatically affected by relative humidity. Further comparison between DI and LST indicated that LST as a widely utilized indicator of surface thermal condition fails to address human heat stress as environmental factors such as relative humidity are not taken into account.

TI  - CHANGES OF THE TIDAL SAND RIDGES IN THE SOUTHERN YELLOW SEA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The large-scale fan-shaped tidal sand ridges in the south Yellow Sea along the Jiangsu Coast is characterized by a special geomorphology system in landform feature and in hydrodynamic conditions. This paper deals mainly with the changes of beach profile, tidal troughs in the sand ridges and present movement of the total tidal sand ridges using satellite images, bathymetric maps and field survey data. The results show that the tidal sand ridges are in a stage of separation with the number of sand ridges increasing and the average area of each ridge decreasing. The movement of tidal sand ridges in this area is affected by tidal currents and submarine topography. Tidal sand ridges formed rapidly and the tidal troughs were developed greatly in the condition of tidal current; the migration of main tidal troughs are the main drive of the whole sand ridges' changes and directly affect the shift direction of big sand ridges. Sand ridges tend to be accumulated in center area and outer area eroded.

AB  - Pastoralism that keeps livestock in the dry areas of grassland is the most appropriate economic activity. The work of art in which the aesthetic sense of nomads is best exhibited in grassland nomadic culture is the animal style metalwork. Saka people established grassland Silk Road connecting the East and the West, mainly around the nomadic economy in which they kept livestock like sheep in dry steppes.Saka’s elite class Kurgan shows the common aspect of gold jewelry or the decoration of golden artifacts on the costume, although there was a certain difference in the level of the kind or quantity of the grave goods. It is judged that these animals were related to the identity of the upper class that ruled the Saka society. Animal styles consist of imaginary animals, in which several animals were mixed like Griffin or twisted animals distorted with a posture, hard to see in the actual nature. There is an opinion that these animals were expressed out of a shamanistic hope for the power not possessed by humans, but it is judged that they were an expression of the worldview of the nomads who lived in the grassland in the dry climate.This study examined the animal styles of the golden tile decorations on a golden man’s hat and belt of Issyk Kurgan between the 4th century BC and the 3rd century BC, located in the Jetisu area, Kazakhstan, which was Saka people’s central zone. The golden man in the period when Saka people had an ancient state system of the league was a figure in the elite class. This study considered the golden man’s costume a special dress worn at the ritual of Saka.Various animals such as sheep, tiger, bird, deer, and horse were those composed, reflecting the Saka people’s worldview. Saka people considered the universe a vertical axis consisting of the lower world, the middle world, and the upper world and identified the highest peak as the sun. Accordingly, it was judged that a golden horn sheep symbolizing the sun was decorated at the tip of the golden man’s hat. In addition, the belt where bird-headed antler tines were expressed was interpreted as serving as a mediator in ascending to heaven.The hat with gold horn sheep decorated at the top was found also in the golden man in the Arzhan-2 Tomb in the 7th century B.C., a much earlier period than Issyk Kurgan. In addition, on the hat worn by Priestess of Sarmatian Taksai-Ⅰ No. 6 Tomb No. 3, gold horn sheep was also discovered at the top. In addition, on this hat, long gold pendants were hanging on both sides, passing the human temple part.These pendants were judged to mean the staircase ascending to heaven.

AB  - On the 2016, two large earthquakes occurred continuously on April 14 and April 16 in Kumamoto prefecture, Japan. Satellite remote sensing with periodic observation characteristics is one of effective observation methods for survey of disaster situation and continuous monitoring of land cover. In this study, the purpose was to evaluate the restoration situation of the damaged building by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. Using the high-resolution satellite data of Worldview-3 observed after the disaster and one year after the disaster, the texture index by Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix was calculated and the distribution situation was evaluated. As a result, it was recognized that the value of dissimilarity differs depending on the damage of the building after the disaster and one year after the disaster and the recovery situation. In addition, we examined the extractability of the removed building by normalizing the dissimilarity after the disaster and one year after the disaster.

TI  - Value of Intraoperative Cytological and Pathological Sentinel Lymph Node Diagnosis in Fertility-Sparing Trachelectomy for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Trachelectomy, a fertility-sparing surgery for early-stage cervical cancer, can be performed only when there is no extrauterine extension present. Therefore, identifying the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and using them to obtain an intraoperative pathologic diagnosis can provide information on the feasibility and safety of trachelectomy. Our aim was to assess the value of an intraoperative SLN diagnosis. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the accuracy of intraoperative imprint cytology and frozen-section examination in 201 patients at our institution in whom trachelectomy was planned. Results: All patients could be evaluated for SLNs; a total of 610 SLNs were analyzed. Although the specificity of both imprint cytology and frozen-section examination was 100.0%, the sensitivity was only 58.6 and 65.5%, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity was higher in 2-mm slices along the short axis than on bisection along the longitudinal axis. Imprint cytology correctly diagnosed 2 patients who had false-negative results on frozen section. The nature of the metastatic foci that caused an intraoperative false-negative diagnosis was either micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells. Conclusions: The accuracy of intraoperative SLN diagnosis requires improvement, especially when small metastatic foci are present. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Remotely sensed data is affected due to presence of shadow effects over undulating terrain surface. The topographic effects suppress the vital information of land surface and also affects the classification of accuracy assessment. In this paper, different shadow removing or topographic correction (TC) algorithms have been implemented with an aim to investigate their impact on land-use and land-cover (LULC) classification using moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor satellite data. To ensure its validity, visual, statistical, graphical analyses and accuracy assessment procedures have been performed. The experimental outcomes have shown that detection and effective removal of shadow effects from the Himalayan terrain provides improvement of assessment of LULC classification.

AB  - Clustering is one of the most important steps in the data processing pipeline. Of all the clustering techniques, perhaps the most widely used technique is K-Means. However, K-Means does not necessarily result in clusters which are spatially connected and hence the technique remains unusable for several remote sensing, geoscience and geographic information science (GISci) data. In this article, we propose an extension of K-Means algorithm which results in spatially connected clusters. We empirically verify that this indeed is true and use the proposed algorithm to obtain most significant group of waterbodies mapped from multispectral image acquired by IRS LISS-III satellite.

TI  - Economic Development of City Marketing on the Basis of Its Historical and Cultural Heritage
T2  - HELIX
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current globalization of the market, the vast majority of the society has changed its worldview under the current conditions for development of socio-economic relations. It became clear that a new economic era is coming, and the post-industrial transition contains powerful challenges. Cities began to lose their traditional production functions, and there was a need to create their new competitive advantages in the changed conditions. One of the modern directions that allow solving this problem is "city marketing". The article is aimed at researching the essence of city marketing on the basis of studying its historical and cultural heritage, as well as determining how historical and cultural heritage affects the city's economic development. The leading approach to this research is the interpretative approach to the development and use of historical and cultural heritage in the city's marketing activity. The main results of the article are: definition of the role of city marketing while creating a positive image of the city; perspective directions for the development of the city's marketing activity, the use of which is necessary for the development of marketing strategy; directions for the development of cities' potential in the Volga Federal District of the Russian Federation (using the example of Samara and Saratov) while disclosing their unique features. The materials of the article can be useful informing a marketing strategy for the city development, as well as improving the efficiency of the management system of municipalities.

Different methods were used for this purpose: two artificial neural networks (ANN) and three decision trees forests. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of LiDAR data significantly improved the classifications in all methods. Excluding the Convolutional Neural Network, the classification algorithms had a nearly similar performance, and none of them achieved the best accuracy for all adopted classes. Forest by Penalizing Attributes (FPA) attained the best general result, with a Kappa index of 0.92, while Rotation Forest obtained the best result in the classification of the two vegetation classes.

TI  - Assessing large area forest cover products derived from the same imaging source across Victoria, Australia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover products are an essential tool for land managers and policy makers. They are used at a variety of spatial scales to inform decision-making and policy across a range of ecosystem drivers and services. This article compares three forest cover products (FCP), all of which were created using Landsat satellite imagery, but using different methodologies and covering different spatial extents that range from global to state. It also explores their use and utility across the state of Victoria, Australia. It asks the question, how interchangeable are the forest cover maps? FCP are also validated against a very high-resolution reference data set. Overall accuracy was around 89% for the state and national FCP, and 84% for the global FCP. The global map produced the lowest estimate of total forest cover, while estimates obtained by the national and state FCP were similar across the study area. Spatially, differences, however, were apparent. The national forest cover map obtained higher estimates across most of Victoria except in the most arid region which is dominated by low open woodland. While the national and global scale forest cover maps were found to have good diagnostic ability for large area assessment and reporting, their use for land management is not optimal and can lead to gross error.

TI  - Assessing two large area burnt area products across Australian Southern Forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burnt area is a critical parameter for estimating emissions of greenhouse gases associated with biomass burning. Several burnt area products (BAPs) derived from Earth Observation satellites/sensors have been released; these are based on different spatial resolutions and derived using different methodologies so that accuracies can vary amongst them. This study validates a global (MODIS) and a national (AVHRR) BAP across Australian southern forests using two reference datasets: state fire histories (SFHs) from 2000 to 2013 and a forest cover map derived through high resolution air photo interpretation (API). The spatial and temporal agreement between fires in the BAPs and reference SFH were analysed based on 2610 sample points representative of Australian southern forest types (successful detection was evaluated according to fire type: planned burn vs. wildfire, size of fire, and land tenure). Results show that both BAPs were most successful when identifying large wildfires (>5000 ha). Overall accuracy for AVHRR and MODIS was 73.9% and 62.5%, respectively. When compared to the API derived forest cover map as reference dataset, both products achieved higher overall accuracies (94.1% for AVHRR and 87.1% for MODIS); an expected result given that the fires detected in this dataset are known to be observable using Earth observation data. But regardless of reference dataset, the AVHRR BAP which is tailored to Australian conditions achieved better results than the MODIS global BAP. Also, the AVHRR archive in Australia goes back to 1988, which is an important consideration for calculating wildfire history for greenhouse gas accounting.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza is a vaccine preventable disease that causes important morbidity and mortality worldwide. Estimating the burden of influenza disease is difficult. However, there are some methods based in surveillance data and laboratory testing that can be used for this purpose.ObjectivesEstimating the burden of serious illness from influenza by means of hospitalization and death records during the period between 2012 and 2014, and using information from Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance.MethodsTo estimate the Chilean rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths, we applied the influenza positivity of respiratory samples tested in six SARI surveillance sentinel hospitals to the hospitalizations and deaths from the records with ICD-10 codes from influenza and pneumonia.ResultsAnnually, 5320 people are hospitalized for influenza and 447 die for this cause. The annual influenza-associated hospitalization rate for the period was 71.5/100000 person-year for <5years old, 11.8/100000 person-year for people between 5 and 64years old; and 156.0/100000 person-year for 65years. The annual mortality rate for the period was 0.08/100000 person-year for <5years; 0.3/100000 person-year for people between 5 and 64years; and 22.8/100000 person-year for 65years.ConclusionsThis is the first study of influenza burden in Chile. Every year an important quantity of hospitalizations and deaths result from influenza infection. In countries in temperate zones, it is important to know the burden of influenza in order to prepare the health care network and to assess preventive intervention currently in practice and the new ones to implementing.

TI  - Mapping groundwater recharge potential zones in arid region using GIS and Landsat approaches, southeast Tunisia
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of population and agricultural and industrial activities has caused an increase in demand on the Jeffara aquifers of Gabes (southeast Tunisia). In fact, the over-pumping of this aquifer system has resulted in water-level declines ranging from 0.25 to 1 m/year during the past three decades. The aim of this study is to identify favourable artificial recharge sites of this aquifer system based on the combined use of remotely sensed data, a geographic information system (GIS), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) product and a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) technique. The delineation of artificial recharge zones shows high to moderate potential for groundwater recharge (40%) in the Gabes region, with high precision of good potential proposed sites. Recharge processes need to account for natural conditions and ecosystems.

TI  - Size, spines and crochets: defences of luna moth caterpillars against predation by brown anoles
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-testing predator-prey interactions between invasive exotic brown anole lizards and sentinel larvae of the luna moth, Actias luna, suggests that late instars of this saturniid, and perhaps many other saturniids, are well defended by their spines and crochets against predation by lizards. However, Actias luna larvae remain vulnerable to anole predation until they reach about 3 cm in length. In contrast, even relatively small caterpillars that are chemically defended, such as those of the io moth, Automeris io, and the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, were shown to be well defended against anoles by their toxins. There is an obvious advantage for caterpillars to be chemically defended. However, there is also a tradeoff: Danaus plexippus are restricted to feeding on a relatively small group of plants, which limits resources and requires specialisation; in polyphagous Automeris io, the constant production of elaborate spines and toxin leads to prolonged larval development, which is at least twice as long as that of Actias luna, and exposes the caterpillars to mortality factors such as parasitism for a longer duration.

TI  - The spirituality of Celtic Art: Study of the Battersea Shield under the Panofskyan optics
T2  - NUMEN-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS E PESQUISA DA RELIGIAO
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the theme: religious art present in Celtic artistic production. It's known that in the heyday of Celtic people, the idea of art and religion wasn't outlined as it's today. Their artifacts and weapons of war weren't disconnected from their spirituality and worship of the Gods. The main objective of this work is to understand how the religious worldview of Celtic people is represented in the Battersea Shield production, through the application of Panofsky's iconology: the primary or natural meaning; secondary or conventional one and intrinsic or content. It's concluded that there's a religious intentionality in Celtic artifacts, just as everything in their daily life that was guided by the worship of the Gods and their spiritual worldview.

TI  - Commentary on the clinical and preclinical dosage limits of interstitially administered magnetic fluids for therapeutic hyperthermia based on current practice and efficacy models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We offer a critique of what constitutes a suitable dosage limit, in both clinical and preclinical studies, for interstitially administered magnetic nanoparticles in order to enable therapeutic hyperthermia under the action of an externally applied alternating magnetic field. We approach this first from the perspective of the currently approved clinical dosages of magnetic nanoparticles in the fields of MRI contrast enhancement, sentinel node detection, iron replacement therapy and magnetic thermoablation. We compare this to a simple analytical model of the achievable hyperthermia temperature rise in both humans and animals based on the interstitially administered dose, the heating and dispersion characteristics of the injected fluid, and the strength and frequency of the applied magnetic field. We show that under appropriately chosen conditions a therapeutic temperature rise is achievable in clinically relevant situations. We also show that in such cases it may paradoxically be harder to achieve the same therapeutic temperature rise in a preclinical model. We comment on the implications for the evidence-based translation of hyperthermia based interventions from the laboratory to the clinic.

TI  - A Supramolecular Approach for Liver Radioembolization
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hepatic radioembolization therapies can suffer from discrepancies between diagnostic planning (scout-scan) and the therapeutic delivery itself, resulting in unwanted side-effects such as pulmonary shunting. We reasoned that a nanotechnology-based pre-targeting strategy could help overcome this shortcoming by directly linking pre-interventional diagnostics to the local delivery of therapy.Methods: The host-guest interaction between adamantane and cyclodextrin was employed in an in vivo pre-targeting set-up. Adamantane (guest)-functionalized macro albumin aggregates (MAA-Ad; d = 18 mu m) and (radiolabeled) Cy5 and beta-cyclodextrin (host)-containing PIBMA polymers (Tc-99m-Cy5(0.5)CD(10)PIBMA(39); MW similar to 18.8 kDa) functioned as the reactive pair. Following liver or lung embolization with (Tc-99m)-MAA-Ad or (Tc-99m)-MAA (control), the utility of the pre-targeting concept was evaluated after intravenous administration of Tc-99m-Cy5(0.5)CD(10)PIBMA(39).Results: Interactions between MAA-Ad and Cy5(0.5)CD(10)PIBMA(39) could be monitored in solution using confocal microscopy and were quantified by radioisotope-based binding experiments. In vivo the accumulation of the MAA-Ad particles in the liver or lungs yielded an approximate ten-fold increase in accumulation of Tc-99m-Cy5(0.5)CD(10)PIBMA(39) in these organs (16.2 % ID/g and 10.5 % ID/g, respectively) compared to the control. Pre-targeting with MAA alone was shown to be only half as efficient. Uniquely, for the first time, this data demonstrates that the formation of supramolecular interactions between cyclodextrin and adamantane can be used to drive complex formation in the chemically challenging in vivo environment.Conclusion: The in vivo distribution pattern of the cyclodextrin host could be guided by the pre-administration of the adamantane guest, thereby creating a direct link between the scout-scan (MAA-Ad) and delivery of therapy.

AB  - This study focuses on the monitoring of the shoreline in the bay of Sendai with high spatial resolution satellite images, after the Tohoku Tsunami, with the presence of foam which usually leads to an invalid shoreline detection. The monitoring uses multispectral classifications: Several distances for multispectral classifications are compared: Euclidian distance (ED), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) or Mahalanobis Distance (MAH) in order to classify pixels into three classes: land, foam and water. The fusion between water and foam classes shows a separation between water and land. Results of each method are compared to the validation data. This comparison is operated with WorldView-2 multispectral images (8 bands, 2 m resolution) acquired before and after the Tohoku tsunami. The MAH is the distance delivering the best results.

TI  - Culture-Based Metaphors in Traditional Bemba Narratives: Relevance for African Teaching Contexts
T2  - LANGUAGE MATTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses metaphors in traditional Bemba narratives and demonstrates their thematic relevance in African literature classrooms today. Based on Sharifian's theory of cultural conceptualisations and Lakoff and Johnson's view of metaphor as a conceptual phenomenon, the article explores African cultural views relating to land, food and ubuntu. The ongoing contestation over land is revealed in the conceptual chasm between the Western "THE LAND IS MINE" versus the embodiment implicit in the indigenous metaphor, "THE LAND IS ME" and in eating and enrichment conceptualisations in African English. The traditional African worldview is founded on the kinship-in-community model, encapsulated in the term ubuntu. The article promotes an African cultural perspective by means of textual analysis of Zambian narratives, sourced by Mwelwa. In the process of the analysis, the underpinning cultural conceptualisations are interrogated with the aim of countering the continued hegemony of Western cultural values in African literature classrooms.

TI  - Claude Gadroys and a Cartesian Astrology
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN STUDIES-ROMANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - When Descartes made his scientific work public, he ushered in a worldview based almost entirely on mechanical motion, which brought along a complete rejection of "occult" forces. Thus, the foundation of astrology was equally rejected by many prominent Cartesians. However, the popularity of Descartes' system lead to its rapid adoption by many subjects, astrology included. Here, I will take a look at the curious case of Claude Gadroys, whose primary work, Discours sur les influences des astres (1671), defends a mechanical account of astrology that accords with Descartes' principles.Gadroys' Discours employs a sophisticated strategy to rehabilitate astrology of the 17th century against Pico della Mirandola, among other critics. Gadroys' theory even incorporates Descartes' discovery, contra the scholastics, that the sublunary and celestial spheres do not differ in kind. Surprisingly, Gadroys uses Descartes' discovery to substantiate the stars influencing the Earth, whereas earlier astrologers required such a distinction. Gadroys' adoption of Cartesian philosophy highlights two major theses. First, the advent of mechanical philosophy in no way necessitated the downfall of astrology; instead, it merely changed the direction of astrological explanation for those that followed current science. Second, it shows the selective nature of Cartesian explanation and hypotheses.

AB  - Remote sensing and satellite imagery have become commonplace in efforts to monitor and model various biological and physical characteristics of the Earth. The land water interface is a continually evolving landscape of high scientific and societal interest, making the mapping and monitoring thereof particularly important. This paper aims at describe a new automated method of shoreline position detection through the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images derived from European Space Agency (ESA) satellites. The resultant delineated shorelines are validated against those derived from video-monitoring systems extracted and in-situ monitoring; a mean distance of 1 to 3.51 pixels is found.

AB  - Glenn D. Paige pioneered in the revolutionary development of a far-reaching transformation of science, academia, and society from a killing to a nonkilling worldview, values, and attitudes. For six decades, anthropology has been accumulating scientific empirical evidence and rational arguments demonstrating that nonkilling societies exist, thereby rebutting the simplistic biological determinist myth that human nature inevitably and universally generates violence and war. Nevertheless, Hobbessians persist in their echo chamber advertising and celebrating the innate depravity of the human species as apologists for war and peace resisters. This systemic bias operates in synergy with the American industrial-military-media-academic complex and culture, the latter exemplified by a revealing comparison of war and football. With great intellectual courage and creative thinking, Paige critically challenges the anachronistic Hobbesian paradigm and offers a far more compelling and positive alternative for sustainable peace in the future.

TI  - Effect of Sea Level Changes on the Groundwater Quality along the Coast of Ernakulam District, Kerala
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea Level Rise (SLR) is considered as one of the effects of climate change that leads to Salt Water Intrusion (SWI) into the coastal areas around the world, thereby contaminating the groundwater and making it unusable for household and irrigation purposes along the coastal areas. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to analyze the change in sea level and shoreline and the consequent changes on the quality of groundwater in lowland and midland areas of Ernakulam district, Kerala. The tidal gauge data were sourced from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSML) to assess the changes in sea level during 1971-2007. Remote sensing data was utilized for estimating the shoreline changes along the coast of the district using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The physical and chemical properties of groundwater were sourced for 27 locations from Central Ground Water Board (CGWB). Ionic ratios were computed to assess the salinity levels in the sampling locations. Sodium percentage (Na %) and potential salinity were computed for determining SWI and the suitability of the groundwater usage for domestic and irrigation purpose. Spatial variation of pH, EC, TDS and ionic ratios were assessed in the GIS environment through IDW interpolation. Findings indicate a rising trend in sea level at the rate of 1.8 mm/yr along the coast of the study area. Shoreline accretion and erosion was also observed at different locations along the coast during 2002-2012, though the rate of change varied across the shoreline. In general, water has shown slight alkaline nature, with pH varying from 7.2 to 8.2 at some locations, particularly along the coast. Higher values of EC and TDS were also observed along the coastal aquifer and may be ascribed to SWI. Sodium percentage (Na %) and potential salinity suggest presence of salt water. However, groundwater in majority of the areas especially away from the coast is good for domestic and irrigation uses. This study showed the groundwater quality deterioration, mainly due to the intrusion of sea water, particularly along the coastal areas of the Ernakulam district.

T2  - GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES IN LAND RESOURCES MAPPING, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Micro level planning (MLP), sometimes also called as grassroots level planning or cadastral level planning, is a developmental planning exercise, which requires detailed spatial database on presently available natural resources in the area in terms of geology, geomorphology, soil resources, groundwater and surface water resources, rivers/streams, and land use/land cover. Though abundant data is available, not much of it is properly organized and analyzed, which has resulted in limited outcome and wastage of available resources. By making this resource information available to the people at grassroots level in easy and user-friendly manner, planning process could be catalyzed at micro level. Geospatial technologies, i.e., satellite remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), information technology (IT), and geographic information system (GIS), have the capability in generation and integration of datasets derived from various sources. In recent decades, satellite remote sensing data has improved continuously in terms of the spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. This has led to revolutionary change in mapping in two ways -one, in terms of spatial extent, and, two, in terms of information content that can be mapped. Information derived from remote sensing data can be used in conjunction with other field data for prioritization and characterization of areas for micro level planning enabling us to prepare village cadastral level development plans. Further, remote sensing and GIS technology is also used in monitoring and evaluation of the implemented developmental plans mainly to assess the overall improvement in the health of the micro-watershed or gram panchayat (village) and to evaluate the long-term effects and impact of the developmental activities taken up.

AB  - Active microwave remote sensing data has become an important source to retrieve crop biophysical parameters due to its unique sensitivity towards geometrical, structural and dielectric properties of various crop components. The temporal variability of various crop biophysical parameters during crop cycle has significant impact on the overall crop yield. In this study, two RISAT-1 hybrid polarimetric temporal SAR datasets at similar to 32 degrees incidence angle were acquired during 2015 Kharif season. The in-situ leaf area index (LAI) values from seventeen paddy fields were measured in synchrony to the satellite passes during both the campaigns. Analysis observed the decreasing trend of backscattering coefficients (sigma(RH)degrees, sigma(RV)degrees) with increase in LAI. Results indicate that the sensitivity of hybrid polarimetric parameters towards LAI, also depends on the change in crop structure due to crop growth. This study investigate the sensitivity of backscattering coefficients (sigma(RH)degrees, sigma(RV)degrees) and polarimetric parameters (even bounce, odd bounce and volume component) generated from m-delta, m-chi and m-alpha space decompositions towards LAI using empirical analysis. An increase of 0.16 in R-2 (from 0.63 to 0.79) clearly indicates that the polarimetric parameters (even bounce, odd bounce and volume component) are more sensitive to LAI of paddy crop than the backscattering coefficients (sigma(RH)degrees, sigma(RV)degrees). It has been identified that the combined use of backscattering coefficients as well as polarimetric parameters (even bounce, odd bounce and volume component) in the model, can significantly improve the accuracy of the LAI estimation.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Comprehensive information on soil resources in terms of type, extent, physical and chemical properties and limitations/capabilities is required for optimal management of land resources and monitoring changes in land qualities. The technological advancements in the remote sensing have revolutionized the land resource inventory and mapping process. The advantage of remote sensing data is that it provides synoptic view of the terrain, which enables to understand the relief, land use and drainage conditions for better delineation of landform-soil units. Further, digital elevation models (DEMs) have facilitated surface parameterization by attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, flow accumulation, plan and profile curvature to obtain relief or surface topography units. Hyperspectral remote sensing and soil spectroscopy data can be analysed using statistical and chemometric techniques to derive information about wide variety of soil attributes, which can be used for digital soil mapping.

TI  - Detecting Forest Cover and Ecosystem Service Change Using Integrated Approach of Remotely Sensed Derived Indices in the Central Districts of Uganda
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests in Uganda have experienced both spatial and temporal modifications from different drivers which need to be monitored to assess the impacts of such changes on ecosystems and prevent related risks of reduction in ecosystem service benefits. Ground investigations may be complex because of dual ownership, whereas remote sensing techniques and GIS application enable a fast multi-temporal detection of changes in forest cover and offer a cost-effective option for inaccessible areas and their use to detect ecosystem service change. The overarching goal of this study was to use satellite measurements to study forest change and link it to ecosystem service benefit reduction (fresh water) in the study area using a representative sample of Landsat scenes, also testing whether the inclusion of ecosystem service benefits improves the classification. In this paper, an integrated approach of remotely derived indices was used together with post-classification comparison to detect forest cover and ecosystem service changes. Our contribution novelty is the ability to detect at multi-temporal scale private and central reserve forest cover decline along with ecosystem benefit reduction using remotely derived indices in the 20 year period (1986-2005). Change detection analysis showed that forest cover declined significantly in five sub-counties of Mpigi, than in Butambala by 5.99%, disturbed forest was 3%, farm land increased by 44%, grassland declined by 62.5% and light vegetation increased by63.6%. The two most affected areas also experienced fresh water reductions. For sustainable supply of ecosystem service benefits, resource managers must also involve private resource owners in the conservation effort.

TI  - Estimating post-fire debris-flow hazards prior to wildfire using a statistical analysis of historical distributions of fire severity from remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following wildfire, mountainous areas of the western United States are susceptible to debris flow during intense rainfall. Convective storms that can generate debris flows in recently burned areas may occur during or immediately after the wildfire, leaving insufficient time for development and implementation of risk mitigation strategies. We present a method for estimating post-fire debris-flow hazards before wildfire using historical data to define the range of potential fire severities for a given location based on the statistical distribution of severity metrics obtained from remote sensing. Estimates of debris-flow likelihood, magnitude and triggering rainfall threshold based on the statistically simulated fire severity data provide hazard predictions consistent with those calculated from fire severity data collected after wildfire. Simulated fire severity data also produce hazard estimates that replicate observed debris-flow occurrence, rainfall conditions and magnitude at a monitored site in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California. Future applications of this method should rely on a range of potential fire severity scenarios for improved pre-fire estimates of debris-flow hazard. The method presented here is also applicable to modelling other post-fire hazards, such as flooding and erosion risk, and for quantifying trends in observed fire severity in a changing climate.

AB  - Topographical information is fundamental to many geospatial related information and applications on Earth. Remote sensing satellites have the advantage in such fields because they are capable of global observation and repeatedly. One of the newest free of charge global digital surface model (DSM) is ALOS World 3D 30m mesh (AW3D30) and it is provided by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The AW3D30 version 1 released on May 2016 and on March 2017 the newer version 1.1 released with changes in specific areas. In Greece, the National Trigonometric Network established by the Hellenic Military Geographic Service (HMGS), the network includes 26,739 trigonometric control points but are not systematically maintained and many do not exist anymore. The trigonometric control points located in areas without vegetation, so the vegetation height does not influence the comparison. This paper calculates the vertical difference of the AW3D30 DSM and the trigonometric survey points of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order. Also, a map identifying the areas with low and high height difference is presented.

T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The aim of this study is to monitor the post-fire recovery of forest ecosystems on the basis of remote aerospace methods and data. To achieve this goal, a hybrid model for styding the dynamics of recovery processes of forest ecosystems after fire was developed. Based on the Greenness Tasseled cap component, Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI) was obtained and used as input data in combination with vegetation indices (NDVI, MCARI2). NDGI is an index for vegetation dynamic assessment based on orthogonal transformation of satellite images from Sentinel-2. NDGI shows the vegetation dynamic change depending on temporal periods. The values of this index range from +1 to -1. Using NDGI assessment can be made of negative and positive changes of the vegetation. This study uses a new approach for forest ecosystems assessment, based on this index using the Greenness component obtained from orthogonalization of satellite images in combination with generated vegetation indices (NDVI and MCARI2). Optimization of model performance and automatization of Sentinel-2 MSI data processing were conducted. Sentinel-2 MSI model for orthogonalization of multispectral data was used for Tasseled cap transformation. Results obtained by implementation of the proposed approach show that the integrated composite images of NDGI, NDVI and MCARI2 represent the condition of forest ecosystems.

TI  - Hope Springs Eternal: An Exploration of Hope at a Local Jail
T2  - WOMEN & CRIMINAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Prevention and intervention research has indicated the malleability of hope in a variety of populations and the positive impact on treatment outcomes in general clinical settings and substance use treatment. However, despite its prospective role in improving well-being, research on hope is not often situated behind bars. Thus, the current project intended to explore the nature of theory-driven hope discussions for women involved in justice systems. The aim was to maintain and enhance hope, activate positivity, and thereby enhance the quality of life.Four weekly focus group sessions were conducted with women detained at a local jail (n = 23), with discussion prompts based on Snyder's theory of hope (goal setting, agency thinking, and pathway thinking). Using interactional delivery methods, we emphasized hope among jailed women by: (1) facilitating the development and maintenance of hopeful thinking; (2) developing concrete goals towards rehabilitation and a positive life; (3) enhancing the capacity for developing enduring, cross-sectional strategies for goal attainment; and (4) facilitating self-analysis on their overall ability to produce workable plans required to reach the goals. Weekly journaling was also included to complement the process.Results from the qualitative analysis suggest hope for these jailed women was constructed as belief in a better future and was also often embedded within a religious worldview. Further, jailed women's perceptions of meeting goals were heavily dependent upon outside sources that would provide structure and discipline. Implications include providing strength-based reentry programs, offering mentorship, emphasizing goal-setting strategies, and reviewing visitation policies.

TI  - Total pathological complete response versus breast pathological complete response in clinical trials of reference and biosimilar trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Trastuzumab is a key drug in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancers that over-express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Pathological complete response (pCR) is commonly used as an endpoint in neoadjuvant clinical trials of trastuzumab as evidence suggests it may be a surrogate for long-term survival. Several biosimilar candidates of originator or 'reference' trastuzumab are in development and have used pCR as a primary endpoint to assess therapeutic equivalence between treatments. The exact definition of pCR has varied across studies.Areas covered: Here we look at the clinical relevance of pCR and compare rates of total pCR (defined as ypT0/is ypN0) and breast pCR (defined as ypT0/is) in clinical trials of reference and biosimilar trastuzumab.Expert commentary: In order to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant systemic therapies in a uniform way, standardization of trial endpoints is necessary. Future studies in HER2-positive breast cancer should include full assessment of the breast and lymph node basin before and after neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and the use of total pCR as the primary outcome.

TI  - Accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping in detecting occult neck metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the following: 1) the accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) in detecting metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and 2) if SLNM could modify the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging of previous cN0 PTC patients. Subjects and methods: Forty SLNM were performed prospectively in 38 consecutive cN0 PTC patients, with total thyroidectomy and elective compartment neck dissection (CND). The results of SLNM were compared with CND pathological findings to verify the accuracy of sentinel SLNM. Results: The mean patients follow-up was 36 months. A total of 133 SLN were found at levels VI, II, III and IV. The SLN was identified in 95% of the patients with one false negative, 95% sensitivity, a 94% negative predictive value and 97% accuracy. The SLNM upstaging from cN0 to pN+ was 49%, and to stages III and IVa, it was 21%. Conclusions: For this series of cN0 PTC patients: 1) SLNM accuracy was 97%, and 2) SLNM upstaging from cN0 to pN+ was 49%, whereas to stages III and IVa, it was 21%. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - High resolution estimates of human population distributions are very useful for large-scale or national scale analyses in many fields including epidemiology, healthcare, resource distribution, and development. Population densities have long been estimated using remote sensing data, particularly at large spatial scales. However, the accuracy of population density predictions can be very poor in cities, and this is particularly relevant in urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa. Here we map intra-urban population densities for select African cities by disaggregating census data using random forest techniques with remotely-sensed and geospatial data, including bespoke time-series intra-urban built-up data. We produce maps with up to 83% explained variance and find including built-up density layers in urban population models allows for clear improvements in prediction.

AB  - In this study, we performed ground validation to support the interpretation of Sentinel-1 imagery during a full growing season of five key crop types in the Netherlands. Crop height and growth stage were monitored weekly in a total of 25 parcels of maize, potato, sugar beet maize and English rye grass in the province of Flevoland. Hydrometeorological data were collected throughout the season. Here, these results are used to interpret time series of Sentinel-1 data processed for the province of Flevoland. Results demonstrate that Sentinel-1 data follow the phenological stages and can be used to identify key moments in crop development. Combined with the guaranteed availability of observations regardless of cloud cover, this makes Sentinel-1 data a valuable resource for agencies and commercial entities providing advice to farmers and agro-industrial co-operatives.

AB  - iCOR is a scene and sensor generic atmospheric correction algorithm which can process images containing land and coastal, inland or transitional water pixels. The tool is adaptable with minimal efforts to hyper-or multi-spectral sensors. iCOR has been extensively validated for Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI and Proba-V and is now being developed for Sentinel-3 OLCI. It has been developed in such a way that it can be easily integrated in an operational workflow. Three examples of the integration in an operational workflow are presented, the Highroc processor for coastal waters, the Belgian collaborative ground segment TERRASCOPE and the WATCHITGROW service for the potato industry.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient forest fire management requires precise and up-to-date knowledge regarding the composition and spatial distribution of forest fuels at various spatial and temporal scales. Fuel-type maps are essential for effective fire prevention strategies planning, as well as the alleviation of the environmental impacts of potential wildfire events. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the potential of Disaster Monitoring Constellation and Landsat-8 OLI satellite images (Operational Land Imager), combined with Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), in operational mapping of the Mediterranean fuel types at a regional scale. The results showcase that although the images of both sensors can be used with GEOBIA analysis for the generation of accurate fuel-type maps, only the OLI images can be considered as applicable for regional mapping of the Mediterranean fuel types on an operational basis.

AB  - The Copernicus programme brings a wealth of ocean colour data at medium and high spatial resolution with a full, free and open data access policy, allowing for unprecedented monitoring capabilities of the open ocean and coastal and inland waters. The POLYMER atmospheric correction algorithm, with its genericity and robustness to most atmospheric and surface perturbations (aerosols, sun glint, thin clouds, adjacency effect), allows to maximize these observation capabilities, in particular for Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI. The algorithm is fully consistent between these sensors, which gives access to a unique product in terms of potential applications. The evolution of the POLYMER algorithm will be presented, with examples of applications and validation results for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3.

AB  - In the Free State of Thuringia, in Central Germany, the ThuringenForst develops new remote sensing products using open and free data. For this purpose, Copernicus data as well as LiDAR data, and Thuringian GIS database provided by the Agency for Surveying and Geodata (Federal State Thuringia) have been used. Copernicus services combined with auxiliary data can provide at no cost timely and objective information on forest resources that complement and update the existing forest geoinformation. Until now, three products have been available for operational use by ThuringenForst, namely afforestation monitoring, terrain accessibility maps, and tree height maps. Another important forest parameter to monitor is tree species.In this paper, a workflow for classifying tree species has been presented that can be utilized as a future remote sensing local forest product. Using the Sentinel-2 data, five dominant tree species were classified with an overall accuracy of more than 83%.

TI  - WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THE BAROQUE?
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the demands of the Council of Trent, the Baroque sought not so much to teach (docere) but to inspire (movere) and to allure (delectare). Owing to the predominance of this aesthetic principle, the Baroque preserved human integrity in a period when the Renaissance worldview utterly collapsed, when professional disciplines became compartmentalized, when the infinitely small and great worlds revealed themselves through the microscope and the telescope, and when anatomists and physiologists went inside the human body.Only in its sensual aspect is Baroque art seemingly opposed to the rationality of philosophic and scientific thought. The creative practices of the coryphaei of the Baroque were carried out under the rubric of ratio. The apotheosis of rationalism in the arts was the opera house with all of its constituent parts: from the libretto, the music and vocal techniques to the financial arrangements of the impresarios, the tiered seating and the wonders of scenography. Leaving behind adherence to the Renaissance ideal of intellectual and creative excellence, the Baroque encouraged going beyond what had been known and accomplished, and its message is still heard today.From the beginning of European history to the Napoleonic Wars, the Baroque stands out for its extreme bellicosity. However, the Baroque is surprisingly optimistic despite the great number of terrible events. From this era on, a European perceived death not as an impersonal fatal blow, but as a private event whose likelihood at every point was partly dependent on one's own actions. Baroque monuments in Asia and in the Americas show that globalization first manifested itself in the spread of the Baroque style. But the landing of the Pilgrim founding fathers on the shore of Cape Cod and the Mayflower Compact they signed were phenomena of global significance that had nothing in common with the way colonization of distant territories had been carried out by Europeans before the age of the Baroque.

AB  - The research is devoted to the study of peculiarities of perception by adolescents (by both potential weightlifters and /or future parents, who in due time will have to participate in formation of the worldview and sporting interests of their children) of one of the gender denounced kinds of sports - women's weightlifting.The research methods are as follows: interviewing students in the form of essay and questionnaire survey, qualitative and quantitative content analysis of interview results. 184 Moscow students (67 young men and 117 young women) at the age of 17-19 took part in the interview.On the whole, the attitude of modern adolescents to women's weightlifting can be characterised as negative. At that, young men demonstrate greater rejection of this kind of sports than young women do. Voicing their discontent with women's weightlifting, young men operate predominantly with exclusively gender-related epithets, the considerable part of which is of discriminating nature.In case of young women, 62.9 % of negative responses are of gender-related nature, they include: "unsuitable/unacceptable kind of sports for women","unwomanly kind of sports", etc. The rest 37.1 % of negative responses of young women characterize women's weightlifting as "dangerous and harmful for health","complicated", "connected with heavy physical loads", "injury-prone", etc.The obtained findings suggest that the role of gender stereotypes in perception of women's weightlifting by adolescent is extremely large. It manifests itself particularly in young men. However, young women tend to establish frameworks, limiting their own freedom of choice and actions.

CL  - Las Vegas, NV
AB  - Creativity in China in the current era of globalization has become a buzzword for industry, acting as a catalyst for innovative potential and investment. However, while 'Made in China' has long been established, 'Created in China' still requires some legitimization internationally, and alongside creativity comes the need for a more nuanced, cross-cultural perspective in design and manufacturing alike. The 'Belt and Road' initiative is one key national plan in this larger globalization-oriented process and the high speed train, which has been referred to as China's 'national identity card', plays a symbolic role in this initiative. Exporting public transport systems, e.g. high speed trains, to international markets inevitably brings with it the challenge of cross-cultural issues, due to the different cultural background of prospective passengers. The nature of creativity itself bears an intrinsic link with one's worldview, as the act of creating is variable in different perspectives. While a particular social setting in one country or society may be historically aligned with concepts of creativity or idea-generation, that same social setting elsewhere may be viewed as a deterrent or hindrance. The importance of cross-cultural perceptions of creativity in the realm of idea-generation as related to design thus requires a thorough examination. As the conditions and need for growth in innovative thinking grows, the need to understand creativity as it is understood from a Chinese lens becomes a timely area of focus. This paper will examine the relationship between culture and creativity, as evidenced by a study on employees of a publicly owned transportation company in Mainland China.

TI  - Monitoring Inter- and Intra-Seasonal Dynamics of Rapidly Degrading Ice-Rich Permafrost Riverbanks in the Lena Delta with TerraSAR-X Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic warming is leading to substantial changes to permafrost including rapid degradation of ice and ice-rich coasts and riverbanks. In this study, we present and evaluate a high spatiotemporal resolution three-year time series of X-Band microwave satellite data from the TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite to quantify cliff-top erosion (CTE) of an ice-rich permafrost riverbank in the central Lena Delta. We apply a threshold on TSX backscatter images and automatically extract cliff-top lines to derive intra- and inter-annual CTE. In order to examine the drivers of erosion we statistically compare CTE with climatic baseline data using linear mixed models and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Our evaluation of TSX-derived CTE against annual optical-derived CTE and seasonal in situ measurements showed good agreement between all three datasets. We observed continuous erosion from June to September in 2014 and 2015 with no significant seasonality across the thawing season. We found the highest net annual cliff-top erosion of 6.9 m in 2014, in accordance with above-average mean temperatures and thawing degree days as well as low precipitation. We found high net annual erosion and erosion variability in 2015 associated with moderate mean temperatures but above average precipitation. According to linear mixed models, climate parameters alone could not explain intra-seasonal erosional patterns and additional factors such as ground ice content likely drive the observed erosion. Finally, mean backscatter intensity on the cliff surface decreased from -5.29 to -6.69 dB from 2013 to 2015, respectively, likely resulting from changes in surface geometry and properties that could be connected to partial slope stabilization. Overall, we conclude that X-Band backscatter time series can successfully be used to complement optical remote sensing and in situ monitoring of rapid tundra permafrost erosion at riverbanks and coasts by reliably providing information about intra-seasonal dynamics.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding the burden of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is important for setting national influenza surveillance and vaccine priorities. Estimating influenza-associated SARI rates requires hospital-based surveillance data and a population-based denominator, which can be challenging to determine.ObjectivesWe present an application of the World Health Organization's recently developed manual (WHO Manual) including hospital admission survey (HAS) methods for estimating the burden of influenza-associated SARI, with lessons learned to help others calculate similar estimates.MethodsUsing an existing SARI surveillance platform in Cambodia, we counted influenza-associated SARI cases during 2015 at one sentinel surveillance site in Svay Rieng Province. We applied WHO Manual-derived methods to count respiratory hospitalizations at all hospitals within the catchment area, where 95% of the sentinel site case-patients resided. We used HAS methods to adjust the district-level population denominator for the sentinel site and calculated the incidence rate of influenza-associated SARI by dividing the number of influenza-positive SARI infections by the adjusted population denominator and multiplying by 100000. We extrapolated the rate to the provincial population to derive a case count for 2015. We evaluated data sources, detailed steps of implementation, and identified lessons learned.ResultsWe estimated an adjusted influenza-associated 2015 SARI rate of 13.5/100 000 persons for the catchment area of Svay Rieng Hospital and 77 influenza-associated SARI cases in Svay Rieng Province after extrapolation.ConclusionsMethods detailed in the WHO Manual and operationalized successfully in Cambodia can be used in other settings to estimate rates of influenza-associated SARI.

TI  - CONTRADICTION OF FREEDOM AND PARADOXES OF RESPONSIBILITY (ANTHROPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS)
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the paper is to highlight the methodological role of social philosophy in the processes of optimizing the democratic system, modernizing the content of the category of freedom and responsibility-through the philosophical analysis of definitions by representatives of various political forces and the humanities. The task is to reveal the causes of the ambiguity of the concept of democracy through the analysis of the polysemy of the notions of freedom and responsibility and to prevent the danger of the transformation of democracy into a dictatorship or ochlocracy. Theoretical basis is the fundamental research of prominent philosophers such as B. Spinoza, G. F. F. Hegel, G.-V. Leibniz, F. Nietzsche, J.-J. Russo, J.-P. Sartre, E. Fromm, M. Berdyaev and others; the basic principles of social philosophy-social determinism, the concreteness of truth, rationality, interconnection and development, the requirements of comprehensiveness and criticism. Originality of the research is: in substantiating the significance of contemporary philosophical analysis of the content of key concepts of democracy-"freedom" and "responsibility"; in revealing the mechanism of the functioning of concepts of freedom and responsibility in different ideologies and various spheres of public life; in conducting a philosophical analysis of the notion of responsibility, in revealing the reasons for the paradoxical nature of its manifestations; in outlining the scientific and didactic potential of the philosophical research of categories of freedom and responsibility in the practice of democratic processes; in posing the question of the need to take into account the hierarchy of the content of freedom (delineation of the word, concept, category). Conclusions. As a result of the study, it was found that the philosophical understanding of the basic principles and concepts of democracy, especially freedom and responsibility, must precede the optimization of the democratic system, and the results of philosophical analysis must be taken into account in the practice of everyday life of the state. The model of the constant reproduction of the existing state of spiritual differentiation of a person's worldview should be contrasted with the model of harmonization of the democratic system (which is an ideal), only reducing its internal contradiction to the non-antagonistic and the formation on this basis of self-limitation, self-determination of personalities-as a consequence of understanding the relativity of freedom, full awareness and acceptance responsibility for their intentions and decisions.

AB  - The paper submit an innovative approach to dam surveillance question by means of multi-level heterogeneous sensory data fusion, in order to increase the aggregation efficiency of data obtained by different sensors, which combines fuzzy set theory with other multi-sensor data fusion techniques. The sensor information fusion model was designed, using partial coupled data gathered by various sensors. Behind the analysis and process of the multi level fusion model, the precise appraisal of the secure status of the dam environment can be achieved. Lastly, the approach, that could actually enrich the consistency of the secure situation of the dam, is validated through a case analysis.A rule-based expert sub-system for fusing the raw data acquired from sensors with complementary accuracy and bandwidth attributes is proposed. Furthermore, for particularly precise purposes it is proposed a high accuracy fuzzy predictor sub-system. The major benefits of the projected multi-modal sensor fusion method are illustrated by simulation of a dam surveillance sub-system employing the fusion components for behavior assessment.

AB  - We present and analyze the methodology, architecture, and various functionalities of CODE-DE (Copernicus Data and Exploitation Platform - Deutschland, www.code-de.org) which is the German operational environment for accessing and processing Copernicus Sentinel products, a so-called Copernicus collaborative ground segment activity. Since 9 March 2017 the element for online data access to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products is operational and tapped by over 650 registered users until 30 November 2017. During this period more than 47,000 products were downloaded and the global catalogue was continuously updated and includes a data volume of 800 TByte based on a rolling archive concept. Since 30 November 2017 also the element for big data processing is operational, where registered users automatically process and analyze data themselves specifically with the help of various methodologies to value-added products. Furthermore, optimizations are realized such as improved visualization of the catalogue of available Sentinel-2 products. They are presented with the catalogue client at full 10 meter resolution.

AB  - Mapping urban boundaries is an area of considerable research interest. The ability to monitor growth and change is facilitated by the ease and accuracy of boundary delineation. This research proposes an open-source (data and software) workflow for detecting and delineating the urban-rural boundary. Using Sentinel-1a SAR data for the city of Melbourne, Australia and a combination of texture and k-means classifications, using ESA SNAP software, a three-category map is produced that distinguishes urban from rural areas. A simple raster to polygon conversion produces a useable shapefile that can be added to a broader GIS based analysis.

AB  - This research presents the results of a survey on the extent of the affected areas in the municipality of Bregovo from the flood of the Timok River, which occurred on 11.03.2018. The application of SAR and optical data for assessment of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the occurred flood is the objective of this paper. This methodology applies orthogonal transformation of different multispectral images from Sentinel 2 mission combined with SAR data from Sentinel 1. The assessment was made on the basis of the orthogonal transformation' components of the bands from different multispectral Sentinel 2 imagery: Tasseled Cap Transformation TCT-brightness, TCT-wetness, TCT-greenness. Indicators of quantitative changes in areas affected by the floods have been obtained. Satellite images from Sentinel 1-SAR and Sentinel 2-MSI satellite missions, orthophotography, terrestrial and in-situ terrain data from the Bregovo municipality affected by flooding were used. The processed satellite images are from different sensors and are selected by different dates before and after the day of the natural disaster. Pseudocomposite radar images with different polarization (vv,vh) were used to clarify and more precisely visualize the territorial coverage of the flood in the surveyed area. Various normalized quantitative differentiation indices (vegetation, humidity, vapors, etc., NDGI,) are generated after image processing. Results are presented for correlation between the values obtained for the different data types. On the basis of the obtained data and results, a comparative analysis of the dynamics of the changes occurred as a result of the disaster was carried out and a quantitative assessment of the changes occurred and respectively the registered negative environmental impacts in the territorial extent of the flood.

TI  - A comparison of airborne hyperspectral-based classifications of emergent wetland vegetation at Lake Balaton, Hungary
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation has rapidly evolved into a state-of-the-art technology providing new capabilities and a wide variety of sensors; nevertheless, it is still a challenge for practitioners external to a specialized community of experts to select the appropriate sensor, define the imaging mode requirements, and select the optimal classifier or retrieval method for the task at hand. Especially in wetland mapping, studies have relied largely on vegetation indices and hyperspectral data to capture vegetation attributes. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of a concurrently acquired very high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral and lidar data set at the peak of aquatic vegetation growth in a nature reserve at Lake Balaton, Hungary. The aim was to examine to what degree the different remote-sensing information sources (i.e. visible and near-infrared hyperspectral, vegetation indices and lidar) are contributing to an accurate aquatic vegetation map. The results indicate that de-noised hyperspectral information in the visible and very near-infrared bands (400-1000nm) is performing most accurately. Inclusion of lidar information, hyperspectral infrared bands (1000-2500nm), or extracted vegetation indices does not improve the classification accuracy. Experimental results with algorithmic comparisons show that in most cases, the Support Vector Machine classifier provides a better accuracy than the Maximum Likelihood.

T2  - STELLENBOSCH THEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - When referring to the viewpoints of the Dutch Reformed Church as a whole, one should look for the decisions of its general synod. In trying to be a church and a prophet, this General Synod should speak out according to the Bible and in the way of a church or an institution of faith.The Dutch Reformed Church indeed spoke as a prophet to the government in the decade after 1994. However, it was done with a certain reluctance and not from an overall perspective. Two main factors contributed to this. There is a difference in worldview between this church and the government. The Dutch Reformed Church had the experience that a little came of its efforts.In the meantime the Dutch Reformed Church remains convinced that it should promote the kingdom of God in South Africa as a church and through its individual members.

TI  - Contralateral lymph node metastasis in a woman with new primary breast cancer: Systemic desease or locoregional diffusion?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Contralateral axillary lymph node metastases (CAMs) in patients with breast cancer are rare (Daoud et al., 1998); however, CAMs may be already detected at the time of primary breast cancer diagnosis (synchronous CAM) or after a previous treatment of breast cancer as a recurrence if not as an ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR) (metasynchronous CAM) (Zhou and Richir, 2013). The involvement of the contralateral axilla could be caused by a systemic disease (stage IV), a regional metastasis from a new occult primary tumor (TONI, stage II) or a breast cancer recurrence It may also arise from a locally advanced disease in a patient who has suffered from a primary breast cancer.PRESENTATION OF CASE: This report focuses on the case of a 50-year-old woman who has developed a new primary breast cancer, breast skin invasion and CAMs.DISCUSSION: We intend to show that an altered lymphatic drainage may result from CAMs; in fact, patients who have previously undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) are more likely to develop contralateral lymph drainage (Maaskant-Braat et al., 2013).CONCLUSION: Along with that, we want to support the theory that CAMs should be treated with curative intent rather than as a stage IV disease, as we believe that CAMs are due to a locoregional extension of the disease.

TI  - Early season weed mapping in rice crops using multi-spectral UAV data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose an automatic procedure for classification of UAV imagery to map weed presence in rice paddies at early stages of the growing cycle. The objective was to produce a weed map (common weeds and cover crop remnants) to support variable rate technologies for site-specific weed management. A multi-spectral ortho-mosaic, derived from images acquired by a Parrot Sequoia sensor mounted on a quadcopter, was classified through an unsupervised clustering algorithm; cluster labelling into weed'/no weed' classes was achieved using geo-referenced observations. We tested the best set of input features among spectral bands, spectral indices and textural metrics. Weed mapping performance was assessed by calculating overall accuracy (OA) and, for the weed class, omission (OE) and commission errors (CE). Classification results were assessed under an alarmist' approach in order to minimise the chance of overestimating weed coverage. Under this condition, we found that best results are provided by a set of spectral indices (OA=96.5%, weed CE=2.0%). The output weed map was aggregated to a grid layer of 5x5m to simulate variable rate management units; a weed threshold was applied to identify the portion of the field to be subject to treatment with herbicides. Ancillary information on weed and crop conditions were derived over the grid cells to support precision agronomic management of rice crops at the early stage of growth.

AB  - This work describes system engineering of an internet-of-things (IoT) connectivity and satellite data transfer for a pico-hydroelectric power generation system. The system is developed for deployment in remote villages in the Nepal Himalayas. The IoT devices are sensors attached to various points in the system which monitor critical system performance metrics such as generator vibrations and output voltage and control important functions. The data is transmitted from IoT devices using Zigbee. The data is then transmitted to the Iridium satellite system so it can be available to an international team of researchers who developed and monitor the performance of the system. This allows for optimization and performance improvements with the goal of perfecting the system so it can be implement in other villages. This work describes the system, why it is needed, and the hardware. The result is an IoT enabled monitoring system with real time data transmitted using satellites.

AB  - This study examines the process in which Wang Fuzhi(王夫之)’s Sishuxue(四書學) was created and has transitioned to Shixue(實學) in the Qing Dynasty. With this goal in mind, the study examines the intrinsic relationship between Wang Fuzhi's Shixue and Bentilun(本體論) and reviews the characteristics of Jingshilun(經世論) and self-discipline. The philosophical thought of Wang Fuzhi, a scholar who succeeds from the Ming Dynasty, has a clear purpose. Therefore, his Jingshilun(經世論) is rooted in strong ethnic awareness and has a yearning for building a new nation through studies that has practical contribution to the society (經世致用). Wang Fuzhi felt strong need for a new worldview and completed Qi-monism(氣一元論) by succeeding Zhang Zai’s Qi philosophy(氣哲學). Based on Qi-monism, Wang Fuzhi criticized theories of Song Ming Lixue(宋明理學), Taoism, and Buddhism and attempted to unify ‘Moral(道德) and Jingshi(經世),’ which was age-old unresolved issue of Confucianism. In this process, Wang Fuzhi criticized "existent but immovable universe," the main theory of the Cheng Zhu Lixue(程朱學) and presented a new world view that believes in the "moving universe body". Based on this, Wang Fuzhi completed the new methodology of classical learning(經學) and self-discipline that emphasized actual practice rather than knowledge. The critical mind of Wang Fuzhi, which started from with an aim to reform the reality, eventually developed into Jingshilun(經世論) and self-discipline that emphasized people’s active practice after going through series of criticism of Song-Ming Lixue(宋明理學). From this point of view, Wang Fuzhi's Sishuxue can be argued to be a turning point in the transition to the Shixue of the Qing Dynasty which has heavy emphasis on practicality.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry is a technique that provides high-resolution measurements of the ground displacement associated with many geophysical processes. Currently there are two broad categories of algorithms for processing multiple acquisitions, persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) and small baseline methods(SB), which are optimized for different models of scattering. However, the scattering characteristics of transmission corridors in mountain areas usually lay between these two end-member models. In the experiment, we selected a set of SAR images of TerraSAR-X satellite, covered Mao County area, to detect the subsidence during the fifteen months, using stanford method for persistent scatterers-multitemporal InSAR technology (StaMPS-MTI).

AB  - Tomography SAR (TomoSAR) imaging can distinguish different scatterers in the same pixel using their spatial frequency spectrum difference. Sparse scatterers case located in one pixel can be imaged using high resolution spectral estimation algorithm or compressed sensing (CS) algorithm. For the pixel where the top position of the electric power transmission tower is located, it can be seen this sparse scatterers case. In this paper, TomoSAR imaging methods based on MUSIC algorithm, ESPRIT algorithm and CS algorithm are used to calculate the height of the electric power transmission tower, respectively. TerraSAR-X data is used for experiment. The experimental results demonstrate the ESPRIT algorithm has better accuracy than the other two algorithms for the height estimation of the study electric power transmission tower. Basically, this accuracy can meet the requirement in practical applications.

TI  - Multi-Scale Segmentation Method Based on Binary Merge Tree and Class Label Information
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a newly developed segmentation algorithm for high-resolution remote sensing imagery. The new method is based on binary merge tree (BMT) and mainly comprises two parts, which are BMT construction and tree node selection. The first part is initialized by super-pixels, which are iteratively merged through using the well-known multi-resolution segmentation approach to complete BMT construction. The primary contribution of this paper resides in the second part, in which a new tree node selection criterion is developed. The new criterion is formulated by using spectral variance and class label cues in order to better describe intra-segment homogeneity. To validate the proposed strategy, four multi spectral scenes captured by two Chinese satellites, ZiYuan-3 and GaoFen-2, were adopted for segmentation experiments. The results indicated that our method out-performed some state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of segmentation accuracy.

AB  - The volume of landing fish of the Sadeng Fishing Port within certain months showed an increase from year to year, especially during June, July and August (JJA). While in other months the fish production was low. The purpose of this research was to understand the influence of monsoon variability on fish landing in the Sadeng Fishing Port. Data were analyzed descriptively as spatial and temporal catch. Data were namely catch fish production collected from fishing port, while satellite and HYCOM model during 2011-2012 period were selected. The wind data, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a were analyzed from ASCAT and MODIS sensors during the Southeast Monsoon. The result showed the wind from the southeasterly provide wind stress at sea level and caused Ekman Transport to move away water mass from the sea shore. The lost water mass in the ocean surface was replaced by cold water from deeper layer which was rich in nutrients. The distribution of chlorophyll-a during the Southeast Monsoon was relatively higher in the southern coast of Java than during the Northwest monsoon. The SST showed approximately 25.3 degrees C. The abundance of nutrients indicated by the distribution of chlorophyll-a around the coast during the Southeast Monsoon, will enhance the arrival of larger fish. Thus, it can be understood that during June, July, and August the catch production is higher than the other months.

AB  - In paper authors present limitations and possibilities associated with terrestrial laser scanning technology in diagnostics of brick walls. The research was conducted in both lab and field conditions. Specially prepared samples were used for lab tests. Field tests were performed on a real building. Measurements were carried out using pulsed scanner Leica ScanStation C10. Defects of flat brick surfaces were located using an algorithm based on Mean Sum Error. In this method a regression is harnessed to find an optimal reference surface. Specifying reference surface was basis for detecting cavities. Influence of a scan density, laser beam divergence and spot size on effectiveness of scanning brick facades was discussed. Generally, the higher scan density, the smaller spot size and smaller laser beam divergence higher definition of survey. The research results show that the surface delamination (cavities, cracks) of bricks facades can be effectively detected by a terrestrial laser scanning system.

AB  - This paper analyses weather monitoring systems using various platforms and types of equipment, one of them being Klara, an Android application installed on a smartphone, which produces a multi-day forecast that includes temperature and pressure in the atmosphere. Another system used for weather forecasting is through the Meteotest API, which provides climatic and satellite data for specific geographical coordinates, but also air pollution measurements and back-casting. The thermal comfort using ISO 7730 standard and the energy efficiency for improving indoor environmental comfort powered by photovoltaic installation system was calculated. The use of the RayManPro model led to the determination of PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature) and TSV (thermal sensation) and to the correlation of data.

TI  - UNDERSTANDING THE FUTURE OF CRIMINOLOGY: AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT TRENDS
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study and evaluation of established and evolving views of scholars regarding the future of criminology, expressed in articles as well as books, requires their generalization and makes it possible to formulate certain conclusions. Speculations regarding the future of criminology are primarily connected with the future crime trends and the projected reaction of the society and the theories of crime to their changes. Is the following theoretically and logically sound chain going to be perspective: technological development and rapid technological progress - use of new technologies by criminals - structural changes in crime - systemic changes in the law enforcement structures that meet the new criminal threats? Rapid technological progress, worsening social and economic inequality gave rise to futurological criminological research. Modern theory of criminology has many areas of urgent importance. They include the following issues debated in the academic circles: first, the effective methodological basis for such research, second, the possible ways of improving crime prevention theory that is dependent on the social processes and third, how and in what direction will criminology evolve in connection with the social trends and if it will be able to "incorporate" and take into account future, intensively and actively predicted trends of global social development, while gaining the status of the science of the future. Global criminology, fundamental criminology, digital criminology - what is the attitude of scholars to these theoretical constructs in today's academic discussions? Do speculations on the future of criminology have and prospects? Viewing science today as one of the forces that can help overcome the global civilization crisis has encouraged criminologists to discuss a wider consistent approach to future criminology as a source of ensuring criminological safety of the future society. The authors discuss the necessity and appropriateness of returning, in criminology as well as science in general, to the holistic worldview at the level of scientific knowledge. Criminology should develop by sprouting new branches supported by technological progress. A special part should be played by the criminology of hi tech that converges the knowledge of natural sciences.

AB  - Gajah Mungkur Reservoir located in Wonogiri Regency Central Java Province. This is a multipurpose reservoir with an area of approximately 8,800 ha. This reservoir can irrigate 23.600 ha of rice fields in Sukoharjo, Klaten, Karanganyar and Sragen districts. The amount of sedimentation increased rapidly resulting in degradation of water quality of Gajah Mungkur Reservoir. High sedimentation can be shown from the high value of Total Suspended Solid (TSS) in the waters. TSS is a solid material, including organic and inorganic matter suspended in aquatic area. TSS Dynamics in the waters of Gajah Mungkur Reservoir can not be separated from the dynamics of vegetation density change in Watershed area (DAS). The watershed that flows into the Gajah Mungkur Reservoir is Bengawan solo Watershed.Total Suspended Solid (TSS) concentration can be identified using Total Suspended Solid (TSS) algorithm in Landsat 8 Satellite imagery. This research is monitored by TSS development in 2013, 2015, and 2017 which then compared with TSS level in the field. Vegetation density was identified using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) method.Based on the results obtained the most suitable algorithm in the waters of Gajah Mungkur Reservoir is TSS Syarif Budhiman algorithm with 92% regression coefficient. The concentration of TSS in the waters of Gajah Mungkur Reservoir in the period of 2013-2017 has increased. Then the result of vegetation density in Bengawan Solo watershed showed that dominates is a fairly tight class. While the density of vegetation in the watershed that flows into the Gajah Mungkur Reservoir in 2013-2017 significant changes also some Sub watershed that decreased vegetation density occurred in the sub watershed Keduang, Solo Hulu and Wuryantoro. The vegetation density of several sub watersheds has an effect on the content of TSS in Gajah reservoir at estuary of the sub-watershed.

AB  - Satellite Image inspection is difficult as it expresses the analysis in the presence of uncertainty, due to factors like poor illumination and effects of environmental conditions. Image processing methods are widely used in the field of remote sensing to extract the region of interest in the image. In this paper, a heuristic algorithm assisted multi-level thresholding approach is considered to extract the buildings and roads from the remotely sensed satellite data. The proposed work is based on Electromagnetic Optimization (EMO) algorithm and Kapur's objective function has been used for optimal multi-level thresholding. This proposed approach is validated by comparing the actual and the thresholded image. The performance measures such as Mean Square error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise ratio(PSNR), Structural SIMilarity(SSIM), Normalized Absolute Error(NAE) are identified and they provide good values for the proposed work. Hence, this technique is very significant for the analysis of satellite images through remote sensing.

TI  - Estimating Specific Features of the Optical Property Variability in the Black Sea Waters Using the Data of <i>SeaWiFS</i> and <i>MODIS</i> Satellite Instruments
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem of quantitative interpretation of the Black Sea observations provided by the SeaWiFS and MODIS satellite instruments is considered in the terms of spectral dependencies of the seawater optically active components. For this purpose, the results of standard data (accumulated in the NASA archive) processed by the GIOP (Generalized ocean color inversion model for retrieving marine Inherent Optical Properties) complex method are analyzed. As these results often contain significant distortions related to the atmospheric disturbances, selection of reliable test data implies the following requirement: large cloudless areas of the sea should contain no sudden chaotic spatial-temporal fluctuations of all the defined products and no false local correlations between the fields of the atmospheric and seawater parameters. Besides, imposed are the conditions for sufficiently accurate model reproduction of the empirical spectra of the sea surface reflectance and coincidence of the results obtained from the SeaWiFS and MODIS instruments. Application of the GIOP method permits to analyze the features of variations and the relative role of the light absorption components in the upper water layer associated with phytoplankton and the dissolved yellow substance. In the deepwater part of the Black Sea in summer, yellow substance makes the main contribution to absorption, and during the summer-autumn transition period, approximately equal growth of both the phytoplankton and the yellow substance absorptions is observed. Having been compared, the features of the Black Sea and the Equatorial Pacific waters are represented as an example. In contrast to the Black Sea, phytoplankton in the Equatorial Pacific is a dominating factor, whereas the yellow substance content remains almost unchanged.

AB  - The Indian Ocean Tsunami event on the 26 December 2004 has caused severe damage of some shorelines in Banda Aceh City, Indonesia. Tracing back the impact can be seen using remote sensing data combined with GIS. The approach is incorporated with image processing to analyze the extent of shoreline changes with multi-temporal data after 12 years of tsunami. This study demonstrates multi-resolution and multi-temporal satellite images of QuickBird and IKONOS to demarcate the shoreline of Banda Aceh shoreline from before and after tsunami. The research has demonstrated a significant change to the shoreline in the form of abrasion between 2004 and 2005 from few meters to hundred meters' change. The change between 2004 and 2011 has not returned to the previous stage of shoreline before the tsunami, considered post tsunami impact. The abrasion occurs between 18.3 to 194.93 meters. Further, the change in 2009-2011 shows slowly change of shoreline of Banda Aceh, considered without impact of tsunami e.g. abrasion caused by ocean waves that erode the coast and on specific areas accretion occurs caused by sediment carried by the river flow into the sea near the shoreline of the study area.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard of care for breast cancer. The detection method using radioisotope(RI)is considered the standard method but has some drawbacks including radiation exposure and access of the nuclear medicine to RI. A novel method using indocyanine green(ICG)as a near infrared(NIR)fluorescence contrast agent was developed in Japan. This NIR fluorescence imaging system can visualize subcutaneous lymphatic channels in real-time and navigate the surgeon to harvest sentinel lymph node in the axillary basin. Accumulating results in previous studies demonstrated that the ICG fluorescence method has achieved a high detection rate of sentinel lymph node comparable with the RI method. Currently, the ICG fluorescence method is another standard method as an acceptable alternative to the RI method. Development of fluorescence tracer to visualize tumor cells may enable the novel navigation surgery using in vivo fluorescence imaging.

AB  - SAR imagery requires image focusing through successive signal processing of received data before browsing images and acquiring information. For example, the signal data records of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 are stored in the onboard mission data storage, transmitted to the ground, and then focused to reproduce images. Apart from the power consumption, the storage volume and the transmission network speed are the two major factors that are limiting the utility of today's spaceborne SAR systems. One of the solutions is to further compress the SAR data through onboard signal processing and information extraction from the reproduced images. This is also beneficial for event-driven observations and fast delivery of information products. The Emergence Studio of JAXA has been developing evaluation models of FPGA-based signal processing system for onboard SAR image focusing. The model, namely, "Fast L1 Processor 2 (FLIP2)" can reproduce a 3m/6m/10m-resolution single look complex image from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data in near real-time. Preliminary evaluation results are presented in this article.

AB  - In 2017, 10 topics were selected as major clinical research advances in gynecologic oncology. For cervical cancer, efficacy and safety analysis results of a 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and long-term impact of reduced dose of quadrivalent vaccine were updated. Brief introduction of KEYNOTE trials of pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed death (PD)-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, followed. Tailored surveillance programs for gynecologic cancer related with Lynch syndrome and update on sentinel lymph node mapping were reviewed for uterine corpus cancer. For ovarian cancer, 5 topics were selected including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases inhibitors and immunotherapy. The other potential practice changers covered in this review were lymphadenectomy in advanced disease, secondary cytoreductive surgery in recurrent disease, weekly dose-dense regimen for first-line chemotherapy, incorporation of bevacizumab maintenance in platinum-sensitive recurrent disease, and effect of platinum-free interval prolongation. Conflicting opinions of academic societies on periodic pelvic examination were introduced in conjunction with relevant literature review. For the field of radiation oncology, results of 2 big trials, The Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma-3 and Gynecologic Oncology Group-258, for endometrial cancer and recent advance in high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer were reported. Topics for breast cancer covered adjuvant capecitabine after preoperative chemotherapy, adjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab in early human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease, olaparib for metastatic cancer in patients with a germline BRCA mutation, 20-year risks of recurrence after stopping endocrine therapy at 5 years, and contemporary hormonal contraception and the risk of breast cancer.

AB  - Many studies revealed significant correlation between satellite image properties and forest data attributes such as stand volume, biomass or carbon stock. However, further study is still relevant due to advancement of remote sensing technology as well as improvement on methods of data analysis. In this study, the properties of three vegetation indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI were tested upon above-ground carbon stock data from 50 circular sample plots (30-meter radius) from ground survey in PT. Inhutani I forest concession in Labanan, Berau, East Kalimantan. Correlation analysis using Pearson method exhibited a promising results when the coefficient of correlation (r-value) was higher than 0.5. Further regression analysis was carried out to develop mathematical model describing the correlation between sample plots data and vegetation index image using various mathematical models. Power and exponential model were demonstrated a good result for all vegetation indices. In order to choose the most adequate mathematical model for predicting Above-ground Carbon (AGC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was applied. The lowest BIC value (i.e. -376.41) shown by Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI) indicates this formula, AGC = 9.608*TVI21.54, is the best predictor of AGC of study area.

AB  - The coastline changes depend on stability of coastal bodies, such as characteristics of sediment and coastal slope. This research aimed to determine the relationship between the rate of coastline changes with the characteristics of sediment and coastal slope. The coastline changes were analysed by Landsat satellite images in 1991, 1999 and 2017 used End Point Rate (EPR) method on Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) module. Sediment characteristics (grain size and sediment statistics mean, sorting, skewness and kurtosis) were analysed by dry sieves and hydrometer with graphical method. The coastal slope used ASTER DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data analysis. The results showed that coastline changes at Pangenan coast of Cirebon in 1991-1999, 1999-2017 and 1991-2017 had average accretion rate respectively was 10.72 m/year, 7.25 m/year, 8.97 m/year and average abrasion rate was -12.49 m/year, -9.67 m/year, -6.70 m/year. The sediments were dominated by coarse silt, that had characteristics, were very well sorted, very fine skewed and platykurtic. The coastal slope was categorized as flat. The conclusion of this research was the rate of coastline change had not significant correlation with sediment and coastal slope.

AB  - Coastal zone is highly dynamic in nature and undergoes rapid change. It plays an important role in the livelihood of 55 million people along Indian coast. The critical issue faced by the coastline includes coastal erosion, Sea Level Rise (SLR), urbanization, industrialization, and resource management. 23% of Indian coastline is facing coastal erosion and this problem is relatively severe in Dakshina Kannada, making it a critical stretch. As per NOAA report prediction, global SLR is of the order of 0.5-2 m over the next century which ultimately cause extensive loss of low lying coastal areas. The present study is carried out with a view to identify the coastal vulnerability sites along 40 km stretch of Mangalore coast, starting from Talapady in South to Mulky in North. Both conventional and remotely sensed data, coupled with field data were employed to identify critical erosion zones, over a period of 16 years. ERDAS Imagine (2014) software was used to analyze the satellite data to prepare Land Use/Land Cover map. This can be employed in identifying area of land submergence, in case of coastal inundation and to develop ICZMP for Mangalore Coast.

AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content was a mediate indicator for monitoring winter wheat growing status. Based on 8-day composited time series dataset of MODIS surface reflectance with 1 km spatial resolution, a new Modified Ratio Vegetation Index (MRVI) was developed for monitoring leaf chlorophyll content of winter wheat in Hengshui City, Hebei Province of China. Comparing with the existing vegetation indexes, MRVI showed the better linear correlation with leaf chlorophyll content, with R-2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 8.34. The MRVI also revealed spatial patterns of leaf nitrogen status of winter wheat all over the Hengshui City in 2017, with R-2 of 0.73 in pure pixels and R-2 of 0.59 in all pixels. Our results demonstrated that MRVI would be a timely, economically and promising way for monitoring winter wheat nutritional condition from MODIS data in the future.

AB  - This paper examines the suffering and healing of two female subjects, Ellen West and Simone Weil from the standpoint of philosophical counseling. The pathophysiological diagnosis of both of these Jewish women resembles “anorexia” and “suicide,” but the two women’s perceptions and attitudes toward the suffering and their healing processes differ greatly.Chapter Two presents a philosophical interpretation of the “existential suffering” of Ellen West using the approach of Daseinsanalysis developed by Binswanger. After focusing on her platonic worldview and the dialectical pattern of “despair” between the two worlds of soul and body, the therapeutic limitations to analyzing individual female suffering are examined. In Chapter Three, after investigating the illness and mental suffering that Simone Weil experienced as an individual, the “social suffering” she faced is examined through the conceptualization of “uprootedness”. Chapter Four sheds light on Simone Weil’s thinking processes regarding her own and the world’s suffering from the philosophical premise of “duty”. An understanding of the meaning of reflexive healing, which contains the “rootedness” of the soul, is offered.In this way, this paper provides a philosophical understanding of the female subject’s suffering. At the same time, it examines the practical implications of philosophical counseling, which builds the mutual healing of “being with you” by listening to the individual and the social suffering that “I” has experienced.

AB  - Appropriate Government Regulation No. 15/2010 concerning the Organization of Spatial, Spatial Plan area (RTRW) Regency/City must assign part of its territory and put together a plan of Spatial Detail (RDTR). Map of RDTR that exist today can be said to be less qualified and their use should be insufficient. One of RDTR is about Open Green Space (RTH). In Act No. 26/2007 of spatial mentions open green space should consist of 30% of the city area that is 20% and 10% of the public and the private. In making the RDTR map can be done by using very high-resolution satellite imagery previously orthorectification needed to be made in advance. Therefore, it needs to be done research on the accuracy of very highresolution satellite imagery, satellite imagery can be known so that it can be used for making the based map of RDTR with scale 1:5000. This research was conducted in the Urban area of Tuban, East Java. To create a base map of the Spatial Detail of this Plan needs to be done orthorectification using data that are the Pleiades Imagery, QuickBird Imagery, DEM data of Astrium Terra SAR X with a resolution 9 m, the measurement point of GCP and ICP with Geodetic GPS, and limits Urban administration. GCP and ICP are used as much as 5 and 12 points. After a specified GCP point, can do calculations of SoF with results indicators of SoF <= 1, and obtained of 0.1883. Then do the process of orthorectification with the GCP has been tied to BIG's SRGI with RMSError <= 1.5 pixels. As for the value of the RMS Error of 0.548 pixels for Pleiades Image and 0.366 pixels for QuickBird Image. To test the results of orthorectification, performed the accuracy test using ICP with a horizontal accuracy of 1.5175xRMSE. Test the accuracy of obtained results of 0.463 m for the image of the Pleiades and 0.414 m for QuickBird Imagery. So it can be specified in the 1:5000 scale for the image of the Pleiades enters class 1 and for class 1 entry QuickBird Imagery.

AB  - Landslide is a kind of land or rock movement, come from a place that has a higher slope as a consequence of disturbed land stability. The landslide can cause huge damage around us, but there are so many ways that can decrease landslide risk assessment, for example, to keep away from landslide area, spread a warning around the people, and apply safety standard when entering a landslide area. This research has purpose to know landslide potential that influences in hazard mitigation strategy in Tuban Regency. This research result is landslide potential map based on the land characteristic, rainfall, slope, and land use. That four parameters pass by an analysis processing an will be sure by remote sensing data that is medium resolution satellite imagery of Landsat 8, high-resolution satellite imagery of SPOT, and very high-resolution satellite imagery of Quickbird. This research result is a map of landslide susceptibility that places Tuban Regency in 5 classifications of it, where Tuban Regency domination in the low stage of susceptibility with 106.618 ha, and for very high of susceptibility with 175.5 ha of areas.

AB  - Green open space (GOS) is one of the requirements where a city is comfortable to stay. GOS might reduce land surface temperature (LST) and air pollution. Medan is one of the biggest towns in Indonesia that experienced rapid development. However, the early development tends to neglect the GOS existence for the city. The objective of the study is to determine the distribution of land surface temperature and the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the priority of GOS development in Medan City using imagery-based satellite Landsat 8. The method approached to correlate the distribution of land surface temperature derived from the value of digital number band 10 with the NDVI which was from the ratio of groups five and four on satellite images of Landsat 8. The results showed that the distribution of land surface temperature in the Medan City in 2016 ranged 20.57 - 33.83 degrees C. The relationship between the distribution of LST distribution with NDVI was reversed with a negative correlation of -0.543 (sig 0,000). The direction of GOS in Medan City is therefore developed on the allocation of LST and divided into three priority classes namely first priority class had 5,119.71 ha, the second priority consisted of 16,935.76 ha, and third priority of 6,118.50 ha.

TI  - Canadian boreal forest greening and browning trends: an analysis of biogeographic patterns and the relative roles of disturbance versus climate drivers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have used satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series to explore geographic patterns in boreal forest greening and browning. A number of these studies indicate that boreal forests are experiencing widespread browning, and have suggested that these patterns reflect decreases in forest productivity induced by climate change. Here we use NDVI time series from Landsat, which has much higher quality and spatial resolution than imagery used in most previous studies, to characterize biogeographic patterns in greening and browning across Canada's boreal forest and to explore the drivers behind observed trends. Our results show that the majority of NDVI changes in Canada's boreal forest reflect disturbance-recovery dynamics not climate change impacts, that greening and browning trends outside of disturbed forests are consistent with expected ecological responses to regional changes in climate, and that observed NDVI changes are geographically limited and relatively small in magnitude. By examining covariance between changes in NDVI and temperature and precipitation in locations not affected by disturbance, our results isolate and characterize the nature and magnitude of greening and browning directly associated with climate change. Consistent with biogeographic theory, greening and browning unrelated to disturbance tended to be located in ecotones near boundaries of the boreal forest bioclimatic envelope. We observed greening to be most prevalent in Eastern Canada, which is more humid, and browning to be most prevalent in Western Canada, where forests are more prone to moisture stress. We conclude that continued long-term climate change has the potential to significantly alter the character and function of Canada's boreal forest, but recent changes have been modest and near-term impacts are likely to be focused in or near ecotones.

TI  - NATIONAL SPECIFICITY AND ARTISTIC VALUE: AT THE CROSSROADS OF ETHNOCULTURAL DISCOURSE AND AXIOLOGICAL CRITIQUE
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses correlation of ethnic, cultural, and axiological approaches as a methodologically relevant problem in literary studies. The weakening interest in the structural and semantic complexity of the literary work and devaluation of the assertion criteria assign a peripheral role to the creative factor in art. As a result, the principle of aesthetic selectivity and the literary approach to the functional role of ethno-cultural realities remain in the shadows of axiological relativism. The essay intends to restore the status of "artistic value" as a significant category in literary studies by practicing axiological approach within the literary discourse; it also invites to pay special attention to the semantic complementarity of "national specificity" and "artistic value" respectively. A change of values affects and modifies the state of literature and its self-awareness by opening a new horizon of self-expression and modelling a certain worldview; it reveals productive struggle of established and emerging meanings, traditionalist attitudes and promising artistic intentions. In contemporary literary criticism oriented at the study of the literatures of the peoples of Russia, there is a demand for the reconstruction and reevaluation of national literatures. Such criticism seeks to overcome the existing gap between axiological and cultural aspects of textual analysis.

AB  - Screw connection is prefered used by apllicator because of it's simple. Type of screw usually used is Self Drilling Screw (SDS). This type of screw will become fix as it's screwed by the applicator until its head. almost all applicator able to make this connection and do not need some course or sertificate to become an applicator, does not like applicator of High Tension Bolt, HTB. But this type of connection has some disadvantages, for example it's connection doest not suit to dynamic loading.the experiment results that galvalume material has Yeilding Force, fy = 580 Mpa and Ultimate Force, fu = 590 Mpa. Connection of 2 SDS screw vertically configured fail on about tension loading 6000 N less than horizontally configured that fail on about 7500 N. Displacement of 2 SDS screw vertically configure on about 0.6 mm less than horizontally one that fail on displacement 0.85 mm. For adhesive of Sikadur CF 31 connection fail on loading about 6000 N tension loading but its displacement is less than 0.5 mm when it fail, for 2 type of connection configured.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification using carbon nanoparticles in abdominal lymph node metastasis in elderly (>60 years old) patients with colorectal cancer.Methods: Eighty patients admitted at Weihai Second Municipal Hospital affiliated to Qingdao University from November 2014 to February 2017 were selected and divided into the control group (n=40) and the observation group (n=40) using the random number method. The control group was treated with surgery, while the observation group was administered carbon nanoparticle tracer for intraoperative dye detection and positioning; the first to four black-stained lymph nodes were marked as SLN, then radical surgery for colorectal cancer was performed. Pathological examination of intraoperative specimens was performed to assess the effect of SLN in the abdominal lymph node metastasis.Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the metastasis rate and lymph node metastasis rate between the two groups (p>0.05). The total number of lymph nodes and the number of lymph nodes with micrometastases (<2mm) in the observation group were larger than those in the control group (p<0.05); the ratio of fewer than 12 lymph nodes in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (p<0.05). In the observation group, 8 out of 40 cases had lymph node metastasis, the detection rate of SLN using carbon nanoparticles was 92.50%, the accuracy rate 94.59%, the specificity of diagnosis 87.50%, the false negative rate 12.50% and the negative predictive value 21.88%. There was no statistically significant difference in the metastasis rate of black-stained and non-black-stained lymph nodes in the observation group (p>0.05). The black-stained rate of micro lymph nodes was higher than the total black-stained rate (p<0.05); the rate of micro lymph node metastasis was lower than that of lymph node metastasis >5mm (p<0.05).Conclusion: Preoperative SLN examination can evaluate the abdominal lymph node status in elderly patients with colorectal cancer, which is simple and accurate and can guide the clinical treatment, so it is worthy of popularization and application.

AB  - Four remote sensing soil moisture (SM) data products (ESA CCI, FY-3B, SMOS/BEC, SMOS/CATDS) across China are evaluated from the aspects of their statistical characteristics (mean value and variation coefficient (CV)), correlations with precipitation and ground based measurements. Further, four products are compared with GLDAS (global land surface data assimilation system) simulated SM products. The results show that ESA CCI performs best among the four satellite products. FY-3B SM is overestimated in humid regions while underestimated in arid regions, with a CV within the natural range; SMOS/BEC SM is generally lower than the other products, with an abnormal CV in northwestern China and poor correlation with precipitation; SMOS/CATDS SM has the worst quality. Compared with satellite products, GLDAS simulated SM performs better in these three aspects.

AB  - The NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched on November 18, 2017. VIIRS has been scheduled to view the Moon approximately monthly with a spacecraft roll maneuver after its NADIR door open on December 13, 2017. To reduce the uncertainty of the radiometric calibration due to the view geometry, the lunar phase angles of the scheduled lunar observations are confined in the range from -51.5 degrees to-50.5 degrees, which is same as the range used for SNPP VIIRS lunar calibration and where the negative sign for the phase angles indicates that the VIIRS views a waxing moon. Different from the MODIS lunar observations but same as those of SNPP VIIRS, the scheduled VIIRS lunar observations occur on the day side of the Earth. The lunar observations can be used to identify inoperable detectors. They can be used to check if there are crosstalk contaminations among the instrument's bands and to track on orbit changes in the Reflective Solar Bands (RSB) detector gains. In this paper, we report our results using the lunar observations to identify inoperable detectors, to examine the on-orbit crosstalk effects among NOAA-20 VIIRS bands, to track the VIIRS RSB gain changes in first few months on-orbit, and to compare the gain changes derived from lunar and SD/SDSM calibration.

T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The damming of rivers results in hydrological modifications that not only affect the aquatic ecosystem but also adjoining terrestrial systems. Thirteen dams commissioned along the Wujiang River have induced ecological problems, including decreased water turbidity and loss of biodiversity, which potentially influence ecosystem net primary production (NPP) and hence the sequestration, transformation, and storage of carbon. We used terrestrial NPP (NPPT) as a bioindicator to assess the impact of dams on carbon storage in the Wujiang catchment. MODIS satellite and meteorological data were used as inputs to the CASA model to calculate annual NPPT from 2000 to 2014. NPPT was calculated at the catchment and landscape scale to quantify the impact of dams on surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. Mean NPPT was calculated for concentric buffer zones covering a range of spatial extents (0-10 km) from the reservoir shoreline.We found a negligible impact from construction of a single dam on NPPT at the catchment scale. By contrast, the impact of dam construction was scale-dependent, with a stronger landscape-scale effect observed at short distances (i.e., 0-1 km) from the reservoir. Decreases in NPPT were mainly ascribed to the loss of vegetated land resulting from dam impoundment and subsequent urbanization of the surrounding area.

T2  - SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used ground-based hyperspectral imaging to map an outcrop of the Eagle Ford Group in west Texas. The Eagle Ford Group consists of alternating layers of mudstone - wackestone, grainstone - packstone facies and volcanic ash deposits with high total organic content deposited during the Cenomanian - Turonian time period. It is one of the few unconventional source rock and reservoirs that have surface representations.Ground-based hyperspectral imaging scanned an outcrop and hand samples at close ranges with very fine spatial resolution (centimeter to sub-millimeter). Spectral absorption modeling of clay minerals and calcite with the modified Gaussian model (MGM) allowed quantification of variations of mineral abundances. Petrographic analysis confirmed mineral identifications and shed light on sedimentary textures, and major element geochemistry supported the mineral quantification. Mineral quantification resulted in mapping of mudstone - wackestone, grainstone - packstone facies and bentonites (volcanic ash beds). The lack of spatial associations between the grainstones and bentonites on the outcrop calls into question the hypothesis that the primary productivity is controlled by iron availability from volcanic ash beds. Enrichment of molybdenum (Mo) and uranium (U) indicated "unrestricted marine" paleo-hydrogeology and anoxic to euxinic paleo-redox bottom water conditions.Hyperspectral remote sensing data also helped in creating a virtual outcrop model with detailed mineralogical compositions, and provided reservoir analog to extract compositional and geo-mechanical characteristics and variations. The utilization of these new techniques in geo-statistical analysis provides a workflow for employing remote sensing in resource exploration and exploitation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

FY-4A AGRI contains 14 spectral bands, in which 6 bands are in reflective solar region, with the nominal wavelengths at 0.47, 0.65, 0.825, 1.375, 1.61 and 2.25 mu m. The spatial resolution is 0.5 km for 0.65 mu m band, 2 km for the shortwave infrared bands and 1 km for others. AGRI is designed with a solar diffuser, however it revealed the insufficient capacity for in-flight calibration mainly due to the partial aperture effect. The first vicarious calibration field campaign was conducted at the Dunhuang site of China Radiometric Calibration Site (CRCS) in Apr. 2017. It revealed the large bias of the AGRI data calibrated using the prelaunch calibration parameters, mostly underestimated. Using multiple land sites in Asia and Oceania, the calibration correction factors were derived combined with the CRCS data. The sensor's on-orbit radiometric response variation and observation bias against the simulated radiation were also monitored. It revealed that the bands at 0.65 mu m was most stable, while 0.47 mu m band showed the large degradation with an annual rate nearly 17%. In this paper, the calibration status of the FY-4A AGRI solar bands was presented.

AB  - Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard FY-3 was a MODIS-like sensor which was designed for application in land, ocean and atmosphere. However, the prelaunch characterization of MERSI was not sufficient. The polarization property was not measured, which would influence the accuracy of sensor radiometric measurement, especially at scan edges. To evaluate the polarization sensitivity after launch, an ocean target based method was presented to model the Stokes vector entering the sensor at the top of atmosphere, and the on-orbit polarization response coefficients were estimated by regression between the modeled and measured radiance. After testing with Aqua MODIS, the method was applied to FY-3B MERSI. It revealed that there was relatively large polarization sensitivity for FY-3B MERSI visible bands. For the most sensitive band at 412nm, the polarization factor is approximately twice of that for Aqua MODIS. The mean polarization factors are above 3% for blue bands. For 412-nm band, the TOA polarization correction range is 16% for FY-3B MERSI, while 7% for Aqua MODIS on the same day.

TI  - A quantitative performance comparison of paddy rice acreage estimation using stratified sampling strategies with different stratification indicators
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Various indicators derived from thematic maps have been widely used to determine the strata needed to perform stratified sampling. However, these indicators typically do not quantify the spatial errors in the crop thematic maps that are needed to reduce the uncertainty. To address this lack of error information, this paper introduces a hybrid entropy indicator (HEI). Two conventional indicators, the acreage indicator (AI) and the fragmentation indicator (FI), were also evaluated to compare the results of the three indicators in a homogeneous agricultural area (Pinghu, PH) and a heterogeneous agricultural area (Zhuji, ZJ). The results show that HEI performs the best in heterogeneous areas with the lowest coefficient of variation (CV) (as low as 1.59%) and also has the highest estimation accuracy with the lowest standard deviation of estimation. For both areas, the performances of HEI and AI are very similar, and better than FI These results highlight that the HEI should be considered as an effective indicator and used in place of AI and FI to help improve sampling efficiency of crop acreage estimation, while R is not recommended. Furthermore, the positive performance achieved using HEI indicates the potential for incorporating thematic map uncertainty information to improve sampling efficiency.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation in arid area under the global Land Use/Cover Changehas drawn more attention in research of arid landscape ecology recently. In this study, the evaluated oasis evolution and its landscape fragmentation in Suzhou Oasis, a typical agricultural oasis in the middle reach of the Heihe River watershed. Oasis maps were obtained from Landsat TM images for 1990, 1999 and 2010, respectively. The results indicated that during 1990 to 2010, the change of oasis area was dominated by an increase of farmland, grassland and constructed land. The oasis area had increased mainly due to the conversion of farmland, unused land to grassland, and rapid urbanization. Landscape fragmentation index changed over time in the 15 towns, and there was a decrease of number of patches (NP), patch density (PD) and largest patch index (LPI), and an increase in division index (DIV) and Shannon's density index (SHI), suggesting that the change of landscape fragmentation degree had slowed down gradually. An improved method is used to describe the villages and towns scales of landscape fragmentation of the oasis evolution and fragmentation process.

AB  - Chlorophyll is an important pigment in green plants for photosynthesis and obtaining the energy for growth and development. The rapid, nondestructive and accurate estimation of chlorophyll content is significant for understanding the crops growth, monitoring the disease and insect, and assessing the yield of crops. Sentinel-2 equipped with the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), which will provide images with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. It covers the VNIR/SWIR spectral region in 13 bands and incorporates two new spectral bands in the red-edge region and a spatial resolution of 20nm, which can be used to derive vegetation indices using red-edge bands. In this paper, we will focus on assessing the potential of vegetation spectral indices for retrieving chlorophyll content from Sentinel-2 at different angles. Subsequently, we used in-situ spectral data and Sentinel-2 data to test the relationship between VIs and chlorophyll content. The REP, MTCI, CIred-edge, CIgreen, Macc01, TCARI/OSAVI [705,750], NDRE1 and NDRE2 were calculated. NDRE2 index displays a strongly similar result for hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 spectral bands (R-2=0.53, R-2=0.51, for hyperspectral and Sentinel-2, respectively). At different observation angles, NDRE2 has the smallest difference in performance (R-2=0.51, R-2=0.64, at 0 degrees and 15 degrees, respectively).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)
CL  - Fortaleza, BRAZIL
AB  - The variability of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) and South China Sea (SCS) during the intermonsoon (February-May) is investigated using shipboard and satellite data from 2011 to 2014, in order to understand the mechanism controlling AOT production and transport. Overall AOT in tropical IO is significantly smaller than those in SCS, and a strong intraseasonal variability of AOT, along with significant dependence on wind speed (especially when <8m s(-1)), is observed in both basins. Our analysis showed that in tropical IO, aerosols are mostly of natural marine production in spring, and the AOT shows greater dependence on the higher wind speeds in May, while in SCS, AOT dependence on wind speed increases when the prevailing wind turns from offshore (February, March) to onshore (April, May), due to less transport of terrestrial dust and anthropogenic aerosols from land. A better agreement between shipboard and once-daily satellite AOT is observed in the Equatorial belt (5 degrees S-5 degrees N, i.e. remote areas of IO) than in the Non-Equatorial area (5 degrees N-25 degrees N), and can be explained by the overall lower AOT values and the smaller diurnal variation in the Equatorial belt. Changes of wind regime during the monsoon evolution and the consequent transport of land-based aerosols reduce AOT dependence on wind speed and are the major drivers for the AOT variability.

AB  - Eastern Sichuan Basin is one of the areas sensitive to global climate change. Due to impacts from human disturbance, the farmland in the study area has been degrading, and the desertification of land has been expanding rapidly. Based on the data of Landsat TM/ ETM image in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010, this thesis analysed the spatial characteristics and dynamic trends of land use pattern in eastern Sichuan basin using software for remote sense and geographical information system. The driving factors of land-use change in study area were also discussed. The results indicated that: (i) the area of farmland has significantly decreased because of degradation and conversion from grassland into building land; (ii) farmland patches have changed into fragmented and isolated ones; (iii) the main landscapes in study area, are farmland and forests; (iv) land-use change is significantly associated with the human activities. This study provides a strong theoretical and technical basis for the policy-making of environmental protection and management in Eastern Sichuan Basin of Sichuan Province in china.

AB  - As Singapore's only remaining patch of primary freshwater swamp forest, the good management of the Nee Soon catchment is of utmost importance if a large proportion of the flora and fauna in Singapore is to be conserved. An integrated eco-hydrological model is developed for the area, with the objectives to numerically model the hydrological variations, to assess the possible impacts of future climate change, and to facilitate future eco-hydrological management. The numerical model considers the hydrological processes in a holistic manner, including rainfall-runoff, evapotranspiration, the interaction between surface water and groundwater, etc. The numerical model makes use of a combination of field survey data and alternative remote sensing data. With climate projection inputs from the Regional Climate Model (RCM), the numerical model is applied to nm future scenarios to assess the climate change impact. A few management strategies are considered if favourable hydrological conditions are to be maintained for conserving the local ecosystem.

AB  - Crop area information can provide decision support for agricultural production management, and it is an important basis for formulating grain policy and economic plan. Remote sensing has an irreplaceable role in large-scale agricultural monitoring, in which optical remote sensing is greatly influenced by cloud and rain weather. It is often unable to obtain clear and clear optical remote sensing images in the critical period of crop growth, which seriously images the accuracy and timeliness of the classification of crop remote sensing. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capable of monitoring ground objects throughout the day and all weather, Polarimetric SAR data also include scattering matrix, geometric details and permittivity information, it is sensitive to the geometry and height of vegetation, which can make up for the lack of optical remote sensing and has unique advantages in crop identification and monitoring. So full polarization SAR has wide application demand and great potential in crop remote sensing monitoring. The effective use of full polarimetric SAR data to classify crops is of great academic and practical value for promoting the greater role of radar technology in national agricultural remote sensing monitoring and agricultural supply side structural reform. This paper summarizes the different data types and polarization decomposition methods of polarization SAR used in crop identification. According to the current research, there are the following deficiencies: first, most of the research subjects are rice, and dry land crops are less studied. Secondly, the identification of dry land crops is not accurate enough, and the average recognition accuracy is less than 85%. Finally, there are few researches on the scattering mechanism, which leads to poor rationality and poor universality. First, determine the scattering mechanism of dry land crops, and use scattering mechanism to improve the accuracy and universality of remote sensing recognition of dryland crops. Second, how to make use of the special imaging method of SAR to optimize the design is applicable to polarimetric SAR classification algorithm. Third, how to better integrate with optical remote sensing and other multi -source data, these three points will become the key problem to be solved in polarimetric SAR crop classification in the future.

M3  - Article
AB  - Surface ultraviolet (UV) observations can be obtained from satellite or ground observations. This paper uses one data fusion technique (similar to Kalman filter) to combine the advantages from both sources of observations, aiming at achieving a better estimate of surface UV. In this paper, new mathematical methods and algorithms were developed to estimate the error covariance and correlation region, which are the most important components in this data fusion technique. This technique was applied to the satellite data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)-Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) combined with ground measurements from UV-B Monitoring and Research Program (UVMRP) within the region of continental U.S. from 2005 to 2015. Numerical experiments showed that the technique is effective, and TOMS-OMI data were improved by combining UVMRP data. In addition, the innovative ensemble-based method is generic and can be applied to other fields for data fusion/assimilation.

AB  - East Jakarta icon as a buffer and the lungs of the city is still a big dream of Jakarta. It is a classic problem that there is a struggle for land between current economic interests and sustainable environmental interests for the future. This paper discusses the development of urban forest area of Halim Perdana Kusuma, East Jakarta. The forest area according to regulations of existing city local governments is not enough to support sustainable urban development indicators. Therefore, it requires an extensive mapping of urban forest potential development accurately by utilizing satellite imaging technology. Landsat-TM satellite imagery data can provide a full picture of the potential land width for urban forest area development. The results of this satellite image will then be made into a model of urban forest as one of the indicators of sustainable urban development. This research aims to support sustainable urban development through environmental balance in the form of a green neighborhood revitalization and development of urban forests and to create socio-economic balance. This paper uses a dynamic system model to simulate the conditions of the region against the intervention performed in the potential area for development of urban forests which are derived from urban spatial analysis based on satellite image data, using GIS program as a tool. The result is a model of urban forest area which is integrated with a social and economic function to encourage the development of sustainable cities.

AB  - Satellites that orbit the Earth at lower altitudes are the predominant type that are deployed in remote sensing missions. Although thee are many well documented advantages in having the Earth-observing satellites in such lower orbits, the altitude parameter often introduces significant variabilities to the orbital elements, the predominant among them being the perturbative forces due to atmospheric drag. The drag parameter causes deviation of the satellite from its actual orbital trajectory. While updated near-Earth atmospheric drag models have helped resolve this issue, there are the other forces that are secondary in importance, such as the non-spherical Earth's shape factor effect and luni-solar perturbations that also affect on remote sensing satellites, particularly of the low-Earth Orbit (LEO) and geosynchronous transfer orbiting (GTO) types, that are considered for this particular study. After verifying the equivalent perturbed acceleration terms using the Cowell's method, variations caused to the classical orbital elements in general, and the altitude element in particular, are characterised in terms of the corresponding distortions caused in the imaging data obtained by the Landsat platform, that are then shown as resulting in a image quality degradation.

CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - This paper will discuss the use of the MODTRAN (MODerate spectral resolution TRANsmittance) code to simulate shadows on terrain created by broken cloud fields. Under partially cloudy conditions, there are two main cloud-induced effects: shadowing, which results in diminished and spectrally altered ground illumination, and illumination enhancement of sunlit areas due to the photons scattered from the clouds into these areas. The work presented here will focus on the effects of cloud shadows on the retrieval of reflectance signatures for target detection applications. The impact of cloud shadows is examined using forward simulations of fully and partly shadowed scenes based on the Rochester Institute of Technology Target Detection Self-Test reflectance scene. A blue roof spectral signature extracted from the scene was used as a target signature. The roof signature was randomly embedded back into the scene at subpixel levels. The scene radiance is then modeled for a low altitude sensor flying below uniform and broken cloud fields, as well as under clear sky conditions. Target detection is performed on these radiance scenes after atmospheric correction. Preliminary detection results show significant performance loss when scenes include a combination of cloud shadows and sunlit areas.

AB  - Land use change was common in Indonesia, including Bali, especially land conversion from paddy field to other uses. Based on statistics data of Bali 2015, the area of rice fields continues to decline every year, both irrigated and rain-fed rice fields. This study was conducted to analyze land use change and its impact on food security in Denpasar. Land use change dynamics can be observed by multi-temporal land use changes. GIS analysis was performed to obtain spatial land use changes in the study area by using topographic map 1: 25,000 with data sources 2002 and land cover classification of SPOT 6 image acquisition 2015. The results of GIS analysis indicate that settlement and built-up area increased by 1,736 hectares and the area of rice field decreased by 1,695 hectares during 13 years. The increasing of settlement rate was 133,5 ha / year and the decreasing of rice field was 130 ha / year. Meanwhile, the result of food availability analysis shows that the Denpasar City still deficit of rice amount 48,997 tons in 2014, and 69,175 tons in 2015 or only fulfill about 45% of food requirement.

AB  - This study attempted to identify whether space radiation sources could have affected the communication on RazakSAT-1 that was orbiting in a Low Earth Orbit-Near Equatorial (LEO-NEqO). Data on galactic cosmic rays (GCR), trapped protons, trapped electrons, and solar energetic particles (SEPs) obtained from Space Environment Information System (SPENVIS) are considered. The effects of these radiation sources are analyzed using the linear energy transfer (LET), total ionizing dose (TID), and solar cell degradation. Flux data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 15, 16, and 17 satellites, and the geomagnetic conditions during the time when RazakSAT-1's missing is also analyzed. Another two satellites, Satelite de Coleta de Dados (SCD-2) and Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), are compared with the performance of RazakSAT-1. Results showed that GCR dominated at a high energy range of 10(3) MeV and above in the LEO-NEqO, whereas the energies of the trapped protons and trapped electrons are less than 400 MeV and 4 MeV, respectively. There are no SEPs estimated during the mission period (2009 - 2011). Based on the SPENVIS, SCD-2 and ALOS are more exposed to higher radiation damage than RazakSAT-1. Thus, an analysis of space radiation environment effects on the RazakSAT-1 communication lost after one year of operation will be discussed further, as a platform to find the best strategy for future missions.

AB  - One of the ecosystems in the coastal areas that have a very important role is mangrove forest. Segara Anakan, Cilacap is an area that has the largest mangrove potential in Java. However, the condition of the mangrove both qualitative and quantitative are decreasing. Utilization of remote sensing and GIS technology for the provision of information on the distribution and presence of mangrove forest is growing. The aim of this study is to create a model of distribution changes mangrove forests in 1987-2016 and forecast the distribution of mangrove forests in 2031 in Segara Anakan, Cilacap. Satellite imagery that used such imagery SPOT 1 in 1987, Landsat 7 ETM + in 2003 and Landsat 8 OLI 2016. The method used is a Markov-Chain, Cellular Automata with driving factors such as distance from settlements, population density, distance from the road, distance from the river, the distance from the center of activity, sedimentation and salinity. The results showed a decrease in the distribution of mangroves in the western part of Segara Anakan precisely in the north of the lagoon where the majority of mangrove forest land converted to the rice field. The predicted distribution of mangrove forests in 2031 is the addition of mangrove forests in the lagoon Segara Anakan, precisely the western part due to conversion to the rice field and dry land agriculture.

AB  - Land cover information is vital for ecosystem management, to find biodiversity indicators and for sustainable development. The launch of the Sentinel-1 satellites provide large amounts of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that can be used for the extraction and classification of land cover. This study presents a preliminary method for land cover classification using SAR amplitude and textural features and by combining multi-temporal images from ascending and descending orbits. The texture parameters contrast, entropy, homogeneity and variance were investigated. The rules of the SAR-LC classifier, designed and implemented at the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy in Frankfurt, were optimised to include textual information for processing the multi-temporal SAR images. The results for land cover classification of images from 2017 for the area around Berlin in Germany are reported along with their classification efficiencies.

AB  - Information regarding the extents of forests and forest biomass is crucial for the quantification of the terrestrial carbon budget. While field surveys are time consuming and expensive, remote sensing techniques offer an efficient and fast alternative. The Copernicus programme provides large amounts of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multi-spectral data that can be used for this purpose. This study presents two methods for forest cover classification, one using a multi-temporal dataset of SAR images from one orbit, and the other combining SAR images acquired in both ascending and descending orbits and almost cloud-free (< 10%) multi-spectral images. The SAR-LC classification system, a rule-based decision tree which is designed to classify land cover types using radar backscatter is used to extract forest cover extent from the 2016 dataset. For the second method, Sentinel-1 images from 2017 in both ascending and descending orbits are combined with 10 m resampled almost cloud free Sentinel-2 images to form one multi-temporal dataset with 88 bands. This is then segmented into objects before forest extent is classified using a rule-based classification. The SAR-LC thresholds were optimised to include the ReNDVI values from the Sentinel-2 images for this purpose. While the final objective of this study is to produce forest cover maps for the whole of Germany, this paper will only focus on the forests around the region of Frankfurt. The challenges, limitations and accuracy of each method is reported and discussed.

TI  - Improved turbidity estimates in complex inland waters using combined NIR-SWIR atmospheric correction approach for Landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is one of the important water quality parameters, essentially a proxy to assess eutrophication state in inland coastal systems. In this article, a method of combined near-infrared-shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR) atmospheric correction for Landsat 8 (L8) Operational Land Imager data is proposed to improve the turbidity retrieval in optically complex waters. From the extremely turbid to moderately turbid waters, the relative ranges in water-leaving reflectance in band 3 (rho(3)(w)) are found to be 19-92% and 31-79% in band 4 (rho(4)(w)). The SWIR reflectances in rho(4)(w) and rho(3)(w) are 57% and 66% higher than that of standard NIR correction in extremely turbid waters. However, this method has resulted in similar to 30% higher reflectances than the NIR method in relatively less turbid waters; the latter method is still good in moderately turbid waters. Using Rayleigh corrected reflectances, a turbidity index, T-ind (865; 1610), was computed to discriminate the productive and/or turbid waters. The SWIR method was applied for water having T-ind >1.5 threshold and the NIR method in the other regions. A new turbidity algorithm has been developed using L8 two band ratio (rho(4)(w) = rho(3)(w)) optimized with in situ turbidity data from four data buoys for 2014. The Landsat 8 band-weighted in situ reflectances for bands 3 and 4 are used to derive turbidity using the present algorithm and validated against in situ turbidity, providing a good coefficient of determination of R-2 = 0.87. As compared to the NIR-based correction, the turbidity obtained from the combined (NIR + SWIR) correction in extremely turbid waters is around 80-90% (absolute percentage difference (APD)) different. Whereas in the moderately turbid waters, the APD between the two corrections was around 50-75%. There are no obvious data discontinuities in using the combined approach. Comparisons were made with available single-band turbidity algorithms and found that the present turbidity algorithm performed well in the optically complex lagoon environment.

AB  - Microseepages is one way to identify the existence of oil and gas below the surface of the earth. Identification of microseepages could be done using remote sensing approaches. One of the remote sensing data that can be used is Landsat 8. The purpose of this study is to map the potential of microseepages on the ground surface of Tugu Barat oil and gas field, North West Java Basin, Indonesia. The Landsat 8 data processing were performed including radiometric and geometric corrections, and vegetation indices calculation. The indices calculated in this study are Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (ENDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). Based on the vegetation indices, we detected that physical condition of vegetation anomaly served as microseepages location. The results showed that microseepages is identified in the south to the east of the oil and gas field presented by vegetation anomaly. Field survey confirmed the possibility of microseepages is located at yellowish leaf vegetation, high spectral of the leaf at the visible wavelength and low magnetic susceptibility.

AB  - Selection of vegetation indices in plant mapping is needed to provide the best information of plant conditions. The methods used in this research are the standard deviation and the linear regression. This research tried to determine the vegetation indices used for mapping the sugarcane conditions around oil and gas fields. The data used in this study is Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The standard deviation analysis on the 23 vegetation indices with 27 samples has resulted in the six highest standard deviations of vegetation indices, termed as GRVI, SR, NLI, SIPI, GEMI and LAI. The standard deviation values are 0.47; 0.43; 0.30; 0.17; 0.16 and 0.13. Regression correlation analysis on the 23 vegetation indices with 280 samples has resulted in the six vegetation indices, termed as NDVI, ENDVI, GDVI, VARI, LAI and SIPI. This was performed based on regression correlation with the lowest value R-2 than 0,8. The combined analysis of the standard deviation and the regression correlation has obtained the five vegetation indices, termed as NDVI, ENDVI, GDVI, LAI and SIPI. The results of the analysis of both methods show that a combination of two methods needs to be done to produce a good analysis of sugarcane conditions. It has been clarified through field surveys and showed good results for the prediction of microseepages.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIndonesia's hospital-based Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance system, Surveilans Infeksi Saluran Pernafasan Akut Berat Indonesia (SIBI), was established in 2013. While respiratory illnesses such as SARI pose a significant problem, there are limited incidence-based data on influenza disease burden in Indonesia. This study aimed to estimate the incidence of influenza-associated SARI in Indonesia during 2013-2016 at three existing SIBI surveillance sites.MethodsFrom May 2013 to April 2016, inpatients from sentinel hospitals in three districts of Indonesia (Gunung Kidul, Balikpapan, Deli Serdang) were screened for SARI. Respiratory specimens were collected from eligible inpatients and screened for influenza viruses. Annual incidence rates were calculated using these SIBI-enrolled influenza-positive SARI cases as a numerator, with a denominator catchment population defined through hospital admission survey (HAS) to identify respiratory-coded admissions by age to hospitals in the sentinel site districts.ResultsFrom May 2013 to April 2016, there were 1527 SARI cases enrolled, of whom 1392 (91%) had specimens tested and 199 (14%) were influenza-positive. The overall estimated annual incidence of influenza-associated SARI ranged from 13 to 19 per 100000 population. Incidence was highest in children aged 0-4years (82-114 per 100000 population), followed by children 5-14years (22-36 per 100000 population).ConclusionsIncidence rates of influenza-associated SARI in these districts indicate a substantial burden of influenza hospitalizations in young children in Indonesia. Further studies are needed to examine the influenza burden in other potential risk groups such as pregnant women and the elderly.

AB  - Accuracy assessment is conducted to assess how well a classification method is. One of the land cover classification method for mixed pixel problem is Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA). Error matrix is commonly used accuracy assessment of categorical data. But accuracy assessment for fraction map as result of LSMA processing is not really examined yet. LSMA method produces map fraction which contains land cover proportion. This experiment aims to examine the effect of sampling unit on land cover fraction map accuracy assessment result. 70 samples were taken using stratified random sampling. Geoeye 1 image is used as reference data corresponding to ground truth data. Accuracy assessment was performed in two scenario sampling unit which is single pixel area and a cluster of pixels area. The accuracy of LSMA model was influenced by position error between classified map and the reference data. Selection the right sampling unit is a one way to minimize the deviation caused by positional error corresponding reference data.

AB  - The Samin sub-watershed (SSW) is one of the critical watersheds in Indonesia which need conservation. The identification of land-use / land-cover changes (LUCC) can help in deciding the priority of conservation areas as well as limiting the widespread of critical lands in the watershed, which can contribute to climate change. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of land use change on climate parameters, i.e. precipitation, air temperature and relative air humidity. The method is by using the descriptive explorative. The study employed Indonesian topographic map and Landsat's imageries of 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. The climate data from 1996 to 2016 were obtained from surroundings weather station. Data were analyzed using Geographic Information System (GIS) and SPSS. The results showed that land use was dominated by rice fields 22,552.83 ha (69.20%), and converted to non-agricultural lands 165.05 hectares/year for the last 20 years. Forest area decreased 65.8 ha/year, and settlement (housing and industrial estates) increased 253.87 ha/year (11.07%). The statistical analysis resulted in a negative relationship between forest area and air temperature and, but no significant correlation with rainfall.

AB  - The Secchi disk depth is one of the most important physical indicators of the water clarity. When studying Lake Baikal with the surface area of 31,722 sq. km, remote sensing is a necessary tool to assess the Secchi disk depth within the entire lake. To develop regional algorithms for estimating the Secchi disk depth in Lake Baikal is based on the use of a set of coincident AVHRR data and in situ Secchi disk depth measurements.Because of research, the linear algorithm for the periods from the beginning of June to mid-July and from midSeptember to the end of October and the nonlinear algorithm for the period from mid-July to mid-September with the root-mean-square error of 1.9 and 0.9 meters respectively were developed. A series of maps of the distribution of the Secchi disk depth in Lake Baikal for the ice-free period of different years was created using the AVHRR-based regional algorithms.

TI  - NIGHT AND DAY SUN AS ATTRIBUTES OF CHRONOTOPE <i>NIGHT</i> IN THE DECORATIVE CARVING OF WOODEN CRADLES
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The author, drawing on the material of analysis of the Slavic archaic preserved in the wood carving of cradles, explores solar signs, which are not only attributes of the chronotope day, but also night. Night, in contrast to the day - was considered a period of domination of evil, dark spirits that can harm a newborn, which is why it required a system of protective measures. Carving of decorative elements with a special, sacred, meaning acted as one of the most important units of them. The cradle could be decorated with the signs of day' s or night' s sun. In some cases (the Northern sample) master depicted underground passage of the Sun (the night sun) in accordance with the East Slavic worldview, which continued to coexist with the Christian one, although in a significantly modified image. One must not identify the path of the night sun through the world of the dead portrayed on the cradle - as the locus of the first postnatal stay of the baby - with a destructive principle. for the carver did not address death, but called for sleep, a necessary condition for the favorable development of the child. We find such a synthesis (Southern pattern) in the sign of the day sun (cross in a circle), which can also be interpreted as a Christian cross. Such variability and multiplicity of metaphysical forms of chronotope representation of the night also takes place in lullabies as an element of mother's folklore performed to a child lying in the cradle.

T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to use Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery for detecting phytoplankton blooms in the Upper Gulf of Thailand by using the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI). The results showed that the MCI was able to detect phytoplankton blooms in the study area. The areas with intense phytoplankton blooms showed high MCI values. The radiance spectrum (with a reflectance peak at wavelength 708.75 nm) and the difference between baseline wavelengths 708.75 nm and 681.25 nm were quite high. High MCI values corresponded well with locations of phytoplankton blooms seen on RGB False-Color Composite images. Thus, time series analysis of MCIs obtained from Sentinel-3A OLCI images could be used in detecting, tracking, and delineating phytoplankton blooms.

AB  - Seasonal haze pollution is a big issue in northern part of Thailand for last decade. It normally happens in dry season during February to May annually. Chiang Mai is one of effected city and become economics and health concerns for local people seriously. Thus, haze pollution monitoring remains a challenge. PM10 value is the key indicator of air quality. Many publications have been reported the relationship between PM10 value and the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) which can be analyzed by MODIS Aerosol Product. This study examined the temporal and spatial distribution of PM10 base on a long-term monitoring data (2007-2016) using Terra-MODIS MOD04_3K product with 3 km resolution. The images were analyzed and calculated AOT and PM10 using existing model. The results were converted to air quality index according to standard of Thailand Pollution Control Department as good, moderate, unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous. The result showed that high PM10 values (> 120 mu g/m3) which unhealthy for sensitive groups and very unhealthy levels were exposed in February, March, and April for some areas. The highest PM10 value was found in February and has been continuously decreasing in March, April and May, respectively. These results are useful for haze resilience against impact in the near future. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of temperate mangrove forest cover are required for management of estuarine ecosystems, particularly in areas experiencing rapid change in mangrove distribution. However, it remains challenging to obtain accurate estimates of temperate mangrove cover using remote sensing because of the unique physical features and environmental conditions of temperate mangroves. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop an improved image analysis approach for estimating temperate mangrove forest cover using remote sensing and (2) to test the new approach by comparing its accuracy and uncertainty with those of traditional image analysis. The study area (around 1500 ha) is located in the southern part of the Waitemata Harbour, Auckland, New Zealand. Landsat images and field surveys were used for mapping, and uncertainty was quantified using a Monte Carlo approach. This study showed that, using a traditional approach of mapping, misclassification was the highest source of uncertainty (up to 19% for dwarf mangroves and 16% for tall mangroves), followed by water column effects (up to 7% for dwarf mangroves and 5% for tall mangroves) and positional errors (up to 4% for dwarf mangroves and 5% for tall mangroves). Improved image analysis enhanced accuracy from 72% to 95% for tall mangroves and from 69% to 90% for dwarf mangroves. The improved approach minimized the overall uncertainty by up to 68% for tall mangroves and 57% for dwarf mangroves. Adopting this innovative approach to image analysis can improve accuracy of estimates of long-term trends in temperate mangrove forest cover.

AB  - Spatial data on temperature are of importance to the studies concerning the roles of climate, including the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functions and ecosystem services. However, most temperature data are available at station level, sparsely and irregularly distributed across space as points, and the accuracies of spatial-interpolation-based surface models decrease with decreasing density of the observation points. Meanwhile, relationship between elevation and temperature has been acknowledged, which basis is grounded in thermodynamics theory by Robert Clausius, and later known as altitudinal temperature lapse rate. Most studies related to altitudinal temperature lapse rate in Indonesia have been using and scaling-up the findings from Cornelis Braak, based on his research in Java during the 1920s. According to Braak, temperature decreases by 0.60 degrees C and 0.55 degrees C as the elevation increases by 100 m asl, for areas below and above 1500 asl, respectively. With regards to climate change, Braak's findings should be updated, since it determines climatic geo-data, used for strategic geo-planning (e.g. for suitability mapping). Thus, in this respect, the study is aimed at revisiting altitudinal temperature lapse rates in Indonesia using thermal-infrared bands of Landsat 8. With regards to Braak's observation stations, one window area in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia was selected as the study site. The results suggest that altitudinal temperature lapse rate decreased from 0.0016 to 0.0021 degrees C.m(-1), as compared to Braak's equation, which indicate significant temperature increase. The results also suggest that temperature increase in the window area was about 1.58 degrees C, doubled from temperature increase at global scale of about 0.8 degrees C, which implies to losses of montane and sub montane zones according to Holdridge life zone of about 7 km(2) (100%) and 727 km(2) (32.53%), respectively; and gain of basal zone of about 734 km(2) (211.77%).

AB  - Within UNFCCC framework, forest monitoring should be capable of detecting emissions from not only deforestation, but also from forest degradation. In fact, determinants of deforestation are relatively more detectable using remotely sensed data than determinants of forest degradation. Forest canopy closure is one important determinant of forest degradation. In this case, loss on forest canopy closure indicates forest degradation. As part of our activities in developing methodology for estimating forest canopy closure, this paper describes our methods on estimating forest canopy closure based on ALS LiDAR point cloud through the development of a three dimensionally explicit voxel-based model of forest canopy using an open-source modelling platform of NetLogo 3D 5.3.1. Window area in South Sumatra, Indonesia was selected as the study site. Estimated canopy closure resulted by our model was compared with the results from commercial software (i.e. LiDAR360). The results of this study suggest that using a simple voxel-based model with 2 parameters within open source platform; it is possible to estimate forest canopy closure based on ALS LiDAR point cloud at relatively small deviation (around 25.04%), as compared to similar commercial software, which algorithm is usually hidden. However, validating the model with ground measured data on canopy closure should be carried out.

AB  - In Lithuania, the old archival topographic maps of locations of small and medium scale and 1:10,000 scale contour photo plans were created on the basis of aerial images. The material of these scales provides documented records on the condition of the objects in the location and the landscape at the moment of aerial photography. Those maps can be used to restore the accurate topographic image of the terrain and buildings in 1945-1951 and in later years and perform the necessary topographic, photogrammetric, and geodetic measurements of the parameters of objects, to identify the location of objects and changes. This information is necessary for a variety of disputed property issues and for building farmhouses in reserves, in areas of forestry land parcels, and for assessment of changes in the landscape. Studies of landscape changes are needed for the assessment of renaturalization processes. This paper presents the geodetic method used for geomorphological changes at the channel of River Zalesa during the period 1942-2017, based on the collected archival cartographic materials: historical topographic maps from archive of the Lithuanian State Company Land Fund, Land Information System, and land management projects and orthophoto maps from Lithuanian spatial information portal and free open-access Sentinel-I satellite data from the Copernicus Open Access Hub.

AB  - We report a case of primary malignant melanoma (MM) of the female urethra. A 60-year-old female complained bleeding from the urethral meatus. MRI revealed a mass of 20 mm at the external urethral meatus. Pathological examination of transurethrally resected specimens revealed MM with stromal invasion. She underwent total urethrectomy plus cystostomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The tumor was pathologically confined in the specimen and no lymph node metastasis was found. She received interferone beta as adjuvant therapy. However, she developed bilateral adrenal and pulmonary hilar lymph node metastases 1 year after urethrectomy. Although she started to receive nivolumab as salvage therapy, the disease progressed as well as development of interstitial pneumonia (IP) after four cycles. Following improvement of IP with steroid therapy, she started to receive ipilimumab, which resulted in the development of intolerable IP of grade 3. The patient finally died of MM 19 months after the initiation of treatment.

TI  - What is your tweet worldview? Mapping the topic structure of tweets on the Wikipedia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERVASIVE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to propose a method for summarizing the topics of tweets using the Wikipedia category structure as common knowledge for supplementing the understanding of the Twitter user's interests. There are many topics in the tweets, and the topics can be treated as a tree structure. However, when the topic hierarchy is constructed using existing hierarchal clustering approach, the granularity of tweet groups differs for each user. For summarizing the topics, identification of the topics which are heterogeneous and which are not is necessary because it is easy to understand if several groups are categorized into parent groups. However, if the group units are different for each user, a number of users' interests cannot be summarized. If some tweets are grouped into the presidential election, and the others are into Donald Trump, there cannot be a count of how many users are interested in Donald Trump.Design/methodology/approach One solution of this issue is to construct topic structures by mapping one common tree structure. In this paper, a method is proposed for constructing the topic structure using the Wikipedia category tree similar to a common tree structure. The tweets are categorized, mapped to titles of articles in the Wikipedia category tree and then visualized as the hierarchal structure to the users.Findings The effectiveness of the proposed hierarchal topic structure is confirmed. In theme politics, the proposed method works well. The main reason is that there are many technical terms about politics in the Wikipedia categories and articles. It was found that a number of the terms of politics do not have multiple meanings, multiple semantics. However, in theme sports, the proposed method does not perform well. The main reason for this case is that there are a number of names of people present as topic names.Originality/value One important feature of the proposed method is that it is easy to grasp not only about the topics which are heterogeneous or homogeneous with each other but also consider the missing time when extracting topics. Another feature is that the topic structures for multiple users are easy to compare with each other.

AB  - Teledyne has a well-established heritage of supplying sensors for Earth observation space missions. Since early involvement in the SPOT satellites and Envisat, the French and UK Teledyne 2v sites have continued to develop sensors for Earth observation satellite suppliers and space agencies. For high-resolution imaging, panchromatic and multi spectral TDI CCDs have been developed as the main sensors for the PLEIADES satellites and subsequent follow on Earth-imaging missions. The latest TDI CCD developed in combination with the ESA Enhanced CCD Design and Process ESCC Evaluation is presented, the CCD283-00 has 8 mu m anti-blooming pixels, multi-TDI stage integration time selection and multiple outputs for fast line advance time up to 5 kHz at 10 MHz pixel readout. The next generation of CMOS TDI sensors under design are described, with on-chip charge domain signal TDI combined with CMOS on-chip digital outputs.For Earth science, Teledyne e2v is a major contributor to the Copernicus Programme, successfully packaging and testing Sentinel-2 CMOS sensors and delivery of Sentinel-3 CCDs. For the recently launched Sentnel-5P TROPOMI hyperspectral imaging instrument, a custom CCD275 sensor was designed. Details are presented describing the improved radiation hardness, fast frame transfer design for up to 750ns per line and high UV and NIR quantum efficiency.For the next generation MTG and MetOp satellites, an overview is given of the Sentinel-4 UVN spectrometer, the Sentinel-5 UVNS and 3MI CCD sensors. Customised CMOS sensors specifically designed for space by Teledyne-e2v are in development for the MTG FCI and for MetOp. Details and progress are presented.

T2  - ORIENTAL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study uses the Aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite as a proxy to estimate the surface particulate matter (PM) concentrations over Sumatra. The daily average PM10 data collected during 2015 from three air quality stations across Sumatra, i.e., Kototabang, Jambi and Pekanbaru, were analyzed. The 2015 Indonesian forest fire significantly increased the PM10 concentrations and MODIS AOD values. The ratios of the mean PM10 concentrations and ADD values during the peak forest fire period to those during the period of normal conditions varied from 6 to 9. MODIS AOD may be a good indicator of the near-surface PM10 concentrations over Sumatra, as the correlation coefficients of the linear regressions were 0.86 (Kototabang), 0.80 (Jambi), and 0.81 (Pekanbaru). The linear regression functions of PM10 and satellite-observed AOD can be used to estimate the surface PM10 concentrations, and the correlation coefficient is 0.84.

AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) based on radar satellite data has emerged as a powerful technology for observing the Earth's surface, especially for monitoring the Earth's topography and deformations. However, it is well known that the InSAR measurements are often significantly affected by the atmosphere. This paper applies the pairwise logic (PWL) and the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technique using multitemporal SAR image from Sentinel-1A (S1A). The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of using PWL in reducing atmospheric delay and improve the results in capturing the deformation signal from the artifact. We stacked twelve pairs of S1A data before and after the December 6, 2016, M-w 6.5 Pidie Jaya earthquake in Aceh, Indonesia. Multitemporal interferograms of S1A in ascending and descending orbits were used to obtain Line of Sight (LOS) motion maps. To generate the differential interferogram of the PWL, then the first and the second interferogram were computed by summation process. Next, the second interferogram was added with the third, until the last interferogram of D-InSAR data pairs. The final data pair summation produced six pairwise interferogram. The results indicated that the summation of interferogram can increase the deformation twice in the line of sight of the satellite which represents movement toward or away from the satellite (e.g. uplift or subsidence), and also eliminated positive and negative signals in the line of sight velocities, which represent the atmospheric phase delay. The PWL simplified the complexity of atmospheric correction in the D-InSAR processing by reducing atmospheric artifact and increasing the deformation signal.

AB  - The remotely derived oceanographic variables included sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Eastern Little Tuna (Euthynnus affinis) catches are used as a combined dataset to understand the seasonal variation of oceanographic variables and Eastern Little Tuna catches in the north Indramayu waters, Java Sea. The fish catches and remotely sensed data were analysed for the 5 years datasets from 2010-2014. This study has shown the effect of monsoon inducing oceanographic condition in the study area. Seasonal change features were dominant for all the selected oceanographic parameters of SST and Chl-a, and also Eastern Little Tuna catches, respectively. The Eastern Little Tuna catch rates have the peak season from September to December (700 to 1000) ton that corresponded with the value of SST ranging from 29 degrees C to 30 degrees C following the decreasing of Chl-a concentrations in September to November (0.4 to 0.5) mg m(-3). The monsoonal system plays a great role in determining the variability of oceanographic conditions and catch in the north Indramayu waters, Java Sea. The catches seemed higher during the northwest monsoon than in the southeast monsoon for all year observations except in 2010. The wavelet spectrum analysis results confirmed that Eastern Little Tuna catches had seasonal and inter-annual variations during 2012-2014. The SST had seasonal variations during 2010-2014. The Chl-a also showed seasonal variations during 2010-2011 and interannual variations during 2011-2014. Our results would benefit the fishermen and policy makers to have better management for sustainable catch in the study area.

TI  - Validation of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram to detect non-sentinel lymph node metastases in a United Kingdom cohort

AB  - Aim. Axillary lymph node dissection, although associated with long-term morbidity, has been the standard of treatment for all node-positive breast cancer patients. We assessed the risk prediction ability (validity) of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram for non-sentinel lymph node metastases and analysed the outcome of patients with sentinel node metastases.Patients and methods. All operable early breast cancer patients with sentinel node macro metastases (size > 2mm) who underwent axillary dissection from April 2009 to March 2015 were considered eligible. The risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastases was calculated using an online MSKCC calculator, and accuracy was determined based on the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Tumour characteristics and overall survival were also analysed as secondary end points.Results. Of 1745 patients who were diagnosed with operable breast cancer during the study period, 114 patients were considered eligible. The AUC-ROC was 0.66 suggestive of lesser accuracy in prediction and not statistically significant (p value = 0.7303). Seventy-six (50.7%) of these patients did not have any non-sentinel node metastases. At a mean follow up of four years, the disease-free survival was 86.4% and overall survival rate was 88.4%.Conclusions. The MSKCC nomogram was unable to accurately predict the risk in our cohort of patients with more than half of this cohort of patients not requiring axillary dissection. These findings are consistent with other European studies. This study thus highlights the need for modified prediction model for European cohorts.

TI  - ABANDONED AGRICULTURAL LAND MAPPING USING SENTINEL-2A DATA

AB  - Abandoned agricultural land (AAL) is a widespread phenomenon in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe where large tracts of agricultural land were left uncultivated following the collapse of socialism. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) provide powerful tools for mapping and analysis of AAL at various spatial and temporal scales. Here we present an approach to AAL extraction from Sentinel-2A satellite imagery, provided in the frame of European Copernicus program. This study aims to investigate and map the spatial distribution of AAL on the foothill of Little Carpathians and in Danubian Lowland, Slovakia. Supervised maximum likelihood classification was used to identify AAL polygons. Aerial orthophotos were used along the classified Sentinel images to support this goal and accuracy assessment. The presented case study showed the possibilities of semi-automatic extraction of AAL from Sentinel-2A data that may improve the transfer of scientific knowledge to the local agri-environmental monitoring and management.

TI  - Using of Sentinel-2 images for automation of the forest succession detection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was performed for the part of the administrative district Milicz. The authors analysed the parcels where the changes in land use, compared to the cadastral data, were found. The areas of interest were the parcels, where agricultural use was abandoned and the forest succession progressed. This paper investigates the possibility of applying satellite images Sentinel-2A for the automation of land use/land cover change detection, mainly in the aspect of monitoring uncontrolled forest succession. The results of the supervised classification of images Sentinel-2A were referred to the results of the traditionally applied manual vectorization of aerial orthophotomap. The difference for area covered by trees or shrub was 3.85% of the analysed parcels area. Analysing the results for each parcel in which the process of succession occurred, the mean difference is on average 2.25% for one parcel. The mean difference in the absolute value of the total area of participation in individual land use plots was about 1.54% of the analysed area.
